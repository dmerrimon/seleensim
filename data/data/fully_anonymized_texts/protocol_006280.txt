Statistical methods:  
The patients will be enrolled into cohorts of approximately 16 patients with each cohort 
evaluating a different dose level of MAA868.  Within each cohort, patients will be randomized 
3:[ADDRESS_413830] will achieve pre-defined  degrees of  FXI 
inhibition at trough (Day 91). The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement are as 
follow s:  
Low -dose cohort  (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
High dose cohort  (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
The “ on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analysis, where “on treatment” 
FXI level is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The response rate per treatment group will be calcul ated by [CONTACT_335290]. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose regimens 
of MAA868 together with 2 -sided 90 % confidence intervals.  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90 % at trough after the first and second dose (Day 31 and Day 61) at multiple  
dose levels of MAA868. The analyses described for the primary endpoint will be repeated for 
the secondary efficacy variables.  
Safety data including adverse events (AEs) , bleeding events, ECG, vital signs , thromboembolic 
events  and laboratory results will be reported by [CONTACT_335291].  
Page [ADDRESS_413831] more than 6 million 
patien ts in Europe and approximately 2.3 million in the [LOCATION_002], and this number continues 
to grow rapi[INVESTIGATOR_335260] -
morbidities. As such, the prevalence of AF is expected to increase 2 - to 3-fold over the following 
3 decades in western populations ( Kannel and Benjamin 2008 ). 
AF is associated with a 4 - to 5-fold increase in embolic stroke. The risk for stroke associated with 
AF increases steeply with age to 23.5%  for patients aged 80 to 89 years ( Kannel and Benjamin 
2008 ). Most patients with AF require life -long anticoagulation therapy to prevent cardioembolic 
stroke and systemic embolism. It is estimated that 85 to 90% of AF patients wil l require 
anticoagulation therapy ( Camm et al 2012 ). 
Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, are effective in reducing stroke and systemic 
thromboembolism; a highly significant relative risk reduction in stroke incidence by 67% was 
observed in a meta -analysis combining six studies ( Hart et al 1999 ). All -cause mortality was 
reduced (26%) significantly by [CONTACT_335292]. control ( Hart et al 1999 ). In recent years, direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOACs) medications have been approved and introduced to clinical practice. These 
drugs are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and may be 
superior to warfarin in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage ( Connolly et al  
2009 , Granger et al 2011 , Patel et al 2011 ). The incidence of m ajor bleeding events  with DOACs 
was similar or slightly lower than the incidence observed with well -conducted warfa rin therapy. 
Nonetheless, the overall bleeding risk continues to be high with the use of DOACs. For instance, 
the annual incidence of major and clinically relevant non -major (CRNM) bleeding was 14.9% and 
the annual incidence of major bleeding events was 3. 6% in patients treated with rivaroxaban in the 
ROCKET AF study ( Patel et al 2011 ). It is notable that the occurrence of major bleeding was 
strongly associated with mortality. In the same study, the rate of all -cause mortality over the 2 -
month period following a major bleeding event was 20.4% in the rivaroxaban group and 26.1% in 
the warfarin group ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335261] 2014 ). Thus, there is a high unmet medical need for an 
anticoagulant therapy that can effective ly reduce the risk of AF -related thromboembolic 
complications such as stroke but with a lower risk of bleeding than currently employed 
anticoagulants.  
FXI is an emerging target for potentially safer and more effective anticoagulant medications. FXI 
holds i mportant roles in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways and in bridging the 
initiation and amplification phases of plasmatic hemostasis ( Gailani and Renné 2007 ). Both Factor 
XII and thrombin can activate FXI, resu lting in a sustained thrombin generation and fibrinolysis 
inhibition. FXI plays a minor role in normal hemostasis in a high tissue factor environment “after 
vessel injury” whereas it appears to play a key role in thrombosis. Severe FXI deficiency is 
associ ated with a lower incidence of ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolic events ( Salomon 
et al 2008 , Salomon et al 2011 , Preis et al 2017 ). Nevertheless, bleeding manife stations in subjects 
with severe FXI deficiency are infrequent and usually mild. Bleeding events that occur are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_335262] -related and preferentially affect tissues known to have increased fibrinolytic 
Page [ADDRESS_413832] ( Bolton -Maggs 2000 ). Bleeding in 
vital organs is extremely rare or non -existent.  
MAA868  
MAA868 is a human antibody that binds to the catalytic domain of FXI. MAA868 binds to both 
the zymogen (FXI) and activated  factor XI (FXIa) with high potency. MAA868 dose -dependently 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in in -vitro and in -vivo studies. After a 
single subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of MAA868 at a 3 mg/kg dose, sustained anticoagulant 
activity lasting for more than one month was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, 
MAA868 prevented experimental carotid artery thrombosis induced by [CONTACT_335293]3 and resulted in a 
prolongation in aPTT in FXI -/- mice reconstituted with human FXI. No significant t oxicity 
findings were observed in single dose and in the 13 -week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -
compliant toxicity study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. The highest s.c. dose administered 
in the [ADDRESS_413833] leve l NOAEL (100 mg/kg/week 
s.c.).  
MAA868 was evaluated in a first -in-human (FIH) study (CMAA868X2101) to characterize its 
safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy subjects 
following single s.c. administration. In total, 6 cohorts with 10 subjects each (8 MAA868: 2 
Placebo) were enrolled. The doses of MAA868 administered in Cohorts 1 to 5 ranged from 5  mg 
to 240 mg. In a sixth cohort, 240 mg of MAA868 was administered to subjects with body mass 
index (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2). 
In the FIH study, MAA868 appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and the incidence of AEs were 
comparable across dose groups and placebo. No bleeding events, hypersensitivity reactions or 
injection site reactions were reported. Exposure increased with increasi ng dose of s.c. MAA868; 
the median maximum observed concentration (C max) occurred on Day 7 to 21 and the mean 
terminal elimination half -life ranged from 20 to 28 days. A dose and time -dependent prolongation 
of aPTT occurred with MAA868 after single s.c. ad ministration; the 150 mg dose resulted in a 
mean aPTT prolongation ≥ [ADDRESS_413834] and sustained 
reductions of free FXI ≥ 90 % were observed with [ADDRESS_413835] - and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, non -confirmatory study to assess safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD. Three cohorts (MAA868 dose levels: 15, 50 and 150 mg) were enrolled 
in this study and received a single s.c. dose of MAA868 or matching placebo (8 subjects recei ved 
MAA868 and 2 subjects received placebo in each cohort). Assessments and assessment schedules 
were generally similar to the FIH study.  No SAE or study discontinuation due to AEs were reported 
in this study. All AEs were mild in intensity and the distrib ution of AEs was well balanced between 
the MAA868 dose groups and placebo. No bleeding event, hypersensitivity or injection site 
reactions were reported in the study.  PK analysis suggested that t here was no indication of an 
impact of the Japanese ethnicity  on exposure or PD parameters  of MAA868  in healthy subjects.

to/through Day 29 with the 150 mg dose and Day 43 with the 240 mg dose in subjects with normal 
body weight or class 1 obesity (BMI <35 kg/m 2). In subjects with class 2 or 3 obesity  (BMI ≥35 
kg/m 2), exposures of MAA868 may be lower and the duration of aPTT prolongation is shorter.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
This study is a multicenter, randomized, subject and Investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, multiple ascending dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and 
PD effects of MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter  at low risk of thromboembolic stroke  or 
peripheral embolism . The trial will evaluate the effects of up to three different doses of MAA868 
on FXI inh ibition, indices of coagulation, and thrombogenesis biomarkers compared to placebo. 
The incidence of injection site reactions, bleeding events, immunogenicity, and systemic arterial 
and venous thromboembolic events will also be assessed. Results from this study will assist with 
dose-selection of MAA868 for a phase [ADDRESS_413837] a lower risk of VTE even though their bleeding phenotype is variable and often quite  mild.  Further  support  of the  safety  of inhibiting  FXI  comes  from  clinical  studies  using  an 
investigational  FXI  antisense  oligonucleotide  (FXI-ASO)  where  administration  of FXI-ASOs in 
healthy  subjects  and in patients  undergoing  total  knee  arthroplasty  was  demonstrated  to be safe 
and well-tolerated ( Buller et al 2015). 
Results from the first-in- human (FIH) study of MAA868 (CMAA868X2101) demonstrated that a 
single s.c. administration of MAA868 at increasing  doses up to [ADDRESS_413838] and sustained FXI inhibition 
and prolongation  of aPTT.  The  safety  and pharmacodynamic  efficacy  of MAA868  was  further 
supported  by [CONTACT_335294]868A1101,  which  showed  a good safety 
profile of MAA868 in Japanese heathy male subjects. 
This study  is designed  to evaluate  the efficacy  and safety  of achieving  different  levels  of FXI 
inhibition with different dose levels of s.c. MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter. This study will 
recruit  patients  with  AF or flutter  who  are judged  by [CONTACT_335295].  In each  case,  patients  will  only  be enrolled  if their  physician  has 
determined  that  the patient  does  not merit  anticoagulation  based  on the  guidelines  and  the 
physician’s  assessment  of the  benefit -risk profile  for that  patient.  The  guidelines  state  that the 
benefits  of anticoagulation in  AF patients  at low risk  of embolic  stroke  are uncertain  given  the 
concomitant risks of bleeding with anticoagulant therapy. Accordingly, the guidelines recommend individualized shared physician-patient decision-making with regards to the decision to initiate anticoagulant therapy in this population (January et al 2019).  Patients with PAF will be enrolled who have a CHA2DS2-VASc risk score of 0-1 for men or 1-2 for women, in whom the guidelines 
Page 27 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 20 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
are equivocal regarding the recomme ndation to initiate anticoagulation and advise an 
individualized assessment of the benefit -risk of anticoagulation (January et al 2019 ).  
Overall, the nonclinical and clinical data to date support the investigation of MAA868 in t he 
prevention of thromboembolic diseases in patients with AF. The risk -benefit relationship appears 
to be acceptable.

ascending dose-ranging  study  to assess the PK/PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
MAA86 [ADDRESS_413840] 2 and up to 3 cohorts of approximately 16 patients each  for a 
total of up to 48 subjects ( Figure 1A). Patients in cohort 1 will be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_413841] . Cohort 2  may be initiated after it is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor and the Covance Lead Project Physician that the 
cohort [ADDRESS_413842] 
to: 
• Enroll cohort 3 to evaluate a higher, lower, or a previously studied dose of MAA868  
• Terminate the study  
The study is comprise d of 3 periods:  
(1) Screening period of up to 28 days  
(2) Treatment period with MAA868 administered s.c. monthly (or matching placebo) 
(randomized 3:1) for 90  days 
(3) Follow -up period up to end of study (Day 170).  
Following the screening period of up to 28 days , all patients that meet the study eligibility criteria 
(Section 4.1 and Section 4.2) will have baseline efficacy and safety assessments performed on Day 
1 and then randomized to active or placebo ( Figure 1B ). 
Figure 1: Overall study design  
 
The first dose of study drug  will be administered  at the study ce nter on Day 1. The second and 
third doses of study drug will also be administered at the study center to patients on the Day 31 
visit and Day 61  visit, respectively.

AFib  Protocol Amendment 2   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
During the treatment period, patients will return to the study center on Day 11, Day 31, Day 41, 
Day 61, Day 71, and Day 91 for safety assessments such as vital signs, AE  assessment s, laboratory 
tests, PK, PD, thrombogenesis biomarkers, and other study ass essments according to the 
assessment schedule shown in Table 9. 
During the follow -up period, patients will continue to be followed for PK, PD, thrombogenesis, 
and other study assessments. Patients will return to the study center on Day 101, Day 121 and Day 
170 (end of study; EoS)  for the evaluations described in the assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Rationale for route of administration and treatment duration . The s.c. route of administration 
was chosen because it is the route of administration anticipated for subsequent st udies in patients 
with AF. In the FIH study of MAA868, the half -life of MAA868 ranged from [ADDRESS_413843]  of >2-fold mean  activated partial 
thromboplastin time [ aPTT ] prolongation w as observed for ~30 days and returned to the baseline 
level by ~[ADDRESS_413844] -dose after a  single 150 mg s.c. dose administration in study X2101.  These 
data support monthly administration of MAA868. Furthermore, a ssessment of the exposure -
response relationship of MAA868 in healthy subjects demonstrated  a nearly flat exposure -response 
for relevant PD parameters (aPTT, FXI  coagulation activity and free F XI) at concentrations above 
4 μg/mL which is consistent with the Day 29 total MAA868 concentr ations achieved with the 150 
mg single dose administration in healthy subjects (CMAA868X2101).  
Given the half -life of MAA868 and the observed time to return to baseline aPTT levels, a 
prolonged washout/ follow -up period of approximately [ADDRESS_413845] and sustained dose -dependent inhibition of FXI and 
relevant prolongation of aPTT for approximately 4 weeks. MAA868 doses g reater than 150 mg 
s.c. produced a sustained ~[ADDRESS_413846] remains 
unknown. The primary  efficacy endpoint of this study wi ll be the number of patients who achieve  
≥ 50%, ≥ 80%, or ≥ 90% FXI inhibition [<50%, <20%, or 10% free FXI] at trough  on Day 91 
following s.c. administration of MAA868 . Based on preliminary PK/PD modeling, the doses 
selected for cohorts 1 and 2 are projec ted to target the following levels of FXI inhibition : 
• Cohort 1 (120 mg dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects at trough (Day  91).  
• Cohort 2 (180 mg dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects a t trough (Day  91). 
Based on interim data, an optional cohort 3 may be dosed to add further data to the PK/PD model 
which will inform dose selection of MAA868 for subsequent studies.  
The dosing regimens selected for evaluation in this study are projected t o result in exposure (C max) 
below the C max achieved with a single dose of [ADDRESS_413847] be obtained before any assessment is performed

Screening. There is not time -limit for this.  
4. Patients with a CHA2DS2 -VASc risk score (tool as a predict or for estimating the risk of 
stroke in patients with AF; Lip et al 2010) of 0 -1 for men and 1 -2 for women and in whom, 
in the investigator’s judgment, the use of an anticoagulant for stroke prevention is not 
indicated  
5. Body weight between [ADDRESS_413848] has returned to baseline, whichever is longer; 
or longer if required by [CONTACT_427].  
2. History of stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism  
3. History of major bleeding during treatment with an anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

17. Significant illness, per Investigator judgement, which has not resolved within four (4) 
weeks prior to dosing   
18. Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective metho ds of contraception during 
their time in the study. Highly effective contraception methods include:  
• Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal , post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception  
• Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without 
hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking 
investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status 
of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] -up hormone level assessment  
• Male sterilization of sexual partner (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female 
subjects on  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that 
subject  
• Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate

six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the 
woman has been conf irmed by [CONTACT_6492] -up hormone level assessment with FSH is she 
considered not of child -bearing potential.  
Male subjects  must also agree to use highly effective methods of contraception during their 
time in the study  and should not father a child or donate sp erm in this period.

4.3. Discontinuation Criteria  
Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the cl inical study but are not 
subsequently  randomized . A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements an d to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may be rescreened ; however , 
each case must be discussed and agreed with the Sponsor on a case -by-case basis.  
Withdrawal of informed consent  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from  the study for any reason at any time.  
Withdrawal from the study can occur  when a sub ject chooses to do one or more of the following : 
• Does not want to participate in the study anymore  
• Does not want any further visits or assessments  
• Does not want any further study -related contacts  
• Does not allow analysis of already obtained biologic mate rial. 
If a subject who has received one or more doses o f the study drug determines that they no longer 
want to participate the Investigator must make every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to 
determine the primary reason (s) for the subject’s decisio n to withdraw his/her consent , record this 
information and conduct any assessments and visits still allowed.  
In the event the subject withdraws consent prior to beginning dosing, the study treatment will not 
be administered. The data that would have been c ollected at subsequent visits will be considered 
missing. Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_335296] -
up. 
Lost to Follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits withou t stating an 
intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_335297], e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered 
letters, etc. A subject cannot be formally considered lost to follow -up until his/her scheduled end 
of study visit would have occurred.  
4.4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_335264]:  
Enrollment in the study will be placed on hold if the Sponsor considers that the number and/or 
severity of AEs, abnorm al safety monitoring tests or abnormal laboratory findings justify putting 
the study on hold.  
Page 35 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 28 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
The study may resume following the safety review, if the Investigator and Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor  agree it is safe to proceed.

AFib  Protocol Amendment 2   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
5.3. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomized to MAA868 or placebo in a ratio of 12: 4 as follows.  
• Cohort 1 = 120 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 2 = 180 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 3 (if necessary) = TBD mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible subjects. The 
Investigator will enter the randomization number on the CRF.  
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that 
treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff . A 
randomization list will be produced by [CONTACT_335298] a 
validated system that automates the random assignment of treatment arms to randomization 
numbers in the specified ratio. The randomization scheme for sub jects will be reviewed and 
approved by a member of the Covance Randomization Group.  
Patients will be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion. Replacement subjects will be assigned 
randomization numbers [ADDRESS_413852] (e.g., Subject [ADDRESS_413853] 1103).  
The table below provides the general details of the numbering of the subjects for randomization:

I [ADDRESS_413854] or pharmacy designee, all site staff (including 
study investigator and study nurse(s)) will be blinded to study treatment during treatment 
allocation and subject dosing. Appropriate measures must be taken by [CONTACT_335299].  
Unblinding a single subject at the site for safety reasons (necessar y for subject management) will 
occur via an emergency system in place at the site (see Section 5.10). 
Site staff may also be unblinded to the treatment assignment of one or more subjects (within a 
single cohort or across cohorts as necessary), or an entire cohort at the initial cohort safety

evaluation timepoint if deemed appropriate to aid decision -making. The decision to un -blind site 
staff will be determined by [CONTACT_335300] a pre -selected time.  
Sponsor staff  
The following unblinded Sponsor roles (or designee) are required for this study:  
• Field monitor(s)  (evaluation of drug dispensing and reconciliation)  
• Physician not directly involved in study conduct  
• Sample analyst(s) (PK blood)  
• Study statistician  
• Programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis  
An unblinded Covance Physician not directly involved in study conduct may receive a copy of the 
randomization schedule (via request to the Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of aPTT 
safety labs that would otherwise unblind study Investigators. The unblinded Medical Monitor will 
alert the Investigator and Sponsor of any safety concerns.  
The sample analysts will receive a copy of the randomization schedule (via request to the 
Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of the samples. The sample analysts will provide the 
sample da ta to the study team under blinded conditions unless otherwise allowed.  
The study statistician will be able to access the full randomization list from the start of the study 
and is allowed to share unblinded information with the rest of the clinical trial team as appropriate 
for internal decision purposes. For example, unblinded summaries and unblinded individual data 
can be shared with the team whenever necessary.  
Study programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis (e.g. biomarker expert , 
pharmacometrician, modeler(s)) are allowed to access treatment assignment information from the 
start of the study for the purpose of data analysis.  
The clinical trial team is allowed to share unblinded results with other Sponsor staff (e.g. decision 
boards) as required for internal decision making on the study or the project while the study is 
ongoing.  
All unblinded personnel will otherwise keep randomization lists and data or information that could 
un-blind other study team members confidential and secu re except as described above.  
Following final database lock all roles may be considered unblinded.  
5.5. Treating the subject  
MAA868 will be administered to the subject by [CONTACT_198930] s.c. administration. See the 
Pharmacy Manual for further details.  
Sponsor  qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems.  
Page [ADDRESS_413855] traveling to the study site.  The reason for interruption should be
documented in the patient's study reco rd.
Once the restriction (s) leading to study drug interruption have been lifted and the Sponsor and 
Investigator agree that it is safe  for the subject to resume study participation , the subject may be 
resumed on study therapy  on a case -by-case basis upon discussion with the Sponsor. Subjects who 
received only [ADDRESS_413856] related assessments collected as per 
the Schedule of assessments (Table 9). All SAEs reported during this time period must be reported as described in Section 7.6.2. and the Safety Management Plan. Documentation of 
attempts to contact [CONTACT_150745]. 
5.8. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The Investigat or ma y decide t o suspe nd the s.c . administrati on of the study drug i f symptoms or 
signs consistent with an injection site reaction or hypersensitivity reaction occur.  
Subjects who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section 4.3,
Withdraw of Informed Consent). Where possible, they should return for the EoS assessments indicated in the assessment table. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e-ma il, letter) should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]/pre-
designated contact [CONTACT_335301] 4.3 (Lost to follow-up). This contact [CONTACT_335302]. 
5.9. Study Termination  
The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_335303]. This may include reasons 
related to the benefit/ risk assessmen t of participating in the study, practical reasons (including 
slow enrollment), or for regulatory or medical reasons. Should this be necessary, subjects must be 
seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject and followed until the 
aPTT has returned to baseline. The Investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s 
interests. The Investigator will be responsible for informing  the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of the early termination of the trial.  
Page [ADDRESS_413857] who presents with an 
emergency condition. A complete set of emergency code break cards will be provided to the 
Investigator site(s) and a complete set will be available at Anthos and Covance. All code break 
cards must be retained until the end of the study and retained by [CONTACT_261860] a source document. 
They must be stored in a secure place but be accessible to the In vestigator [ADDRESS_413858]. In an 
emergency, the code break may be opened to determine the treatment. There is no known reversal 
agent for MAA868 (see Section 6.2).  
The code break should not be opened for any reason other than an emergency. If the Investigator 
opened the code break, he/she must note the date, time, and rea son for removing it and retain this 
information with the case report form documentation. The unblinded treatment code must not be 
recorded on the CRF. The Investigator must also immediately inform the study monitor that the 
code has been broken.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to 
allow access to the code break cards at any time in case of emergency. The Investigator will need 
to provide:  
• Protocol number  
• Study drug name (if available)  
• Subject number.  
In addition, the Investigator must provide oral and written information to inform the subject how 
to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable to ensure that un 
blinding can be performed at any time . 
Page [ADDRESS_413859] to notify the study staff of any new medications 
(including nutritional supplements and herbal medications) that he/she takes after being enrolled 
into the study.  
All prescription medic ations, OTC drugs and significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy and blood transfusions) administered or taken within the timeframe defined in the entry 
criteria prior to the start of the study and during the study, must be recorded on the Concomitant 
medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_50061].  
Medication entries should be specific to trade name, the single dose and unit, the frequency and 
route of administration, the start and discontinuation date and the reason for therapy.  
Each concom itant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited 
medication. If in doubt, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_335304] a subject or, 
if the subject is already enrolled, to determine if the subject should cont inue participation in the 
study.  
During the study, in the event the Investigator elects to start the patient on chronic antithrombotic 
therapy, anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy should not be started until the patient’s aPTT has 
returned to baseline.  
Reporting medication errors including misuse/abuse  
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient/subject or 
consumer (EMA  definition).  
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the protocol.  
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is  accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
All study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the Dose Administration Record CRF. Study treatment errors are only to be reported to Covance 
DSS department if the treatment error is associated with an SAE.  
All instances of misuse or abuse must be documented in the AE CRF irrespective of the 
misuse/abuse being associated with an AE/SAE. In addition, all instances of misuse or abuse must 
be reporte d to the Covance DSS department. As such, instances of misuse or abuse are also to be 
reported using the SAE form/CRF. Table 3 summarizes the reporting requirements.

Prohibited treatment 
Use of the  following  medications  is not allowed  during  the course  of the study  from  screening 
(Visit  1) through  the EoS.  Patients  who  are receiving  such  medication(s)  will be excluded,  or if 
ethically  and clinically  justified,  the medication(s)  should  be gradually  withdrawn  at least  seven 
days before the baseline visit: 
•Use of chronic antiplatelet agents such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_335265]; however,
use of low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤100 mg per day) is permitted.
•Use of chronic systemic anticoagulants such as warfarin, low molecular weight heparin or
heparinoids, or direct oral anticoagulants such as api[INVESTIGATOR_335266]. Patients ma y be
started on chronic anticoagulation during the Washout/Follow -up period once their aPTT
has returned to baseline, at the Investigator’s discretion.
•Use of any therapeutic monoclonal antibody regardless of the indication during the study.
Dietary restri ctions 
•No alcohol for 48 hours before each clinic visit (from Screening through the EoS visit).
During the study, alcohol consumption will be restricted to no more than 2 drinks/day for
males and 1 drink/day for females.
•Patients should not make significa nt alterations in their diet (e.g., going on weight loss diet)
while in the study.
•During the study, caffeinated beverages will be restricted to no more than 3 cups/day.
Other restrictions  
No strenuous physical exercise or activities which have an increase d risk of injury or falling should 
be undertaken until after the EoS visit.

6.3. Reversal medication  
There is currently no specific antidote for MAA868. FXI concentrates (not marketed in the US) 
are unlikely to be effective as the excess in free MAA868 concentr ations in the circulation is 
expected to quickly neutralize the exogenous FXI.  
Recombinant FVIIa can by[CONTACT_335305]. Administration of intermediate to high doses of rFVIIa (40 to 90  μg/kg) 
resulted in supra -physiological levels of FVII and thromboembolic complications in patients with 
severe FXI deficiency ( Riddell et al 2011 ). Low doses of rFVIIa are associated with lower 
prothrombotic risk. Riddell et al reported their experience in 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency 
undergoing surgery ( Riddell et al 2011 ); patients were administered rFVIIa 30 μg/kg and 
tranexamic acid 1 g i.v. at induction of anesthesia. Subsequent bolus dose s of rFVIIa 15 –30 μg/kg 
were administered at 2 to 4 hourly intervals as guided by [CONTACT_335306] 24 48 
hours and tranexamic acid 1 g every 6 hourly for 5 days. Low doses of rFVIIa and tranexamic acid 
were safe and effective in restoring hemostasis in severe FXI deficiency in this study. In another 
study comprising 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency with inhibitor who experienced 5 surgeries 
(Livnat et al 2009 ), [ADDRESS_413861] 7 days; moreover, rFVIIa was administered at doses 
ranging from 15 to 30 μg/kg at the completion of surgery. This protocol secured normal hemostasis 
in patients with severe FXI d eficiency with inhibitor.  
Based on the above, rFVIIa can be recommended as a preferred therapeutic option to restore 
hemostasis in subjects with active, non -accessible bleeding site and in subjects requiring 
immediate reversal of the MAA868 PD effects prio r to an urgent surgery.  Please see the 
Investigator’s Brochure - Summary of the data and guidance for the investigator for a more 
complete discussion.

7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Assessment schedule  
Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule ( Table 9).  
Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as 
possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the study treatmen t discontinuation (TD) 
visit will be performed.  
7.2. Informed consent procedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB -approved informed consent.  
The Sponsor, or Sponso r designee, will provide to investigators a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the ICHE6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline and regulatory requirements 
and is considered appropriate for this study. The informed consent form will also inc lude a section 
related to optional future research which will require a separate consent  checkbox  if the subject 
agrees to future research. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_335307].  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the IB. This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be 
discussed with the subject during the study as need ed. Any new information regarding the safety 
profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as 
appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safety Finding. New 
information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the 
subject.  
Ensure subjects are informed of the contraception requirements outlined in the Section 4.2 
(Exclusion criteria).  
A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to the Covance monitor 
after IRB approval.  
7.[ADDRESS_413862] if s/he fails the initial Screening or falls out of 
the screening window timelines; however, each case must be discussed and agreed with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor on a case -by-case basis. A new screening number will be assigned to a 
subject who is re screened, thus no screening n umber will be used twice.  
Reasons for screen failure will be documented in the site log.  
7.[ADDRESS_413863] demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristic data will be collected on all subjects. Relevant 
medical histor y/current medical conditions data will also be collected until signature [CONTACT_62686].  
Page [ADDRESS_413864] and drug screening  
All subjects will be screened for alcohol and substances of abuse.  
7.5 Efficacy Assessments  
The PD samples wil l be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing and shipment.  
In order to better define the PD profile, the timing of the sam ple collection may be altered based 
on emergent data. The number of samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected will not 
exceed those stated in the  Laboratory Manual . 
PD samples will be obtained and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels.  
7.5.1 Free FXI  
Free FXI concentrations (FXI that is not bound to MAA868) will be measured in plasma. A 
detailed description of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_413865] laboratory protocol and/or point 
of care device will be measured at all timepoints indicated in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9).

in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.3  Total FXI  
Total FXI concentrations (FXI that is either bound to MAA868 or free) will be measured in plasma. 
A detailed description of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.4  FXI coagulation activity (FXI:C)  
FXI:C will be measured in plasma. A detailed description of the assay methods will be included 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report . 
7.6 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments are specified below; assessments will be collected as specified in the 
Assessment Schedule (Table 9). 
Bleeding 
All suspected bleeding events will be documented by [CONTACT_335308]. All 
documentation regarding suspected bleeding events will be forwarded for adjudication. The central 
Page 46 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 39 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
independent adjudication committee (CIAC) will classify the b leeding events as major bleeding, 
CRNM bleeding, nuisance bleeding, or no bleeding. For definition of major bleeding the criteria 
of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for non-surgical patients 
(Schul man et al 2005 ) is referred to. Further definitions can be found in the CIAC charter.  
The members of the CIAC will be blinded to treatment assignment. Further details and procedures 
surrounding adjudication of bleeding events are in the CIAC charter.  
The population is those who have received at least one dose of the study drug.   
Major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events  
All suspected major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and VTE events will be documented by [CONTACT_335309]. For instance, any suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_184395] (i.e., swelling, localized pain, redness, heat, 
localized warmth) must be documented by [CONTACT_49734] (CUS) or venography.  
Any suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_335267] (i.e., shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, tachycardia, 
hemoptysis, hemodynamic compromise, unexplained death) must be documented by 
[CONTACT_302796]/perfusion lung scintigraphy, spi[INVESTIGATOR_85004] (sCT),  or pulmonary 
angiography.  
All major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, systemic arterial, and venous thromboembolic events 
(VTEs) including deaths for which a major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or VTE event could 
not be ruled out will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_335310].  
The adjudicated outcome will be the basis for any interim and final safety evaluations.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_413866] medical occurrence [i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal  laboratory  findings),  symptom  or disease]  in a subject  or clinical  investigation  subject 
after providing  written  informed  consent  for participation  in the study  until  the EoS  visit. 
Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. 
In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the study treatment are also considered 
an AE irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. See Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_413867] one of the 
following criteria: 
•they induce clinical signs or symptoms,
•they are considered clinically significant,
•they require therapy.
Page [ADDRESS_413868] results should be identified through a 
review of values outsid e of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_335268]. 
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject  and identifying 
AEs. Alert ranges for liver and kidney related events are included in Appendix [ADDRESS_413869] be recorded on the AE CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with 
them, and accompanied by [CONTACT_6644]:  
1.Severity grade
•mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities
•moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities
•severe: prevents normal activities
2.Relationship to the study treatment
•Related
•Possibly related
•Not related
3.Duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved 
must be reported.
4.Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 7.6.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness 
criteria  have been met
5.Action taken regarding investigational treatment.
All AEs must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following:  
•no action taken (e.g. further observation only)
•concomitant medication or non-drug therapy given
•hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section 7.6.2 for definition of SAE)
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/r esolved; recovering/resolving,
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown).
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the IB. Once an AE is detected, it must be followed until its resolution  or until it is judged to be 
permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the investigational drug, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outco me. 
The Investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new AE (beyond the protocol 
observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably 
be related to study treatment. This information must be reco rded in the Investigator’s source 
documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Covance.

7.6.2  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any AE [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable 
sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)] which meets any one of the following criteria:  
•is fatal or life -threatening
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:
oelective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition and has not worsened
since the start of study drug
otreatment on an emergency outpa tient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335269]’s
general condition
ois medically significant, e.g . defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may
require medical or surgical intervention
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline).  
Medical and scientifi c judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335270]. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335271] (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline).  
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) are captured on the CRF ; SAEs also require individual reporting 
to Covance Drug Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E).  
SAE Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the subject has 
provided informed consent and until [ADDRESS_413870] be 
reported to Covance within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence as described below. Any SAEs 
Page 49 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 42 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
experienced after this period should only be reported to Covance if the Investigator suspects a 
causal relationship to study trea tment.  
Note: SAEs reported by [CONTACT_335311].  
All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progressi on of the 
initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] [ADDRESS_413871] describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable) and wh ether the subject 
continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression 
of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB (new occurrence) and is thought to be related 
to the study treatment a Covance DS&E associate may urgently require further information from 
the Investigator for Health Authority reporting. Covance may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment 
that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will 
be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committ ees in 
accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries.  
Follow the detailed instructions outlined in the Safety Management Plan regarding the submission 
process for reporting SAEs to Covance. Note: SAEs must be reported to Covance within 24 hours 
of the Investigator learning of its occurrence/receiving follow -up information.  
7.[ADDRESS_413872] be followed.  
Please refer to Appendix 1  for complete definitions of liver events.  
Follow -up of liver events  
Ever y liver event defined in  Appendix 1   should be followed up by [CONTACT_335312], as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of 
liver events are outlined in Table 4 of Appendix 1.  
•Repeating liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), PT/INR, ALP and γGT)
to confirm elevation as soon as possible
These liver chemistry repeats should always be performed using the central laboratory,
with the results provided via the standard electronic transfer. If results are needed quickly
then the repeats can also be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the  safety of the
subject. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local liver chemistry tests previously
Page 50 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 43 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
conducted that are associated with this event should be available to Covance and the 
Sponsor.  
•If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the subject will be initiated,  
including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate.
•Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to Section 4.3 (Discontinuation of study 
treatment), if appropriate
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131539]
•Causality assessment of the liver event
•Thorough follow-up of the liver event should include
oRepeating liver chemistry tests two or three times weekly. Testing should include  
ALT, AST, ALP, PT/INR, and γGT. If total bilirubin is elevated > [ADDRESS_413873] is  
asymptomatic. Retesting should be continued up to resolution.
oObtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.
oObtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including non-prescription 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, and special diets.
oExclusion of underlying liver disease, as specified in  Table 6.
oImaging such as abdominal US, CT or MRI, as appropriate
oObtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
oConsidering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.
All follow up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded as appropriate in the 
CRF.

for timing of the protocol required preg nancy testing; additional pregnancy testing may be 
performed to meet local requirements*. Subjects will not receive study medication in case of a 
positive urine or serum pregnancy test.  
*If additional pregnancy testing is needed per local requirements, tho se additional results will be
kept as source documentation only.
Page [ADDRESS_413875] be 
reported to Covance within  24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal  and/or 
newborn complications.  
Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_335313]. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on 
the same form and should include an assessment  of the possible relationship to the study treatment.  
Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a 
SAE form.  
Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the mother.  
All assessments that are considered as a risk during pregnancy must not be performed. The subject 
may continue all other protocol assessments.  
7.[ADDRESS_413876] be reported and discussed with Covance personnel. The results should be evaluated for 
criteria d efining an AE and reported as such if the criteria are met. Repeated evaluations are 
mandatory until normalization of the result(s) or until the change is no longer clinically relevant. 
In case of doubt, Covance personnel should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Safety labs ( hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) do not need to be repeated at baseline 
if the Baseline visit is taking place within [ADDRESS_413877]  8 hours prior to scheduled safety lab collections.  
Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 3 .

via digital extraction from the rectum.  
Details regarding collection methods and processing are outlined in the Central Laboratory 
Manua l. 
7.11 Vital Signs, Physical Examination, and Other Safety Evaluations  
Vital signs will include the collection of oral body temperature (recorded in °C), blood pressure 
(BP) –sitting and standing –and pulse measurements. At Screening, for eligibility deter mination, 
three sets of systolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate measurements will be collected after the 
subject has been sitting for 3 minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor and 
the mean will be used to determine eligibility. A si ngle set of BP and pulse rate measurements will 
then be collected after three minutes in the standing position.  
A single set of sitting BP measurements will be collected at subsequent visits.  
Physical exams will include assessment of general appearance, s kin, lymph nodes, HEENT, neck, 
thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  
Height in centimeters (cm) and body weight [to the nearest 0.1 kilogram (kg) in indoor clothing, 
but without shoes] will be measured. Body mass  index (BMI) will be calculated using the 
following formula:  
BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)] 2. BMI results will be documented in the CRF to 2 decimal 
places.  
7.12 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
The ECGs must be recorded after [ADDRESS_413879] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_188597] a stable baseline. 
PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, RR interval, QT, QT corrected by [CONTACT_148997] (QTcF) will be collected. The QTcF  should be used for clinical decision -making. ECGs 
must be collected, analyzed and appropriately signed and archived at the study site; the site will 
also store all ECG readings digitally (if possible). For any ECGs with subject safety concerns, 
duplicate ECGs must be per formed to confirm the safety finding. Clinically significant ECG 
findings at baseline must be discussed with the Sponsor before administration of study treatment. 
Clinically significant abnormalities must be reported in the AE CRF.

7.13Pharmacokinetic Anal ysis 
The PK samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual rega rding sample collection, 
numbering, processing and shipment. See Section 7.1 5 regarding the potential use of residual 
samples.  
In order to better define the PK profile, the timing of the PK sample collection may be altered 
based on emergent data. The numbe r of samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected 
will not exceed those stated in the Laboratory Manual.  Changes to the PK Assessment schedule, 
if any, will be communicated to the sites in the dose adjustment minutes.  
The PK samples will be obtaine d and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels. Untreated 
(placebo) samples will not be analyzed.  
Concentrations of plasma total MAA868 (i.e. MAA868 that is bound to FXI or not bound to FXI) 
will be determined by a validated LC -MS/MS method. A detailed description of the method used 
to quantify the concentration of total MAA868 will be included in the bioanalytical raw data and 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
All concentrations below the LLOQ or missing data will be labeled as such in the conc entration 
data listings.  
For standard PK abbreviations and definitions see the list provided at the beginning of this 
protocol.  
The following PK parameters will be determined, where data permit, using the actual recorded 
sampling times and non -compartmenta l method(s) with Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 6.2 or 
higher): C 0 (the concentration at the end of infusion), AUC last, AUC inf, C0/D, and AUC/D, based 
on the plasma concentration data.  
The linear trapezoidal rule will be used for AUC calculation. The terminal  half-life of MAA868 
(T1/2), volume of distribution (V ss) and clearance (C L) will also be estimated, if feasible, based on 
the data.  
7.[ADDRESS_413880] of the study.  
Sample(s) will be collected at the timep oint(s) defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions for sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment provided in the 
central lab manual. Detailed descriptions of the assays will be included in the Bioanalytical Data 
Reports.  
7.14.2  Immunogenicity (IG)  
The IG samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Page 54 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 47 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing, and shipment. See Section 7. 15egarding the potential use of residual 
samples.  
Immunogenicity analytical method(s)  
A ligand -binding assay will be used to detect anti -MAA868 antibodies. The analytical method will 
be described in detail in the IG Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.15 Use of residual biological samples  
Residual blood samples may be used for another protocol specified endpoint.  
Any residual samples remaining after the protocol -defined analysis has been performed may be 
used for additional exploratory analysis. This may include but is not limited to using residual 
samples for pr otein binding, metabolite profiling, biomarkers of transporters or metabolic enzyme 
activity (such as 4 -beta-hydroxycholesterol levels) or other bioanalytical purposes (e.g. cross 
check between different sites and/or stability assessment). Given the explor atory nature of the 
work, the analytical method used for those assessments may not be validated. As such, the results 
from this exploratory analysis will not be included in the clinical study report.

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSES
8.1. Determination of Sample Si ze
A sample size of 16 subjects per treatment dose cohort with a ratio of 3:1 for MAA868 and placebo 
treatment assignment is based on historic data considerations. For example, if the observed 
proportion of patients in a cohort achieving target levels of i nhibition is 11/12, the 90% confidence 
interval would be 0.[ADDRESS_413881] received one dose of study drug. Subjects 
will be analyzed based on the actual tr eatment taken.  
PK/PD Analysis Set  will comprise all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and 
have at least one PK/PD assessment. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual treatment taken.  
8.3. General Considerations  
All efficacy analysis wi ll be based on the Full Analysis Set or Per Protocol Set and will be 
performed based on the assigned treatment arm at the randomization. Only descriptive statistics 
will be summarized, no statistical inference will be calculated in efficacy.  
Safety analys is will be performed using Safety Set. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual

PK and PD analysis will be based on PK/PD Analysis Set.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_249776] [n], mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum [min], and maximum [max]. Categorical variable will be summarized 
using frequency [N] and percentage [%].  
8.4. Demographics and Baseline characteristics

collected at screening (sitt ing diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature and body 
weight) will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max).  
8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
Within each treatment cohort patients wil l be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_413882] will achieve a certain percentage FXI inhibition 
at trough (Day 91). The response rate per treatment group will be calculated by [CONTACT_335315] e targeted FXI inhibition rate divided by [CONTACT_335316]. The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement for Cohorts 1 and 2 are as 
follows  
Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
The “on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analys is, where “on treatment” 
FXI level is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose 
regimens of MAA868 together with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals (CI) computed via the 
Clopper -Pearson exact binomial method.  
Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90% at trough after the first and second dose (Day 31 and Day 61) at 3 dose 
levels of MAA868. The analyses described for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the 
secondary efficacy variables as follows:  
•Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61.
•Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  at Day 31 and 61
•Cohort 3 (MAA868 TBD mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61
8.6. Safety Analysis  
The safety evaluation includes the analysis of bleeding events, AEs, major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, syste mic arterial, and venous thromboembolism events, laboratory data, ECG, 
vital signs, hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, and development of anti -drug 
antibodies. All safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Set.  
Adverse Events  
The Investigator’s verbatim term of each AE will be mapped to system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) using the MedDRA dictionary.  
Page 57 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 50 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be of primary interest. The TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_210716] d PT; a subject will only be counted once per SOC and once per PT within 
a treatment. If a subject reports more than one AE with the same PT, the AE with the maximum 
severity will be presented. Subject counts and percentages and event counts will be presen ted for 
each treatment and totaled for all treatments for the following summaries:  
•All TEAEs
•Serious TEAEs
•All TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]
•All TEAEs by [CONTACT_8792]
•TEAEs potentially related to study drug
•TEAEs potentially related to study drug by [CONTACT_335317]
•TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug
•TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be reported for a selection of interested AE terms 
that are specific to Sponsor’s product and program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_221289].  
The AESIs for this study are defined as follows:  
1. TERM 1
2. TERM 2

No statistical inference between the treatments will be performed on AEs.  
Listings will be presented by [CONTACT_335318], AESIs, as well as for SAEs, TEAEs associated 
with outcome of death, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.  
Bleeding Events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint o f major and CRNM bleeding 
events which occur on -treatment from the first dose of the study drug to the last dose of the study 
drug + [ADDRESS_413883] dose on 
Day 91. The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated bleeding events will be tabulated 
Page 58 of 212

based on ISTH definition by [CONTACT_335319]/or CRNM bleedings.  
Major bleeding events (Yes/No)  
CRNM bleeding events (Yes/No)  
Total bleeding events (Yes/No)  
If a subject has more than one bleeding event in each above category, the subject will be counted 
only once in the tabulation.  
The adjudicated outcome by [CONTACT_335320].  
Major cardiova scular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events which occur on -treatment from the first dose 
of the study d rug to the last dose of the study drug + [ADDRESS_413884] dose on Day 91.   
The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated events will be tabulated based on the 
outcomes adjudicated by  [CONTACT_138559], and the adjudicated outcome will be the 
basis for any interim and final analysis.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory results in continuous values at each timepoint and for change from baseline 
will be displa yed using summary statistics (n, mean, median, SD, minimum and maximum values).  
A laboratory value that is within the central laboratory’s reference range will be considered normal. 
A laboratory value that is outside the central laboratory’s normal range w ill be considered 
abnormal and will be flagged as either high (H) or low (L). The number and percentage of subjects 
with abnormal laboratory values will be summarized for each scheduled visit. In addition, shift 
tables will be presented to display the shif t in the normal range categories (L, normal [N], H) from 
baseline to specified timepoint. Laboratory results in clinical significance will also be summarized 
in tabulation.  
All clinical laboratory data will be presented in listings. Baseline is defined as the result obtained 
prior to first administration of study medication. Laboratory data will be summarized in SI units.  
Vital Sign Measurements  
Pre-dose values, post -dose values, and the change from baseline in vital sign measurements (sitting 
diastolic and  systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature and body weight) will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. 
The baseline value will be value just prior to first administration of study me dication.  
ECG Parameters  
The ECG measures ( QTc -F, QT, RR, ventricular rate, PR, and QRS) will be listed and summarized 
with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148].

8.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_22058] t and visit/sampling timepoint with 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. An 
exception to this is T max where median, minimum and maximum will be presented.  
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics and for PK parameter calculations. A geometric mean will not be reported if the dataset 
includes zero values.  
Individual total MAA868 plasma concentration data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148] (M AA868 arms 
only), subject, and visit/sampling timepoint. PK parameters will also be listed by [CONTACT_335321].  
8.8. Biomarkers  
Coagulation parameters, including free and total FXI, FXI:C, and immunogenicity will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_335322].  
8.9. Interim Analysis  (IA) 
Safety and tolerability data (AEs, laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG data) will be 
evaluated from Cohort 1 by [CONTACT_1034]'s Medical Monitor  and Covance Lead Project Physician 
after approximately [ADDRESS_413886] an additional 14 days, safety, tolerability, and other 
analyses will be evaluated.  
Additional IAs may be conducted to support decision making at any time concerning  the current 
clinical study, the Sponsor’s clinical development projects in general or in case of any emergent 
safety concerns. The Investigator(s) may be included for decisions with regards to any unplanned 
IAs that address questions of subject safety.  
Unblinded IA results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] (or their des ignees). 
No further dissemination of interim results should occur, in particular not with individuals 
involved in treating the study’s subjects or assessing clinical data (e.g. ECGs, symptoms) obtained 
in the study.  
8.10. Data Quality Assurance  
Site monitoring  
Page 60 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 53 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Covance 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the Investigator(s) and their staff. During 
the study Covance employs several methods of ensurin g protocol and GCP compliance and the 
quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, 
the progress of enrollm ent, and ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted 
for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during 
these visits.  
The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case 
and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. 
All information on CRFs must be trace able to these source documents in the subject's file. The 
Investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed 
copy is given to the subject).  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source doc uments to confirm their 
consistency with the CRF entries. Covance monitoring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the eligibility criteria, documentation of SAEs, and 
the recording of data that will be used  for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of 
the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific 
monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be 
disclo sed. 
Data collection  
Designated Investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_335323] 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. 
Designated investigator site staff will not b e given access to the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies 
and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before 
transfer o f the data to Covance working on behalf of Anthos. The Investigator must certify that the 
data entered into the Electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, 
the Investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_335272].  
Data not requiring a separate written record are noted on the Assessment schedule ( Table 9) and 
can be recorded directly on the CRF. Al l other data captured for this study will have an external 
originating source (either written or electronic) with the CRF not being considered as source.  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpret ation and verification.  
Database management and quality control  
Covance will review the data entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_335324]. Syste m 
queries are sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query which will appear in eCRF 
once data have been entered and saved. Manual queries will be raised by [CONTACT_335325]. Designated investigator sit e staff is required to respond to 
the query in the eCRF and confirm or correct the data.  
Page [ADDRESS_413887], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification sy stem. Medical 
history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary 
for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology.  
Laboratory samples will be processed centrally, and the results will be sent electronically to 
Covance.  
At the conclusion of the study, the occurrence of any emergency code breaks will be determined 
after return of all code break reports and unused drug supplies to Covance.  
The occurrence of any protocol deviations will be determined. After these acti ons have been 
completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, and 
the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the 
database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_335326].

concomitant treatment, diabetes)  Assess and document:  
• Blood glucose (fasting)  
• Serum creatinine  
• Urine albumin -creatinine ratio  
New hematuria on urine exam  Assess and document  
• Urine sediment microscopy  
• Assess sCr and urine albumin -creati nine ratio  
• Exclude infection, trauma, bleeding from the distal urinary 
tract/bladder, menstruation  
 • Consider bleeding disorder  
 
 
Additional specialized assessments are available to assess renal function or renal pathology.  
(Note: In exceptional cases when a nephrologist considers a renal biopsy, it is strongly recommended to 
make specimen slides available for evaluation by [CONTACT_335330] t o potentially identify project -wide patterns of 
nephrotoxicity.)  
Whenever a renal event is identified, a detailed subject history and examination are indicated to identify, 
document and potentially eliminate risk factors that may have initiated or contribu ted to the event:  
• Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_413898], with an appropriate cuff size)  
• Signs and symptoms such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, back or abdominal pain, dysuria, 
hematuria, dependent or periorbital edema  
• Changes in blood pressure, body weight, fluid intake, voiding pattern, or urine output  
• Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures, cardiac or hepatic failure, 
contrast media or other known nephrotoxin administration, or other potential causes of r enal 
dysfunction, e.g., dehydration, hemorrhage, tumor lysis

contributing factors to the renal event 
(co-medications, other co -morbid conditions) 
and additional diagnostic procedures (MRI etc.) 
in the CRF  • Urine exam  and sediment microscopy  
• Blood pressure and body weight  
• Serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, 
potass ium, phosphate, calcium), 
bicarbonate, and uric acid  
• Urine output  
Monitor subject regularly (frequency at 
Investigator’s discretion) until:  • Event resolution: (sCr within 10% of 
baseline or protein -creatinine ratio within 
50% of baseline) OR  
• Event stabilization: sCr level with ±10% 
variability over last 6 months or protein -
creatinine ratio stabilization at a new level 
with ±50% variability over last 6 months.  
*Urine osmolality: in the absence of diuretics or chronic kidney disease this can be a ver y sensitive 
metric for integrated kidney function that requires excellent tubular function. A high urinary 
osmolality in the setting of an increase in sCr will point toward a “pre -renal” cause rather than tubular 
toxicity.

Clinical notable laboratory values: 
The definition, the specific alert criteria and the corresponding actions for hepatic and renal notable 
laboratory abnormalities are respectively provided in  Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. 
The following laboratory values are considered clinically notable and should be forwarded to 
Covance at the same time that they are sent to Investigators: 
•A change from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dL
•A decrease from  baseline in platelets count ≥ 50% or < 100 x 10 9/L
•A positive fecal occult blood test
•Macroscopic hematuria
Whenever a clinically notable laboratory value is identified, a detailed subject history and 
examination are indicated to identify, document and potentially eliminate a bleeding event:  
•Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_413899], with an appropriate cuff size);
•Signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, hematemesis,
rectorrhagia, melena, gingival or nos e bleeding, bruising and hematoma;
•Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures.
When one of the above occurs the action plan is as follows:  
•Confirm the value, assess and document the clinically notable laboratory value in the CRF
or via electronic data load;
•Investigate the underlying causes such as clinical or subclinical bleeding event and the
contributing factors such as intake of prohibited medications;
•Monitor subject regularly (frequency at Investigator’s discretion) until  resolution or
stabilization. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], additional laboratory tests, endoscopy, volume
replacement, transfusion, etc. should be performed at the Investigator’s discretion and
according to the medical needs (see Section 6.3 for reversal therapy).

12.5. Appendix 5 – Definition of bleeding events  
Major bleeding event:  
A major bleeding event will be confirmed when it is a clinically overt bleeding event that meets at 
least one of the following:  
a) Fatal bleeding  
b) Bleeding in a critical area or organ such as:  
o Retroperitoneal  
o Intracranial  
 Intracranial bleeding will be further classified as either  
• Subdural  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]  
• Subarachnoidal  
• Intra-cerebral  
• Undetermined.  
o Intraocular  
o Intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]  
o Intra -articular  
o Pericardial  
o Intramuscular with compartment syndrome  
c) A clinically overt bleeding event    
o that is associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2.0 g/dL (>1.24 mMol/L) or more, 
or  
o leading t o a transfusion of  ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or whole  blood.  
Note: The (temporal) relationship of the hemoglobin drop (and or the need for transfusion) with 
the overt bleeding will be carefully evaluated since a gradual decrease of hemoglobin and need for 
transfusions may occur without direct association with an overt bleeding and then would not lead 
to classification major. In the case of surgical procedure related bleeding, the bleeding must be in 
excess of that normally associated with the s urgery/procedure.  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding event  
A bleeding event will be classified as a clinically relevant non -major (CRNM) bleeding event if it 
is overt not meeting the criteria for major bleeding, requires medical attention or is associa ted with 
discomfort for the subject such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life. Examples of 
bleeding requiring medical attention include, but are not limited to, bleeding events that result in 
the following diagnostic or therapeutic measures:  
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
Page 75 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 68 
AFib  Protocol Amendment 2   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
 Diagnostic tests: laboratory evaluations, imaging studies, endoscopy, colonoscopy, 
cystoscopy, or bronchoscopy;  
 Therapeutic intervention such as: nasal packing, ultrasound guided closure of an aneurysm, 
coil embolizati on, surgery . 
 
Clinical examples that might classify as CRNM:  
 Intramuscular hematoma or subcutaneous (skin) hematoma if the size is larger than 25 cm2, or 100 
cm2 if provoked, or  
 epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (profuse) lasting longer than 5 minutes, if it is repetitive (i.e. 2 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_335276], i.e. not spots on a handkerchief, within 24 hours), or lead to an intervention (packing, 
electrocoagulation etc.), or  
 hematuria if it is macroscopic, and either spontaneous or lasts for more than 24 hou rs after 
instrumentation (e.g. catheter placement or surgery) of the urogenital tract, or  
 macroscopic gastro -intestinal hemorrhage: at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_335277]/hematemesis, if clinically 
apparent, or rectal blood loss, if more than a few spots on toilet  paper, or  
 hemoptysis, if more than a few speckles in the sputum and not occurring within the context of PE  
Nuisance (not clinically relevant) bleeding events  
Other overt bleeding events that do not fulfill the criteria of a major bleeding event or a clin ically 
relevant non -major bleeding event will be classified as a nuisance bleeding event.  
 
Note: All other suspected bleeding events (e.g., decline in hemoglobin with no overt bleeding) will 
be classified as “no bleeding event.”

Statistical methods:  
The patients will be enrolled into cohorts of approximately 16 patients with each cohort 
evaluating a different dose level of MAA868.  Within each cohort, patients will be randomized 
3:[ADDRESS_413912] will achieve pre-defined  degrees of  FXI 
inhibition at trough (Day 91). The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement are as 
follow s:  
Low -dose cohort  (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
High dose cohort  (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough  (Day 91).  
The “on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analysis, where “on treatment” 
FXI level is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The response rate per treatment grou p will be calculated by [CONTACT_335290]. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose regimens 
of MAA868 together  with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals.  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90 % at trough after the first and second dose (Day 31 and Day 61) at multiple  
dose levels of MAA868 . The analyses described for the primary endpoint will be repeated for 
the secondary efficacy variables.  
Safety data including adverse events (AEs) , bleeding events, ECG, vital signs , thromboembolic 
events  and laboratory results will be reported by [CONTACT_335291].  
Page [ADDRESS_413913] more than 6 million 
patients in Europe and approximately 2.3 million in the [LOCATION_002], and this number continues 
to grow rapi[INVESTIGATOR_335260] -
morbidities. As such, the prevalence of AF is expected to increase 2 - to 3-fold over the following 
3 decades in western populations ( Kannel and Benjamin 2008 ). 
AF is associated with a 4 - to 5-fold increase in embolic stroke. The risk for stroke associated with 
AF increa ses steeply with age to 23.5% for patients aged 80 to 89 years ( Kannel and Benjamin 
2008 ). Most patients with AF require life -long anticoagulation therapy to prevent cardioembolic 
stroke and systemic embolism. It is estimated that  85 to 90% of AF patients will require 
anticoagulation therapy ( Camm et al 2012 ). 
Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, are effective in reducing stroke and systemic 
thromboembolism; a highly significant relative risk reduction in stroke incidence by 67% was 
observed in a meta -analysis combining six studies ( Hart et al 1999 ). All -cause mortality was 
reduced (26%) significantly by [CONTACT_335292]. control ( Hart et al 1999 ). In recent years, direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOACs) medications have been approved and introduced to clinical practice. These 
drugs are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and may be 
superior to warfarin in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage ( Connolly et al  
2009 , Granger et al 2011 , Patel et al 2011 ). The incidence of m ajor bleeding events  with DOACs 
was similar or slightly lower than the incidence observed with well -conducted warfarin therapy. 
Nonetheless, the overall bleeding risk continues to be high with the use of DOACs. For instance, 
the annual incidence of major and clinically releva nt non -major (CRNM) bleeding was 14.9% and 
the annual incidence of major bleeding events was 3.6% in patients treated with rivaroxaban in the 
ROCKET AF study ( Patel et al 2011 ). It is notable that the occurrence of major bleeding w as 
strongly associated with mortality. In the same study, the rate of all -cause mortality over the 2 -
month period following a major bleeding event was 20.4% in the rivaroxaban group and 26.1% in 
the warfarin group ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335261] 201 4). Thus, there is a high unmet medical need for an 
anticoagulant therapy that can effectively reduce the risk of AF -related thromboembolic 
complications such as stroke but with a lower risk of bleeding than currently employed 
anticoagulants.  
FXI is an emerging target for potentially safer and more effective anticoagulant medications. FXI 
holds important roles in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways and in bridging the 
initiation and amplification phases of plasmatic hemostasis ( Gailani and Renné 2007 ). Both Factor 
XII and thrombin can activate FXI, resulting in a sustained thrombin generation and fibrinolysis 
inhibition. FXI plays a minor role in normal hemostasis in a high tissue factor environment “after 
vessel injury” whereas it appears to play a key role in thrombosis. Severe FXI deficiency is 
associated with a lower incidence of ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolic events ( Salomon 
et al 2008 , Salomon et al 2011 , Preis et al 2017 ). Nevertheless, bleeding manifestations in subjects 
with severe FXI deficiency are infrequent and usually mild. Bleeding events that occur are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_335262] -related and preferentially affec t tissues known to have increased fibrinolytic 
Page [ADDRESS_413914] ( Bolton -Maggs 2000 ). Bleeding in 
vital organs is extremely rare or non -existent.  
MAA868  
MAA868 is a human antibody that binds to the catalytic domain of FXI. MAA868 binds to both 
the zymogen (FXI) and activated factor XI (FXIa) with high potency. MAA868 dose -dependently 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in in -vitro and in -vivo studies. After a 
single subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of MAA868 at a 3 mg/kg dose, sustained anticoagulant 
activity lasting for more than one month was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, 
MAA868 prevented experimental carotid artery thrombosis induced by [CONTACT_335293]3 and r esulted in a 
prolongation in aPTT in FXI -/- mice reconstituted with human FXI. No significant toxicity 
findings were observed in single dose and in the 13 -week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -
compliant toxicity study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. The hig hest s.c. dose administered 
in the [ADDRESS_413915] level NOAEL (100 mg/kg/week 
s.c.).  
MAA868 was evaluated in a first -in-human (FIH) study (CMAA868X2101) to characterize its 
safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy subjects 
following single s.c. administration. In total, 6 cohorts with 10 subjects each (8 MAA868: 2 
Placebo) were enrolled. The doses of MAA868 administered in Cohorts 1 to 5 ranged from 5  mg 
to 240 mg. In a sixth co hort, 240 mg of MAA868 was administered to subjects with body mass 
index (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2). 
In the FIH study, MAA868 appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and the incidence of AEs were 
comparable across dose groups and placebo. No bleeding events, hyperse nsitivity reactions or 
injection site reactions were reported. Exposure increased with increasing dose of s.c. MAA868; 
the median maximum observed concentration (C max) occurred on Day 7 to 21 and the mean 
terminal elimination half -life ranged from 20 to 28  days. A dose and time -dependent prolongation 
of aPTT occurred with MAA868 after single s.c. administration; the 150 mg dose resulted in a 
mean aPTT prolongation ≥ [ADDRESS_413916] and sustained 
reductions of free FXI ≥ 90% were observed with [ADDRESS_413917] - and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, non -confirmatory study to assess safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD. Three cohorts (MAA868 dose levels: 15, 50 and 150 mg) were enrolled 
in this study and received a single s.c. dose of MAA868 or matching placebo (8 subjects received 
MAA868 and 2 subjects received placebo in each cohort). Assessments and assessment schedules 
were generally similar to the FIH study.  No SAE or study discontinuation d ue to AEs were reported 
in this study. All AEs were mild in intensity and the distribution of AEs was well balanced between 
the MAA868 dose groups and placebo. No bleeding event, hypersensitivity or injection site 
reactions were reported in the study.  PK a nalysis suggested that t here was no indication of an 
impact of the Japanese ethnicity on exposure or PD parameters  of MAA868  in healthy subjects.

to/through Day 29 with the 150 mg dose and Day 43 with the 240 mg do se in subjects with normal 
body weight or class 1 obesity (BMI <35 kg/m 2). In subjects with class 2 or 3 obesity (BMI ≥35 
kg/m 2), exposures of MAA868 may be lower and the duration of aPTT prolongation is shorter.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
This study is a multicenter , randomized, subject and Investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, multiple ascending dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and 
PD effects of MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter  at low risk of thromboembolic stroke  or 
peripheral embolism . The trial will evaluate the effects of up to three different doses of MAA868 
on FXI inhibition, indices of coagulation, and thrombogenesis biomarkers compared to placebo. 
The incidence of injection site reactions, bleeding events, immunogenicity, and systemic arterial 
and venous thromboembolic events will also be assessed. Results from this study will assist with 
dose-selection of MAA868 for a phase [ADDRESS_413919] a lower risk of VTE even though their bleeding phenotype  is variable and often 
quite mild. Further support of the safety of inhibiting FXI comes from clinical studies using an 
investigational FXI antisense oligonucleotide (FXI -ASO)  where administration of FXI -ASOs in 
healthy subjects and in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty  was demonstrated to be safe 
and well -tolerated ( Buller et al 2015 ). 
Results from the first -in-human (FIH) study of MAA868 (CMAA868X2101) demonstrated that a 
single s.c. administration of MAA868 at increasin g doses up to [ADDRESS_413920] and sustained FXI inhibition 
and prolongation of aPTT. The safety and pharmacodynamic efficacy of MAA868 was further 
supported by [CONTACT_335331]868A1101, which showed a good safety 
profile of MAA868 in Japanese heathy male subjects.  
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of achieving different levels of FXI 
inhibition with different dose levels of s.c. MAA868  in patients with AF or flutter . This study will 
recruit patients with AF or flutter who are judged by [CONTACT_335332]. In each case, patients will only be enrolled if their physician has 
deter mined that the patient does not merit anticoagulation based on the guidelines and the 
physician’s assessment of the benefit -risk profile for that patient. The guidelines state that the 
benefits of  anticoagula tion in AF patients at low risk of embolic stroke are uncertain given the 
concomitant risks of bleeding with anticoagulant therapy. Accordingly, the g uidelines recommend 
individualized shared physician -patient decision -making  with regards to the decision to initiate 
anticoagulant therapy in  this population ( January et al 2019 ).  Patients with PAF will be enrolled 
who have a CHA2DS2 -VASc risk score of 0 -1 for men or 1-2 for wome n, in whom the guidelines

AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
are equivocal regarding the recommendation to initiate anticoag ulation and advise an 
individualized assessment of the benefit -risk of anticoagulation (January et al 2019 ).  
Overall, the nonclinical and clinical data to date support the investigation of MAA868 in the 
prevention of thromboembo lic diseases in patients with AF. The risk -benefit relationship appears 
to be acceptable.

Page [ADDRESS_413921] - and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, multiple 
ascending dose-ranging  study  to assess the PK/PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter.  
Patients will be enrolled in at least 2 and up to 3 cohorts of approximately 16 patients each  for a 
total of up to 48 subjects ( Figure 1A). Patients in cohort 1 will be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_413922] . Cohort 2 will be initiated after it is confirmed by [CONTACT_429]’s Medical Monitor and the Covance Lead Project Physician that the cohort [ADDRESS_413923] to:  
• Enroll cohort 3 to evaluate a higher, lower, or a previously studied dose of MAA868  
• Terminate the study  
The study is comprised of 3 periods:  
(1) Screening period of up to 4 weeks  
(2) Treatment period with MAA868 administered s.c. monthly (or matching placebo) 
(randomized 3:1) for 90  days 
(3) Follow -up period up to end of study (Day 170).  
Following the screening period of up to 4 weeks, all patients that meet the study eligibility criteria 
(Section 4.1 and Section 4.2) will have baseline efficacy and safety assessments performed on Day 
1 and then randomized to active or placebo ( Figure 1B ). 
Figure 1: Overall study design  
 
The first dose of study drug  will be administered  at the study center on Day 1. The second and 
third doses of study drug will also be administered at the study center to patients on the Day 31 
visit and Day 61  visit, respectively.  
Page 104 of 212

AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
During the treatment period,  patients will return to the study center on Day 11, Day 31, Day 41, 
Day 61, Day 71, and Day 91 for safety assessments such as vital signs, AE  assessment s, laboratory 
tests, PK, PD, thrombogenesis biomarkers, and other study assessments according to the 
assessment schedule shown in Table 9. 
During the follow -up period, patients will continue to be followed for PK, PD, thrombogenesis, 
and other study assessments. Patients will return to the study center on Day 101, Day 121 and Day 
170 (end of study; EoS)  for the evaluations described in the as sessment schedule ( Table 9). 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Rationale for route of administration and treatment duration . The s.c. ro ute of administration 
was chosen because it is the route of administration anticipated for subsequent studies in patients 
with AF. In the FIH study of MAA868, the half -life of MAA868 ranged from [ADDRESS_413924]  of >2-fold mean  activated partial 
thromboplastin time [ aPTT ] prolongation w as observed for ~30 days and returned to the baseline 
level by ~[ADDRESS_413925] -dose after a  single 150 mg s.c. dose administration in study X2101.  These 
data support m onthly administration of MAA868. Furthermore, a ssessment of the exposure -
response relationship of MAA868 in healthy subjects demonstrated  a nearly flat exposure -response 
for relevant PD parameters (aPTT, FXI  coagulation activity and free F XI) at concentrat ions above 
4 μg/mL which is consistent with the Day 29 total MAA868 concentrations achieved with the 150 
mg single dose administration in healthy subjects (CMAA868X2101).  
Given the half -life of MAA868 and the observed time to return to baseline aPTT levels, a 
prolonged washout/ follow -up period of approximately [ADDRESS_413926] and sustained dose -dependent inhibition of FXI and 
relevant prolongation of aPTT for approximately 4 weeks. MAA868 doses greater than 150 mg 
s.c. produced a sustained ~[ADDRESS_413927] remains 
unknown. The primary  efficacy endpoint of this study will be the number of patients who achieve  
≥ 50%, ≥ 80%, or ≥ 90% FXI i nhibition [<50%, <20%, or 10% free FXI] at trough  on Day 91 
following s.c. administration of MAA868 . Based on preliminary PK/PD modeling, the doses 
selected for cohorts 1 and 2 are projected to target the following levels of FXI inhibition : 
• Cohort 1 (120 m g dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects at trough (Day  91).  
• Cohort 2 (180 mg dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects at trough (Day  91). 
Based on interim data, an optional cohort 3 may be dosed to add further data to the PK/PD model 
which will inform dose selection of MAA868 for subsequent studies.  
The dosing regimens selected for evaluation in this study are projected to result in exposur e (C max) 
below the C max achieved with a single dose of [ADDRESS_413928] be obtained before any assessment is performed

3. Patients with a history of PAF or atrial flutter, as documented by (telemetry, 12 lead 
electrocardiography or ambulatory [e.g . Holter] monitor) and not due to a reversible 
condition (e.g. alcohol binge drinking) can be entered even if they do not have PAF at 
Screening. There is not time -limit for this.  
4. Patients with a CHA2DS2 -VASc risk score (tool as a predictor for estimating t he risk of 
stroke in patients with AF; Lip et al 2010) of 0 -1 for men and 1 -2 for women and in whom, 
in the investigator’s judgment, the use of an anticoagulant for stroke prevention is not 
indicated  
5. Body weight between [ADDRESS_413929] has returned to baseline, whichever is longer; 
or longer if required by [CONTACT_427].  
2. History of stroke, transi ent ischemic attack or systemic embolism  
3. History of major bleeding during treatment with an anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. 
(Patients who have had major bleeding on anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy more than 
a year ago can be enrolled only if the bleeding was due to a reversible cause, e.g. gastro -
duodenal ulcer that was successfully treated.)

weeks prior to dosing   
18. Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during 
their t ime in the study. Highly effective contraception methods include:  
• Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and with drawal are not acceptable methods of contraception  
• Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without 
hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking 
investigational drug. In case of oophorect omy alone, only when the reproductive status 
of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] -up hormone level assessment  
• Male sterilization of sexual partner (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female 
subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that 
subject  
• Use of oral (estrogen  and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 
or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate

age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral 
oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total h ysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 
six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the 
woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] -up hormone level assessment with FSH is she 
considered not of child -bearing potential. Male  subjects  must also agree to use highly 
effective methods of contraception during their time in the study  and should not father a 
child or donate sperm in this period.

laboratory test.  
20. Patients with either a psychiatric disease or substance abuse history, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_335278].  
21. Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may place the

4.3. Discontinuation Criteria  
4.3.1.  Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently  randomized . A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details , eligibility criteria, and any 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may be rescreened.  
4.3.2.  Withdrawal of informed consent  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from  the study for any reason at any time.  
Withdrawal from the study can occur  when a subject  chooses to do one or more of the following : 
• Does not want to participate in the study anymore  
• Does not want any further visits or assessments  
• Does not want any furt her study -related contacts  
• Does not allow analysis of already obtained biologic material.  
If a subject who has received one or more doses o f the study drug determines that they no longer 
want to participate the Investigator must make every effort (e.g. te lephone, e -mail, letter) to 
determine the primary reason (s) for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent , record this 
information and conduct any assessments and visits still allowed.  
In the event the subject withdraws consent prior to beginning dosing, the study treatment will not 
be administered. The data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered 
missing. Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_335296] -
up. 
4.3.3.  Lost to Follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an 
intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_335297], e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered 
letters, etc. A subject cannot be formally considered lost to follow -up until his/her scheduled end 
of study visit would have occurred.  
4.4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_335264]:  
Enrollment in the study will be p laced on hold if the Sponsor considers that the number and/or 
severity of AEs, abnormal safety monitoring tests or abnormal laboratory findings justify putting 
the study on hold.  
Page 108 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 27 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
The study may resume following the safety review, if the Investigator and Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor  agree it is safe to proceed.  
Page [ADDRESS_413933] is a sterile, preservative -free liquid in vial for subcutaneous (s.c.) or 
intravenous (i.v.) administration. Each drug product vial contains 15 0 mg of MAA868 active 
ingredient per 1 mL plus 20% (0.2 mL) overfill which allows for complete withdrawal of the 
labeled dose (150 mg). 
 
 The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_335279]. MAA868 will be provided as a 150 mg/mL solution in 6 mL single -use vials 
(with 1.2 mL fill). The 180 mg d ose will require 2 vials. 0.8 and 1.2 mL should be withdrawn into 
a syringe and administered subcutaneously for the 120 mg and 180 mg doses, respectively.

5.2. Preparation, Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
Details on the requirements for storage and management of study treatment, and instructions to be 
followed for subject numbering, prescribing/dispensing and administering study treatment are 
outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
MAA [ADDRESS_413934] vials should be stored refrigerated at 2° - 8°C and protected from light. A 
disposable syringe will be used to administer the s.c. injection.  
The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the study treatment. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study 
treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study  treatment. The 
Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for 
study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, 
and final disposition records).  
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided 
in the Pharmacy Manual.

5.3. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomized to MAA868 or placebo in a ratio of 12: 4 as follows.  
• Cohort  1 = 120 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 2 = 180 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 3 (if necessary) = TBD mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible subjects. The 
Investigator will enter the randomization number on the CRF.  
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that 
treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A 
rando mization list will be produced by [CONTACT_335334] a validated system that automates the random assignment of treatment arms to 
randomization numbers in the specified ratio. The randomization scheme for su bjects will be 
reviewed and approved by a member of the Covance IIS Randomization Group.  
Patients will be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion. Replacement subjects will be assigned 
randomization numbers [ADDRESS_413935] (e.g., Subject [ADDRESS_413936] 1103).  
The table below provides the general details of the numbering of the subjects for randomization:  
Table 2: Randomization Assignment Numbering  
Cohort  Randomization numbers  Replacement randomization numbers  
I [ADDRESS_413937] or pharmacy designee, all site staff (including 
study investigator and study nurse(s)) will be blinded to study treatment during treatment 
allocation and subject dosing. Appropriate measures must be taken by [CONTACT_335299].  
Unblinding a single subject at the site for safety reasons (necessar y for subject management) will 
occur via an emergency system in place at the site (see Section 5.10). 
Site staff may also be unblinded to the treatment assignment of one or more subjects (within a 
single cohort or across cohorts as necessary), or an entire cohort at the initial cohort safety

Anthos Therapeutics   Page 30 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
evaluation timepoint if deemed appropriate to aid decision -making. The decision to un -blind site 
staff will be determined by [CONTACT_335300] a pre -selected time.  
Sponsor staff  
The following unblinded Sponsor roles (or designee) are required for this study:  
• Field monitor(s)  (evaluation of drug dispensing a nd reconciliation)  
• Physician not directly involved in study conduct  
• Sample analyst(s) (PK blood)  
• Study statistician  
• Programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis  
An unblinded Covance Physician not directly involved in study conduct may receive a copy of the 
randomization schedule (via request to the Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of aPTT 
safety labs that would otherwise unblind study Investigators. The unblinded Medical Monitor will 
alert the Investigator and S ponsor of any safety concerns.  
The sample analysts will receive a copy of the randomization schedule (via request to the 
Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of the samples. The sample analysts will provide the 
sample data to the study team under blinded conditions unless otherwise allowed.  
The study statistician will be able to access the full randomization list from the start of the study 
and is allowed to share unblinded information with the rest of the clinical trial team as appropriate 
for int ernal decision purposes. For example, unblinded summaries and unblinded individual data 
can be shared with the team whenever necessary.  
Study programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis (e.g. biomarker expert, 
pharmacometrician, modele r(s)) are allowed to access treatment assignment information from the 
start of the study for the purpose of data analysis.  
The clinical trial team is allowed to share unblinded results with other Sponsor staff (e.g. decision 
boards) as required for interna l decision making on the study or the project while the study is 
ongoing.  
All unblinded personnel will otherwise keep randomization lists and data or information that could 
un-blind other study team members confidential and secure except as described abov e.  
Following final database lock all roles may be considered unblinded.  
5.5. Treating the subject  
MAA868 will be administered to the subject by [CONTACT_198930] s.c. administration. See the 
Pharmacy Manual for further details.  
Sponsor qualified medical personne l will be readily available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems.  
Page [ADDRESS_413938] related assessments collected as per 
the Schedule of assessments ( Table 9). All SAEs reported during this time period must be reported 
as described in Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_413939] should be recorded in the source documentation.  
5.8. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The Investigator may decide to suspend the s.c. administration of the study drug if symptoms or 
signs consistent with an injection site reaction or hypersensitivity r eaction occur.  
Subjects who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered 
withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section 4.3.2 , Withdraw of 
Informed Consent). Where possible, they should return for the EoS assessments indicated in the 
assessment table. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. 
telephone, e -mail, letter) should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]/pre -designated contact [CONTACT_335335] 4.3.3  (Lost to follow -up). This contact [CONTACT_335336].  
5.9. Study Termination  
The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_335303]. This may include reasons 
related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study, practical reasons (including 
slow enrollm ent), or for regulatory or medical reasons. Should this be necessary, subjects must be 
seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject and followed until the 
aPTT has returned to baseline. The Investigator may be informed of additio nal procedures to be 
followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s 
interests. The Investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of the early termination of the tria l. 
5.10. Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code  
Emergency unblinding must only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject safely and 
efficaciously, such as in the event of clinically significant bleeding events. Most often, knowledge 
of the p ossible treatment assignments is sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an 
emergency condition. A complete set of emergency code break cards will be provided to the 
Investigator site(s) and a complete set will be available at Anthos and Cova nce. All code break 
cards must be retained until the end of the study and retained by [CONTACT_261860] a source document. 
Page [ADDRESS_413940]. In an 
emergency, the code break may be opened to determine the treatment. There is no known reversal 
agent for MAA868 (see Section 6.2).  
The code break should not be opened for any reason other than an emergency. If the Investigator 
opened the code break, he/she must note the date, time, and reason for removing it and retain this 
information with the case report form documentation. The unblinded treatment code must not be 
recorded on the CRF. The Investigator must also immediately inform the study monitor that the 
code has been broken.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable proced ure in place to 
allow access to the code break cards at any time in case of emergency. The Investigator will need 
to provide:  
• Protocol number  
• Study drug name (if available)  
• Subject number.  
In addition, the Investigator must provide oral and written information to inform the subject how 
to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable to ensure that un 
blinding can be performed at any time . 
Page [ADDRESS_413941] to notify the study staff of any new medications 
(including nutritional supplements and herbal medications) that he/she takes after being enrolled 
into the study.  
All prescription medications, OTC drugs and significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy and blood transfusions) administered or taken within the timeframe defined in the entry 
criteria prior to the start of the study and during the study, must be recorded on the Concomitant 
medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_50061].  
Medi cation entries should be specific to trade name, the single dose and unit, the frequency and 
route of administration, the start and discontinuation date and the reason for therapy.  
Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion c riteria/prohibited 
medication. If in doubt, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_335304] a subject or, 
if the subject is already enrolled, to determine if the subject should continue participation in the 
study.  
During the study, in the event the Investigator elects to start the patient on chronic antithrombotic 
therapy, anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy should not be started until the patient’s aPTT has 
returned to baseline.  
Reporting medication errors including misuse/abuse  
Medication e rrors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient/subject or 
consumer (EMA definition).  
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal pr oduct is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the protocol.  
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
All s tudy treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the Dose Administration Record CRF. Study treatment errors are only to be reported to Covance 
DSS department if the treatment error is associated with an SAE.  
All instances of misuse or abuse must be documented in the AE CRF irrespective of the 
misuse/abuse being associated with an AE/SAE. In addition, all instances of misuse or abuse must 
be reported to the Covance DSS department. As such, instances of misuse or  abuse are also to be 
reported using the SAE form/CRF. Table 3 summarizes the reporting requirements.

methods of  contraception  and should not father a child or donate sperm in this period. Prohibited 
treatment  
Use of the following medications is not allowed during the course of the study from screening 
(Visit 1) through the EoS. Patients who are receiving such medication(s) will be excluded, or if 
ethically and clinically justified, the medication(s) should be gradually withdrawn at least seven 
days b efore the baseline visit:  
• Use of chronic antiplatelet agents such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_335280]; however, 
use of low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤100 mg per day) is permitted.  
• Use of chronic systemic anticoagulants such as warfarin, low molecular weight hep arin or 
heparinoids, or direct oral anticoagulants such as api[INVESTIGATOR_335266]. Patients may be 
started on chronic anticoagulation during the Washout/Follow -up period once their aPTT 
has returned to baseline, at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Use of any  therapeutic monoclonal antibody regardless of the indication during the study.  
Dietary restrictions  
• No alcohol for 48 hours before each clinic visit (from Screening through the EoS visit). 
During the study, alcohol consumption will be restricted to no mo re than 2 drinks/day for 
males and 1 drink/day for females.  
• Patients should not make significant alterations in their diet (e.g., going on weight loss diet) 
while in the study.  
• During the study, caffeinated beverages will be restricted to no more than 3 cu ps/day.  
Other restrictions  
No strenuous physical exercise or activities which have an increased risk of injury or falling should 
be undertaken until after the EoS visit.

6.3. Reversal medication  
There is currently no specific antidote for MAA868. FXI concentrat es (not marketed in the US) 
are unlikely to be effective as the excess in free MAA868 concentrations in the circulation is 
expected to quickly neutralize the exogenous FXI.  
Recombinant FVIIa can by[CONTACT_335337] s with 
severe FXI deficiency. Administration of intermediate to high doses of rFVIIa (40 to 90 μg/kg) 
resulted in supra -physiological levels of FVII and thromboembolic complications in patients with 
severe FXI deficiency ( Riddell  et al 2011 ). Low doses of rFVIIa are associated with lower 
prothrombotic risk. Riddell et al reported their experience in 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency 
undergoing surgery ( Riddell et al 2011 ); patients were administered rFVIIa 30 μg/kg and 
tranexamic acid 1 g i.v. at induction of anesthesia. Subsequent bolus doses of rFVIIa 15 –30 μg/kg 
were administered at 2 to 4 hourly intervals as guided by [CONTACT_335306] 24 48 
hours and tranexamic acid 1 g every 6 ho urly for 5 days. Low doses of rFVIIa and tranexamic acid 
were safe and effective in restoring hemostasis in severe FXI deficiency in this study. In another 
study comprising 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency with inhibitor who experienced 5 surgeries 
(Livnat et al 2009 ), [ADDRESS_413943] 7 days; moreover, rFVIIa was administered at doses 
ranging from 15 to 30 μg/kg at th e completion of surgery. This protocol secured normal hemostasis 
in patients with severe FXI deficiency with inhibitor.  
Based on the above, rFVIIa can be recommended as a preferred therapeutic option to restore 
hemostasis in subjects with active, non -acces sible bleeding site and in subjects requiring 
immediate reversal of the MAA868 PD effects prior to an urgent surgery.  Please see the 
Investigator’s Brochure - Summary of the data and guidance for the investigator for a more 
complete discussion.

7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Assessment schedule  
Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule ( Table 9).  
Missed or reschedul ed visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as 
possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the study treatment discontinuation ( TD) 
visit will be performed. At the TD visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, 
and the AE and concomitant medications recorded on the CRF.  
7.2. Informed consent procedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after prov iding written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB -approved informed consent.  
The Sponsor, or Sponsor designee, will provide to investigators a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the ICHE6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidel ine and regulatory requirements 
and is considered appropriate for this study. The informed consent form will also include a section 
related to optional future research which will require a separate signature [CONTACT_335354]. Any ch anges to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_335338].  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the IB. This information will  be included in the subject informed consent and should be 
discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety 
profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as 
appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safety Finding. New 
information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the 
subject.  
Ensure subjects are informed of the contraception requireme nts outlined in the Section 4.2 
(Exclusion criteria).  
A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to the Covance monitor 
after IRB approval.  
7.3. Subject screenin g 
In general, it is permissible to re -screen a subject if s/he fails the initial Screening or falls out of 
the screening window timelines; however, each case must be discussed and agreed with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor on a case -by-case ba sis. A new screening number will be assigned to a 
subject who is re screened, thus no screening number will be used twice.  
Reasons for screen failure will be documented in the site log.  
7.4. Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Subject demographi c and baseline characteristic data will be collected on all subjects. Relevant 
medical history/current medical conditions data will also be collected until signature [CONTACT_62686].  
Page [ADDRESS_413944] and drug screening  
All subjects will  be screened for alcohol and substances of abuse.  
7.5. Efficacy Assessments  
The PD samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing and shipment.  
In order to better define the PD profile, the timing of the sample collection may be altered based 
on emergent data. The number o f samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected will not 
exceed those stated in the  Laboratory Manual . 
PD samples will be obtained and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels.  
7.5.1.  Free FXI  
Free FXI concentrations (FXI that is not bound to MAA868) will be measured in plasma. A 
detailed description of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.2.  aPTT  
aPTT, calibrated for FXI deficiency, and aPTT using a standard laboratory protocol will be 
measured at all timepoints in dicated in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
aPTT will be determined in plasma. The detailed method descriptions of the assay will be included 
in the Bioanalytical Dat a Report.  
7.5.3.  Total FXI  
Total FXI concentrations (FXI that is either bound to MAA868 or free) will be measured in plasma. 
A detailed description of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.4.  FXI coagulation activity (FXI:C)  
FXI:C will  be measured in plasma. A detailed description of the assay methods will be included 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report . 
7.6. Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments are specified below; assessments will be collected as specified in the 
Assessment Schedule ( Table 9). 
Bleeding  
All suspected bleeding events will be documented by [CONTACT_335308]. All 
suspected bleeding events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_335339] 119 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 38 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
treatment assignment. Adjudication of bleeding events will be performed in accordance with the 
International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition of a major bleeding in 
non-surgical patients ( Schulman et al 2005 ) and criteria for clinically -relevant non -major bleeding 
(CRNM) events. The definitions of bleedings are as follows:  
Major bleeding events include:  
• Fatal bleeding, and/or  
• Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra ‐articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or  
• Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more or leading to 
transfusion  of two or more units of whole blood or red cells.  
CRNMs (clinically relevant non -major) bleeding events will be defined as clinically overt bleeding 
that did not satisfy the criteria for major bleeding and that led to:  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or  
• physician -guided medical treatment, or  
• surgical treatment or  
• change in antithrombotic therapy  
In addition to the ISTH definition of bleeding events other definitions such as TIMI, BARC,  
GUSTO, etc. can be used as supportive for exploratory safety analyses.  
The populati on is those who have received at least one dose of the study drug.  
 
Major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events  
All suspected major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and VTE events will be documented by [CONTACT_335340]. For instance, any suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_184395] (i.e., swelling, localized pain, redness, heat, 
localized warmth) must be documented by [CONTACT_49734] (CUS) or venograph y.  
Any suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_335267] (i.e., shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, tachycardia, 
hemoptysis, hemodynamic compromise, unexplained death) must be documented by 
[CONTACT_302796]/perfusion lung scintigraphy, spi[INVESTIGATOR_85004] (sCT), or pulmo nary 
angiography.  
All major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, systemic arterial, and venous thromboembolic events 
(VTEs) including deaths for which a major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or VTE event could 
not be ruled out will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_335341].  
The adjudicated outcome will be the basis for any interim and final safety evaluations.  
Page [ADDRESS_413945] medical occurrence [i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or disease] in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the EoS visit. 
Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causa lly associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the study treatment are also considered 
an AE irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. See Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_413946] one of th e 
following criteria:  
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  
• they require therapy.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to  be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_335268]. 
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and identifying 
AEs. Alert ranges for liver and kidney related events are included in Appendix [ADDRESS_413947] be recorded on the AE CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with 
them, and a ccompanied by [CONTACT_6644]:  
1. Severity grade  
• mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• severe: prevents normal activities  
2. Relationship to the study treatment  
• Related  
• Possibly related  
• Not related  
3. Duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved 
must be reported.  
Page 121 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 40 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
4. Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 7.6.2  for definition of SAE) and which seriousness 
criteria have been met  
5. Action taken regarding investigational treatment.  
All AEs must be treated appropriately. Treatment may in clude one or more of the following:  
• no action taken (e.g. further observation only)  
• concomitant medication or non -drug therapy given  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section 7.6.2  for definition of SAE)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown).  
Information about common side effects already known about the investi gational drug can be found 
in the IB. Once an AE is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the sus pected relationship to the investigational drug, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outcome.  
The Investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new AE (beyond the protocol 
observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s pers onal physician, believes might reasonably 
be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the Investigator’s source 
documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Covance.  
7.6.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Ev ents 
Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any AE [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable 
sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)] which meets any one of the following criteria:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existin g condition and has not worsened 
since the start of study drug  
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_335281]’s 
general condition  
o is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention  
Page 122 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 41 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medi cally significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might hav e 
caused death if it were more severe (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be imm ediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37208]. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121895] (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline).  
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also co nsidered a 
serious adverse reaction.  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) are captured on the CRF; SAEs also require individual reporting 
to Covance Drug Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E).  
SAE Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality,  occurring after the subject has 
provided informed consent and until [ADDRESS_413948] be 
reported to Covance within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence as described below. Any SAEs 
experienced after this period shoul d only be reported to Covance if the Investigator suspects a 
causal relationship to study treatment.  
Note: SAEs reported by [CONTACT_335342].  
All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the 
initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] [ADDRESS_413949] describe whether the event has resolved or co ntinues, if and 
how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable) and whether the subject 
continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression 
of the original event must be reported as a fol low-up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB (new occurrence) and is thought to be related 
to the study treatment a Covance DS&E associate may urgently require further information from 
the Investigato r for Health Authority reporting. Covance may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment 
that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S [LOCATION_003]Rs) will 
be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in 
accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries.  
Page 123 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 42 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
Follow the detailed instructions outlined in the Safety Management Plan regarding the submission 
process for reporting SAEs to Covance. Note: SAEs must be reported to Covance within 24 hours 
of the Investigator learning of its occurrence/receiving follow -up information.  
7.7. Liver safety monitoring  
To ensure subject safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an 
investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver 
events must be followed.  
Please refer to Appendix 1  for complete definitions of liver events.  
Follow -up of liver events  
Every liver event defined in  Appendix 1   should be followed up by [CONTACT_335312], as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of 
liver events are outlined in Table 4 of Appendix 1.  
• Repeating liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), PT/INR, ALP and γGT) 
to confirm elevation within [ADDRESS_413950] results reported on the unscheduled local laboratory CRF.  
• If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the subject will be initiated, 
including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate.  
• Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to Section 4.3 (Discontinuation of study 
treatment), if appropriate  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131539]  
• Causality assessment of the liver event  
• Thorough follow -up of the liver event should include  
o Repeating liver chemistry tests two or three times week ly. Testing should include 
ALT, AST, ALP, PT/INR, and γGT. If total bilirubin is elevated > [ADDRESS_413951] is 
asymptomatic. Retesting should be continued up to resolution.  
o Obtaining a more detailed his tory of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
o Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, and special diets.  
Page [ADDRESS_413952] pregnancy testing. See the Assessment Schedule ( Table 9), 
for timing of the protocol required preg nancy testing; additional pregnancy testing may be 
performed to meet local requirements*. Subjects will not receive study medication in case of a 
positive urine or serum pregnancy test.  
*If additional pregnancy testing is needed per local requirements, tho se additional results will be
kept as source documentation only.
Pregnancy reporting  
Reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity data are not available for this antibody at this time, 
therefore no guidelines on therapeutic recommendations in case of pregnancy  are available. This 
study enrolls women who are considered to be of non -child -bearing potential, thus pregnancy is 
not an expected outcome for any female study participant. However, in the case that a pregnancy 
in a female study participant should occur p lease follow the below reporting guidelines. The 
follow -up for this subject and for the fetus is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be 
reported to Covance within  24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal  and/or 
newborn complications.  
Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_335313]. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on 
the same form and should include an assessment  of the possible relationship to the study treatment.  
Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a 
SAE form.  
Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the mother.  
Page [ADDRESS_413953] be reported and discussed with Covance personnel. The results should be evaluated for 
criteria defini ng an AE and reported as such if the criteria are met. Repeated evaluations are 
mandatory until normalization of the result(s) or until the change is no longer clinically relevant. 
In case of doubt, Covance personnel should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Safety labs (hemat ology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) do not need to be repeated at baseline 
if the Baseline visit is taking place within [ADDRESS_413954] 8 ho urs prior to scheduled safety lab collections.  
Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 3 . 
Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count with 
differentials and  platelet count will be measured.  
Clinical chemistry  
Sodium, potassium, creatinine, BUN/urea, uric acid, chloride, albumin, calcium, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, bicarbonate/HCO 3, LDH, GGT, AST, ALT, CK, glucose, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides.  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.[ADDRESS_413955] to produce a sample 
via digital extraction from the rectum.  
Details regarding collection methods and processing are outlined in the Central Laboratory 
Manual.  
7.11. Vital Signs, Physical Examination, and Other Safety Evaluations  
Vital signs will include the collection of oral body temperature (recorded in °C), blood pressure 
(BP) –sitting and standing –and pulse measurements. At Screening, for eligibility determ ination, 
three sets of systolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate measurements will be collected after the 
subject has been sitting for 3 minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor and 
Page 126 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 45 
AFib  Protocol v0 2 Protocol No. ANT -004 
the mean will be used to determine eligibility. A sin gle set of BP and pulse rate measurements will 
then be collected after three minutes in the standing position.  
A single set of sitting BP measurements will be collected at subsequent visits.  
Physical exams will include assessment of general appearance, sk in, lymph nodes, HEENT, neck, 
thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  
Height in centimeters (cm) and body weight [to the nearest 0.1 kilogram (kg) in indoor clothing, 
but without shoes] will be measured. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated using the 
following formula:  
BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)] 2. BMI results will be documented in the CRF to 2 decimal 
places.  
7.12. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
The ECGs must be recorded after [ADDRESS_413956] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_67529] n to ensure a stable baseline. 
PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, RR interval, QT, QT corrected by [CONTACT_148997] (QTcF) will be collected. The QTcF should be used for clinical decision -making. ECGs 
must be collected, analyzed and ap propriately signed and archived at the study site; the site will 
also store all ECG readings digitally (if possible). For any ECGs with subject safety concerns, 
duplicate ECGs must be performed to confirm the safety finding. Clinically significant ECG 
findings at baseline must be discussed with the Sponsor before administration of study treatment. 
Clinically significant abnormalities must be reported in the AE CRF.  
7.13. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the As sessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing and shipment. See Section 7 .15 regarding the potential use of residual 
samples.  
In order to better define the PK profile, the timing of the PK sample collection may be altered 
based on emergent data. The number of samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected 
will not exceed those stated in the Laboratory Manual.  Changes to the  PK Assessment schedule, 
if any, will be communicated to the sites in the dose adjustment minutes.  
The PK samples will be obtained and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels. Untreated 
(placebo) samples will not be analyzed.  
Concentrations of plasma total MAA868 (i.e. MAA868 that is bound to FXI or not bound to FXI) 
will be determined by a validated LC -MS/MS method. A detailed description of the method used 
to quantify the concentration of total MAA868 will be included in the bioanalytical raw data and 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
All concentrations below the LLOQ or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration 
data listings.  
For standard PK abbreviations and definitions see the list provided at the beginning of this 
protocol.  
Page 127 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 46 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
The following PK parameters will be determined, where data permit, using the actual recorded 
sampling times and non -compartmental method(s) with Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 6.2 or 
higher): C 0 (the concentration at the end of infusion), AUC last, AUC inf, C0/D, and AUC/D, based 
on the plasma concentration data.  
The linear trapezoidal rule will be used for AUC calculation. The terminal half -life of MAA868 
(T1/2), volume of distribution (V ss) and clearance (C L) will also be estimated, if feasib le, based on 
the data.  
7.14. Other assessments  
7.14.1.  Exploratory Biomarker assessments  
Biomarkers including, but not limited to, D -Dimer and biomarkers of thrombogenesis and 
coagulation may also be studied.  
The list may be changed or expanded further, as it is recogni zed that more relevant or novel 
biomarkers may be discovered during the conduct of the study.  
Sample(s) will be collected at the timepoint(s) defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions for sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment provided in the 
central lab manual. Detailed descriptions of the assays will be included in the Bioanalytical Data 
Reports.  
7.14.2.  Immunogenicity (IG)  
The IG samples  will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collect ion, 
numbering, processing, and shipment. See Section 7.1 5 regarding the potential use of residual 
samples.  
Immunogenicity analytical method(s)  
A ligand -binding assay will be used to detect anti -MAA868 antibodies. The analytical method will 
be described in  detail in the IG Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.15. Use of residual biological samples  
Residual blood samples may be used for another protocol specified endpoint.  
Any residual samples remaining after the protocol -defined analysis has been performed may be 
used fo r additional exploratory analysis. This may include but is not limited to using residual 
samples for protein binding, metabolite profiling, biomarkers of transporters or metabolic enzyme 
activity (such as 4 -beta-hydroxycholesterol levels) or other bioanaly tical purposes (e.g. cross 
check between different sites and/or stability assessment). Given the exploratory nature of the 
work, the analytical method used for those assessments may not be validated. As such, the results 
from this exploratory analysis will  not be included in the clinical study report.

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSES  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of 16 subjects per treatment dose cohort with a ratio of 3:1 for MAA868 and placebo 
treatment assignment is based on historic data consi derations. For example, if the observed 
proportion of patients in a cohort achieving target levels of inhibition is 11/12, the 90% confidence 
interval would be 0.[ADDRESS_413957] received one dose of study drug. Subjects 
will be analyzed based on t he actual treatment taken.  
PK/PD Analysis Set  will comprise all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and 
have at least one PK/PD assessment. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual treatment taken.  
8.3. General Considerations  
All efficacy analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set or Per Protocol Set and will be 
performed based on the assigned treatment arm at the randomization. Only descriptive statistics 
will be summarized, no statistical inference will be calculated in efficacy.  
Safety analysis will be performed using Safety  Set. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual 
treatment taken.  
PK and PD analysis will be based on PK/PD Analysis Set.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_249776] [n], mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum [min], and maximu m [max]. Categorical variable will be summarized 
using frequency [N] and percentage [%].  
8.4. Demographics and Baseline characteristics  
All baseline summaries will be based on the All Randomized Set and Full Analysis Set 
populations.  
Gender, race and ethnicity will be summarized using counts and percentages. Age, height (cm), 
and weight (kg) will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, SD, 
median, minimum [min], and maximum [max]). Age may be summarized by [CONTACT_335314] N and 
%. 
The listing of subjects with abnormal physical examination findings at screening will be presented. 
The number and percent of subjects with medical history events will be summarized. Vital signs 
Page 129 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 48 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
collected at screening (sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature and body 
weight) will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max).  
8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
Within each treatment cohort patients will be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_413958] will achieve a certain percentage FXI inhibition 
at trough (Day 91). The response rate per treatment group will be calculated by [CONTACT_335343]. The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement for Cohorts 1 and 2 are as 
follows  
Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subj ects at trough (Day 91).  
Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
The “on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analysis, where “on treatment” 
FXI leve l is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose 
regimens of MAA868 together with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals (CI) computed via the 
Clopper -Pearson exact binomial method.  
8.5.2.  Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90% at trough after the first and second dose ( Day 31 and Day 61) at 3 dose 
levels of MAA868. The analyses described for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the 
secondary efficacy variables as follows:  
• Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61.  
• Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly  or placebo):  at Day 31 and 61  
• Cohort 3 (MAA868 TBD mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61  
8.6. Safety Analysis  
The safety evaluation includes the analysis of bleeding events, AEs, major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, systemic arterial, and venous thromboe mbolism events, laboratory data, ECG, 
vital signs, hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, and development of anti -drug 
antibodies. All safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Set.  
8.6.1.  Adverse Events  
The Investigator’s verbatim term of  each AE will be mapped to system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) using the MedDRA dictionary.  
Page 130 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 49 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be of primary interest. The TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3592]; a subject will only be counted once per SOC and once per PT within 
a treatment. If a subject reports more than one AE with the same PT, the AE with the maximum 
severity will be presented. Subject counts and percentages and event counts will be presented for 
each treatment and to taled for all treatments for the following summaries:  
• All TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
• All TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]  
• All TEAEs by [CONTACT_8792]  
• TEAEs potentially related to study drug  
• TEAEs potentially related to study drug by [CONTACT_926]  
• TEAEs leading to discon tinuation of study drug  
• TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be reported for a selection of interested AE terms 
that are specific to Sponsor’s product and program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_221289].  
The AESIs for this study are defined as follows:  
1. TERM 1  
2. TERM 2  
Similarly, to the TEAE summary, the AESI will be summarized in the following:  
1. All AESIs  
2. Serious AESIs  
3. All AES Is by [CONTACT_926]  
4. All AESIs by [CONTACT_8792]  
5. AESIs leading to discontinuation of study drug  
6. AESIs leading to withdrawal from the study  
No statistical inference between the treatments will be performed on AEs.  
Listings will be presented b y subject for all TEAEs, AESIs, as well as for SAEs, TEAEs associated 
with outcome of death, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.  
8.6.2.  Bleeding Events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of major and CRNM bleeding 
events which occur on -treatment from the first dose of the study drug to the last dose of the study 
drug + [ADDRESS_413959] dose on 
Day 91. The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated bleeding events will be tabulated 
Page 131 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 50 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
based on ISTH definition by [CONTACT_335319]/or CRNM bleedings.  
Major bleeding events (Yes/No)  
CRNM bleeding events (Yes/No)  
Total bleeding events (Yes/No)  
If a subject has more than one bleeding event in each above category, the subject will be counted 
only once in the tabulation.  
The adjudicated outcome will be the basis for any interim and final analysis.  
8.6.3.  Major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromb oembolic events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events which occur on -treatment from the first dose 
of the study drug to the last dose of the study drug + [ADDRESS_413960] dose on Day 91.   
The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated events will be tabulated based on the 
outcomes adjudicated by [CONTACT_138559], and the ad judicated outcome will be the 
basis for any interim and final analysis.  
8.6.4.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory results in continuous values at each timepoint and for change from baseline 
will be displayed using summary statistics (n, mean, med ian, SD, minimum and maximum values).  
A laboratory value that is within the central laboratory’s reference range will be considered normal. 
A laboratory value that is outside the central laboratory’s normal range will be considered 
abnormal and will be fla gged as either high (H) or low (L). The number and percentage of subjects 
with abnormal laboratory values will be summarized for each scheduled visit. In addition, shift 
tables will be presented to display the shift in the normal range categories (L, norma l [N], H) from 
baseline to specified timepoint. Laboratory results in clinical significance will also be summarized 
in tabulation.  
All clinical laboratory data will be presented in listings. Baseline is defined as the result obtained 
prior to first adminis tration of study medication. Laboratory data will be summarized in SI units.  
8.6.5.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Pre-dose values, post -dose values, and the change from baseline in vital sign measurements (sitting 
diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperatu re and body weight) will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. 
The baseline value will be value just prior to first administration of study medication.  
8.6.6.  ECG Parameters  
The ECG measures (QTc -B, QTc -F, QT, RR, ventricular rate, PR, and QRS) will be listed and 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by 
[CONTACT_3148].  
Page [ADDRESS_413961] administration of study 
medication.  
8.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/sampling timepoint with 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. An 
exception to this is T max where median, minimum and maximum will be presented.  
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be treated as zero  in summary 
statistics and for PK parameter calculations. A geometric mean will not be reported if the dataset 
includes zero values.  
Individual total MAA868 plasma concentration data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148] (MAA868 arms 
only), subject, and visit/sampli ng timepoint. PK parameters will also be listed by [CONTACT_335321].  
8.8. Biomarkers  
Coagulation parameters, including free and total FXI, FXI:C, and immunogenicity will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_335322].  
8.9. Interim Analysis  
Safety and tolerability dat a (AEs, laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG data) will be 
evaluated from Cohort 1 by [CONTACT_1034]'s Medical Monitor  and Covance Lead Project Physician 
after approximately [ADDRESS_413962] an additional 14 days, safety, tolerabilit y, and other 
analyses will be evaluated.  
Additional IAs may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical study, 
the Sponsor’s clinical development projects in general or in case of any emergent safety concerns. 
The Investigator( s) may be included for decisions with regards to any unplanned IAs that address 
questions of subject safety.  
Unblinded IA results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] (or their designees).  
No further dissemination of interim results should occur, in particular  not with individuals 
involved in treating the study’s subjects or assessing clinical data (e.g. ECGs, symptoms) obtained 
in the study.  
8.10. Data Quality Assurance  
Site monitoring  
Page 133 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 52 
AFib  Protocol v0 2  Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Covance 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the Investigator(s) and their staff. During 
the study Covance employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the 
quality/integrity of the sites’ da ta. The monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, 
the progress of enrollment, and ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounte d 
for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during 
these visits.  
The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case 
and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335282] l records) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. 
All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject's file. The 
Investigator m ust also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed 
copy is given to the subject).  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the CRF entries. Covance monito ring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the eligibility criteria, documentation of SAEs, and 
the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of 
the consiste ncy of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific 
monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be 
disclosed.  
Data collection  
Designated Investigator staff will enter the data r equired by [CONTACT_335323] 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. 
Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system until they ha ve been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies 
and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before 
transfer of the data to Covance working on behalf of Anthos. The Investigator must  certify that the 
data entered into the Electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, 
the Investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_109002].  
Data not requiring a separate written r ecord are noted on the Assessment schedule ( Table 9) and 
can be recorded directly on the CRF. All other data captured for this study will have an external 
originating source (either written or electronic) with the CRF not being considered as source.  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation and verification.  
Database management and quality con trol 
Covance will review the data entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_335344]. Queries are 
sent to the investigational site using an electronic d ata query. Designated investigator site staff is 
required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. Site personnel will complete and 
sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Covance who will make the correction to the database. The 
signed copy  of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site.  
Page [ADDRESS_413963], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical 
history/current me dical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary 
for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology.  
Laboratory samples will be processed centrally, and the results will be sent electronically to 
Covance.  
At the conclusion of the study, the occurrence of any emergency code breaks will be determined 
after return of all code break reports and unused drug supplies to Covance.  
The occurrence of any protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been 
completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, and 
the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the 
database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_335345] A nthos Head of 
Regulatory and the Chief Medical Officer.

make specimen slides available for evaluation by [CONTACT_335330] t o potentially identify project -wide patterns of 
nephrotoxicity.)  
Whenever a renal event is identified, a detailed subject history and examination are indicated to identify, 
document and potentially eliminate risk factors that may have initiated or contribu ted to the event:  
• Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_413974], with an appropriate cuff size)  
• Signs and symptoms such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, back or abdominal pain, dysuria, 
hematuria, dependent or periorbital edema  
• Changes in blood press ure, body weight, fluid intake, voiding pattern, or urine output  
• Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures, cardiac or hepatic failure, 
contrast media or other known nephrotoxin administration, or other potential causes of renal 
dysfunction, e.g., dehydration, hemorrhage, tumor lysis

12.3. Appendix 3 - Clinical notable laboratory values  
Clinical no table laboratory values : 
The definition, the specific alert criteria and the corresponding actions for hepatic and renal notable 
laboratory abnormalities are respectively provided in Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 . 
The following laboratory values are considered clinically notable and should be forwarded to 
Covance at the same time that they are sent to Investigators:  
•A change from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dL
•A decrease from baseline in platelets count ≥ 50% or < 100 x 10 9/L
•A positive fecal occult blood test
•Macroscopic hematuria
Whenever a clinically notable laboratory value is identified, a detailed subject history and 
examination are indicated to identify, document and potentially eliminate a bleeding event:  
•Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_413975], with an appropriate cuff size);
•Signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, hematemesis,
rectorrhagia, melena, gingival or nose bleeding, b ruising and hematoma;
•Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures.
When one of the above occurs the action plan is as follows:  
•Confirm the value, assess and document the clinically notable laboratory value in the CRF 
or via electronic data load;
•Investigate the underlying causes such as clinical or subclinical bleeding event and the contributing factors such as intake of prohibited medications;
•Monitor subject regularly (frequency at Investigator’s discretion) until resolution or stabilization. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], additional laboratory tests, endoscopy, volume replacement, transfusion, etc. should be performed at the Investigator’s discretion and according to the medical needs (see Section 6.3 for reversal therapy).

Statistical methods:  
The patients will be enrolled into cohorts of approximately 16 patients with each cohort 
evaluating a different dose level of MAA868.  Within each cohort, patients will be randomized 
3:[ADDRESS_413987] will achieve pre-defined  degrees of  FXI 
inhibition at trough (Day 91). The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement are as 
follow s:  
Low -dose cohort  (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
High dose cohort  (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI 
inhibition in 90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
The “ on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analysis, where “on treatment” 
FXI level is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The response rate per treatment group will be calcul ated by [CONTACT_335290]. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose regimens 
of MAA868 together with 2 -sided 90 % confidence intervals.  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90 % at trough after the first and second dose (Day 31 and Day 61) at multiple  
dose levels of MAA868. The analyses d escribed for the primary endpoint will be repeated for 
the secondary efficacy variables.  
Safety data including adverse events (AEs) , bleeding events, ECG, vital signs , thromboembolic 
events  and laboratory results will be reported by [CONTACT_335291].  
Page [ADDRESS_413988] more than 6 million 
patients in Europe and approxim ately 2.3 million in the [LOCATION_002], and this number continues 
to grow rapi[INVESTIGATOR_335260] -
morbidities. As such, the prevalence of AF is expected to increase 2 - to 3-fold over the follo wing 
3 decades in western populations ( Kannel and Benjamin 2008 ). 
AF is associated with a 4 - to 5-fold increase in embolic stroke. The risk for stroke associated with 
AF increases steeply with age to 23.5% for patients aged 80 to 89 years ( Kannel and Benjamin 
2008 ). Most patients with AF require life -long anticoagulation therapy to prevent cardioembolic 
stroke and systemic embolism. It is estimated that 85 to 90% of AF patients will require 
anticoagulation  therapy ( Camm et al 2012 ). 
Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, are effective in reducing stroke and systemic 
thromboembolism; a highly significant relative risk reduction in stroke incidence by 67% was 
observed in a meta -analysis combining six studies ( Hart et al 1999 ). All -cause mortality was 
reduced (26%) significantly by [CONTACT_335292]. control ( Hart et al 1999 ). In recent years, direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOACs) medications have been approved and introduced to clinical practice. These 
drugs are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and may be 
superior to warfarin in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage ( Connolly et al  
2009 , Granger et al 2011 , Patel et al 2011 ). The incidence of m ajor bleeding events  with DOACs 
was similar or slightly lower than the incidence observed with well -conducted warfarin therapy. 
Nonetheless, the overall bleeding risk continues to be high with the use of DOACs. For instance, 
the annual incidence of major and clinically releva nt non -major (CRNM) bleeding was 14.9% and 
the annual incidence of major bleeding events was 3.6% in patients treated with rivaroxaban in the 
ROCKET AF study ( Patel et al 2011 ). It is notable that the occurrence of major bleeding w as 
strongly associated with mortality. In the same study, the rate of all -cause mortality over the 2 -
month period following a major bleeding event was 20.4% in the rivaroxaban group and 26.1% in 
the warfarin group ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335261] 2014 ). Thus, there is a high unmet medical need for an 
anticoagulant therapy that can effectively reduce the risk of AF -related thromboembolic 
complications such as stroke but with a lower risk of bleeding than currently employed 
anticoagulants.  
FXI is an emerging target for potentially safer and more effective anticoagulant medications. FXI 
holds important roles in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways and in bridging the 
initiation and amplification phases of plasmatic hemostasis ( Gailani and Renné 2007 ). Both Factor 
XII and thrombin can activate FXI, resulting in a sustained thrombin generation and fibrinolysis 
inhibition. FXI plays a minor role in normal hemostasis in a high tissue factor environment “after 
vessel injury” whereas it appears to play a key role in thrombosis. Severe FXI deficiency is 
associated with a lower incidence of ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolic events ( Salomon 
et al 2008 , Salomon et al 2011 , Preis et al 2017 ). Nevertheless, bleeding manifestations in subjects 
with severe FXI deficiency are infrequent and usually mild. Bleeding events that occur are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_335262] -related and preferentially affec t tissues known to have increased fibrinolytic 
Page [ADDRESS_413989] ( Bolton -Maggs 2000 ). Bleeding in 
vital organs is extremely rare or non -existent.  
MAA868  
MAA868 is a human antibody that binds to the catalytic domain of FXI. MAA868 binds to both 
the zymogen (FXI) and activated factor XI (FXIa) with high potency. MAA868 dose -dependently 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in in -vitro and in -vivo studies. After a 
single subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of MAA868 at a 3 mg/kg dose, sustained anticoagulant 
activity lasting for more than one month was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, 
MAA868 prevented experimental carotid artery thrombosis induced by [CONTACT_335293]3 and r esulted in a 
prolongation in aPTT in FXI -/- mice reconstituted with human FXI. No significant toxicity 
findings were observed in single dose and in the 13 -week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -
compliant toxicity study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. The hig hest s.c. dose administered 
in the [ADDRESS_413990] level NOAEL (100 mg/kg/week 
s.c.).  
MAA868 was evaluated in a first -in-human (FIH) study (CMAA868X2101) to characterize its 
safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy subjects 
following single s.c. administration. In total, 6 cohorts with 10 subjects each (8 MAA868: 2 
Placebo) were enrolled. The doses of MAA868 administered in Cohorts 1 to 5 ranged from 5  mg 
to 240 mg. In a sixth co hort, 240 mg of MAA868 was administered to subjects with body mass 
index (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2). 
In the FIH study, MAA868 appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and the incidence of AEs were 
comparable across dose groups and placebo. No bleeding events, hyperse nsitivity reactions or 
injection site reactions were reported. Exposure increased with increasing dose of s.c. MAA868; 
the median maximum observed concentration (C max) occurred on Day 7 to 21 and the mean 
terminal elimination half -life ranged from 20 to 28  days. A dose and time -dependent prolongation 
of aPTT occurred with MAA868 after single s.c. administration; the 150 mg dose resulted in a 
mean aPTT prolongation ≥ [ADDRESS_413991] and sustained 
reductions of free FXI ≥ 90% were observed with [ADDRESS_413992] - and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, non -confirmatory study to assess safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD. Three cohorts (MAA868 dose levels: 15, 50 and 150 mg) were enrolled 
in this study and received a single s.c. dose of MAA868 or matching placebo (8 subjects received 
MAA868 and 2 subjects received placebo in each cohort). Assessments and assessment schedules 
were generally similar to the FIH study.  No SAE or study discontinuation d ue to AEs were reported 
in this study. All AEs were mild in intensity and the distribution of AEs was well balanced between 
the MAA868 dose groups and placebo. No bleeding event, hypersensitivity or injection site 
reactions were reported in the study.  PK a nalysis suggested that t here was no indication of an 
impact of the Japanese ethnicity on exposure or PD parameters  of MAA868  in healthy subjects.

body weight or class 1 obesity (BMI <35 kg/m 2). In subjects with class 2 or 3 obesity (BMI ≥35 
kg/m 2), exposures of MAA868 may be lower and the duration of aPTT prolongation is shorter.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
This study is a multicenter, randomized, subject and Investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, multiple ascending dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and 
PD effects of MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter  at low risk of thromboembolic stroke  or 
peripheral  embolism . The trial will evaluate the effects of up to three different doses of MAA868 
on FXI inhibition, indices of coagulation, and thrombogenesis biomarkers compared to placebo. 
The incidence of injection site reactions, bleeding events, immunogenicity , and systemic arterial 
and venous thromboembolic events will also be assessed. Results from this study will assist with 
dose-selection of MAA868 for a phase [ADDRESS_413994] a lower risk of VTE even though their bleeding phenotype is variable and often quite mild. Further support of the safety of inhibiting FXI comes from clinical studies using an investigational FXI antisense oligonucleotide (FXI-A SO) where administration of FXI-A SOs in 
healthy subjects and in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated ( Buller et al 2015 ). 
Results from the first-i n-human (FIH) study of MAA868 (CMAA868X2101) demonstrated that a 
single s.c. administration of MAA868 at increasing doses up to [ADDRESS_413995] and sustained FXI inhibition and prolongation of aPTT. The safety and pharmacodynamic efficacy of MAA868 was further supported by [CONTACT_335331]868A1101, which showed a good safety profile of MAA868 in Japanese heathy male subjects. 
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of achieving different levels of FXI 
inhibition with different dose levels of s.c. MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter. This study will recruit patients with AF or flutter who are judged by [CONTACT_335347]. In each case, patients will only be enrolled if their physician has 
determined that the patient does not merit anticoagulation based on the guidelines and the physician’s assessment of the benefit-risk profile for that patient. The guidelines state that the benefits of anticoagulation in AF patients at low risk of embolic stroke are uncertain given the 
concomitant risks of bleeding with anticoagulant therapy. Accordingly, the guidelines recommend individualized shared physician-patient decision-making with regards to the decision to initiate anticoagulant therapy in this population (January et al 2019).  Patients with PAF will be enrolled who have a CHA2DS2-VASc risk score of 0-1 for men or 1-2 for women, in whom the guidelines

AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
are equivocal regarding the recommendation to initiate anticoagulation and advise a n 
individualized assessment of the benefit -risk of anticoagulation (January et al 2019 ).  
Overall, the nonclinical and clinical data to date support the investigation of MAA868 in the 
prevention of thromboembolic diseases in pati ents with AF. The risk -benefit relationship appears 
to be acceptable.

Page [ADDRESS_413996] - and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, multiple 
ascending dose-ranging  study  to assess the PK/PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
MAA868 in patients with AF or flutter.  
Patients will be enrolled in at least 2 and up to 3 cohorts of approximately 16 patients each  for a 
total of up t o 48 subjects ( Figure 1A). Patients in cohort 1 will be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_413997] . Cohort 2 will be initiated after it is confirmed by [CONTACT_429]’s Medical Monitor and the Covance Lead Project Physician that the cohort [ADDRESS_413998] to:  
• Enroll cohort 3 to evaluate a higher, lower, or a previously studied dose of MAA868  
• Terminate the study  
The study is comprised of 3 periods:  
(1) Screening period of up to 4 weeks  
(2) Treatment period with MAA868 administered s.c. monthly (or matching placebo) 
(randomized 3:1) fo r 90 days 
(3) Follow -up period up to end of study (Day 170).  
Following the screening period of up to 4 weeks, all patients that meet the study eligibility criteria 
(Section 4.1 and Section 4.2) will have baseline efficacy and safety assessments performed on Day 
1 and then randomized to active or placebo ( Figure 1B ). 
Figure 1: Overall study design  
 
The first dose of study drug  will be administered  at the study center on Day 1. The second and 
third doses of study drug will also be administered at the study center to patients on the Day 31 
visit and Day 61  visit, respectively.  
Page 168 of 212

AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
During the treatment period, patients will return to the study center on Day 11, Day 31, Day 41, 
Day 61, Day 71, and Day 91 for safety assessments such as vital signs, AE  assessment s, laboratory 
tests, PK, PD, thrombogenesis biomarkers, and other study assessments according to the 
assessment schedule shown in Table 9. 
During the follow -up period, patients will continue to be followed for PK, PD, thrombogenesis, 
and other study assessments. Patients will return to the study center on Day 101, Day 121 and Day 
170 (end of study; EoS)  for the evaluations de scribed in the assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Rationale for route of administration and treatment duration . The s.c. route of administration 
was chosen because it is the route of administration anticipated for subsequent studies in patients 
with AF. In the FIH study of MAA868, the half -life of MAA868 ranged from [ADDRESS_413999]  of >2-fold mean  activated partial 
thromboplastin time [ aPTT ] prolongation w as observed for ~30 days and returned to the baseline 
level by ~[ADDRESS_414000] -dose after a  single 150 mg s.c. dose administration in study X2101.  These 
data support monthly administration of MAA868. Furthermore, a ssessment of the exposure -
response relationship of MAA868 in healthy subjects demonstrated  a nearly flat exposure -response 
for relevant PD parameters (aPTT, FXI  coagulation activ ity and free F XI) at concentrations above 
4 μg/mL which is consistent with the Day 29 total MAA868 concentrations achieved with the 150 
mg single dose administration in healthy subjects (CMAA868X2101).  
Given the half -life of MAA868 and the observed time to  return to baseline aPTT levels, a 
prolonged washout/ follow -up period of approximately [ADDRESS_414001] and sustained dose -dependent inhibition of FXI and 
relevant prolongation of aPTT for approximately 4 weeks. MAA868 doses greater than 150 mg 
s.c. produced a sustained  ~2-fold prolongation of aPTT for greater than [ADDRESS_414002] remains 
unknown. The primary  efficacy endpoint of this study will be the number of patients who achieve  
≥ 50%, ≥ 80%, or ≥ 90% FXI inhibition [<50%, <20%, or 10% free FXI] at trough  on Day 91 
following s.c. administration of MAA868 . Based on preliminary PK/PD modeling, the doses 
selected for cohorts 1 and 2 are projected to target the following levels of FXI in hibition : 
• Cohort 1 (120 mg dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects at trough (Day  91).  
• Cohort 2 (180 mg dose group). Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 90% of 
subjects at trough (Day  91). 
Based on interim data, an optional cohort 3 may be dosed to add further data to the PK/PD model 
which will inform dose selection of MAA868 for subsequent studies.  
The dosing regimens selected for evaluation in this study are projected to result in exposur e (C max) 
below the C max achieved with a single dose of [ADDRESS_414003] be obtained before any assessment is performed

their time in the study. Highly effective contraception methods include:  
• Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptotherma l, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception  
• Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without

4.3. Discontinuation Criteria  
4.3.1.  Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently  randomized . A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidat ed Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Patients  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may be rescreened.  
4.3.2.  Withdrawal of informed consent  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from  the study for any reason at any time.  
Withdrawal from the study can occur  when a subject  chooses to do on e or more of the following : 
• Does not want to participate in the study anymore  
• Does not want any further visits or assessments  
• Does not want any further study -related contacts  
• Does not allow analysis of already obtained biologic material.  
If a subject who has received one or more doses or the study drug determines that they no longer 
want to participate the Investigator must make every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to 
determine the primary reason (s) for the subject’s decision to w ithdraw his/her consent , record this 
information and conduct any assessments and visits still allowed.  
In the event the subject withdraws consent prior to beginning dosing, the study treatment will not 
be administered. The data that would have been collect ed at subsequent visits will be considered 
missing. Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_335296] -
up. 
4.3.3.  Lost to Follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stat ing an 
intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_335297], e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered 
letters, etc. A subject cannot be formally consid ered lost to follow -up until his/her scheduled end 
of study visit would have occurred.  
4.4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_335264]:  
Enrollment in the study will be placed on hold if the Sponsor considers that the number and/or 
severity of AEs, abnormal saf ety monitoring tests or abnormal laboratory findings justify putting 
the study on hold.  
Page 172 of 212

5.2. Preparation, Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
Details on the requirements for storage and management of study treatment, and instructions to be 
followed for subject numbering, prescribing/dispensing and administering study treatment are 
outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
MAA [ADDRESS_414009] vials should be stored refrigerated at 2° - 8°C and protected from light. A 
disposable syringe will be used to administer the s.c. injection.  
The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the study treatment. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study 
treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study  treatment. The 
Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for 
study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, 
and final disposition records).  
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided 
in the Pharmacy Manual.

5.3. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomized to MAA868 or placebo in a ratio of 12: 4 as follows.  
• Cohort  1 = 120 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 2 = 180 mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
• Cohort 3 (if necessary) = TBD mg MAA868 monthly s.c. or placebo  
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible subjects. The 
Investigator will enter the randomization number on the CRF.  
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that 
treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A 
rando mization list will be produced by [CONTACT_335334] a validated system that automates the random assignment of treatment arms to 
randomization numbers in the specified ratio. The randomization scheme for su bjects will be 
reviewed and approved by a member of the Covance IIS Randomization Group.  
Patients will be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion. Replacement subjects will be assigned 
randomization numbers [ADDRESS_414010] (e.g., Subject [ADDRESS_414011] 1103).  
The table below provides the general details of the numbering of the subjects for randomization:  
Table 2: Randomization Assignment Numbering  
Cohort  Randomization numbers  Replacement randomization numbers  
I [ADDRESS_414012] or pharmacy designee, all site staff (including 
study investigator and study nurse(s)) will be blinded to study treatment during treatment 
allocation and subject dosing. Appropriate measures must be taken by [CONTACT_335299].  
Unblinding a single subject at the site for safety re asons (necessary for subject management) will 
occur via an emergency system in place at the site (see Section 5.10). 
Site staff may also be unblinded to the treatmen t assignment of one or more subjects (within a 
single cohort or across cohorts as necessary), or an entire cohort at the initial cohort safety

evaluation timepoint if deemed appropriate to aid decision -making. The decision to un -blind site 
staff will be de termined by [CONTACT_335300] a pre -selected time.  
Sponsor staff  
The following unblinded Sponsor roles (or designee) are required for this study:  
• Field monitor(s)  
• Physician not di rectly involved study conduct  
• Sample analyst(s) (PK blood)  
• Study statistician  
• Programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis  
An unblinded Covance Physician not directly involved in study conduct may receive a copy of the 
randomization schedule (via request to the Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of aPTT 
safety labs that would otherwise unblind study Investigators. The unblinded Medical Monitor will 
alert the Investigator and Sponsor of any safety concerns.  
The sample analysts will receive a copy of the randomization schedule (via request to the 
Randomization Office), to facilitate analysis of the samples. The sample analysts will provide the 
sample data to the study team under blinded conditions unless otherwis e allowed.  
The study statistician will be able to access the full randomization list from the start of the study 
and is allowed to share unblinded information with the rest of the clinical trial team as appropriate 
for internal decision purposes. For examp le, unblinded summaries and unblinded individual data 
can be shared with the team whenever necessary.  
Study programmers and other personnel involved in study data analysis (e.g. biomarker expert, 
pharmacometrician, modeler(s)) are allowed to access treatm ent assignment information from the 
start of the study for the purpose of data analysis.  
The clinical trial team is allowed to share unblinded results with other Sponsor staff (e.g. decision 
boards) as required for internal decision making on the study or the project while the study is 
ongoing.  
All unblinded personnel will otherwise keep randomization lists and data or information that could 
un-blind other study team members confidential and secure except as described above.  
Following final database lock all roles may be considered unblinded.  
5.5. Treating the subject  
MAA868 will be administered to the subject by [CONTACT_198930] s.c. administration. See the 
Pharmacy Manual for further details.  
Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be readily available to adv ise on trial related medical 
questions or problems.  
Page [ADDRESS_414013] related assessments collected as per 
the Schedule of assessments ( Table 9). All SAEs reported during this time p eriod must be reported 
as described in Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_414014] should be recorded in the sourc e documentation.  
5.8. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The Investigator may decide to suspend the s.c. administration of the study drug if symptoms or 
signs consistent with an injection site reaction or hypersensitivity reaction occur.  
Subjects who decide th ey do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered 
withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section 4.3.2 , Withdraw of 
Informed Consent). Where possible, they should return for the EoS assessments indicated in the 
assessment table. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. 
telephone, e -mail, letter) should be made to  contact [CONTACT_423]/pre -designated contact [CONTACT_335335] 4.3.3  (Lost to follow -up). This contact [CONTACT_335348].  
5.9. Study Termination  
The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_335303]. This may include reasons 
related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study, practical reasons (including 
slow enrollment), or for regulatory or m edical reasons. Should this be necessary, subjects must be 
seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject and followed until the 
aPTT has returned to baseline. The Investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followe d in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s 
interests. The Investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of the early termination of the trial.  
5.10. Emergency breaking of ass igned treatment code  
Emergency unblinding must only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject safely and 
efficaciously, such as in the event of clinically significant bleeding events. Most often, knowledge 
of the possible treatment assignment s is sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an 
emergency condition. A complete set of emergency code break cards will be provided to the 
Investigator site(s) and a complete set will be available at Anthos and Covance. All code break 
cards mu st be retained until the end of the study and retained by [CONTACT_261860] a source document. 
Page [ADDRESS_414015]. In an 
emergency, the code break may be opened to determine the treatment. There is no known reversal 
agent for MAA868 (see Section 6.2).  
The c ode break should not be opened for any reason other than an emergency. If the Investigator 
opened the code break, he/she must note the date, time, and reason for removing it and retain this 
information with the case report form documentation. The unblinded  treatment code must not be 
recorded on the CRF. The Investigator must also immediately inform the study monitor that the 
code has been broken.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to 
allow access  to the code break cards at any time in case of emergency. The Investigator will need 
to provide:  
• Protocol number  
• Study drug name (if available)  
• Subject number.  
In addition, the Investigator must provide oral and written information to inform the subject how 
to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable to ensure that un 
blinding can be performed at any time .

(including nutritional supplements and herbal medications) that he/she takes after being enrolled 
into the study.  
All prescription medications, OTC drugs and significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy and blood transfu sions) administered or taken within the timeframe defined in the entry 
criteria prior to the start of the study and during the study, must be recorded on the Concomitant 
medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_50061].  
Medication entries should be specific to trade name, the single dose and unit, the frequency and 
route of administration, the start and discontinuation date and the reason for therapy.  
Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited 
medication. If in doubt, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_335304] a subject or, 
if the subject is already enrolled, to determine if the subject should continue participation in the 
study.  
During the study, in the event the Investigator elects to start t he patient on chronic antithrombotic 
therapy, anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy should not be started until the patient’s aPTT has 
returned to baseline.  
Reporting medication errors including misuse/abuse  
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient/subject or 
consumer (EMA definition).  
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappro priately used 
not in accordance with the protocol.  
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
All study treatment errors and uses out side of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the Dose Administration Record CRF. Study treatment errors are only to be reported to Covance 
DSS department if the treatment error is associated with an SAE.  
All instances of misuse or abuse mu st be documented in the AE CRF irrespective of the 
misuse/abuse being associated with an AE/SAE. In addition, all instances of misuse or abuse must 
be reported to the Covance DSS department. As such, instances of misuse or abuse are also to be 
reported usi ng the SAE form/CRF.

Prohibited treatment 
Use of the  following  medications  is not allowed  during  the course  of the study  from  screening 
(Visit  1) through  the EoS.  Patients  who are receiving  such medication(s)  will be excluded,  or if 
ethically  and clinically  justified,  the medication(s)  should  be gradually  withdrawn  at least seven 
days before the baseline visit: 
•Use of chronic antiplatelet agents such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_335280]; however,
use of low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤100 mg per day) is permitted.
•Use of chronic systemic anticoagulants such as warfarin, low molecular weight heparin or
heparinoids, or direct oral anticoagulants such as api[INVESTIGATOR_335266]. Patients may be
started on chronic anticoagulation d uring the Washout/Follow -up period once their aPTT
has returned to baseline, at the Investigator’s discretion.
•Use of any therapeutic monoclonal antibody regardless of the indication during the study.
Dietary restrictions 
•No alcohol for 48 hours before ea ch clinic visit (from Screening through the EoS visit).
During the study, alcohol consumption will be restricted to no more than 2 drinks/day for
males and 1 drink/day for females.
•Patients should not make significant alterations in their diet (e.g., going  on weight loss diet)
while in the study.
•During the study, caffeinated beverages will be restricted to no more than 3 cups/day.
Other restrictions  
No strenuous physical exercise or activities which have an increased risk of injury or falling should 
be und ertaken until after the EoS visit.

6.3. Reversal medication  
There is currently no specific antidote for MAA868. FXI concentrates (not marketed in the US) 
are unlikely to be effective as the excess in free MAA868 concentrations in the circulation is 
expected to quickly neutralize the exogenous FXI.  
Recombinant FVIIa can by[CONTACT_335305]. Administration of intermediate to high doses of rFVIIa (40 to 90 μg/kg) 
resulted in supra -physiological l evels of FVII and thromboembolic complications in patients with 
severe FXI deficiency ( Riddell et al 2011 ). Low doses of rFVIIa are associated with lower 
prothrombotic risk. Riddell et al reported their experience in 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency 
undergoing surgery ( Riddell et al 2011 ); patients were administered rFVIIa 30 μg/kg and 
tranexamic acid 1 g i.v. at induction of anesthesia. Subsequent bolus doses of rFVIIa 15 –30 μg/kg 
were ad ministered at 2 to 4 hourly intervals as guided by [CONTACT_335306] 24 48 
hours and tranexamic acid 1 g every 6 hourly for 5 days. Low doses of rFVIIa and tranexamic acid 
were safe and effective in restoring hemostasis in severe FXI defici ency in this study. In another 
study comprising 4 patients with severe FXI deficiency with inhibitor who experienced 5 surgeries 
(Livnat et al 2009 ), [ADDRESS_414018] 7 days; moreover, rFVIIa was administered at doses 
ranging from 15 to 30 μg/kg at the completion of surgery. This protocol secured normal hemostasis 
in patients with severe FXI deficiency with inhibitor.  
Based  on the above, rFVIIa can be recommended as a preferred therapeutic option to restore 
hemostasis in subjects with active, non -accessible bleeding site and in subjects requiring 
immediate reversal of the MAA868 PD effects prior to an urgent surgery.  Please  see the 
Investigator’s Brochure - Summary of the data and guidance for the investigator for a more 
complete discussion.

7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Assessment schedule  
Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment s chedule ( Table 9).  
Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be sc heduled for a visit as soon as 
possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the study treatment discontinuation (TD) 
visit will be performed. At the TD visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, 
and the AE and concomita nt medications recorded on the CRF.  
7.2. Informed consent procedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB -approved informed consent.  
The Sponsor, or Sponsor designee, w ill provide to investigators a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the ICHE6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline and regulatory requirements 
and is considered appropriate for this study. The informed consent form will also include a sectio n 
related to optional future research which will require a separate signature [CONTACT_335354]. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_335338].  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the IB. This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be 
discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new informat ion regarding the safety 
profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as 
appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safety Finding. New 
information might require an update to  the informed consent and then must be discussed with the 
subject.  
Ensure subjects are informed of the contraception requirements outlined in the Section 4.2 
(Exclusi on criteria).  
A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to the Covance monitor 
after IRB approval.  
7.3. Subject screenin g 
In general, it is permissible to re -screen a subject if s/he fails the initial Screening or falls out of 
the screening window timelines; however, each case must be discussed and agreed with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor on a case -by-case basis. A new screening number will be assigned to a 
subject who is re screened, thus no screening number will be used twice.  
Reas ons for screen failure will be documented in the site log.  
7.4. Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristic data will be collected on all subjects. Relevant 
medical history/current medical conditions data will also be collected until signature [CONTACT_62686].  
Page [ADDRESS_414019] and drug screening  
All subjects will be screened for alcohol and substances of abuse.  
7.5. Efficacy Assessments  
The PD samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing  and shipment.  
In order to better define the PD profile, the timing of the sample collection may be altered based 
on emergent data. The number of samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected will not 
exceed those stated in the protocol.  
PD samples will be obtained and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels.  
7.5.1.  Free FXI  
Free FXI concentrations (FXI that is not bound to MAA868) will be measured in plasma. A 
detailed description of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.2.  aPTT  
aPTT, calibrated for FXI deficiency, and aPTT using a standard laboratory protocol will be 
measured at all timepoints indicated in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
aPTT will be determined in plasma. The detailed method descriptions of the assay will be included 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.3.  Total FXI  
Total FXI concentrations (FXI that is either bound to MAA868 or free) will be measured in plasma. 
A detailed d escription of the assay methods will be included in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.5.4.  FXI coagulation activity (FXI:C)  
FXI:C will be measured in plasma. A detailed description of the assay methods will be included 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report . 
7.6. Safety Asse ssments  
Safety assessments are specified below; assessments will be collected as specified in the 
Assessment Schedule ( Table 9). 
Bleeding  
All suspected bleeding events w ill be documented by [CONTACT_335308]. All 
suspected bleeding events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_335349] 184 of 212

AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
treatment assignment. Adjudication of bleeding events will be performed in accordance with t he 
International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition of a major bleeding in 
non-surgical patients ( Schulman et al 2005 ) and criteria for clinically -relevant non -major bleeding 
(CRNM) events. The definitions of bleedings are as follows:  
Major bleeding events include:  
• Fatal bleeding, and/or  
• Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra ‐articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or  
• Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more or leading to 
transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells.  
CRNMs (clinically relevant non -major) bleeding events wi ll be defined as clinically overt bleeding 
that did not satisfy the criteria for major bleeding and that led to:  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or  
• physician -guided medical treatment, or  
• surgical treatment or  
• change in antithrombotic therapy  
In addition to the ISTH de finition of bleeding events other definitions such as TIMI, BARC,  
GUSTO, etc. can be used as supportive for exploratory safety analyses.  
The population is those who have received at least one dose of the study drug.  
 
Major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events  
All suspected major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and VTE events will be documented by [CONTACT_335309]. For instance, any suspec ted epi[INVESTIGATOR_184395] (i.e., swelling, localized pain, redness, heat, 
localized warmth) must be documented by [CONTACT_49734] (CUS) or venography.  
Any suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_335267] (i.e., shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, tachycardia, 
hemoptysis,  hemodynamic compromise, unexplained death) must be documented by 
[CONTACT_302796]/perfusion lung scintigraphy, spi[INVESTIGATOR_85004] (sCT), or pulmonary 
angiography.  
All major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, systemic arterial, and venous thromboembolic e vents 
(VTEs) including deaths for which a major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or VTE event could 
not be ruled out will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_335310].  
The adjudicated outcome will be the basis for  any interim and final safety evaluations.  
Page [ADDRESS_414020] medical occurrence [i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or disease] in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the EoS visit. 
Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
In addition, all reports of intentional misu se and abuse of the study treatment are also considered 
an AE irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. See Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_414021] one of the 
following criteria:  
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  
• they req uire therapy.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to  be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_335268]. 
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and identifying 
AEs. Alert ranges for liver and kidney related events are included in Appendix [ADDRESS_414022] be recorded on the AE CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with 
them, and a ccompanied by [CONTACT_6644]:  
1. Severity grade  
• mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• severe: prevents normal activities  
2. Relationship to the study treatment  
• Related  
• Possibly related  
• Not related  
3. Duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved 
must be reported.

AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
4. Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 7.6.2  for definition of SAE) and which seriousness 
criteria have been met  
5. Action taken regarding investigational treatment.  
All AEs must be treated appropriately. Treatment may in clude one or more of the following:  
• no action taken (e.g. further observation only)  
• concomitant medication or non -drug therapy given  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see  Section 7.6.2  for definition of SAE)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown).  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the IB. Once an AE is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the investigational drug, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outcome.  
The Investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new AE (beyond the protocol 
observation period) that the subject, or the subject ’s personal physician, believes might reasonably 
be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the Investigator’s source 
documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Covance.  
7.6.2.  Reporting Serious Adv erse Events  
Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any AE [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable 
sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)] which meets any one of the following criteria:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existin g condition and has not worsened 
since the start of study drug  
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_335281]’s 
general condition  
o is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention  
Page 187 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 41 
AFib  Protocol v01  Protocol No. ANT -004 
All malignant neoplasms will be assesse d as serious unde r “medicall y significant” i f other 
seriousness criteria are not met. 
Life-threatening  in the context  of a SAE  refers  to a reaction  in which  the subject  was at risk of 
death  at the time of the  reaction;  it does not refer  to a reaction  that hypothetically  might  have 
caused death if it were more severe (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening  or result  in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335287].  Examples of such events 
are intensive  treatment  in an emergency  room  or at  home  for allergic  bronchospasm,  blood 
dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335288] (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). 
Any suspecte d transmissi on via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is als o considere d a 
serious adverse reaction. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) are captured on the CRF; SAEs also require individual 
reporting to Covance Drug Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) as per Section 0. 
SAE Reporting 
To ensure  subject  safety,  every  SAE,  regardless  of causality,  occurring  after the subject  has 
provided  informed  consent  and until [ADDRESS_414023]  be 
reported to Covance within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence as described below. Any SAEs 
experienced  after this period  should  only be reported  to Covance  if the Investigator  suspects  a 
causal relationship to study treatment. 
Note: SAEs reporte d by [CONTACT_335350] d to be scree n failures must be reporte d to Covance as 
outlined here with appropriate informati on also captured in the CRFs. 
All follow-up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the 
initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537]-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] [ADDRESS_414024] describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated,  whether  the blind  was broken  or not (if applicable)  and whether  the subject 
continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB (new occurrence) and is thought to be related 
to the study treatment a Covance DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the Investigator  for Health  Authority  reporting.  Covance  may need to issue  an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected  and reported  to the competent  authorities  and relevant  ethics  committees  in 
accordance  with EU Guidance  2011/C  172/01  or as per national  regulatory  requirements  in 
participating countries. 
Page 188 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics  Page 42 
AFib  Protocol v01  Protocol No. ANT -004 
Follow the detailed instructions outlined in the Safety Management Plan regarding the submission 
process for reporting SAEs to Covance. Note: SAEs must be reported to Covance within 24  hours 
of the Investigator learning of its occurrence/receiving follow -up information.  
7.7. Liver safety monitoring  
To ensure subject safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an 
investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver 
events must be followed.  
Please refer to Appendix 1  for complete definitions of liver events.  
Follow -up of liver events  
Every liver event defined in  Appendix 1   should be followed up by [CONTACT_335312], as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of 
liver events are outlined in Table 4 of Appendix 1.  
•Repeating liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), PT/INR, ALP and γGT)
to confirm elevation within [ADDRESS_414025] results reported on the unscheduled local laboratory CRF.
•If the initial elevation is confirmed, close obse rvation of the subject will be initiated,
including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate.
•Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to Section 4.3 (Discontinuation of study
treatment), if appropriate
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131539]
•Causality assessment of the liver event
•Thorough follow -up of the liver event should include
oRepeating liver chemistry tests two or three ti mes weekly. Testing should include
ALT, AST, ALP, PT/INR, and γGT. If total bilirubin is elevated > [ADDRESS_414026] is
asymptomatic. Retesting should be continued up to resolution.
oObtaining a more deta iled history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.
oObtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use,
recreational drug use, and special diets.
Page [ADDRESS_414027] pregnancy testing. See the Assessment Schedule ( Table 9), 
for timing of the protocol required pregnancy testing; additiona l pregnancy testing may be 
performed to meet local requirements*. Subjects will not receive study medication in case of a 
positive urine or serum pregnancy test.  
*If additional pregnancy testing is needed per local requirements, those additional results wi ll be
kept as source documentation only.
Pregnancy reporting  
Reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity data are not available for this antibody at this time, 
therefore no guidelines on therapeutic recommendations in case of pregnancy are available. This 
study enrolls women who are considered to be of non -child -bearing potential, thus pregnancy is 
not an expected outcome for any female study participant. However, in the case that a pregnancy 
in a female study participant should occur please follow the below r eporting guidelines. The 
follow -up for this subject and for the fetus is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be 
reported to Covance within 24 hours of learning of  its occurrence. The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complica tions.  
Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_335313]. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on 
the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relatio nship to the study treatment.  
Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a 
SAE form.  
Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the mother.  
Page [ADDRESS_414028] be reported and discussed with Covance personnel. The results should be evaluated for 
criteria defining an AE and reported as such if the criteria are met. Repeated evaluations are 
mandatory until normalization of the result(s) or until the change is no longer clinically relevant. 
In case of doubt, Covance personnel should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Safety labs (hematology, clinical chemistry  and urinalysis) do not need to be repeated at baseline 
if the Baseline visit is taking place within [ADDRESS_414029] 8 hours prior to scheduled sa fety lab collections.  
Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 3 . 
Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count with 
differentials and platelet count will be measured.  
Clinical chemistry  
Sodium, potassium, creatinine, BUN/urea, uric acid, chloride, albumin, calcium, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, bicarbonate/HCO 3, LDH, GGT, AST, ALT, CK, glucose, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides. If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.[ADDRESS_414030] to produce a sample 
via digital extraction from the rectum.  
Details regarding collection methods and processing are outlined in the Central Laboratory 
Manual.  
7.11. Vital Signs, Phys ical Examination, and Other Safety Evaluations  
Vital signs will include the collection of oral body temperature (recorded in °C), blood pressure 
(BP) –sitting and standing –and pulse measurements. At Screening, for eligibility determination, 
three sets of s ystolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate measurements will be collected after the 
subject has been sitting for 3 minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor and 
Page 191 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 45 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
the mean will be used to determine eligibility. A single set of BP and pulse rate measurements will 
then be collected after three minutes in the standing position.  
A single set of sitting BP measurements will be collected at subsequent visits.  
Physical exams will include assessment of general appearance, skin, lymph nodes, HEENT, neck, 
thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  
Height in centimeters (cm) and body weight [to the nearest 0.1 kilogram (kg) in indoor clothing, 
but without shoes] will be measured. Body mass index (BMI) will be calc ulated using the 
following formula:  
BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)] 2. BMI results will be documented in the CRF to 2 decimal 
places.  
7.12. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
The ECGs must be recorded after [ADDRESS_414031] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_188597] a stable bas eline. 
PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, RR interval, QT, QT corrected by [CONTACT_148997] (QTcF) will be collected. The QTcF should be used for clinical decision -making. ECGs 
must be collected, analyzed and appropriately signed and a rchived at the study site; the site will 
also store all ECG readings digitally (if possible). For any ECGs with subject safety concerns, 
duplicate ECGs must be performed to confirm the safety finding. Clinically significant ECG 
findings at baseline must be  discussed with the Sponsor before administration of study treatment. 
Clinically significant abnormalities must be reported in the AE CRF.  
7.13. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing and shipment. See Section 7.13 regarding the potent ial use of residual 
samples.  
In order to better define the PK profile, the timing of the PK sample collection may be altered 
based on emergent data. The number of samples/blood draws and total blood volume collected 
will not exceed those stated in the prot ocol. Changes to the PK Assessment schedule, if any, will 
be communicated to the sites in the dose adjustment minutes.  
The PK samples will be obtained and evaluated in all subjects at all dose levels. Untreated 
(placebo) samples will not be analyzed.  
Concentrations of plasma total MAA868 (i.e. MAA868 that is bound to FXI or not bound to FXI) 
will be determined by a validated LC -MS/MS method. A detailed description of the method used 
to quantify the concentration of total MAA868 will be included in the bioanalytical raw data and 
in the Bioanalytical Data Report.  
All concentrations below the LLOQ or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration 
data listings.  
For standard PK abbreviations and definitions see the list provided at the beginning of this 
protocol.  
Page 192 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 46 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
The following PK parameters will be determined, where data permit, using the actual recorded 
sampling times and non -compartmental method(s) with Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 6.2 or 
higher): C 0 (the concentration at the end of infusion), AUC last, AUC inf, C0/D, and AUC/D, based 
on the plasma concentration data.  
The linear trapezoidal rule will be used for AUC calculation. The terminal half -life of MAA868 
(T1/2), volume of distribution (V ss) and clearance (C L) will also be estimated, if feasib le, based on 
the data.  
7.14. Other assessments  
7.14.1.  Exploratory Biomarker assessments  
Biomarkers including, but not limited to, D -Dimer and biomarkers of thrombogenesis and 
coagulation may also be studied.  
The list may be changed or expanded further, as it is recogni zed that more relevant or novel 
biomarkers may be discovered during the conduct of the study.  
Sample(s) will be collected at the timepoint(s) defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions for sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment provided in the 
central lab manual. Detailed descriptions of the assays will be included in the Bioanalytical Data 
Reports.  
7.14.2.  Immunogenicity (IG)  
The IG samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the Assessment schedule ( Table 9). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual regarding sample  collection, 
numbering, processing, and shipment. See Section 7.13 regarding the potential use of residual 
samples.  
Immunogenicity analytical method(s)  
A ligand -binding assay will be used to detect anti -MAA868 antibodies. The analytical method will 
be desc ribed in detail in the IG Bioanalytical Data Report.  
7.15. Use of residual biological samples  
Residual blood samples may be used for another protocol specified endpoint.  
Any residual samples remaining after the protocol -defined analysis has been performed may be  
used for additional exploratory analysis. This may include but is not limited to using residual 
samples for protein binding, metabolite profiling, biomarkers of transporters or metabolic enzyme 
activity (such as 4 -beta-hydroxycholesterol levels) or other bioanalytical purposes (e.g. cross 
check between different sites and/or stability assessment). Given the exploratory nature of the 
work, the analytical method used for those assessments may not be validated. As such, the results 
from this exploratory analy sis will not be included in the clinical study report.

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSES  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of 16 subjects per treatment dose cohort with a ratio of 3:1 for MAA868 and placebo 
treatment assignment is based on historic da ta considerations. For example, if the observed 
proportion of patients in a cohort achieving target levels of inhibition is 11/12, the 90% confidence 
interval would be 0.[ADDRESS_414032] received one dose of study drug. Subjects 
will be analyzed based on the actu al treatment taken.  
PK/PD Analysis Set  will comprise all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and 
have at least one PK/PD assessment. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual treatment taken.  
8.3. General Considerations  
All efficacy analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set or Per Protocol Set and will be 
performed based on the assigned treatment arm at the randomization. Only descriptive statistics 
will be summarized, no statistical inference will be calculated in efficacy.  
Safety analysis will be performed using Safety  Set. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual 
treatment taken.  
PK and PD analysis will be based on PK/PD Analysis Set.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_249776] [n], mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum [min], and maximu m [max]. Categorical variable will be summarized 
using frequency [N] and percentage [%].  
8.4. Demographics and Baseline characteristics  
All baseline summaries will be based on the All Randomized Set and Full Analysis Set 
populations.  
Gender, race and ethnicity will be summarized using counts and percentages. Age, height (cm), 
and weight (kg) will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, SD, 
median, minimum [min], and maximum [max]). Age may be summarized by [CONTACT_335314] N and 
%. 
The listing of subjects with abnormal physical examination findings at screening will be presented. 
The number and percent of subjects with medical history events will be summarized. Vital signs 
Page 194 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 48 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
collected at screening (sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature and body 
weight) will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max).  
8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
Within each treatment cohort patients will be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_414033] will achieve a certain percentage FXI inhibition 
at trough (Day 91). The response rate per treatment group will be calculated by [CONTACT_335343]. The dose regimens and targeted FXI inhibition achievement for Cohorts 1 and 2 are as 
follows  
Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 50% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subj ects at trough (Day 91).  
Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly or placebo):  Targeted to achieve ≥ 90% FXI inhibition in 
90% of subjects at trough (Day 91).  
The “on treatment” trough FXI levels will be used for the primary analysis, where “on treatment” 
FXI leve l is defined as a value which is collected within 30 (±5) days after the last administration 
of MAA868. The estimate of the responder rate (%) at Day 91 will be presented for each dose 
regimens of MAA868 together with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals (CI) computed via the 
Clopper -Pearson exact binomial method.  
8.5.2.  Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving FXI inhibition 
≥ 50%, ≥80%, and ≥90% at trough after the first and second dose ( Day 31 and Day 61) at 3 dose 
levels of MAA868. The analyses described for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the 
secondary efficacy variables as follows:  
• Cohort 1 (MAA868 120 mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61.  
• Cohort 2 (MAA868 180 mg monthly  or placebo):  at Day 31 and 61  
• Cohort 3 (MAA868 TBD mg monthly or placebo): at Day 31 and 61  
8.6. Safety Analysis  
The safety evaluation includes the analysis of bleeding events, AEs, major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, systemic arterial, and venous thromboe mbolism events, laboratory data, ECG, 
vital signs, hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, and development of anti -drug 
antibodies. All safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Set.  
8.6.1.  Adverse Events  
The Investigator’s verbatim term of  each AE will be mapped to system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) using the MedDRA dictionary.  
Page 195 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 49 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be of primary interest. The TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3592]; a subject will only be counted once per SOC and once per PT within 
a treatment. If a subject reports more than one AE with the same PT, the AE with the maximum 
severity will be presented. Subject counts and percentages and event counts will be presented for 
each treatment and to taled for all treatments for the following summaries:  
• All TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
• All TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]  
• All TEAEs by [CONTACT_8792]  
• TEAEs potentially related to study drug  
• TEAEs potentially related to study drug by [CONTACT_926]  
• TEAEs leading to discon tinuation of study drug  
• TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be reported for a selection of interested AE terms 
that are specific to Sponsor’s product and program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_221289].  
The AESIs for this study are defined as follows:  
1. TERM 1  
2. TERM 2  
Similarly, to the TEAE summary, the AESI will be summarized in the following:  
1. All AESIs  
2. Serious AESIs  
3. All AES Is by [CONTACT_926]  
4. All AESIs by [CONTACT_8792]  
5. AESIs leading to discontinuation of study drug  
6. AESIs leading to withdrawal from the study  
No statistical inference between the treatments will be performed on AEs.  
Listings will be presented b y subject for all TEAEs, AESIs, as well as for SAEs, TEAEs associated 
with outcome of death, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.  
8.6.2.  Bleeding Events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of major and CRNM bleeding 
events which occur on -treatment from the first dose of the study drug to the last dose of the study 
drug + [ADDRESS_414034] dose on 
Day 91. The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated bleeding events will be tabulated 
Page 196 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 50 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
based on ISTH definition by [CONTACT_335319]/or CRNM bleedings.  
Major bleeding events (Yes/No)  
CRNM bleeding events (Yes/No)  
Total bleeding events (Yes/No)  
If a subject has more than one bleeding event in each above category, the subject will be counted 
only once in the tabulation.  
The adjudicated outcome will be the basis for any interim and final analysis.  
8.6.3.  Major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromb oembolic events  
An analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of major cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events which occur on -treatment from the first dose 
of the study drug to the last dose of the study drug + [ADDRESS_414035] dose on Day 91.   
The number of events and the incidence of adjudicated events will be tabulated based on the 
outcomes adjudicated by [CONTACT_138559], and the ad judicated outcome will be the 
basis for any interim and final analysis.  
8.6.4.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory results in continuous values at each timepoint and for change from baseline 
will be displayed using summary statistics (n, mean, med ian, SD, minimum and maximum values).  
A laboratory value that is within the central laboratory’s reference range will be considered normal. 
A laboratory value that is outside the central laboratory’s normal range will be considered 
abnormal and will be fla gged as either high (H) or low (L). The number and percentage of subjects 
with abnormal laboratory values will be summarized for each scheduled visit. In addition, shift 
tables will be presented to display the shift in the normal range categories (L, norma l [N], H) from 
baseline to specified timepoint. Laboratory results in clinical significance will also be summarized 
in tabulation.  
All clinical laboratory data will be presented in listings. Baseline is defined as the result obtained 
prior to first adminis tration of study medication. Laboratory data will be summarized in SI units.  
8.6.5.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Pre-dose values, post -dose values, and the change from baseline in vital sign measurements (sitting 
diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperatu re and body weight) will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. 
The baseline value will be value just prior to first administration of study medication.  
8.6.6.  ECG Parameters  
The ECG measures (QTc -B, QTc -F, QT, RR, ventricular rate, PR, and QRS) will be listed and 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by 
[CONTACT_3148].  
Page [ADDRESS_414036] administration of study 
medication.  
8.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/sampling timepoint with 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, and max) at each timepoint by [CONTACT_3148]. An 
exception to this is T max where median, minimum and maximum will be presented.  
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics and for PK parameter calculations. A geometric mean will not be reported if the dataset 
includes zero values.  
Individual total MAA868 plasma concentration data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148] (MAA868 arms 
only), subject, a nd visit/sampling timepoint. PK parameters will also be listed by [CONTACT_335321].  
8.8. Biomarkers  
Coagulation parameters, including free and total FXI, FXI:C, and immunogenicity will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_335322].  
8.9. Interim Analysis  
Safety and t olerability data (AEs, laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG data) will be 
evaluated from Cohort 1 by [CONTACT_1034]'s Medical Monitor  and Covance Lead Project Physician 
after approximately [ADDRESS_414037] an additional 14 days, safe ty, tolerability, and other 
analyses will be evaluated.  
Additional IAs may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical study, 
the Sponsor’s clinical development projects in general or in case of any emergent safety concerns. 
The Investigator(s) may be included for decisions with regards to any unplanned IAs that address 
questions of subject safety.  
Unblinded IA results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] (or their designees).  
No further dissemination of interim results should occur , in particular not with individuals 
involved in treating the study’s subjects or assessing clinical data (e.g. ECGs, symptoms) obtained 
in the study.  
8.10. Data Quality Assurance  
Site monitoring  
Page 198 of 212
Anthos Therapeutics   Page 52 
AFib  Protocol v01   Protocol No. ANT -004 
 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Covance 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the Investigator(s) and their staff. During 
the study Covance employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the 
quality/integrity of the sites’ da ta. The monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, 
the progress of enrollment, and ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounte d 
for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during 
these visits.  
The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case 
and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335282] l records) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. 
All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject's file. The 
Investigator m ust also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed 
copy is given to the subject).  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the CRF entries. Covance monito ring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the eligibility criteria, documentation of SAEs, and 
the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of 
the consiste ncy of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific 
monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be 
disclosed.  
Data collection  
Designated Investigator staff will enter the data r equired by [CONTACT_335323] 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. 
Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system until they ha ve been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies 
and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before 
transfer of the data to Covance working on behalf of Anthos. The Investigator must  certify that the 
data entered into the Electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, 
the Investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_109002].  
Data not requiring a separate written r ecord are noted on the Assessment schedule ( Table 9) and 
can be recorded directly on the CRF. All other data captured for this study will have an external 
originating s ource (either written or electronic) with the CRF not being considered as source.  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation and verification.  
Database management and quality control  
Covance will review the data entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_335344]. Queries are 
sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query. De signated investigator site staff is 
required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. Site personnel will complete and 
sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Covance who will make the correction to the database. The 
signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site.  
Page [ADDRESS_414038], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical 
history/current medical conditi ons and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary 
for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology.  
Laboratory samples will be processed centrally, and the results will be sent electronically to 
Covance.  
At the conclusion of the study, the oc currence of any emergency code breaks will be determined 
after return of all code break reports and unused drug supplies to Covance.  
The occurrence of any protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been 
completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, and 
the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the 
database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_335351].

• Consider causes and possible interventions  
 
• Assess serum albumin and serum protein  
 
• Repeat assessment  to confirm  
New onset glucosuria on urine 
dipstick (unless related to 
concomitant treatment, diabetes)  Assess and document:  
• Blood glucose (fasting)  
• Serum creatinine  
• Urine albumin -creatinine ratio  
New hematuria on dipstick  Assess and document  
• Urine sediment microscopy  
• Assess sCr and urine albumin -creatinine ratio  
• Exclude infection, trauma, bleeding from the distal urinary 
tract/bladder, menstruation  
 • Consider bleeding disorder  
 
 
Additional specialized assessments are available to assess renal function or renal pathology.  
(Note: In exceptional cases when a nephrologist considers a renal biopsy, it is strongly recommended to 
make specimen slides available for evaluation by [CONTACT_335330] t o potentially identify project -wide patterns of 
nephrotoxicity.)  
Whenever a renal event is identified, a detailed subject history and examination are indicated to identify, 
document and potentially eliminate risk factors that may have initiated or contribu ted to the event:  
• Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_414049], with an appropriate cuff size)  
• Signs and symptoms such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, back or abdominal pain, dysuria, 
hematuria, dependent or periorbital edema  
• Changes in blood press ure, body weight, fluid intake, voiding pattern, or urine output  
• Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures, cardiac or hepatic failure, 
contrast media or other known nephrotoxin administration, or other potential causes of renal 
dysfunction, e.g., dehydration, hemorrhage, tumor lysis

contributing factors to the renal event 
(co-medications, other co -morbid conditions) 
and additional diagnostic procedures (MRI etc.) 
in the CRF  • Urine dipstick and sediment microscopy  
• Blood pressure and body weight  
• Serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, 
potassium, phosphate, calc ium), 
bicarbonate, and uric acid  
• Urine output  
Monitor subject regularly (frequency at 
Investigator’s discretion) until:  • Event resolution: (sCr within 10% of 
baseline or protein -creatinine ratio within 
50% of baseline) OR  
• Event stabilization: sCr level wit h ±10% 
variability over last 6 months or protein -
creatinine ratio stabilization at a new level 
with ±50% variability over last 6 months.  
*Urine osmolality: in the absence of diuretics or chronic kidney disease this can be a very sensitive 
metric for integ rated kidney function that requires excellent tubular function. A high urinary 
osmolality in the setting of an increase in sCr will point toward a “pre -renal” cause rather than tubular 
toxicity.

12.3. Appendix 3 - Clinical notable laboratory values  
Clinical no table laboratory values : 
The definition, the specific alert criteria and the corresponding actions for hepatic and renal notable 
laboratory abnormalities are respectively provided in  Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 . 
The following laboratory values are considered clinically notable and should be forwarded to 
Covance at the same time that they are sent to Investigators:  
• A change from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dL  
• A decrease from baseline in platelets count ≥ 50% or < 100 x 10 9/L 
• A positive fecal occult blood test  
• Macroscopic hematuria  
Whenever a clinically notable laboratory value is identified, a detailed subject history and 
examination are indicated to identify, document and potentially eli minate a bleeding event:  
• Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_414050], with an appropriate cuff size);  
• Signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, hematemesis, 
rectorrhagia, melena, gingival or nose bleeding, bruising and hem atoma;  
• Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures.  
When one of the above occurs the action plan is as follows:  
• Confirm the value, assess and document the clinically notable laboratory value in the CRF 
or via electronic data load ;  
• Investigate the underlying causes such as clinical or subclinical bleeding event and the 
contributing factors such as intake of prohibited medications;  
• Monitor subject regularly (frequency at Investigator’s discretion) until resolution or 
stabilization . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], additional laboratory tests, endoscopy, volume 
replacement, transfusion, etc. should be performed at the Investigator’s discretion and 
according to the medical needs (see Section 6.3 for reversal therapy).

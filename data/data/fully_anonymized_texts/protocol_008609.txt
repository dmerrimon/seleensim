STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Study Purpose  
The purpos e of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of including stroke 
patients in a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation ( CCR)  program, while examining the 
clinical value in reducing stroke  recurrence, myocardial infarction, readmission, and 
mortality in stroke patients.  
Primary Objective  
• To assess the feasibility of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation for stroke patients.  
Secondary Objective (s)  
• To explore the potential benefits of cardiac rehabilitation for stroke patients by 
[CONTACT_110125] [ADDRESS_122421] of a 
single arm of ischemic stroke patients. Seventeen  patients will be 
consented through rolling recruitment to participate in  a 36 -session CCR 
program over 12- week period at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110113].  Participants will join the existing cardiac 
rehabilitation program, and undergo the same types of exercise therapy and education as the cardiac patients, with slight modifications to the educational material to include brain pathology. The primary endpoint of the study is the successful completion of the study protocol, which consists of attending 75% of the CCR sessions, completing brain MRI and la boratory tests at the end of the study, and attending the end of 
study visit.  
Baseline data will be collected while patients are admitted at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If patients need more time to recover, baseline visits will take place at HealthPartners Neurosci ence Center within 3 months from the 
time of stroke. CCR sessions will also begin within 3 months after the patient’s admission for ischemic stroke. The research staff will conduct a 6-week phone call (6- weeks after beginning CCR) to determine if any 
adver se events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) have occurred and 
to obtain and updated medication list. The 3- month and 6- month clinic 
visits will take place at the Neuroscience Center and will be [ADDRESS_122422]. Haitham Hussein and the research staff. The patients’ vitals will be

04 June 2020  Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION 
 
There is a significant overlap in risk factors (e.g. hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, smoking, 
diabetes, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle) between ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease.
1-4 These risk factors contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, 
which is a major cause of ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. This is why prevention strategies for coronary artery disease and stroke are similar.  
 
Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) is standard- of-care after myocardial infarction, 
which includes aerobic exercise, education/counseling, and medication compliance oversight. CCR has been shown to improve vascular risk factor control and survival rates, as well as reduce re-infarction and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47847].
5-[ADDRESS_122425] by [CONTACT_110126], occupational, and speech therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This is a fundamental philosophical difference between CCR and stroke rehabilitation. The former aims to impr ove wellness and 
bring the patient to a healthier state compared to baseline, while the latter aims to bring the patient back to baseline. Another important difference between CCR and stroke rehabilitation is the extent and intensity of patient education; while there is an education curriculum for CCR, stroke patients’ education typi[INVESTIGATOR_4755] a discussion with providers during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110117]. Coaching provided by [CONTACT_110127] (e.g. helpi[INVESTIGATOR_110118] a healthier lifestyle and ensuring medication compliance) is lacking in post-stroke care.  
 
A few studies have attempted to integrate CCR after stroke. These studies showed that CCR has short -term beneficial effect on vascular risk factors control (blood pressure, lipid profile, body 
mass index) and exercise endurance.
11,[ADDRESS_122426] that CCR has on clinical endpoints such as stroke recurrence and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]. 
 
The overall goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of s troke patient participation in Regions 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s CCR program. Our study will examine the ability of stroke patient to complete the current CCR program (provided as standard of care by [CONTACT_110128]). The program consists of [ADDRESS_122427]. The cardiac rehabilitation progra m includes supervised exercise, nutritional 
counseling, medication review, and patient education. Stroke patients will receive the same education sessions as the cardiac patients, except for three sessions. Because there were three sessions that were speci fic to cardiac patients (and therefore not relevant to stroke patients), these 
sessions will be replaced with three stroke specific education sessions, which were developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Haitham Hussein. 
Each session will last approximately 60 -90 minutes, and inc lude 30- 40 minutes of aerobic 
exercise, 15 minutes of strength training, and a 30 minutes group education session. Patients will 
be instructed to exercise at a rate of perceived exertion of 11 -13 on the Borg scale, corresponding 
to “fairly light” to “somew hat hard”.

patients. Seventeen  patients will be consented through rolling recruitment to participate in a 36 -
session CCR program over 12- week period at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110113].  Participants will join the existing cardiac rehabilitation program, and 
undergo the same types of exercise therapy and education as the cardiac patients, with slight modifications to the educational mate rial to include brain pathology. The primary endpoint of the 
study is the successful completion of the study protocol, which consists of attending 75% of the CCR sessions, completing brain MRI and laboratory tests at the end of the study, and attending the end of study visit. 
 Baseline data will be collected while patients are admitted at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If patients need more time to recover, baseline visits will take place at HealthPartners Neuroscience Center within 3 months from the time of stroke. CCR  sessions will also begin within 3 months after the 
patient’s admission for ischemic stroke. The research staff will conduct a 6 -week phone call (6 -
weeks after beginning CCR) to determine if any adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) have occu rred and to obtain and updated medication list. The 3- month and 6- month clinic

6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES  
6.1. Study Assessments  
6.1.1. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)  
NIHSS is a tool used to evaluate stroke severity.
14,15 The total score ranges from 0 -42, with a 
higher stroke indicating a more severe stroke.  
6.1.2. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)  
MRS is a tool used to evaluate the level of disability after stroke.16 The assessment ranges from 
0-6, where 0 is no symptoms at all and 6 is dead.  
6.1.3. European Quality of Life Scale (EQ -5D) 
The EQ -5D is a tool used to measure health- related quality of life.17 The tool includes the 
following dimensions: mo bility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. The scale ranges from 5 -25, with 5 indicating no problems and 25 indicating 
extreme problems.  
6.1.4. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9) 
The PhQ -9 is a tool used to assess depression severity.18 The scale ranges from 1 -27, with a 
score of 1 -4 indicating minimal depression and a score of 20 -27 indicating severe depression.  
 
12 
04 June 2020  Confidential  6.1.5. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
The MoCA is a  brief cognitive screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment or dementia.[ADDRESS_122431]. Occupational therapy completes a MoCA 
assessment during inpatient stroke admission and utilizes version 7.1, so th e MoCA score will be 
extracted from the patient’s chart. For the 3 -month clinic assessment we will use version 7.2 and 
for the 6 -month clinic assessment we will use version 7.3. These are standardized approved 
versions.

04 June 2020  Confidential  8.   ADVERSE EVENTS ( AE) AND SERIOUS ADVE RSE EVENTS (SAE)  
8.1. Definition of AE  
 
An adverse event is any symptom, sign, illness or e xperience which develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Inter val development of  illnesses or injuries will be 
regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be 
adverse events if the abnormali ty: 
• Results in study withdrawal  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Leads to treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
8.2. Definition of SAE  
 
Adverse events are classified as eith er serious or non- serious. A serious adverse event is any 
event that results in: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Disability or incapacitation  
• Other events determined by [CONTACT_15330]’s well-
being is jeopardized (e.g. events that have high likelihood of escalating to the point of meeting criteria outlined above)  
8.2.1. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities  and Other Abnormal Assessments as AEs and                    
SAEs  
Any new abnormal, vital, examination, or laboratory finding judged clinically significant by [CONTACT_110130], if meeting the definitions for such.  Abnor mal 
lab findings or other abnormal assessments associated with the disease under study will not be 
considered AEs or SAEs unless more severe than expected, as judged by [CONTACT_093].  
8.2.2. Time Period and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Upon conse nting, a subject is considered to be a participant in the study, and until that person 
either withdraws or completes study, AEs and SAEs will be recorded.  The investigational team will promptly report any AE/SAE as r equired per federal guidelines.  
9. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATIST ICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Analysis  
The statistical analysis plan was written by [INVESTIGATOR_6234] O. Erickson, Biostatistician at the 
HealthPartners Institute. She will also perform the statistical analyses for the study.  
[ADDRESS_122434] deviation (for continuous variables) and 
frequency (for categorical and binary variables) will be computed for all demographic variables. Population demographics will include age, gender, stroke type, labs, BMI, and others.  
No imputation for missing data or adjustment for multiple comparisons will be done as they were 
deemed too conservative for this feasibility study. All statistical analyses will be performed in SAS 9.4 with p< 0.05 considered to be statistically significant.  
9.3. Primary Analysis  
The primary goal of this feasibility study will be to determine the study completion rate. This will be defined as 75% attendance at CCR sessions, acquisition of 6- month MRI and labs, and 
attendance of end of study visit. We will calculate and report the 95% confidence interval for this rate. We will also report the number of charts reviewed, the number of patients screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria, the number of patients contact[CONTACT_110131], the number of patients that agreed to participate, th e number of patients that started CCR, and the number of 
patients that dropped out or completed CCR. We will also describe reasons for non- completion.  
9.4. Secondary Analyses  
For the secondary analyses , we will explore the potential benefits of cardiac re habilitation for 
stroke patients by [CONTACT_110125] 6 -month rates of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110115] a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular indication, silent stroke on MRI and death. We will assess the individual and composit e event rates by [CONTACT_110132] 95% 
confidence interval. This  will provide information to  allow us to power a larger study.  
Additionally, we plan to descriptively compare weight, BMI, blood pressure, and laboratory values at the beginning and end of the study. We will do this by [CONTACT_110132] 95% confidence intervals for these values.  
9.5. Study Power  
 Our sample size is based on the capacity of the CCR course as deemed by [CONTACT_110133]. With a sample size of 17, w e will be able to estimate a completion rate of 
75% to within a 95% confidence interval of ± 20.2 %. 
 
10. STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with GCP guideline s. Subject privacy requirements 
will be observed, as well as the fundamental concepts o f the Declaration of Helsinki (e .g. IRB 
approval of the study, obtaining informed consent from all subjects and meeting all reporting 
requirements).  
10.2. Quality Assura nce 
 
17 
04 June 2020  Confidential  In the event of a regulatory agency audit or inspection, the site will allow the auditor/inspector 
access to all records documented and facilities util ized in conducting the study.  The s ite will 
also make accommodations (e.g. time, schedule) to discuss findings, concerns, and questions 
with auditor/inspector.   
10.3. Study Closure  
 
Upon completion of all subject visits, data entry and analysis, the investigator will inform the 
local IRB of study closure.  
10.4. Records Retention  
 
All site records will be maintained and stored in a safe and secure location for a minimum of [ADDRESS_122435] study completion.  
10.5. Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
 
The s tudy results will be made available by [CONTACT_110134].  
10.6. Data Management  
 
Data collection and reporting tools will be developed and stored inte rnally (e.g. Case Report 
Forms and source documents [Paper/REDCap]). Data collected and stored electronically will 
remai n confidential and secure (e.g. secured server and passw ord protected files [REDCap]). 
Study binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office. After the study is 
closed, all subject identifiers will be destroyed.

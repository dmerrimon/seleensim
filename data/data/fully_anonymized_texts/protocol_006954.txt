The Study Team consists of the Lead Principal Investigator (Adrianna Vlachos, MD  - Cohen 
Children’s Medical Center of [LOCATION_001], New Hyde Park, NY  and The Feinstein Institute for 
Medical Research, Manhasset, NY)  and five Co-Investigators from the four Diamond Blackfan 
Anemia Resource Centers (Jeffrey M. Lipton, MD, PhD - Cohen Children’s Medical Center of 
[LOCATION_001], New Hyde Pa rk, NY; George Buchanan, MD and Zora Rogers, MD - University of 
[LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; Bertil Glader, MD, PhD - Stanford University, 
Palo Alto, CA; Colin Sieff, MD - Dana Farber Cancer Institute, [LOCATION_011], MA) established in 
cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This protocol was initially 
discussed at the annual Diamond Blackfan Anemia International Consensus Conference and 
three more Co-Investigators were added to the Study Team at that time Steven  Ellis, PhD is also 
a Study Team member.  He is a researcher in ribosome biology and will be providing assistance 
in the scientific nature of this study.  He has been involved in providing the background for the 
study design.  
 
The lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_767602] , verifying IRB approvals at all sub -
sites, recruiting DBA patients, verifying eligibility, consenting patients to the study, overseeing 
adherence to the protocol specifics, monitoring for drug toxicity and safety, evaluating feasibility 
and outcome and analyzing data and reporting results after the study is complete.  
The Coordinating Center will be at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Researc h (FIMR) and the  
Central Study Coordinator will also be  at the lead PI’s institution. The Study Coordinator will be 
responsible for assisting the lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_767603] -mentioned delegated roles.  In addition the 
Central Study  Coordinator will be responsible  for assisting participating institutions in IRB 
submission of the protocol, drug shipment to the participating physicians /institutions, collecting 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) from all sites and assisting with their completion, as well as tracking 
protocol co mpliance at the participating sites.  She will also assist in the analysis of the data.  
All Study Team members, except for Steven Ellis, PhD, will be recruiting patients on to the 
study from their surrounding areas and, as such, will be engaged in human sub jects’ research.  
They will serve as local site PIs.  Thus, they will be responsible for obtaining IRB approval and 
the conduct of the study at their institutions. They will also be responsible for submission of the 
required CRFs to the Central Study Coord inator.  The Study Team will also review the data at 
completion of the study and assist in the analysis.  They will also serve as authors in reporting of 
the data. 
 
The funding for this study allows for up to 17 institutions to enroll 50 subjects. Aside for the PI’s 
and Co-I’s institutions, o ther collaborating institutions will be added once they are identified by 
[CONTACT_767624]. A designee at these participating 
institutions will be added as Co-Investigato r and will be responsible for subject recruitment, 
obtaining IRB approval and completion and submission of CRFs to the Central Study 
Coordinator .   
 
Site Information: The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research will be the main location of 
research activity.  Subjects will also be enrolled at the participating institutions and data will be 
submitted to The FIMR.

Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited pure red cell aplasia.  Over the past ten 
years mutations have been described in genes encoding both the small and large ribosome 
associated proteins. There is wide variability in clinical and biol ogic features, familial history, 
and therapeutic responses. Currently standard therapy includes corticosteroids, red cell 
transfusions or stem cell transplantation.  Approximately 80% of patients have an initial response 
to corticosteroids.  Of these patie nts approximately half will fail to achieve a taper to a tolerable 
steroid dose and will need to discontinue steroid therapy.  These patients and the 20% who do 
not respond initially to steroid therapy must be maintained on a chronic red cell transfusion/i ron 
chelation program.  Chronic transfusion/chelation therapy has considerable treatment -related 
morbidity, most notably iron overload related organ dysfunction . 
 
The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are leucine, isoleucine, and valine.  These amino acids  
are "essential" as they are not stored and must be supplied by a dietary source.  These amino 
acids are utilized by [CONTACT_767625]. Branched -chain amino acid therapy has been used in pa tients with hepatic 
encephalopathy, pre -operative care and  post-operative recovery, burns, post -trauma, cirrhosis, 
phenylketonuria, renal insufficiency, sepsis, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_117746];  however their role 
is not clear.  Leucine is one of three BCA A that have been studied extensively over the years for 
the ability to promote muscle mass when given orally.  Dietary supplementation with branched 
chain amino acids has been used by [CONTACT_767626], in clinica l settings, to reverse muscle deterioration.  Leucine is sold over -the-counter as a 
nutritional supplement and L -Leucine has been Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), 
consistent with Section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  
 
Leucine has  been administered successfully in one patient reported in the literature with DBA. A 
complete response was associated with its administration.  In unpublished data [ADDRESS_1052475] to phenotypic characteris tics that

5.0 BACKGROUND   
5.1 Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA)  
Diamond Blackfan anemia is a rare inherited pure red cell aplasia.  Over the past ten years 
mutations have been described in genes encoding both the small and large ribosome associated 
proteins (1 -6). There is wide variability in clinical and biologic features, familial history, and 
therapeutic responses. Currently standard therapy includes corticosteroids, red cell transfusions 
or stem cell transplantation ( 7, 8).  Approximately 80% of patients have an initia l response to 
corticosteroids. Often patients require chro nic, potentially life -long treatment, which is fraught 
with a variety of short -term and long -term complications including osteoporosis, Cushingoid 
features, diabetes, hypertension, severe growth retardation, aseptic necrosis, glaucoma, and 
cataracts.  Twenty percent of patients are initially unresponsive to corticosteroid treatment and 
about half of the initial responders cannot be tapered to a safe and effe ctive dose.  Other patients 
may become refractory to corticosteroids after a period of responsiveness. These patients must be 
maintained on a chronic red cell transfusion/iron chelation program.  Long -term red cell 
transfusions will result in iron overload  and iron chelation therapy is required.  With inadequate 
chelation, iron overload will inevitably lead to organ damage, especially of the heart and liver, 
and may result in death.     
 
The alternative to corticosteroids or red blood cell transfusions and chelation is hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. Hematopoietic  allogeneic stem cell transplant with a histocompatible 
donor has been proven  to be effective therapy and has been performed successfully f or a select 
group of patients. The DBAR experience  has been recently updated ( 9, 10).  However, because 
of remissions (sustained physiologically acceptable erythropoiesis for > 6 months) in up to 20% 
of DBA patients, stem cell transplantation, regardless of donor type, is not consistently offered to 
corticosteroid-dependent or transfusion -dependent DBA patients. For many patients, the lack of 
a suitable donor does not allow stem cell transplantation as a therapeutic option.  In addition, 
HLA-matched unrelated donor transplants have been associated with mor tality and morbidity.   
 
5.[ADDRESS_1052476] evaluated the efficacy of high -dose corticosteroids in those 
patients failing conventional therapy ( 11-13). In total, [ADDRESS_1052477] become transfusion 
independent after either intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone/intravenous 
methylprednisolone.  One patient had a partial response and [ADDRESS_1052478] that 
extremely high doses may be necessary. Responses were not always durable upon 
Master Protocol  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase I/II Study of Leucine in DBA Patients Proposal 09196004  
Version: 6, 10/1/[ADDRESS_1052479] justifiably led to the abandonment of this approach.  
 
5.2.2 Cyclosporine A and Antithymocyte Globulin   
Cyclosporine A (CSA) has been studied in DBA patients, but has demonstrated limited success. 
By [CONTACT_767627] (1 4-21), a total of 30  patients tried CSA alone (10 patients) or in 
combination with steroids (20 patients).  Only two of the CSA alone patients had a sustained 
response.  Half of the patients treated with CSA plus steroid had a response but it was transient 
and failed once ste roids were discontinued.  Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has also had very 
limited use in DBA. A few case reports of patients with acquired pure red cell aplasia have 
demonstrated mixed responses (2 2-24). A Phase II NIH -sponsored protocol [98 -H-0144] 
combining CSA and ATG closed due to poor responses.  
   
5.2.3 Intravenous Immunoglobulin   
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used in very few cases and has had minimal 
success in patients who were refractory to conventional -dose corticosteroids. In one cas e, a 
patient was able to achieve transfusion independence, although continued to require monthly 
IVIG infusions in order to sustain a remission (2 5). In a few other cases, only limited therapeutic 
benefit was observed (2 6-28).  This modality is not recomme nded.   
 
5.2.4 Interleukin -3   
Interleukin -3 (IL-3) has been studied in a number of trials. An increase in erythroid burst 
forming unit colonies and an improved response to erythropoietin with the addition of IL -3 to in 
vitro cultures of bone marrow from DBA patients (2 9) prompted the i nvestigation of IL -[ADDRESS_1052480] been treated with an approximate 10% response ( 30-35). 
In one report two of the patients who responded, required discontinuation of therapy due to deep 
venous thrombosis.  Others required dis continuation of therapy because of side effects (urticaria, 
wheezing, local reactions). The reason for the disparity between the laboratory results and the 
clinical trials is unclear. IL -3 is no longer available for clinical use.  
 
5.2.5 Metoclopramide    
Metoclopramide has also shown to be effective in DBA.  Abkowitz et al. (36), described a 33% 
hematologic response rate in a small group of patients with DBA using metoclopramide, an 
inexpensive, commonly used dopamine antagonist that induces the release of  prolactin from the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_304], thereby [CONTACT_767628].  It was proposed that prolactin likely 
improves erythropoiesis by [CONTACT_767629].  
Unfortunately other studies in the US and Europe did no t confirm these responses but showed a 
10% response rate (3 7, 38). 
 
In summary none of the agents described have been shown to be unequivocally effective and 
some carry significant treatment related toxicity.  Thus a search for effective agents based upon 
the emergence of new scientific data is ongoing.  
 
6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are leucine, isoleucine, and valine (3 9, 40). These 
amino acids are utilized by [CONTACT_767630][INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase I/II Study of Leucine in DBA Patients Proposal 09196004  
Version: 6, 10/1/14   Page 12 of 35 metabolized by [CONTACT_4852]. Branched chain amino acid therapy has been used in patients with 
hepatic encephalopathy, bronchitis, preoperative care, cirrhosis, phenylketonuria, renal 
insufficiency, sepsis, sleep disorders, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_117746]; however t heir role is not 
clear.  Leucine is one of three BCAA that have been studied extensively over the years for the 
ability to promote muscle mass when given orally.  Dietary supplementation with branched chain 
amino acids has been used by [CONTACT_767631] e muscle mass and increase endurance and in 
clinical settings to reverse muscle deterioration (41).  These latter clinical settings include 
patients undergoing post -operative recovery, in burn wards, post -trauma and cancer therapy.  
The potential benefit of BCAA enrichment, especially leucine, is still not clear however some 
small controlled studies have shown improved nitrogen balance and decreases in postoperative 
morbidity ( 42).  Research on BCAA supplementation as an adjunct therapy in these clinical 
settings continues.     
 
Branched chain amino acid pro ducts vary widely in their composition, ranging from 200 -300mg 
of each BCAA daily to 2 -5 grams of each daily.  The total BCAA requirement for young adults 
and children 6 -10 years of age is 147 mg/kg/day with increased doses for neonates and infants 
(46).  While there is little indication that supplementation with BCAA produce significant results 
in healthy individuals, there are a number of targeted clinical uses. BCAA may support liver 
health in patients with liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatic enc ephalopathy (4 7, 48).  Also, 
patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may show improvement after using BCAA 
(49).  BCAA may help support health and recovery in patients who have experienced trauma, 
extreme physical stress, kidney failure, and burns (50).  BCAA may aid in recovery after surgery 
(51).  
 
6.1 Leucine  Preparation  
Manufacturer:  Ajinomoto Aminoscience LLC  
Leucine is an amino acid available in many over -the-counter nutritional supplements. Leucine is 
a white or almost white, odorless  crystalline powder or shiny flakes. Leucine can be administered 
orally or intravenously and can be supplied as tablet, capsule, powder, or solution.   This pi[INVESTIGATOR_767604] , pharmaceutical grade  L-leucine from Ajinomoto 
Aminoscience LLC, Raleigh, NC.  The leucine will be supplied in capsular form as 250 
milligrams per capsule with e xcipi[INVESTIGATOR_767605].    
 
6.2 Pharmacokinetics  
6.2.1 Distribution Sites    
Amino acids are widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body (5 4). 
 
6.2.2 Metabolism Sites    
Metabolism sites include all body tissues. Factors that influence the metabolism of amino acid 
include injury or stress which increases metabolism and liver dysfunction which decreases 
metabolism. Sepsis increases amino acid metabolism, while renal dysfunction decreases 
metabolism (5 5).  
 
6.3 Mechanism of Action/Pharmacology   
Various mechanisms of action for branched chain amino acids have been proposed. Durin g 
exercise, supplementation appears to exert an anabolic and protein -sparing response. The 
Master Protocol  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase I/II Study of Leucine in DBA Patients Proposal 09196004  
Version: 6, 10/1/[ADDRESS_1052481] 
on protein metabolism during recovery following exercise in human subjects.  
 
6.4 Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to branched chain amino acids, anuria, and inborn errors of amino acid 
metabolism, especially those that in volve branched chain amino acid metabolism, such as maple 
syrup urine disease and isovaleric acidemia are contraindications.  
 
6.5 Adverse Effects 
Toxicity from orally administered leucine is extremely low. Ingestion of even large quantities 
produces only minor gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting.   No consistent 
evidence of toxicity has been linked to leucine supplements.  In healthy subjects, no adverse 
events have been reported by [CONTACT_767632] a 6 -week period (56). In 
another study, healthy elderly men were supplemented with 2.5 g of leucine at each main meal 
for a period of 3 months without any reported adverse effects ( 44). Scarna et al. ( 45) has reported 
that no adverse effects are associated with rep eated oral administration of up to 60 g/day of 
BCAAs (providing 24 g/day of leucine) in patients with bipolar disorder. The body of evidence 
on oral administration of leucine in humans indicates that it can be consumed in considerable 
amounts without adver se effects. There are no Dose -Limiting Toxicities known with oral 
Leucine. There is also no defined Maximum Tolerated Dose and no Recommended Phase II 
Dose reported for this supplement.  
 
Thrombophlebitis, thrombocytopenia, hyperammonemia, nausea, flushing,  and fever have been 
reported with administration of intravenous amino acids, but not with oral supplementation.  
Leucine aggravates a rare genetic condition called Maple Syrup Urine Disease and can cause 
delirium and life -threatening neurologic symptoms in  these patients. It has been thought that 
higher levels of leucine taken over a prolonged period of time may contribute to pellagra. 
Pellagra is defined as a disease that results from a lack of niacin (vitamin B3) and tryptophan 
(another essential amino ac id) but also rarely from an excess of leucine. Its symptoms include 
diarrhea, dermatitis (dry skin rash), dementia and even death in its extreme form. There have 
been reports of severe neurologic damage and death when given intravenously (IV) in high 
doses, which will not be done in this study.   
 
6.6 Drug Interactions  
No drug interaction data are available.  
 
6.7 Pregnancy/Lactation  
Excessive leucine administration interferes with embryo development in rats. Scientific evidence 
for the safe use of branched  chain amino acids during pregnancy and lactation is not available as 
there are no human data.  
 
6.8 Overdosage  
Toxicity from orally administered amino acids is extremely low. A minimum toxic dose has not 
been established.

Adults: 0.98 -2.29 mg/dL (75 -175 micromol/L)  
 
7.0 SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL RATIONALE AND SIGNIFIC ANCE 
The molecular basis for the use of the amino acid leucine as a therapeutic agent for Diamond 
Blackfan anemia is based upon the observations in skeletal muscle that leucine supplementation 
can upregulate components of the translational machinery  (53).  These components include 
ribosomal proteins, whose haploinsufficiency appears to be the underlying cause of DBA (5). 
Successful administration of leucine has been reported in the literature i n one patient with DBA 
(52). A complete response was observed after approximately 6 months of use.  In unpublished 
data reported by [CONTACT_767634] 5 more patients were placed on the 
proposed dose of leucine for this trial (2100 mg/M2/day in [ADDRESS_1052482] reported safe dose in humans reported in the GRAS Exemption Claim) with partial 
responses in 4 of the 5 patients – 2 patients were able to reduce their steroid dose and 2 patients 
were able to lengthen their t ime between transfusions; [ADDRESS_1052483] a demonstrated 
difference in transfusion frequency.  No toxicity was reported in these patients (personal 
communication, Pospi[INVESTIGATOR_302533]).  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_767606] -dependent. The patients will be monitored for 
hematologic response.  Although there is no pathophysiologic reason to expect incremental 
toxicity to leucine in patients with DBA, patients will be carefully monitored for side effects.  
Leucine levels and total amino acid profiles will be ascertained in an attempt to correlate 
response with baseline levels. Where available, responders will also be evaluated with regard to 
phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that might distinguish them prospectively from other 
patients.  
 
8.0 STUDY DESIGN   
This study will be conducted as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , phase I/II, multi-center clinical trial.   
8.1 Primary  Endpoints   
1)  To determine the feasibility of administering the amino acid leucine and to determine the 
pharmacokinetics of leucine administration in patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia 
(DBA) who are red cell transfusion -dependent.  
2)  To determine the safety of leucine administration in transfusion -dependent DBA patients.  
3)  To determine the efficacy of leucine to produce a hematologic response in transfusion -
dependent DBA patients.  
 
8.2 Secondary  Endpoint   
4)  To determine if patients with DBA are deficient in branched chain amino acids.

13.4 Grading of Adverse E vents 
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). Any suspected or 
confirmed  dose-limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study 
PI. 
 
13.5 Dose Modifications for Adverse Events  
13.5.1 Dose Reduction  
There will be no drug reduction  for the study drug.  
13.5.2 Dose Escalation  
There will be no  drug escalation for the study drug.  
13.5.3 Dose Discontinuation   
In the event of any serious adverse event (SAE), the study drug will be discontinued until all  
symptoms resolve.  If the SAE is deemed possibly related to the protocol therapy,  the subject 
will be removed from the study and leucine will be permanently discontinued.  
 
14.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
14.1 On-Study Response Criteria  - evaluated at 6 and 9 months of treatment

Version: 6, 10/1/14   Page 25 of 35 14.1.2 Partial Response (PR)  - Hb < 9 gm/dL with an increase in reticulocyte count to 1% and 
any transfusion interval increase  
14.1.3 No Response (NR)  - No change in transfusion needs, no change in Hb or reticulocyte 
count 
14.1.[ADDRESS_1052513]’s choice:  A subject may withdraw from the study at any time.  The risk of 
withdrawing will be discussed, as will alternative treatment options. Once off study, subjects will 
be referred back to his or her referring physician.  Alternative treatment will then be disc ussed 
with the primary hematologist.  
15.2 PI [INVESTIGATOR_214163]:   Alternative treatment options will be discussed with the subject , who will 
then be referred back to his or her referring physician.  
15.3 Discontinuation for Toxicity: Subjects will be discontinued f rom study for any Grade 
III/IV toxicity  related to the study drug as determined by [CONTACT_976] .  
15.4 Discontinuation for Non -Adherence: Subjects will be discontinued from study if non -
adherent to protocol.   
 
16.0 BIOSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Response to treatment (Complete, Partial, None, Progression) will be evaluated at 6 and 9 
months.  Time -to-achieve a complete or partial response will be examined as well.  
 
16.1 General Study Objectives  
16.1.1 To determine the feasibility of administering the amino acid leucine and to determine the 
pharmacokinetics of leucine administration in subjects with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) 
who are red cell tra nsfusion-dependent.  
16.1.2 To determine the efficacy of leucine to produce a hematologic response in subjects with 
DBA. 
16.1.3 To  determine the side effects of leucine administration in DBA subjects (monthly).  
16.1.4 To  determine if subjects with DBA are deficient in branched chain amino acids (baseline) . 
 
16.2 Specific Statistical Aims of the Study ( for the Data Analysis)  
16.2.[ADDRESS_1052514] occurrence of a CR  or PR.  Subjects who do not achieve 
CR or PR by [CONTACT_767642] 9 months will be considered ‘censored for CR (PR)’.   
16.2.3 To catalogue the phenotypic characteristics of the responders and no n-responders at 6 and 
9 months.   
16.2.4 To examine the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) that may arise from the 
study and to determine if these AEs are relat ed to the study drug.   
 
16.3 Endpoint Variables  
The primary outcome is the type of response observed at 9 months (and 6 months).  Response to 
treatment can be one of the following:  
Master Protocol  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase I/II Study of Leucine in DBA Patients Proposal 09196004  
Version: 6, 10/1/14   Page 26 of 35 a. Complete response (CR): Hb > 9 gm/dL and transfusion -independence as de fined in 
DBA 
b. Partial response (PR): Hb < 9 gm/dL and increased reticulocyte count to greater than 
1% and any increase in transfusion interval from baseline. (Baseline reticulocytes 
range from 0.1 to 0.5 and transfusions are usually performed every 3 wee ks.  An 
increase of reticulocyte counts to over 1  to 1.5% and any increase in transfusion 
interval will be considered a PR.)  
 c. No response (NR): no change in transfusion requirements and no significant change 
in Hb or reticulocytes (or any response that  does not satisfy the conditions of either a 
PR or CR)  
d. Progression:  worsening of disease as defined by [CONTACT_767643] -to-occurrence of either a PR or CR, and safety parameters 
such as type, frequency, and severity of adverse events and relationship to leucine (according to 
the NCI CTCAE version 4.0). 
 
16.[ADDRESS_1052515] Phase I/II study with the goal of determining the feasibility, safety and efficacy 
of the use of leucine in transfusion -dependent DBA subjects.  A maximum of 50 subjects will be 
enrolled into the study.  The statistical approach will be primarily descriptive in nature.   
 
For specific aim 1, the proportion of subjects achieving a specific response at 6 and 9 months 
(CR, PR, NR or progression) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals, will be 
calculated using standard method s of estimating proportions.  
 
For specific aim 2, time -to-response (separately for CR and PR) will be analyzed using survival 
analysis techniques. Subjects who do not achieve CR or PR by [CONTACT_767642] 9 months 
will be considered ‘censored for CR  (PR)’. Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated and the log -
rank test will be used for any comparisons with respect to time -to-CR (PR), if feasible.  
 
For specific aim 3, the approach will be primarily descriptive.  However, we may carry out some 
analyses if feasible.  First, response status at 9 months (separately for CR and PR) will be cross -
tabulated with certain subject phenotypes; a chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, 
will be used to determine if there is an association between respons e status and the certain 
phenotype.  Second, time -to-response will be analyzed.  Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated 
and the log -rank test wil l be used to compare ph enotypes with respect to time -to-CR (PR), if 
feasible. Subjects who do not achieve CR or PR by [CONTACT_767642] 9 months will be 
considered ‘censored for CR (PR)’.   
 
For specific aim 4, the proportion of adverse events will be tabulated and their corresponding 
95% confidence interval will be calculated.  
 
16.5 Sample Size Considerations   
The sample size for the Phase I/II study (i.e. a maximum of 50 subjects) is a sample size of 
convenience. The number of subjects in the proposed study is based on logistics/funding 
Master Protocol

Center (TATRC); it is not based on any formal power calculations. Results from this study may 
provide valuable information for quantifying the effects of leucine in this group of transfusion -
dependent DBA subjects and may be useful in estimating  the effect size necessary for 
appropriately designing future larger -scale Phase III clinical trials.  However, in order to have 
some idea as to the precision of estimates that can be obtained from this study, when the sample 
size is 50, a two -sided 95% con fidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample 
normal approximation will be no wider than 50%±13.9% i.e. the 95% confidence interval will 
range from at most, 36.1% to 63.9%.

18.5.5 UNRELATED  means there is no temporal relationship between SAE and study drug 
administration (e.g., the SAE occurred too early, too late, or study drug not taken) or there is 
reasonable causal relationship between SAE and another drug, concurrent disease, or 
circumstance and the SAE.  Subjects experiencing AEs that cause an interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug or those who experience AEs that are present at the end of study 
should receive appropriate follow -up care.  Sites should report the outcome of any AE  that 
caused permanent discontinuation of the study drug or that was present at the end of the study.

Version: 6, 10/1/14   Page 30 of 35 18.7.1 An Adverse Even t (AE) is any unexpected, non -serious event that is NOT an SAE.  An 
AE is any untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a 
subject who receives a study drug and which does not have a necessarily causal relationship with  
study treatment.     
18.7.2 A “study drug” is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient being tested in    
this study.     
18.7.3 An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintentional sign ( including a clinically 
significant abnormal l aboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease associated with the 
use of the medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  The 
collection of Non -Serious AE information should begin at Day 1, initiation of study drug.    
18.7.[ADDRESS_1052528] be recorded on the data capture forms, including description of 
AE, date and time of onset and resolution; duration of AE if less than 24 hours, severity of event,

19.1.1 This study will be open to all subjects who fully meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
as described in section 9.0.   Epi[INVESTIGATOR_767620]: female  ratio to be 
1.03:1.00.  DBA has been reported in nearly all ethnicities.

19.2 Participation of Children    
DBA is an extremely rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases in the [LOCATION_002].  An 
estimated 90% are diagnosed before one year of age.  Consequently, it is vital to include children 
in this protocol because this age group is most likely to benefit from future intervention. The 
majority of subjects expected to be treated will be children as  
a) this is a congenital disorder  
b) 90% of DBA patients are anemic by 1 year of age  
c) the mean age of the patients in the DBAR is 18 years, and  
d) it is desirab le to avoid the complications of chronic transfusion therapy as soon as possible.  
 
19.3 Risks and Discomforts  
19.3.1 Related to  Leucine (See Section 6.0)

Version: 6, 10/1/[ADDRESS_1052531] benefit.  
19.4.2 Risks in Relation to Benefit for Pediatric Subjects Specifically   This study meets the 
DHHS regulation §46.405 as follows:   a)  the risk is justified by [CONTACT_767649] a serious, chronic hematologic disease will be offered a possible 
alternative to transfusion therapy.  b)  the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least 
as favorable to the subje cts as that presented by [CONTACT_767650] a reduction or even a discontinuation of transfusion requirements and/or 
improvement of anemia, resulting in improved quality of life.  It may offer decrease d morbidity 
and mortality from transfusion -associated viral agents and the complications of iron overload. 
The need for chronic iron chelation could also be avoided in responding subjects.   
Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the chi ldren and permission of their 
parents or legal guardians.  Therefore, for pediatric subjects, this research involves greater than 
minimal risk but presents the prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects.

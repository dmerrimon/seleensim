Title of Study:  A Phas e 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 2 Arm, Parallel 
Group Study Comparing  the Safety and Efficacy of IDP -120 Gel and IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in the 
Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 24-35 investigational centers  in North America  
and Latin America  
Objective :  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the  safety, efficacy  and tolerability of IDP -120 Gel and 
IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . 
Methodology:  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, [ADDRESS_457048] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to 
severe acne (defined as an EGSS score of 3 or 4), presenting with 20-50 inflammatory facial lesions 
(papules, pustules, and nodules), 25-100 non-inflammatory facial lesions (open and closed comedones), 
and < 2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 600 subjects  will be randomized  to the following treatment groups:  
• 300 Subjects to IDP -120 Gel, once -daily application  
• [ADDRESS_457049] -baseline study visit (Weeks 2, 
4, 8, and 12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  in the evening , as instructed by [CONTACT_365446] (with the exception of study visit days, where 
study drug will be applied by [CONTACT_1175] -site during the study visit).   
The investigator will assess the s ubject’s face at each study visit. Information on reported and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical exam and vital signs measurement will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12  (Final Visit)  visits for all subjects. Blood samp les will be collected 
from subjects at Baseline and  Week 12, for CBC/Diff, serum chemistry, and serum pregnancy (for pre-
menses females and females of childbearing potential ). For all pre-menses females and females of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Baseline prior to 
randomization, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. All subjects will also be asked to complete the Acne -Specific 
Quality of Life Questionnaire at Baseline and Week 12 . In addition, at selected s ites, standardized 
photography of the fac e will be performed at Baseline  and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_457050] will be  randomized  to the following treatment groups : 
• 300 Subjects to IDP -120 Gel, once -daily application  
• 300 Subjects to IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application

 Efficacy Measurements:  
Lesion Counts  
At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At baseline, eligible subjects may have no more than two nodules. Nodules 
will be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be 
counted at the same time  rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The Evaluator will also 
count the total number of non -inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones).  The same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits f rom baseline to week [ADDRESS_457059] . 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows :  
Papule: An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus  less than 5 mm in 
diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter  
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedone (blackhead): A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly pi[INVESTIGATOR_85131] (whitehead): A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with a white 
appearance  
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator -blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of [ADDRESS_457060] clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], though not pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] -red) 
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules  only; no nodulo -cystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one 
nodulo -cystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulo -cystic lesions  
 
Safety Assessments:  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220129] (scaling, erythema,  hypo/hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study visit. Itching, burning and stinging (Cutaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as a n average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling , erythema and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (Cutaneous Safety) will be assessed by [CONTACT_85170]. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomita nt 
therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE .  
At selected sites, standardized photography of the face will be performed.

 Statistical methods:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. Tests of lesion count superiority will be based on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and 
analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an 
ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a 
covariate. The co -primary analysis of the dicho tomized EGSS will be based on logistic regression with 
factors of treatment group and analysis center.  The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will 
be based on estimation using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC ) imputation.  
Additio nally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to the 
MCMC imputation. The absolute change in lesion count will  also be analyzed using  a repeated measures  
ANCOVA for lesion count data or repeated measures  logistic r egression model (generalized estimating 
equations) for the dichotomized EGSS.  Finally , a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_365431] s.     
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts will be recorded for each Subject at Baseline a nd at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized in to “success” and “failure” 
with a Subject considered a success if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at Week 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_457062] Clear .  
Populations Analyzed : 
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will  be conducted  on all study subj ects. The ITT population will consist 
of all randomized subjects who were dispensed  study drug . 
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are confirmed  to have used the 
study drug  at least once. A  per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for 
the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations 
(i.e., any Subject or investigator activity that could have possibly inte rfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will 
include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria : 
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit ; 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_457063] baseline study visit prior to Week 12 ;  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. Subjects may not miss more than 
five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80 -120% of expected doses. The number of 
expected doses will be determined for each subjects based on the length of their 
participation in the study) ; 
• Out of visit window at the [ADDRESS_457064] (and/or worsening of condition)  will be included in the PP population. Prior to 
breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events 
that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Approximately 600 subjects  with moderate or severe acne will be  enrolled and randomized to  the 
following treatment groups:  
• 300 subjects to receive IDP-120 Gel, once -daily application  
• [ADDRESS_457065] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_85171], PP, and safety analysis sets.

 Efficacy  Evaluation : 
Primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) populations.   
Secondary and supportive analyses will be conducted on the ITT popul ation.   
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses include  the absolute change  from baseline  in inflammatory and in non -
inflammatory lesions, and the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity Score .  The pre -specified time 
point will be Week 12. All of the testi ng relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions will use the methods introduced in Section 1 2. 
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include  percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts from baseline  to Week s 12, [ADDRESS_457067] a two grade  
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline to Week 12 .  
Supportive:  
Additional supportive efficacy endpoints includ e percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions counts from Baseline at Week 2, as well as percentage  of subjects with at least a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. 
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who are confirmed  to have used the study drug  at least once  will constitute the safety 
population . Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_365448] (AEs), Cutaneous Tolerability 
Evaluations , vital signs/abbreviated physical exams, and safety labs .  
Cutaneous Safety  Evaluation scores (erythema , scaling , and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] ) and Tolerability 
(itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 
8, and 12 for each treatment group. Frequencies and percentag es for each outcome category will be 
included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by [CONTACT_85223].  
Vital signs , an abbreviated physical exam, and safety labs will be conducted on all subjects at specified 
visits. For pre-menses females and females of child -bearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing 
and serum pregnancy testing will occur at specified visits. Changes from baseline in safety laboratory 
values and vital sign measurements will be summarized with des criptive statistics for each treatment 
group at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values 
collected at Baseline  and Week  [ADDRESS_457068] relationship within each category .

 Comparisons among treatment groups will be made by [CONTACT_365449] y of subjects with one or 
more AEs (classified into MedDRA terms) during the study.  The Fisher’s Exact test will be used to 
compare the percentage  of subjects in each treatment group who report any adverse event at a significance 
level of 0.05.  The specific system organ classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are 
reported by [CONTACT_220133].  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbati m 
given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, 
and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial 
dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_85177].  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who experienced 
SAEs will also be provided.  
Subject Self -Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire  during the study .  
Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective responses will be 
compared between treatment groups for trends.  
 
This study wi ll be performed in compliance with GCP including the archiving of essential study 
documents. This protocol follows guidelines outlined by [CONTACT_8639] 
(ICH). All data furnished to the investigator and his/her staff, and all  data obtained through this stud, will

 5 Introduction  
Acne is a very common disorder of sebaceous follicles that usually begins at the time of the  
sharp increase in androgen production occurring in adolescence [1]. The disease is most 
prevalent amongst teenagers, but it does occur later in life, particularly in the third and fou rth 
decade. The pathogenesis is complex and involves an androgen -stimulated increase in sebum 
production, associated with follicular hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the sebaceous 
follicles. This results in abnormal desquamation of the follicular epi [INVESTIGATOR_2130], and is associated 
with bacterial proliferation (especially Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494]  (P. acnes) ) and chronic 
inflammation associated with acne. These changes in acne subjects result in enlarged 
sebaceous glands; obstruction of the follicular canal with associated sebum retention and 
distention of the follicle by [CONTACT_365450] (popularly known as 
“blackheads” or “whiteheads”); and more deeply located papules, nodules and cysts [1]. The 
areas most affected by [CONTACT_220135][INVESTIGATOR_365432] s of the head and upper 
trunk, where the sebaceous glands are particularly active [2]. 
Currently, therapeutic treatment of acne is directed against [ADDRESS_457080] the colonization of bacteria ( P. acnes ) in follicles has 
made use of anti -infectives such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_85164] (2.5% -10%), clindamycin, and 
erythromycin and systemic tetracyclines; however, known disadvantages to this treatment 
modality include irritation and limited use due to pathogen resistance [2-5]. Effective 
treatment directed towards inhibiting sebaceous gland activit y has included oral 
corticosteroids, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], and isotretinoin in addition to anti -androgens 
(eg, cyproterone acetate). Known disadvantages to this treatment modality include being 
limited to use in females (anti -androgens), and limited to short ter m use for safety (oral 
corticosteroids). Finally, effective treatment directed against intrafollicular 
hypercornification has made use of retinoids such as oral isotretinoin and topi[INVESTIGATOR_365433], inhibiting follicular 
hyperkeratinization and follicular obstruction [6]. In general, the known usefulness of oral 
retinoids (ie, oral isotretinoin) is limited by [CONTACT_220136], which range from relatively 
minor effects (eg,  dryness of mucosa and skin, skin irritation, and skin scaling) to major 
toxicity syndromes (reversible hair loss, bone toxicity and teratogenicity) and may include 
varying degrees of symptoms associated with hypervitaminosis A syndrome [2, 7, 8]. 
Likewise, the efficacy of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_220106], which include significant erythema, dryness, peeling, scaling, and 
irritation [9].

 Tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  are retinoid prodrug s that activa te 3 members of the retinoid acid 
receptor (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ), which act to modify gene 
expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_220107]. Tretinoin 
and benzoyl peroxide  show  a relative sel ectivity for RARβ, and RARγ. It has not been 
established, however, whether the clinical effects of tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  are mediated 
through activation of RARs, other mechanisms, or both. Although the mechanism of action for 
tretinoin and benzoyl  peroxide  in the treatment of acne is unknown, the drug’s 
antihyperproliferative, normalizing -of-differentiation, and anti -inflammatory effects may be 
related to the observed efficacy.  
IDP-120 Gel is packaged in a dual -chamber airless pump, with each acti ve gel contained in a 
separate cartridge. Specifically, one cartridge is filled with tretinoin (0.1%) gel, while the 
other is filled with BPO (5%) gel. The gels will be mixed (outside of the pump) immediately 
prior to topi[INVESTIGATOR_365434]. When combined, the gels dispensed from the 
pump will have a concentration of tretinoin, 0.05% (w/w) and BPO, 2.5% (w/w). This 
proposed product is the first gel formulation developed for tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  
and will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness in treating acne vulgaris.  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the safety, efficacy and tolerability of a 
once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_220108] -120 Gel compared to IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in subjects 
with moderate to severe acne vulgaris  (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score ( EGSS ) scale) . 
7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled  study designed to assess 
the safety , efficacy and tolerability o f IDP -[ADDRESS_457082] a 
clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris  (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] 
on the EGSS scale ). 
Approximately 600 subjects  will be enrolled into this study and randomized into one (1) of 
two ( 2) treatment groups : 
• 300 subjects  in the  IDP-120 Gel, once -daily application  group  
• 300 subjects in the  IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application  group  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 24-35 independent study centers . The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be  evaluated  at Screening, Baseline and at 
subsequent follow -up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12).

 An interactive web based response system (IWR S) will be employed to facilitate  
randomization of study subjects . Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers w ill be 
gener ated centrally by [CONTACT_8784] . At each clinical site, subject numbers will be assigned 
consecutively at the screening visit starting with 001.  
The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_85141] , in the 
evening , for 12  weeks (up to the evening prior to week 12 visit)  with the exception of study 
visit days (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be applied (also by [CONTACT_423]) 
after the study visit is completed  at the investigational center.  The initial application will be 
applied at the investigational center as per instruction from the study coordinator or designee. 
The subjects  will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight to prevent sunburn  and 
should be instructed to use sunscr eens of at least SPF 15 and wear protective clothing ( e.g., 
hat). During post -baseline study visits (Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 12 ) the subjects will be asked to 
return the ir used pumps  of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps  of study drug (only 
Weeks 4 and 8 ; Week [ADDRESS_457084] no new study drug dispensed,  and Week 12 will be final 
visit) . During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use approved non-medicated 
cleansers , moisturizers  and sunscreens . 
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specif ic Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne -
QoL, Appendix 17. 3).  The Acne -QoL will be completed at Baseline and Week 12.  
Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective 
responses will be compared between treatment g roups for trends.  
The EGSS should be completed prior to the lesion counts.  
Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination and vital sign measurements will be performed at Baseline  
and Week 12 Visits (final visit ) for all subjects.  
For all pre-menses females and female subjects of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy 
testing will be performed at Screening and confirmed at Baseline prior to randomization , and 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 . Serum pregnancy tests will also be conducted at Baseline and Week 
12 / early termination . 
Safety laboratory testing will be conducted at Baseline and Week 12 / early termination.  
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to  complete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment 
period will not be replaced.  
A “Re-screened ” subject (e.g., subject that is rescreened beyond the allowed screening period 
window)  will be considered a new subject and will need to be re -consented,  receive a new 
screeni ng number, and be entered in IWRS  as a new subject. A ll screening assessment s for 
re-screened subjects will need to be completed.

9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double -blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to 
investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1 (IDP -120 [tretinoin 
0.05% and benzoyl peroxide  2.5%] Gel: IDP-120 Vehicle Gel). Each screened sub ject will be

29 A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_23638] t he IRB/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_1275]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual subjec ts or a small group of 
subjec ts and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  
A protocol violation occurs when there is non adherence  to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the subject , when the subject  or investigator has failed to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subject  was enrolled 
without prior sponsor  approval, or when there is non adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP guideline s. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subjec ts’ source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or 
a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjec ts without prior 
IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such a n occurrence, the implemented deviation or 
change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the 
IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, 
if required.

excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) , and should not be refrigerated.  All 
unused study drug will be sent back to the Sponsor or Sponsor designee upon study completion 
for documented disposal.  
10.1.3  Administration  
The assigned study drug  will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_220116] a day  at home, in the evening , 
for 12 weeks (up to the evening prior to week 12 visit ), with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 and 8) , where study drug will be applied by [CONTACT_85199].  Study drug will be applied as a thin layer  that is gently 
rubbed in to the skin. Study drug  use will  be limited to the face.   
The Investigator and/or trained investigational center staff member will instruct the subject on 
the proper application procedure of  the study drug to the treatment area  at the Baseline visit (see 
Appendix 17.1) . All s ubjects will be instructed to apply study drug  at approximately the sa me 
time every day in the evening  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening before the  Week 12 visit)  after 
cleansing. On study visit days (Baseline , Weeks 2, 4 and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait 
until after their study visit is completed to apply study dru g at the investigational site (note, this 
will affect evening application times on study visit days, which is acceptable . Subjects should n ot 
apply another dose of study d rug in the evening on the study visit days ). No time interval  
between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified.

32 During daily application, subjects will be instructed to gently wash their face with an 
Investigator approved, non -medicated cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their face dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense the study drug into their palm (two depressions of the pump into the palm 
of their hand). Study staff will highlight the importance of proper depressio n of the pump by 
[CONTACT_365459] . Upon completing two depressions of the pump and with study product in the palm 
of their hand, subjects will be instructed to blend the two colored gels in their palm until one 
uniform color is observed. This blended gel should then  be dotted on to 6 areas (chin, left cheek, 
right cheek, nose, left forehead, right forehead) on the face. After distributing the gel in this 
manner the sub ject should gently rub the gel into the skin. This amount of drug should be 
sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is 
important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they 
should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. They should gently smooth the test 
material  over the face evenly. The test material  should become invisible almost immediately 
following application with gentle rubbing. If this does n ot happen, the Investigator should 
instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage.  The subject should wash his/her hands  after 
applying the investigational product to the face . Subjects should also be instructed to place the 
cap back onto the pump aft er every use.  
The subjects will be instructed to continue using the same Sponsor /Investigator  approved non-
medicated facial cleanser , moisturizer and sunscreen and not to change products during the 
study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they hav e changed their cleansing routine. Facial 
makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal daily routine; however, subjects 
should be instructed not to wear make -up during study visits as it may interfere with the 
evaluator’s assessments. Subjects m ust also agree to use non -comedogenic makeup during the 
study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on the face.  Subjects should be 
instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use Sponsor /Investigator -approved, non -medicated 
sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during the day ( e.g., hat). Subjects 
should also be instructed to not use study treatment on skin that may have become eczematous 
(on the face) during the course of the study.  
Subjects should be instructed to s tore the study drug  at room temperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump  cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact [CONTACT_365460] a replacement  pump .

application of the study drug  (section 10.1.3 ). At this visit,  the subject will apply the 
study drug at the investigational center under the direction of the study coordinator or 
designee to confirm proper techn ique. Any necessary retraining can be completed. The 
study drug should be applied after  all clinical assessments.  The study coordinator or 
designee will remind the subjects to apply the study drug once daily at home in the 
evening  up to evening prior to W eek 12 visit  (study drug will not be applied in the 
evening after this study visit) . 
10. The study coordinator will instruct the subject to  use a Sponsor /Investigator -approved,  
non-medicated sunscreen of at least SPF 15, and to wear protective clothing during the 
day (e. g., hat). Remind subject not to use study treatment on skin that may have become 
eczematous during the study . 
11. Schedule the next study visit at Week 12 (Day 84 -3/+5 days).  Remind the subject to 
apply study drug up to evening prior to  Week 12 visit and not apply study drug  on day of 
next study visit, prior to the clinic visit . 
11.1.6  Visit 6: Week 12 (Day 84 -3/+5 Days) Visit – End of Treatment/ Study Visit  
The following procedures will be conducted at this visit:  
1. The Week [ADDRESS_457134] and collected prior to any other 
study -related  procedures.  
2. Perform an abbreviated physical exam, including measurements of weight and vital signs  
(blood press ure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) . Any abnormal physical 
exam findings will be recorded . 
3. The E valuator will perform the efficacy evaluations including the Evaluator’s Global 
Severity Score (EGSS) , inflammatory lesion counts , and non-inflamm atory lesion counts. 
The EGSS is performed prior to the lesion counting. Every effort should be made for t he 
same qualified and validated E valuator  to perform the efficacy evaluations at all visits 
from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_457135] changes in any concomitant medications / therapi[INVESTIGATOR_365440]. Check for prior and concomitant

and v alidation at the Investigator Meeting (and/or Site Initiation Visit), or obtain a waiver from 
the Sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by [CONTACT_1034]).  
The EGSS scores and lesion counts will be performed at each study visi t. The EGSS scores will 
be collected before  the Lesion Counts. All Subject assessments will be performed by a trained 
and validated Evaluator. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
Subject at each visit. If this is not poss ible, every effort must be made for the same Evaluator to 
assess the Subject at both the B aseline and Week 12 visits.  
11.2.1  Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS ) 
The Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS) will be a static assessment that is independent of 
the baseline score. The investigator will make the assessment without referring to the baseline 
value. Every effort should be made for the same evaluator to perform each study assessment for 
the same study subject, for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects  are eligible if they have acne with a global severity of a 3 (moderate) or a 4 (severe) on 
the EGSS a t the B aseline visit. The following scores will be used to describe the severity grade 
and subsequent score:

(pustules, papules, and nodules) will be counted as follows: pustules and papules will be counted 
and recorded together, not separately; nodular lesions will be counted and recorded separately. 
Non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded together. 
The lesions counts will be collected at each visit and/or upon disconti nuation. The following are 
definitions of each lesion type counted:  
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule:  An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule:  An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less  
than 5 mm in diameter

A medical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revis ed if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved two or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by [CONTACT_093].  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of heigh t and weight , and vital 
signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) wil l be performed at 
Baseline  and Week 12  (end of treatment/study ). Any abnormal physical exam findings will be

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457148] that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless 
of causal relationship to the study drug(s ) under study. AEs include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out -of-range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has appeared or worsened during 
the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study.  The collection of 
non-serious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin following the subject's 
completion of the consent process to participate in the study.  
11.4.2  Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur du ring the course of the 
study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, 
the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_365465].  Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior 
event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must 
be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug -related. All AEs, whether 
in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_1560], will be recorded.  Any AEs deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final 
study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final 
study visit).  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s req uiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment,  or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate eCRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms)  
• Onset date and end date  
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness  
• Action taken regarding study drug  
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome  
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.  
Vital sign abnormalities  are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling 
a seriousness criterion).

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457149] medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in whic h the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth def ect 
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes . Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion , electi ve aborti on and an ectopic pregnancy  will be considered  
SAE s, and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section 11.4.6 . 
11.4.4  Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Awareness  of a sign of symptom but is easily tolerated, requires no treatment 
and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate: Low level of concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, 
but can be relieved by [CONTACT_3469] t herapeutic care  
• Severe: Interrupts  the subject’s daily activity and requires systemic or other treatment

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457150] 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
45 11.4.5  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study drug. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship b etween the 
drug and the AE.  
 
Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study 
drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal relationship to the study 
drug and/or a more likely or ce rtain alternative etiology exists.  
11.4.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within [ADDRESS_457151]  within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. 
All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.  
The contact(s)  for reporting an SAE are: 
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor  and Sponsor  of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow -up reports are requ ired. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365441]. 
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457152]) t hat occurs within [ADDRESS_457153] be reported in 
accordance with procedures specified in this protocol.  
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropr iate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, 
regardless of the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_85155]. Documentation of the 
subject’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85156]. The 
Medical Monitor  and CRO contact  [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_756] (and/or facsimile/ email) of all subject deaths. Written follow -up must be received 
by [CONTACT_365466] /Independent  Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC)  within five (5) calendar days of initial notification.  
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034] . When a SAE persists at the end 
of the study, the Investigator will conduc t follow -up contacts with the subject until the 
Investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE 
which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately 
(within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by [CONTACT_365467]/email to the Medical Monitor and Sponsor  and/or Sponsor designee.  
11.4.7  Expedited S erious  Adverse Event R eports  
An AE, whether serious or non -serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported 
in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, 
specificity or severity.  
Expedited  SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investi gator Brochure ) and are related ( ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to 
the regulatory reporting agency(ies). The Sponsor  will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs 
and all participating investigational centers in writing for submission by [CONTACT_365468]/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure 
(ie, “15 -day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the 
informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457154] review the following information about study participation:  
• Informed consent requirements  
• Contraceptives in current use  
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment.  
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instruct ed to contact [CONTACT_85214] (eg, missed or late menstrual 
period).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until  the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the 
study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug 
must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed 
until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be submi tted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any 
complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting  procedure for an 
SAE under Section 11.4.6 .  If a pregnancy is associated with an SAE, the event should be 
reported on an SAE form and a pregnancy form as per procedure outlined in Section 11.4.6 . 
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less . 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the 
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  This method provides robust 
estimation when the pattern of missingness is arbitrary.   Additionally, the estimation will be done 
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457155] 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
48 for each treatment group separately so that the pattern of missing ness for one group does not 
influence the estimation of missing data for another group .  Groups of complete datasets 
following the estimation will  be concatenated to f orm analysis datasets for the comparative 
analyses  and subsequent imputation result inference with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. 
Descriptive statistics will also be derived from the multiply imputed datasets . 
Additionally, a model -based multiple  imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to 
the MCMC imputation.  The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression 
model (generalize d estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS . Finally, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_365442] s. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will b e finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments . 
Evaluations and Analyses  
Inflammatory lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory 
lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “succ ess” and 
“failure” at Week 2, 4, [ADDRESS_457156] Clear.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questi onnaire at Baseline 
and Week 12.  
All assessments will be  conducted for both ITT and PP.  
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) 
population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted  on the  PP (supportive) population.  
12.1.1  Primary Efficacy  
There are three co -primary efficacy endpoints:  
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Absolute change in non -inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percent age of subjects who achie ve at least a two-grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score and were Clear or Almost Clear  
12.1.2  Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints  will be the following : 
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12

• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 g rade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percent c hange in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammat ory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
12.1.3  Supportive Efficacy  
 The supportive efficacy endpoints will be as follows:  
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 2  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 2  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 8 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
12.1.[ADDRESS_457158] wil l be included in the model; 
otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by J.H. Zar (1984)  [10], will be applied to the 
residuals resulting from an ANCOVA. A two -sided p -value for the skewness test significant at 
0.01 will imply the use of the non -parametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the 
results of the parametric analysis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a non -
parametric analysis be indicated, the absolute or percent changes in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. 
Results of the rank -transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analy sis; however, 
results of the non -ranked transformed analyses will also be presented .

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457159] of Superiority for EGSS  
The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a subject considered a success 
for those visits if the Evaluator’s Global Seve rity Score is at least [ADDRESS_457160] Clear. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score 
will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center.  
12.1.6  Statistica l Hypothesis Testing and Control of Multiplicity  
Statistical hypothesis testing for lesion count analyses will use the statistical model introduced in 
Section 12.1.4  and employs the methods of Section 12.1.9  regarding missing values. The 
analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on the logistic 
regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center and employs the methods of 
Section 12.1.[ADDRESS_457161] for a step is not significant. All 
subsequent tests for the remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing 
is:  
Step 
Number  Secondary Endpoint  
[ADDRESS_457162] a 2 g rade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
4 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesio n count from B aseline to Week 8  
5 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
6 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesio n count from B aseline to Week 4  
7 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
 
The following stepwise process will be conducted for testing the supportive efficacy endpoints in 
order to control for multiplicity. These tests will be performed fo r only the ITT population. In 
order to control for multiplicity , failure of any one of the secondary efficacy endpoints will 
invalidate the statistical significance of the supportive efficacy endpoints. The testing process

Descriptive statistics will  be presented for the following parameters by [CONTACT_85216]:  
• Frequency and percent distributions of the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at 
Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Frequency and percent distributions of the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity 
Score at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.   
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize the absolute and percent change in 
inflammatory and non -inflammato ry lesion counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 . 
12.1.8  Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with 
the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  Every effort will be made to promote consistency 
in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner 
such that a minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator.  In 
the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm  for an investigator, then this 
investigator's data will be combined , within geographic region,  to achieve the desired sample 
size minimum per arm.  The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_365469] V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_457167] enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second 
largest enrollment,  and so on.  This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_457168] 
insufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in redefi ning the groups of investigators for the 
purposes of statistical analyses.  These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" 
in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment e ffect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the site 
main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site -to-site variability is such that it 
could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the lesion count data at Week [ADDRESS_457169] at an alpha level of 0.10.  Change from baseline in 
inflammatory lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA 
(unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_365470] a covariate.  For the purpose of 
testing con sistency of treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a 
logistic regression procedure  with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_365471] . Further examination will follow for any variables that hav e a significant 
ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction term.  In the event that the AN COVA or logistic 
regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p -value is less than or 
equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result 
will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the 
outcome of the appropriate test has a p -value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the 
pooled data w ill be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers . 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or 
centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test.  The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p -
value for the subset.  Subsets with p -values greater than 0.[ADDRESS_457170] are 
considered homogeneous.

will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The resulting 
data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each 
imputation.

EGSS Missing Data Imputation  
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on percentage of EGSS successes 
wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, 
missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_365472]. Additionally, the 
pattern of missing obse rvations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value 
estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each 
treatment group.  
The missing 12 -week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis 
will involve 3 principal tasks:  
  
1. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and 
those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].   The missing EGSS values in each data set will be 
filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5  data sets. The resulting data sets

eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study 
protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered 
with the therap eutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment 
efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any 
of the following criteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have tak en any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit ; 
• Missed  more than [ADDRESS_457183] baseline visit  prior to Week  12; 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. , Subjects may not miss more 
than five consecutive days of dosing an d must take 80 -120% of expected doses. The 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of 
their participation in the study);

12.8.2  Sample Size Determination  
These power calculations are based primarily on the observed Week 12 results of the Phase 2 
study, V01 -120A-201. This study was a four -arm trial inclu ding IDP -120 Gel versus its 
individual gel components and Vehicle Gel and is therefore a relevant study fo r powering the 
current study.  
A sample size of 300 per treatment  arm has greater than 99% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference in non-inflammatory lesions with a significance level of 0.05. The 
estimated absolute change from baseline in treatment means were 13.[ADDRESS_457186] deviation of  11.0.

68 • First Time Use of New Pump (“Priming”)  
o Priming occurs when a new pump is used – product may not immediately come out 
evenly, or at all, during the first depression (pressing ) of the pump head . This is normal.  
o Priming will be performed during scheduled on-site clinic visits  where new pumps will 
be dispensed (Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8), under the supervision of the clinic staff . 
o During priming, continue to press the top of the pump head until product comes out 
evenly from both of the nozzles. Product that has come out during priming will be 
discarded.  
• Once the pump has been primed and product is coming out from both nozzles evenly, the 
product is ready for use. Holding the pump at an angle onto the palm of your hand, fully push 
the pump head until two gels appear from both nozzles: one nozzle will dispense a yellow gel 
and the other nozzle will dispense a white gel ( Figure 3a ).  
• Repeat this one more time (two times total) to get two wh ite and two yellow gels  in the palm 
of your hand ( Figure 3b ). Figure 3c shows dispensed product in the palm of your hand. 
Note: if only one gel comes out (from one nozzle) or the gels do not come out evenly, please 
discard and repeat the above steps with two pumps of the head.  
• Carefully blend (mix) the white and yellow gels  using 5 to 10 small circular motions with 
your fingertip or until the colors are blended to give a visually uniform color (gel should now 
all be one  color – off-white/pale -yellow)  (Figure 4a, 4b ).  
• Once blended, use one finger to apply a dot (or dab) of t he product onto six areas of your 
face (chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, right forehead) as demonstrated in 
Figure 5 . 
• You should now have 6 dots (or dabs) of product applied to [ADDRESS_457206], s pread the gel over your face and gently rub it in (using any 
remaining gel left on your palm). It is important to spread the gel over your entire face.  
• Wash your hands with soap and water after applying product to your face  and put the cap 
back on the pump . *Note: if there is some product remaining on or around the nozzles, wipe clean 
with a tissue before replacing the cap.  
• A thin layer of study drug should be applied once daily at home (in the evening) to the entire 
face for twelve weeks (up to the evening  prior to the Week 12 visit). Do NOT treat only 
specific lesions, and do not apply more than the prescribed amount.

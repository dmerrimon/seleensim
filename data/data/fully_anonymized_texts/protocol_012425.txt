  2. Protocol Synopsis  
LUX -Dx Insertable Cardiac Monitor Remote Programming and 
Performance Study (LUX -Dx PERFORM)  
Study 
Objective(s) The LUX- Dx PERFORM Study will characterize, in a general patient 
population, the utilization of the remote programming feature of the 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific (BSC) Insertable Cardiac Monitor  (ICM ) device. The 
study will also collect data to characterize the performance of 
arrhythmia detection algorithm s. Finally, data collected will be used to 
analyze and characterize the ICM system -related safety events.  
Indication(s) for Use  The LUX -Dx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) is intended to monitor 
and record subcutaneous electrocardiogram (S-ECG). The recorded S-ECG is used for the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of cardiac 
arrhythmias. The LUX- Dx is indicated for use in patients that have a 
known heart condition and are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_364970], or have symptoms that may suggest a cardiac arrhythmia such as dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], syncope, chest pain, and/or shortness of breath. The LUX -Dx ICM has not been tested specifically for pediatric 
use. LATITUDE Clarity
TM is intended to remotely  program and 
interrogate  a compatible [LOCATION_011] Scientific  device  via the myLUXTM 
patient  application (patient app) or LUX -Dx Clinic  Assis tant application 
(clinic app) and transfer data to a central  database.  The LATITUDE 
Clarity  Data  Management  System  provides patient  data that can be used  
as part of the clinical evaluation  of the patient.    
Test Device/System  The test devices consist of the LUX- Dx ICM , Patient and Clinic Mobile 
Applications, and LATITUDE Clarity Data Management System . The 
number of devices expected to be used are approximately the same as the number of total enrollment of the subjects in the study. 
Study Design The LUX- Dx PERFORM Study is a prospective, multi -center, single 
arm, post-market, observational study. 
Planned Number of Subjects  Approximately 600 to 827 subjects will be enrolled  in the study. This 
includes approximately 600  subjects participating in the extended Holter 
monitoring part of the study (Hol ter study) , of which 300 subjects will 
come from the “Atrial fibrillation (AF ) management, Post -AF ablation, 
or Suspected AF ” indication subgroup, and 300 subjects will come from 
the other t wo indication subgroups: “Cryptogenic stroke” and 
“Syncope”.

Chronic  ICM System -related Complication -free Rate (CFR) at [ADDRESS_455999] meet all study -specific eligibility criteria and sign the study- specific 
Informed Consent Form (ICF). 
Follow- up 
Schedule  All s ubjects must complete the enrollment visit before receiving 
implantation of  the LUX -Dx ICM . Following consent into the study , 
relevant data including reportable adverse events and ICM device data from the LATITUDE Clarity  will be collected during the subject’s study 
participation period. Specifically, participating sites will be requested to review each enrolled subject’s electronic medical record ( EMR ) and 
communicate with the subject by [CONTACT_364995] /virtual 
health visit  or in -office  visit if scheduled per standard of care to the 
subject at two primary time points  ([ADDRESS_456000]-implant) for relevant adverse events. Each subject’s study participation period will be approximately one year or until BSC notifies 
all sites that data collection is complete.

  LUX -Dx Insertable Cardiac Monitor Remote Programming and 
Performance Study (LUX -Dx PERFORM)  
Additionally, extended Holter monitoring (defined as a monitoring 
period of 14 days) will be conducted with a subset of subjects at the  
2-month in -office  visit or remotely  by [CONTACT_756]/virtual health visit. To 
determine which subjects are required to join the Holter study, the 
following study cohort s are specified:  
• The first 227 subjects enrolled in the study belong to the “Safety 
Cohort”. The number of subjects  is required to fulfill the sample 
size requirement of the primary safety endpoint. The “Safety 
Cohort” subjects are not required  to participate in the Holter 
study. 
• Once t he “Safety Cohort” enrollment is completed, all 
subsequent subjects are required to participate in the Holter 
study. 
• All subjects who participate in the Holter study belong to the “Holter Cohort” , which is  to fulfill the sample size requirement 
of the primary effectiveness objective [ADDRESS_456001] is expected to be approximately 12 months. 
Inclusion Criteria  • Patient is indicated to be implanted with the LUX -Dx ICM for one 
of the following reasons (grouped in three “Reason for Monitoring” subgroups):

  4. Introduction  
4.1. Background 
Cardiac arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), affect millions of people  world wide . 
Standard of care methodologies to detect and diagnose these arrhythmias include 
electrocardiogram (ECG), ambulatory rhythm monitoring (e.g. Holter monitor), mobile 
cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT) , and cardiac implantable electronic  devices (CIED) 
with arrhythmia detection and therapeutic capabilities such as pacemakers and 
defibrillators.1,[ADDRESS_456008] drawbacks including patient 
compliance and limited duration of monitoring, while pacemakers and defibrillators are 
restricted to only those patients meeting indications for therapy (bradycardia and/or tachycardia) once the diagnosis has already be en established in most cases.
3-7   
To fill this gap and to aid clinicians in determining the cause of symptoms such as unexplained s yncope and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], insertable cardiac monitors (ICM s) that allow for 
long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring and require a simple subcutaneous implant procedure 
with a low complication  rate have been developed.
8-11 This approach has shown promising 
results in patients who are at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.12-16 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific  (BSC)  has developed an ICM system, LUX -DxTM, which is indicated for 
use in patients that have a known heart condition, are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_364970], or have symptoms that may suggest a cardiac arrhythmia  (e.g. dizziness, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], syncope, chest pain, and/or shortness of breath). The LUX-Dx ICM uses a data 
management system, LATITUDE Clarity ™, which allows clinicians to remotely monitor and 
program the ICM. In order to transfer the ICM device data to LATITUDE Clarity , the system 
utilizes the myLUX ™ mobile patient app. This allows clinicians to access th e device data for 
analysis to support their evaluation of the clinical status and to adjust the diagnostic 
programm able features as needed . 
4.2. Study Rationale  
Real-world clinical data for patients implanted due to cryptogenic stroke, suspected AF, 
syncope, AF management, or post-AF ablation are  necess ary to understand the usage of 
remote programming, the performance of arrhythmia detection algorithms of the LUX -Dx 
ICM , and the safety of the ICM system . This trial’s patient population  is represent ative of the 
majority of the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_364971] L UX-Dx ICM. The data collection in the LUX -
DxTM Insertable Cardiac Monitor Remote  Programming and P erform ance Study ( LUX- Dx 
PERFORM ) may also be used by [CONTACT_364997]. 
5. LUX -Dx ICM  Device/System  Description   
Refer to Table 5-1 for a summary of the LUX-Dx ICM system components used in the study.

the patient’s subcutaneous ECG (S- ECG)  data when specific arrhythmias (according to the 
device-programmed settings) are detected , which include pause, bradycardia , tachycardia, 
AF, and atrial tachyarrhythmia s (AT). In addition, the device will record S -ECG data  when 
the patient triggers th e device to record via the myL UX patient app. The ICM’s memory can 
store up to [ADDRESS_456010]’s clinical indication.  
5.2. Mobile Applications 
There are two  mobile applications used to interrogate the LUX- Dx ICM and transmit data 
from  the device to the LATITUDETM server : a patient -specific app called myLUX, and a 
clinic -specific app called LUX- Dx Clinic Assistant. The patient app also allows patients to 
record and send S- ECGs of  symptomatic events to the LATITUDE server.  Both apps 
communicate with the device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, and with the 
LATITUDE server using a Wi -Fi or cellular connection . Refer to Figure 5-1 for a diagram of 
the LUX- Dx ICM System.

geographies. The number of sites may go up to 35 sites if it is required to sufficiently support the study enrollment completion . Sites may continue to enroll subjects until notified by [CONTACT_364998] . Additional provisions for each site’s enrollment are specified in 
Section 11.2.3. 
The first  227 subjects belong to the “ Safety Cohort”, and must be enrolled to satisfy the 
sample size required for the safety endpoint analysis. See Section 11.1.5. for detailed 
discussion on sample size requirements. The ICM implant procedure must  be performed within [ADDRESS_456012]’s study 
participation period. Specifically, participating sites will review each enrolled subject’s 
electronic medical record (EMR) and communicate with the subject via telephone 
calls/virtual hea lth visit or in-office  visit that might be part of the standard of care at two 
primary time points (6  months and 12 months after implant) for relevant adverse events. For 
the purpose of this study, t hese follow -up visits do not require subjects’ physical presence at 
the study site. Each subject’s study participation period will be approximately one year from the point of device implant  or until BSC notifies all sites that data collection is complete.  
Defined as the “Holter Cohort”, a subset of approximately 600 subjects will wear  an 
extended Holter monitor for  a monitoring period of approximately 14 days . This will be  
performed at the  2-month in- office visit or remotely by [CONTACT_65859]/virtual health visit. The 
purpose of the Holter cohort is for calculating diagnostic performance of the ICM.  
Refer to Figure 7-[ADDRESS_456013] cohort, and flowchart.

Enrollment is expected to be completed in approximately 30 months; therefore, the total 
study duration is estimated to be approximately 3-[ADDRESS_456014]’s 
labelled indications, and who meet study -specific eligibi lity criteria will be considered for 
enrollment. To be enrolled in the study, subjects must meet all study - specific eligibility 
criteria and sign the study- specific Informed Consent Form (ICF).  
There is no randomized treatment assignment in this study . The study is considered “all 
comers” for patients who are eligible.  
7.3. Justification for the Study Design  
The objective of the LUX- Dx PERFORM Study  is to collect data in a clinical setting 
reflecting real-world usage of the LUX- Dx ICM. Therefore, a prospectively enrolled, 
observational, post-market study design was determined to be appropriate. Subject enrollment requirements are supported by [CONTACT_716]: 
• A sample size of [ADDRESS_456015] primary safety 
endpoint analysis (acute endpoint), and 226 subjects will be required to power the second primary safety endpoint (chronic endpoint). 
• The Holter study group is expected to enroll approximately 600 subjects, including 
approximately 300 subjects from the “ AF management , Post -AF ablation , or 
Suspected AF ” subgroup, and approximately 300 subjects from the other 2 subgroups 
(“Syncope” and “Cryptogenic stroke”). The distribution of the device indications is  
desired to generate at least 100 subjects with a detected  AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_364972] 92557593 C.3 LUX-Dx PERFORM Study Protocol

- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the study device or the 
procedures;  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device 
(if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_5746];  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatme nt 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_262474], when applicable; harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;  
- In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria  listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.  
Possibly Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The relationship with the use of the study device  or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has b een obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The relationship with the use of the study  device or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably explained by

Background:
xThe standard of care for metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) is systemic therapy resulting in 
median survival of 6-[ADDRESS_1005021] shown improved overall 
survival following gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy (e.g. median survival after liver resection for metastatic gastric cancer of 15-37 months, with a five year survival rate of 25%).
xThis prospective randomized trial for patients with MGC and limited metastases is 
designed to compare two therapeutic approaches: gastrectomy with metastasectomy plus 
systemic therapy (GYMS) vs. systemic therapy alone (SA) and to evaluate outcome in light of selection criteria to define those patients who may benefit from the more aggressive approach. 
Objectives:

1.1. Study Objectives
1.1.1. Primary Objective: 
xTo determine whether a therapeutic approach that includes gastrectomy and/or 
metastasectomy plus systemic therapy is superior to the standard of care 
approach that includes systemic therapy alone in terms of overall survival for patients who present with limited metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). 
1.1.2. Secondary Objectives:
xTo compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the two study arms 
xTo analyze prognostic factors and generate potential selection criteria for patients who present with limited gastric cancer metastases that might benefit from gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy. 
xTo analyze prognostic factors and generate potential selection criteria for 
patients who present with limited gastric cancer metastases that will not 
benefit from gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy.  
xTo determine if surgical resection impacts the dosing and duration of 
subsequent chemotherapy administration 
xTo compare quality of life (QOL) parameters between the two study groups. 
We will use tools specifically developed for assessment of QOL in gastric cancer patients: FACT-Ga, EORTC QLQ-STO22 and the SROTC QLQ-C30
1-
4.
xTo determine and compare patterns of disease recurrence between the two 
therapeutic approaches and their clinical implications.  
1.2. Background and Rationale
 Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer world-wide with approximately 
930,[ADDRESS_1005025] common cancer in the [LOCATION_002], and accounts for 1.5% of all new 
diagnoses and 5.2% of all cancer deaths6.   The annual age-adjusted incidence rate is 8 in 
100,000 with an annual death rate of 4.1 in 100,0007.  The lifetime risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_735592] 0.89% or 1 in 113 men and women born in the [LOCATION_002] today7.  At 
the time of diagnosis,  4-14%  of patients will present with metastases to the liver 8,9,10
and 0.1% with metastases to the lung45, 46. At the time of initial surgical intervention for 
locally advanced disease,15-50%   of patients will  have metastases to the peritoneum38
This study seeks to define the role of  metastasectomy in patients with gastric cancer who present with metastases to the liver, peritoneum, or lung.  
09-C-0189    5 Hepatic Disease 
At the time of diagnosis 35% of patients present with evidence of distant 
metastases with 4-14% having metastatic disease to the liver 8,9,10.  A study from 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) described patterns of recurrence in 
completely resected gastric adenocarcinomas (NED) in a large series of patients (n=1172) and found liver specific recurrence rates at 37%
11.  In a study analyzing 643 patients 
enrolled in 5 separate chemotherapy trials by [CONTACT_735611], (JCOG) 5-year survival for patients with liver only metastases treated with systemic therapy alone was 1.7%
12.  There have been no large prospective studies detailing the 
natural history of metastatic gastric carcinomas and long term survival.  However, two small randomized trials compared best supportive care with combination chemotherapy and found that no patients treated with supportive care lived for longer than [ADDRESS_1005026] reduced operative mortality for liver resections to less than 4%
18.
In most tertiary referral cancer centers, liver resection carries mortality of less than 2%.  For hepatic colorectal metastases, retrospective studies spanning thousands of patients show that surgical resection can yield 5-year survival between 35 – 62 %
19.  Similar 
results have been observed following resection of hepatic metastases from primary neuroendocrine tumors with resection now considered the standard treatment.  Initial reports of liver resections for metastatic gastric cancers have been encouraging but are 
limited by [CONTACT_735612] a small number of patients.   
Resection of liver metastases from gastric cancer is not widely performed; 
however a thorough review of the literature (Kerkar and Avital et al., in preparation) 
identified 19 studies reporting survival rates on a total of 358 patients receiving hepatic resections for gastric adenocarcinomas.  The in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735593] 3.7%.  Median overall survival for the reporting studies was 18 months and median 5-year actuarial survival was 24.5% (range: 0 -60%).  Although follow up was limited in several studies, 13.4% of patients were still alive at 5 years (Table 1).   The presumed aggressive biology, high incidence of peritoneal dissemination, and lack of sufficient data from single studies reporting on patients undergoing metastasectomy for metastatic gastric cancer to the liver have made it difficult to highlight the benefits of operative management for these patients. 
Although the data certainly represents a highly selected group of patients and bias 
of surgeons, evidence that long term survival can be achieved in individuals with metastatic gastric cancer to the liver is nonetheless encouraging.  Furthermore, analyzing the characteristics of individuals surviving for greater than 5 years  shows that potential ‘cures’ exist, as evidenced by 7 (4%) patients living for greater than 10 years (Table 2).     
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005027] one study included the number of liver metastases (solitary vs. multiple nodules), negative resection margins, synchronous vs. metachronous presentation, certain primary tumor characteristics such as depth (serosal invasion), venous and lymphatic invasion, histologic grade, lymphocytic infiltration and fibrous pseudocapsule along with metastatic tumor characteristics such as disease free interval, size and distribution of metastases (unilobar vs. bilobar).  Factors identified as significant on multivariate analysis in at least one study included the number of liver metastases (solitary vs. multiple), negative resection margins, serosal/lymphatic/venous invasion of primary tumor, and synchronous vs. metachronous presentation.  Although two studies did show a significantly worse outcome for patients undergoing synchronous hepatic resections, the detailed analysis of 29 long term survivors shows that 17 patients (59%) had synchronous disease.
Considering the pattern of distant failure of gastric metastases, we believe that the 
majority of the study population will include patients with hepatic gastric metastases. Based on the data presented here regarding liver resection for hepatic gastric metastases and data from colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver, we propose the following selection criteria for this trial:  Patients eligible for this trial may include patients with synchronous or metachronous gastric liver metastases, and liver disease (bilateral or unilateral) limited to 5 lesions and/or  15cm.  
Peritoneal Disease 
The next most common mode of failure is locoregional-peritoneal disease. 
Sugarbaker et al. categorized gastric peritoneal disease into four distinct categories defined below
37:
Peritoneal Staging (adapted with modifications)
P0 No peritoneal seeding 
P1 Adjacent peritoneal involvement only; seeding limited to the upper abdomen only, all resectable to  0.5mm
P2 Few scattered metastases to distant peritoneum; small-volume seeding throughout the abdomen, resectable to 
0.5mm  
P3 Extensive peritoneal spread or not resectable to  0.5mm 
 Patterns of failure after curative resection showed that up to 50% of patients undergoing gastric resection developed locoregional recurrences 1-3 years after surgery.  There is a strong theoretical basis for the use of perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy with debulking to NED. The tumor cell entrapment hypothesis suggests that manipulation of the primary tumor at surgery result in free peritoneal cancer cells (Figure 1). These cells become fixed in fibrin and later results in peritoneal recurrence.  
09-C-0189    7 This represents only one of several theoretical considerations. The use of adjuvant 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients presenting with advanced primary gastric cancer has been examined in several randomized controlled trials (Table 3).  Individually, these trials were not powered to definitively highlight the role of adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy. However, a meta-analysis in the Annals of Surgical Oncology in [ADDRESS_1005028] 
peritoneal metastases during surgical exploration
38 (15 -50%).  For these patients (with 
peritoneal dissemination resectable to no visible disease [NED] and no evidence of other distant metastases) the majority of the experts (83%) recommended peritonectomy followed by [CONTACT_735613], although 92% of the experts believed a large randomized trial needed to be conducted to make this treatment standard of care
39.
A large percentage (31%) of the patients with gastric cancer in the [LOCATION_002] 
presents with stage IV disease, including P1-P2 disease. After analyzing 20 years of data from multiple studies of patients receiving a ‘palliative’ gastric resection for stage IV gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination, Sugarbaker et al. concluded that gastric resection in the presence of peritoneal metastases improved  quality of life and survival
37.
Furthermore, 4 separate small studies concluded that complete removal of both the gastric primary and all visible peritoneal disease combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy was associated with improved survival
40-43. For patients not treated with 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy, Ouchi et al. showed that overall survival was improved with total gastrectomy performed for patients with peritoneal disease
44.  However, they 
also reported that patients with >P2 disease had significantly worse outcomes compared to those with P0 or P1 metastases. Patients with >P2 disease are excluded from this study. 
Therefore, based on the data presented regarding gastric peritoneal disease, we 
propose the following eligibility criteria: Patients with gastric peritoneal metastases of 
P2 disease, synchronous or metachronous, limited extrabdominal disease and disease resectable to NED.
09-C-0189    8 Pulmonary Disease 
The incidence of lung metastases from gastric cancer is reported to be extremely 
low.  Kanemitsu et al. reported an incidence of 0.1% (4/3076)45, 46.  The following 
represents the sum of our knowledge regarding lung metastases from gastric cancer: Once 
considered the sine qua non for surgically unresectable disease, advances in anesthesia, 
thoracic surgery, and postoperative care have made pulmonary metastasectomies for other intestinal malignancies such as colorectal cancer an essential part of treatment of metastatic disease.  A review of over 5,000 patients who underwent pulmonary resections for malignancies of various histologies showed that after complete metastasectomy long term survival of 36% at 5 years, 26% at 10 years, and 22% at 15 years are possible in selected patients
47.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_735594], pulmonary resection of 
malignant gastric metastases is not routine.  Autopsy series of patients with gastric cancer demonstrate pulmonary metastases in 22-52% of patients
45,48.  The incidence of clinically 
apparent pulmonary metastases ranges from 0.5-14%45,49.  Anywhere from 0.3-6% of 
patients will have purely isolated pulmonary metastases from their primary gastric adenocarcinoma
45,49.  Pulmonary metastases treated with chemotherapy alone have 
traditionally been associated with poor outcomes, with survival measured in a few months
50.
A thorough review of the literature identified case reports and several limited case 
series which report on [ADDRESS_1005029] undergone resection of pulmonary metastases following curative resections of primary gastric malignancies (Kemp and Avital et al
51, in preparation) (Table 4).  Resections included wedge excisions, segmental 
resections, and lobectomies.  No patients underwent pneumonectomy.  Mean survival in case series is 13.8-24.[ADDRESS_1005030] alternative care of systemic chemotherapy. While considering the retrospective nature, inherent biases and limited experience from these studies, clearly there is a potential group of highly selected patients that might benefit significantly from aggressive approach to pulmonary gastric metastases. This study is designed to answer the question: What are the characteristics of patients who might benefit from the GYMS approach for metastatic gastric cancer, including metastases to the lung. 
The rational for using FOLFOXIRI in this trial:
09-C-0189    9 Metastatic gastric cancer remains a therapeutic challenge due to poor prognosis 
and optimum chemotherapy regimen for this disease has not been established.  Several 
randomized phase III trials comparing combination chemotherapy such as 5-fluorouracyl (5-FU), doxorubicin, and mitomycin or 5-FU, doxorubicin and high dose methotrexate with best supportive care have demonstrated significantly prolonged overall  survival (OS) of 8-[ADDRESS_1005031] supportive care alone group
59,60.  Since then, various combination chemotherapy 
regimens were tested in phase II or phase III trials in metastatic gastric cancer without significant improvement in overall survival. A recent phase III trial comparing docetaxel-cisplatin-5-FU (DCF) to the reference arm of cisplatin-5FU (CF) showed a modest improvement in OS (9.2 vs. 8.6 months), time to progression (5.6 vs. 3.7 months), and response rate (37% vs. 25%) for the DCF arm
61. These results represent one of the best 
improvements in treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. However, DCF was associated with high rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and as a consequence the regimen has not yet been widely accepted. 
Irinotecan, a camptothecin analog, acts as an anti-tumor agent by [CONTACT_735614] I. Irinotecan has demonstrated high activity as a monotherapy in gastric cancer patients with response rates from 18% to 43%
62,63. Phase II 
studies with irinotecan plus 5-FU and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) showed a response rate of 40% with median survival time between 10.7 and 12.6 months
64-66.  A phase II study of 
modified FOLFIRI in gastric cancer patients who had failed taxane/cisplatin chemotherapy reported a response rate of 21% with low toxicity profile
67.
Oxaliplatin, an alkylating agent, inhibits DNA replication by [CONTACT_735615]. Oxaliplatin has shown 
a notable activity against colorectal cancer in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin, which has led to several phase II trials in gastric cancer. The oxaliplatin/5-FU/leucovorin regimen yielded response rates in the range of 38% to 54% with a survival time from [ADDRESS_1005032] shown safe toxicity profiles in patients with advanced solid tumors
69.
Preclinical studies reported synergistic anti-tumor activities between irinotecan and oxaliplatin in several tumor cell lines
70.  A phase II study of irinotecan, oxaliplatin plus 
continuous infusion of 5-FU/leucovorin without chronomodulation in 32 colorectal cancer patients produced very promising activity with a response rate of 72%
71. Another 
phase II study of FOLFIRINOX in advanced pancreatic cancer patients also yielded response rate of 26% with manageable toxicity
72.
On the basis of these encouraging results, several phase II studies were recently 
executed in order to assess the efficacy and safety of the modified FOLFOXIRI as a frontline chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer
73,74.  Results from these 
trials are among the best ever reported in gastric cancer: Overall response rate of 63-66% 
09-C-0189    10 (CR 2-4% and PR 60-65%), median survival 12-[ADDRESS_1005033] common grade 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia (12-49% of all cycles), emesis (8-42% of all cycles), grade 2 neuropathy (10%), grade 3 diarrhea (10%), and stomatitis (4%). No grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities were observed.
The role of surgery in early and/or locoregional solid organ cancers is relatively 
well defined. When solid organ cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers, are diagnosed in an early stage and found to be resectable to NED, surgical resection with or without adjuvant systemic therapy can result in high cure rates. However, the role of surgery in patients with metastatic solid organ cancers continues to be controversial. Generally, the alternative, systemic therapy, on average, achieves only a single digit improvement in median survival and five year survivors are rare with few exceptions. In some cancers, such as colorectal, sarcoma, endocrine and breast cancers with metastases to the liver and the lung, metastasectomy is relatively an acceptable practice in specialty centers. Although considered “systemic disease”, in selected patients, surgery plus systemic therapy resulted in dual digit 5-year survivals. This practice is not based on prospective randomized trials but instead on multiple retrospective reports. It took >30 years to compi[INVESTIGATOR_735595], i.e. liver and lung resection for colorectal and neuroendocrine cancers. As a strategy for the next 5 to 7 years, one of the aims the Surgery Branch is to ask the following question in a scientific fashion: What is the role of surgery plus systemic therapy in metastatic gastrointestinal and breast cancers? This study is the first trial resulting from this strategy. 
In light of the retrospective data presented here suggesting that metastasectomy 
plus systemic therapy might improve outcomes in metastatic gastric cancer, the purpose 
of the current study (the GYMSSA Trial) is to answer the question: What is the role of 
surgery plus systemic therapy in patients with gastric cancer who present with limited metastases to the liver, lung and peritoneum ( P2 disease).  In addition, we will be 
monitoring the safety of this combined modality treatment in light of previously conducted studies 
80, 81. The study will be conducted as a random-assignment phase III 
trial. After thorough staging, including laparoscopy and peritoneal washings, patients will be stratified and randomized to one of two arms: GYMS (gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy) vs. SA (systemic therapy alone.) The primary objective is to define the overall survival in the two study groups. Importantly, this study will try to define the characteristics of patients with gastric metastases who might benefit from gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy. The Surgery Branch in collaboration with the Medical Oncology Branch of the NCI aim to answer these questions in a scientific manner.

2.3. Patient Registration, Stratification, and Randomization
Registration of patients onto this study will take place within [ADDRESS_1005038] to the Central Registration Office (CRO) at [PHONE_200] between 9:00 and 5:00 Monday through Friday.  Following laparoscopy, patients will be stratified and then randomized by [CONTACT_735616]/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy (GYMS arm) or standard therapy (SA arm).  The CRO will notify the Study Coordinator of the results of randomization.   Note:   As soon as the patient has signed the informed consent, the patient’s referring 
oncologist (or [CONTACT_735636] or his designee for those patients being treated at the NCI) will 
be notified of the expected date of randomization and potential start dates for the 
chemotherapy.  Immediately following randomization the referring oncologist will be notified.  Subjects who are randomized to receive chemotherapy only must begin chemotherapy treatment within 14 days following randomization .
Stratification will be done according to the following factors:  
xSite of metastases (liver, lung, and peritoneal disease). Note: positive peritoneal washings will be stratified as peritoneal disease. 
xTime to development of first metastases (earlier than 1 year vs. later than 1 year) 
xPrevious systemic therapy specifically given for gastric metastases vs. no therapy for metastatic disease.  ( Note : patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy 
will be stratified to the  no therapy for metastatic disease group)
09-C-0189    15 3. Study Implementation:
Study Design  (See appendix 3 for trial schema) 
Experimental Design :
xThis is a prospective randomized trial comparing the effects of two therapeutic 
approaches, gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy (GYMS) to 
systemic therapy alone (SA) on the overall survival of patients with limited gastric cancer metastases. 
xPatients who are newly diagnosed as well as those who have received prior systemic treatment for gastric metastases will be eligible.  Both groups will be randomized to surgery plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.  
xCandidate patients for this trial will undergo all or part of the following staging elements before randomization and/or if indicated medically: pathologic confirmation of gastric cancer as feasible, H&P, laboratory evaluations, imaging studies and other studies as medically indicated.   
xPatients who enroll and are willing to have tissue collected for research purposes will be 
enrolled on protocol 09-C-0079.
xAll patients found eligible will undergo staging laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage prior to randomization.  
xPatients will be randomized following staging laparoscopy and after the results of the 
peritoneal washings are available.  
xStratification will adjust for site of metastases (liver, peritoneal and lung), disease-free 
interval (DFI), and previous systemic therapy for gastric metastases. Note: positive 
peritoneal washings will be stratified as peritoneal disease. 
xPatients randomized to the GYMS approach and who have peritoneal disease will 
undergo, as an integral part of their treatment, complete peritonectomy and peritoneal 
perfusion (CHPP).  
xPatients who present with intrabdominal disease without peritoneal involvement will undergo CHPP with limited peritonectomy as described in section 3.2.6 
xAll patients randomized to the GYMS arm will undergo gastrectomy, modified D2 lymph 
node dissection and/or appropriate metastasectomy followed by [CONTACT_666991].  
xH. pylori  infection will be tested and treated following the recommendations of the 
American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of H. pylori
infection
75 (Appendix 2).  This treatment should not delay surgery. 
xPatients randomized to the systemic therapy arm (SA) will receive systemic therapy 
preferably by [CONTACT_735617].  
xSystemic therapy: Since there is no definitive standard of care in metastatic gastric cancer 
and oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan were shown in phase III trials76 to be equally effective to 
other common regimens in gastric cancer, patients will receive the FOLFOXIRI regimen 
as described by [CONTACT_735618]77.
xPatients in the SA arm who develop metastases synchronous to the primary gastric cancer 
will be eligible for palliative gastrectomy for pain, bleeding, obstruction and/or if deemed 
in the best interests of the patients. 
xPalliative gastrectomy will include tumor resection (R0 when possible) and a by[CONTACT_6476]. As 
per standard of care, no adjacent organ resection (with the exception of obstructing 
lesions) will be performed.  
09-C-0189    16 xDuring follow up, all patients will undergo H&P laboratory evaluation and imaging 
studies and tumor markers as indicated. The timing of all follow up evaluations will be 
based on the date of randomization.   
xProgression will be measured by a radiologist blinded as to the treatment arm.  
3.1. Staging Laparoscopy
3.1.1.      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be taken to the operating room for 
staging laparoscopy and peritoneal washings. At laparoscopy biopsies of the peritoneum will be done and used later to confirm status of peritoneal disease (not as a part of the staging procedure but as part of the study).
xAny suspi[INVESTIGATOR_735596].  
xLiver ultrasound to confirm axial imaging findings will be done.  
xRandomization and stratification will be done after laparoscopy and only 
after the results of the peritoneal washings are known (within one week of laparoscopy).
3.1.2.       Patients will then be randomized to receive gastrectomy and/or 
metastasectomy plus systemic therapy (GYMS arm) or systemic therapy alone (SA arm). 
xPatients randomized to receive the standard of care (SA arm) will receive systemic therapy (as described in Section 3.5). Note:  Patients may 
undergo palliative gastrectomy if indicated but must begin chemotherapy within 6 weeks of gastrectomy (8 weeks following randomization). 
xPatients randomized to receive gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy plus systemic therapy (GYMS arm) will be taken to the operating room within 1-2 weeks of randomization (as soon as feasible). Patients may undergo surgery only at the NCI. Subsequently, patients will receive systemic therapy within 4 to 16 weeks after surgery and/or when fully recovered from surgery. Patients who do not recover within 16 weeks will be taken off treatment and followed for survival. ( Note:  patients who undergo 
thoracotomy for pulmonary metastases must be able to receive systemic therapy within 24 weeks of their initial surgery.) This is an intent-to-treat phase III trial. 
3.2. Gastrectomy, Metastasectomy, Peritonectomy and Intraperitoneal Therapy  
Surgical Guidelines: 
Note : The following guidelines are for the purpose of promoting consistency in the 
surgical procedure, and peri-operative care where possible.  Physician discretion will be 
exercised as necessary to ensure that the specific needs of the patient are met.  Details pertaining to surgical and perioperative management will be recorded in the patient medical record but will not be captured on the CRFs.  
3.2.1. Preoperative Patient Management 
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005039] preoperative care as appropriate to the planned 
surgical intervention and the patient’s underlying health status which may 
include:
oThe day prior to surgery: anti-embolism stockings (TEDS), Sequential Compression Devices (SCDS), incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_735597]: Hibiclens
® shower 
Note:  For patients undergoing hepatic resection, no anticoagulation will be given 
prior to operation.
3.2.2.  Patient Management in the Operating Room:
xPatients will receive broad spectrum antibiotics in the recovery room before 
moving into the operating theater. 
xEpi[INVESTIGATOR_735598]. Decisions will be made 
by [CONTACT_735619]. 
xTEDS will be placed and SCDs will be “on” before induction of anesthesia.  
xA central venous line, arterial line, and large bore catheters will be placed if 
blood loss is anticipated to be >500cc. 
xIn cases where liver resection is anticipated, fluid administration will be 
tightly coordinated with the operating surgeon. Before the liver parenchyma is transected administered crystalloids should be limited to <500ml when possible. During parenchymal transection the CVP should be kept under 4 and preferably at 0-1 using Trendelenburg position and vasodilators; urine output of 25 cc per hour will be considered sufficient.  
3.2.3. Choice of Gastric Resection: 
General Guidelines: 
xThe overall goal for surgical therapy is to render the patient NED and to 
obtain negative margins whenever technically feasible. 
xAll patients will receive an intraoperative ultrasound of the liver regardless of the preoperative imaging or laparoscopic ultrasound to determine if hepatic 
metastases exist even if preoperative imaging fails to show evidence of disease. 
xHand sewn anastomosis with PDS and a G-J tube placement for patients undergoing CHPP and gastrectomy will be preferred. 
xA resection of surrounding organs will be allowed if the operating surgeon 
observes local invasion. 
xThe drainage procedure after gastric resections will consist of either a Billroth II or preferably, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy when possible. 
Type of resection 
xLesions of the gastric body or antrum: a “radical subtotal gastrectomy” will be performed: this will include an approximate 70-90% distal gastrectomy, and if 
technically feasible, ligation of the right gastric, right gastroepi[INVESTIGATOR_735599], and left gastric arteries at their origin with removal of associated lymphoid tissues.  The lesser and greater omentum will be removed if considered resectable. 
09-C-0189    18 xProximal lesions: a total gastrectomy with 2-4 cm esophageal margins will be 
done when possible. 
xLesions of the cardia or fundus: a total gastrectomy will be performed where 
possible.  Tumors extending < 4 cm into the esophagus will also be resected through the abdominal incision with the intention of gaining 2-4 cm negative margins on the esophagus. 
xDistal lesions: a proximal subtotal gastrectomy (as opposed to total 
gastrectomy)  with high ligation of the left gastric artery, removal of the 
gastrosplenic ligament, lesser omentum and surrounding lymphoid tissue will be done when possible
3.2.4. Lymph node dissection:
xPerigastric lymph nodes (stations 1, 3 and 5) and greater curvature lymph 
nodes (stations 2, 4 and 6) are grouped as N1 (D1 range); the nodes around the 
left gastric artery (station 7), common hepatic artery (station 8), celiac artery (station 9) and splenic artery (stations 10 and 11) are grouped as N2 (D2 range). More distant nodes such as para-aortic nodes (N3 and N4) are regarded as distant disease (M1). 
xAll visible perigastric lymph nodes will be removed along with technically 
feasible resections of lymph nodes along the following named arteries: 1) 
Right Cardiac, 2) Left Cardiac, 3) Left Gastric, 4) Celiac, 5) Splenic Artery, 6) Hepatic Artery, 7) Suprapyloric, 8) Infrapyloric, 9) and low paraesophageal according to the extent of gastrectomy. 
xA modified D2 lymph node resection will be carried out to include removal of the omental bursa along with the posterior leaf of the transverse mesocolon, anterior leaf covering the pancreas, and lymph node stations 1-11 without obligatory splenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. 
xThe extent of a D2 resection will be determined by [CONTACT_735620]. However, if the tumor is adherent to the spleen or invading the gastrosplenic ligament, a splenectomy will be performed 
Note: Patients at risk for splenectomy (proximal T3-T4 lesions) may receive 
triple vaccination (Pneumococcal, Meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae )
prior to surgery. 
3.2.5. Hepatic metastasectomy: 
xIntraoperative ultrasound will be performed on all patients to detect disease 
not witnessed on preoperative imaging. Unexpected findings will be recorded 
in the patients chart. 
xThe goal of hepatic metastasectomy is to render the patient NED with at least 
1 cm negative margins when possible. 
xThe preferred modality of hepatic metastasectomy is anatomical segmental 
resection. For single lesions, when possible, segmentectomy should be performed. For more than a single isolated lesion, a secterectomy or partial hepatectomy should be performed if feasible. In all cases, the surgeon should strive to obtain negative margins.  
09-C-0189    19 xA non-anatomic wedge resection shall be performed only for small superficial 
lesions deemed resectable to negative margins by [CONTACT_90169]-operative ultrasound 
and preoperative imaging. 
xIn selected cases, intraoperative RFA and/or microwave ablation may be used at the discretion of the operating surgeons if deemed in the best interests of the patient.  
xPortal vein ligation/embolization should be considered in selected patients to 
preserve post-operative liver function.
xA formal hepatic lobectomy will be done for large lesions spanning more than two sectors, or multiple lesions within a single hepatic lobe. 
xIn all cases of hepatic gastric metastasis undergoing liver resection, the 
surgeon should perform portal and hepatic artery lymph node dissection whenever possible. 
3.2.6. Peritoneal metastasectomy (cytoreductive surgery):
xIf there is evidence that the extent of disease is beyond the ability to be debulked such that the largest residual tumor nodule is less than or equal to 0.5 cm, patients will be considered ineligible and removed from treatment.   
xFor patients with primary peritoneal metastases (small disease load; P0-P2 
disease) without massive ascites or intestinal obstruction, all visible disease 
will be resected if technically feasible. 
xComplete peritonectomy for patients with peritoneal disease includes the 
following: the right and left sub-diaphragmatic peritoneum, the falciform 
ligament, lesser and large omentum, anterior, right and left abdominal wall down to the paracolic gutters and the pelvic peritoneum. 
xPartial (limited) peritonectomy for patients with intra-abdominal disease without peritoneal disease includes (i.e., liver metastases without peritoneal disease): peritoneal attachment of the hepatic left lateral segment and the spleen, 2 cm along the incision at the anterior abdominal wall and the falciform ligament (Appendix 1). 
3.2.7. Para-aortic lymph-node metastases:
xTo be considered eligible for CHPP and debulking with “positive” para-aortic 
lymph nodes, patients will have no evidence of metastatic disease outside of 
para-aortic lymph nodes on preoperative imaging and no evidence of hepatic or peritoneal metastases on intraoperative examination. 
xStations 16a1 and/ or b2 will be resected when technically possible. 
3.2.8. Lung metastases:
xTiming of resection will be in the best interest of each individual patient. The 
decision will be made by [CONTACT_735621]. It can 
either be performed at the same time as the gastric resection or at a later time point, with a delay of no more than 16 weeks in cases of synchronous disease. Note:  patients must begin chemotherapy within [ADDRESS_1005040] of care and as defined by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion criteria. 
09-C-0189    20 3.3. Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy CHPP
3.3.1. Perfusion 
xTwo large bore catheters will be inserted through the abdominal wall, one 
over the right lobe of the liver and one in the pelvis.  The abdominal fascia 
will be closed, and the catheters connected to a perfusion circuit.   
xThe perfusate passes from a reservoir through a roller pump, heat exchanger, and then into the abdominal cavity.
xEfflux from a second catheter is then recirculated through the reservoir and 
pump.   
xThe perfusion flow rate will be maintained at 2.0 L/min and a perfusate volume will be maintained which moderately distends the abdominal cavity 
correlating with intra abdominal pressures of 5 to 15 mm Hg (2.0 L/m
2).
Stable perfusion parameters are obtained and the peritoneal cavity is warmed 
to a minimum of 41qC prior to starting the clock for perfusion time.   
xThe perfusion will be continued for 35 minutes.   
xDuring the perfusion, constant physical manipulation of the abdomen 
(shaking) will be maintained for the entire 35 minutes to assure even 
distribution of the perfusate. 
xThe heater coil will be maintained at 46-48°C.  Peritoneal temperature will be measured continuously by [CONTACT_735622].   
xThe patient’s core temperature will be measured with an esophageal probe 
(which correlates well with pulmonary artery temperatures) and maintained at 
less than 41°C using a cooling blanket and ice packs around the legs and head.   
xAt the end of the perfusion, the abdomen will be re-opened and the perfusate 
irrigated from the abdominal cavity. 
3.3.2. Medications 
All intraperitoneal drug dosages will be calculated on ideal body weight (IBW).  
Ideal body weight will be calculated based upon the following formula: 
IBW (male, in kg) =  {(Height in inches – 60) x 2.3} + 50 
IBW (female, in kg) = {(Height in inches – 60) x 2.3} + 45.5 
x5-FU  (patients randomized to surgery arm) 
Due to pH incompatibility, 5-FU cannot be mixed with oxaliplatin inside the peritoneal cavity; therefore, it will be administered IV, to bath the tumor and healthy tissue to potentiate oxaliplatin activity.  Prior to the beginning of CHPP patients will receive: 
oFluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m2 IV  in 50 cc  over 5 minutes 
oLeucovorin 20 mg/m2 IV  in 50 cc  over 5 minutes 
09-C-0189    21 xOxaliplatin (patients randomized to surgery arm) 
oOxaliplatin 460 mg/m2diluted in 2.0 L/m2of D5W via the perfusion circuit 
3.4. Postoperative Care
3.4.1. Patient Monitoring
xThe patients will be monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for no less than 12 
hours after surgical resection.
oRoutine ICU monitoring of vital signs will be performed according to 
the patient’s clinical status.  
oWhile in the ICU, an attempt to keep urine output greater than 100 cc/hour will be made when physiologically feasible.  
oPatients will be transfused as appropriate to maintain a hemoglobin greater  than or equal to 8.0 g/dl, and platelet count greater than  25,000 mm
3
xPatients will be discharged from the ICU at the discretion of the treating 
surgeon and in accordance with the institution policies.  
xFollowing discharge from the ICU, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, 
pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]) will be taken per routine (every 2-6 hours and as clinically indicated).
3.4.2. Continued Postoperative Management:
xPatients will receive routine postoperative care; early ambulation will be 
encouraged. 
xLaboratory evaluations will include: 
oCBC, platelets, and acute panel daily x [ADDRESS_1005041] supportive care as needed. 
xX-rays and scans as clinically indicated. 
3.4.3. Discharge:  
xTotal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_258691] 7-[ADDRESS_1005042] a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735600] a diet may be discharged with home rehab/physical therapy.  
xWithin 5 days prior to discharge the following tumor markers should be 
drawn: AFP, CEA, CRP, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3,  and CA 27-[ADDRESS_1005043] CBC with differential and Chem 20 drawn weekly until 
values are less than or equal to grade 2 or baseline.  This may be done through 
the patient’s referring physician with the results faxed to [CONTACT_110732] or his designee.
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005044] operative visit.  Subsequent follow up is detailed in section 3.9. 
3.5. Systemic Chemotherapy Therapy 
3.5.1. Guidelines
Patients who randomize to receive systemic chemotherapy alone (SA) will begin 
treatment within 14 days of randomization; patients who undergo palliative gastrectomy will begin chemotherapy within 6-8 weeks of randomization.  Patients who randomize to surgery plus chemotherapy (GYMS) will begin treatment approximately 6-8 weeks following surgery (24 weeks for patients requiring sequential thoracic and abdominal surgery). Note:  patients must meet 
eligibility requirements prior to beginning chemotherapy.  Patients who do not recover from the surgical procedure within the stated timeframe will be removed from treatment and followed for survival.
Systemic therapy may be administered by [CONTACT_102]’s local oncologist in 
collaboration with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_735601]. Systemic therapy will follow the guidelines for the FOLFOXIRI regimen
77.
Chemotherapy and supportive care will be administered in accordance with each institution’s policies for the administration of chemotherapeutic agents. 
During treatment, the treating oncologist will be asked to fax the following information (Appendix 8) to the research nurse (noted below) at the conclusion of every other cycle (4 weeks): 
chemotherapy administration sheets including dose reductions and 
reason for dose reduction 
laboratory test results 
other clinically relevant information  
The patient will be asked to maintain a diary to be faxed to the research nurse 
every 4 weeks: 
Melissa Walker RN 
[PHONE_15293]
All systemic chemotherapy will be administered based on actual body weight if within 20% above or below the ideal body weight.  If actual weight is not within 20% of ideal body weight, then ideal body weight will be used to calculate systemic chemotherapy doses. 
Ideal body weight will be calculated based upon the following formula: 
IBW (male, in kg) =  {(Height in inches – 60) x 2.3} + 50 
IBW (female, in kg) = {(Height in inches – 60) x 2.3} + 45.5 
3.5.2. Treatment Schedule FOLFOXIRI 
09-C-0189    23 Systemic chemotherapy will be administered every other week (one treatment 
every 14 days), and repeated for 12 cycles (approximately 6 months).  Patients in the systemic chemotherapy alone (SA) arm who are responding may continue chemotherapy beyond 12 cycles at the discretion of the PI.  Refer to Section 8 for further administration guidelines. 
Day 1: Irinotecan will be administered IV over 90 minutes followed by [CONTACT_735623] 2 hours, followed by 5-FU given via continuous infusion (CIV) over 48 hours.

3.9. Post Treatment Follow up (Both Arms)
Patients will be evaluated every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) for the first 2 years, following completion of chemotherapy, every 6 months for the next 3 years and yearly thereafter.  At any stage between these follow-ups additional evaluations will be conducted as clinically indicated.  At each evaluation patients will undergo: 
xPhysical examination 
xLaboratory tests to include CBC with differential and CHEM [ADDRESS_1005047]. The following information may be obtained: 
xSummary of treatment received  since the previous contact 
[CONTACT_735625], physical exam and laboratory reports to be sent 
to the PI 
[CONTACT_41936]:  The CT of chest/abdomen and pelvis, done within 2 weeks of randomization, will 
be used as the base line study for assessment of disease progression. In special cases 
MRI-L (liver MRI) will be used to assess liver disease or PET scan when indicated.  
Patients randomized to the GYMS arm who progress during the follow up period will be offered further debulking/metastasectomy if deemed in the best interest of the patient.  No additional chemotherapy will be given as a part of this protocol; however, patients may be referred to other NCI treatment protocols or back to their treating oncologist. 
3.10.Off Study Criteria 
xDeath
09-C-0189    26 xUnwillingness to participate in study specified follow up (including phone 
contact)
xIf the physician deems it is no longer in the best interest of the patient to 
remain on study 
Note:  As the objective of this study is overall survival, every attempt will be 
made to follow patients for life. 
 Patients will be officially taken off study by [CONTACT_266137]. 
3.11.Measurement of Health Related Quality of Life  
Baseline Quality of Life Questionnaires (QOL) will be completed prior to randomization ,prior to cycle 9 of chemotherapy and then every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) 
for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter. (Note: patients who begin chemotherapy >[ADDRESS_1005048] not to continue completing the questionnaires.  In the event a patient goes off study prior to completion of the follow up time points, the data gathered from their completed QOL questionnaires will be included in the final analysis. 
To QOL parameters and quality of life adjusted survival between the two study groups, 
we will use tools specifically developed for assessment of QOL in gastric cancer patients: FACT-Ga, ; Blazeby [CONTACT_54963], Eur J cancer 2004 (Appendix 6).  Measures will be initially administered by [CONTACT_735626].  The Research Nurse will assess the patient’s ability to read, and if the patient is unable to read, it will not be administered. The Research Nurse or designee will administer the questionnaires providing a firm surface at a table or a clipboard and a pencil.  The patients will be directed to complete the questionnaires using the 
following instructions: 
We would like to better understand how you and other persons in this study feel, how 
well you are able to do your usual activities, and how you rate your health while you are participating in this research study.  To help us better understand these things about you and other persons participating in this study, please complete these two questionnaires about your quality of life.  Both questionnaires should not take longer than [ADDRESS_1005049] applicable.
09-C-0189    27 You should answer these questions by [CONTACT_202699].  Your husband/wife or other family 
members or friends should NOT assist you in completing the questionnaires.  Please fill out the questionnaires now.  Return the questionnaires to me when you have completed them.  We will be asking you to complete these again during some of your follow up visits.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Once the patient has completed the questionnaires, the Research Nurse or designee, will review them for completeness and thank the patient for their cooperation.  Subsequent measurements will be administered by [CONTACT_735627], or designee, when the patient returns for follow-up visits as specified in section 3.9. 
The Research Nurse or designee will request that the patient complete the questionnaires 
prior to seeing the physician, as the interaction between the patient and physician may influence the patient’s answers to the questionnaires. In the event a patient is taken off study, patients will be asked to complete one last set of questionnaires (as appropriate to the point of withdrawal) and the data will be included in the analysis.  Patients who are only being followed for length of survival will be asked to continue to participate in completing the measures at the set intervals (every 6-12 months) through the mail.  Patients will be phoned prior to the scheduled date of measurement and asked to complete the questionnaire; the FACT-Ga will then be mailed to the patient with a self-addressed return envelope and a cover letter with the script above as directions.  If the questionnaires are not returned within 2 weeks, patients are phoned again. 
4. Supportive Care:
During the post-operative period patients will receive all standard of care supportive measures including nasogastric tube drainage and bowel rest for ileus, pulmonary toilet teaching and incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_258693], transfusions, and antibiotics as indicated.
During the administration of systemic chemotherapy patients will receive all necessary 
supportive care as per the guidelines of the treating physician and institution.  This may include:
x Blood transfusions and growth factor support as necessary for the 
management of myelosuppression.  Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously may be administered for ANC less than 1000 mm
3 or as 
per the guidelines of the treating institution.  Note:  Filgrastim will not be 
administered prophylactically during systemic chemotherapy.   
x Neutropenic fever will be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics pending 
culture results.  
x Renal dysfunction (very rare) from oxaliplatin will be managed with 
supportive measures such as avoidance of renal toxic drugs, maintenance of good renal perfusion (hydration), and diuretics as necessary.   
x Diarrhea will be managed with medication such as diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_735602].   
09-C-0189    28 x Mucositis will be treated with bicarbonate rinses or anesthetic mouth 
wash.
x Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers with or without 
dexamethasone, is recommended during systemic chemotherapy. 
5. Data Collection and Evaluation:
5.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using the NCI C3D web based data collection system.  Quality of 
life will be assessed using questionnaires as specified in section 3.11. 
5.2. Response Criteria
5.2.1. Surgery + chemotherapy arm 
Because of the nature of peritoneal imaging and because cytoreductive surgery will likely eliminate all imageable disease, response can only be measured in terms of radiographic or symptomatic disease-free survival and overall survival.  Patients will be followed with CT scans at predetermined intervals as described in Section 3.9.  At any time point when there is evidence of progressive disease (imageable tumor nodules or increasing ascites persistent on CT scans as interpreted by [CONTACT_735628]) the patients will be scored as progressive disease.  In some cases this may require successive scans, but the time of recurrence will be retrospectively defined at the point the first scan demonstrated imageable disease.  Patients who have symptoms of peritoneal tumor recurrence will be followed closely with serial scans and where necessary, laparoscopy (GYMS arm) in order to confirm disease status.  
5.2.2. Systemic chemotherapy alone arm 
Lesions will be evaluated using the RECIST criteria as described below. 
Evaluation of target lesions
*
x Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions 
x Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. 
x Progression (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
or the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
x Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD. 
* All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 10 lesions representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A 
sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions**
09-C-0189    29 x Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. 
x Non-Complete Response:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesions 
x Progression (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions.  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions 
** All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be followed as 
“present” or “absent.” 
Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. 
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response 
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non-PD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response Confirmation
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_74909] [ADDRESS_1005050] once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6-8 weeks.
Duration of Overall Response
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
Duration of Stable Disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
5.3. Toxicity Criteria
09-C-0189    30   This study will utilize the CTCAE version 3.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov) .  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 3.0. 
5.4. Statistical Section
 The primary objective of the trial is to determine if there is a difference in overall survival among patients with limited gastric cancer metastases who are randomized to receive either systemic therapy alone or gastrectomy, metastasectomy and systemic therapy.
 Based upon results in the literature, patients who would be eligible for this trial 
and who receive systemic therapy alone would be expected to have an estimated 12-month median overall survival from the date of randomization. The goal of this study will be to determine if the use of gastrectomy, metastasectomy and systemic therapy will result in an 8-month increase in overall survival, to a median of [ADDRESS_1005051] rate for the systemic therapy is 0.0578, or approximately a 5.8% probability of death each month when the median survival is [ADDRESS_1005052], a total of 68 evaluable subjects per arm (136 total) will need to be enrolled over a 6-year period and followed for 
an additional [ADDRESS_1005053] 80% power to compare the curves.  
 Patients will be stratified for site of metastases (liver, peritoneal, or lung), disease-
free survival and prior systemic therapy for gastric metastases. 
 Progression-free survival will also be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and a 
two-tailed log rank test, as a secondary endpoint. In addition, a prognostic factor evaluation using Cox proportional hazards modeling will take place after the study has concluded in order to identify if there are factors which can be identified that are associated with survival or progression free survival in patients randomized to treatments on this trial; this will also be interpreted as a secondary endpoint.
 The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_6812]/CCR Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
on an annual basis to evaluate the safety of the two arms. The SAEs (typi[INVESTIGATOR_37333] 3 toxicities, or greater) will be reported according to type of toxicity, and maximal grade noted per patient, for toxicities with at least a possible attribution to the therapy provided on that arm. Comparisons will be made between the two arms using Cochran-Armitage tests for trend, or other appropriate methods, to determine if there is increased toxicity associated with either arm.  
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005054] (DSMB) meeting held 
following the point at which half of the required total subjects have been enrolled (68 total), a single evaluation for futility will be undertaken. Evaluations for better than expected efficacy will also be made annually, beginning after half the subjects have been enrolled. 
 The futility evaluation will be performed as follows:  based on the full data 
available at the time, a conditional power analysis will be performed to determine if the trial is unlikely to find an effect at the 0.05 two-tailed significance level with continued accrual based on an overall survival endpoint. Median survivals of 12 and 20 months correspond to 12-month survivals of 50% and 66% respectively.  Using these as the values under the alternative, and using the actual proportions alive at 12 months, based on the observed fractions and the expected sample sizes at 12 months, the conditional power of the trial will be determined assuming accrual of the remaining patients to achieve a total of 136 patients. If the conditional probability of finding a difference at the two-sided 0.05 level at the conclusion of the trial is less than 20%, then it will be reasonable to recommend that no further patients will be enrolled.  
 The evaluation for better than expected efficacy will be performed as follows. 
Beginning at the first annual DSMB meeting after [ADDRESS_1005055] using an O’Brien-Fleming interim evaluation boundary 
79. It will be assumed that a total of [ADDRESS_1005056] been noted. The information fraction 
used to compute the interim boundary at each annual evaluation will be calculated as the number of patients who died /121.   
 Quality of life evaluations will be compared between the two study arms, with 
comparisons at multiple individual time points, as well as with respect to changes from baseline. Wilcoxon rank sum tests will likely be used. The evaluation will be considered secondary, and p-values resulting from the analysis will be presented without adjustment for multiple comparisons, but in the context of the number of tests evaluated.  
 It is expected that [ADDRESS_1005057] annually by [CONTACT_6812]/CCR DSMB.  Interim 
outcome results will not be revealed to the investigators of the trial; results will be presented to the investigators prior to final accrual to the trial only if the DSMB recommends early termination of the trial.  Until [ADDRESS_1005058] such review of outcomes, a single evaluation for futility will also be performed.  
5.6. Clinical Trial Monitoring Plan
Harris Orkand Information Services (HOIS) provides study auditing/monitoring services 
under contract with the Center for Cancer Research, NCI.  The number of patient records monitored is based on actual accrual.  Below is a tabular summary of monitoring evaluations:

6. Human Subject Protection:
6.1. Rational for Subject Selection
The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedure and the treatments involved, the attendant risks and discomforts, potential benefits and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_735603] a signed Informed Consent. This is particularly important for this study because of the relatively unique nature by [CONTACT_735629].  That is to say, the patients must subject themselves to a major operative procedure with the attendant risks and complications associated with it in order to receive treatment without any assurance of benefit from the treatment. 
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005059] the patients under risk.  A combination of surgery and chemotherapy may decrease healing at a time when healing of abdominal wounds and bowel anastomosis is essential for recovery.  All attempts will be made to avoid enterotomies or a bowel resection where feasible.  In the case of intraabdominal catastrophe after surgery, patients may require reoperation.
6.3. Risks/Benefit Analysis
Patients dying of peritoneal carcinomatosis suffer with recurrent bowel obstructions, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain and incapacitating ascites.  This clinical scenario justifies aggressive treatment strategies as a means of palliation and survival benefit.  In Phase I and II trials we have seen long-term remissions after CHPP in patients who were otherwise terminal with no other therapeutic options available.  
The potential benefit is great for these patients if a regional response is obtained.  
Therefore, this protocol involves greater than minimal risk, but presents the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects.
6.4. Consent Process
All patients are thoroughly screened prior to initial consultation at the NIH.  This usually involves a telephone conversation between the patient and a physician or nurse associate investigator.  During the initial consultation the patient, along with family members, is presented a forthright and detailed overview of the treatment option available to them at the NIH.  The experimental nature of the treatment, its theoretical advantages and disadvantages, and an overview of the operative procedure and anticipated convalescence are presented.  The fact that the patient may undergo an operative procedure in order to receive therapy without any assurance of benefit, the aggressive nature of the treatment, and the likelihood of serious or potentially life-threatening complications are presented.  The Informed Consent document is given to the patient and they are asked to review it, make notes and follow-up with a phone call to the physician or nurse investigator to have any additional questions answered prior to considering treatment on protocol. 
When the patient is admitted to the Clinical Center for treatment, an associate physician 
investigator responsible for the care of the patient presents the previously described information in detail. The research nurse or Principal Investigator, or designee is responsible for obtaining consent from the patient upon admission.  The patient is reassured that participation on the trial is entirely voluntary and that they can withdraw or decide against treatment at any time without adverse consequences.  In fact, the 
09-C-0189    34 investigators assure the patient that if alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_735604].  The signed consent will be verified by [CONTACT_735630].  The patient is asked to participate in completing the self-administered questionnaires measuring health related quality of life during this study.  They are assured that their eligibility to participate in the perfusion portion of this study is not dependent upon their willingness to complete the quality of life questionnaires. 
7.Data Reporting:
7.1. DEFINITIONS
7.1.1. Adverse Event
An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the treatment or clinically significant. For this study, AEs will include events reported by [CONTACT_102], as well as clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation. A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically significant laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre-existing condition or abnormality is considered an AE.  All AEs must be recorded on the AE case report form unless otherwise noted above in Section 6.1. All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution. AEs should be reported up to [ADDRESS_1005060] dose of study drug.  AEs that are considered treatment related, expected, continuing, but not resolvable by 30 days after treatment completion (e.g., alopecia) will not be followed after the 30-day period.  
7.1.2. Suspected adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.1.3. Unexpected adverse reaction
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed 
in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
7.1.4. Serious 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
xDeath,
09-C-[ADDRESS_1005061] normal life functions 
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
xImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
7.1.5. Disability
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
7.1.6. Life-threatening adverse drug experience 
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that places the patient or subject, in the view 
of the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., 
it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
7.1.7. Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition)
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that is under the investigator’s control and that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1201].
7.1.8. Protocol Violation (NIH Definition)
Any change, divergence, or departure from the study procedures in an IRB-approved 
research protocol that has a major impact on the subject’s rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy or reliability of the study data. 
7.1.9. Unanticipated Problem
Any incident, experience, or outcome that: 
xIs unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, 
and(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND 
xIs related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND 
xPlaces subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

8.1.2. Toxicities:
Predominant dose-limiting toxicity: sensory peripheral neuropathy.  Fifty-six percent of patients with this combined therapy experienced an acute, reversible primarily peripheral sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one or two days of dosing, that resolves within [ADDRESS_1005064] also been observed.  An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1-2 % of patients is characterized by [CONTACT_435405], with laryngospasm or bronchospasm.  In 48% of 
09-C-0189    38 patients receiving this combination, a persistent (> 14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory 
neuropathy that is usually characterized by [CONTACT_227790], dysethesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception) has occurred.  Oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (0.7% of study patients), which may be fatal.  If patients experience unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_397685]-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, the agent should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease.  Other effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, transaminase elevations, and alopecia.  Myelosuppression is minimal with the agent alone but may be significant when given in combination with 5-FU/LV; severe nephrotoxicity not reported.  Extravasation of oxaliplatin may result in local pain and inflammation that may be severe and lead to complications, including necrosis.  Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling and pain have been reported. 
8.1.3. Formulation and Preparation: 
Oxaliplatin is supplied in clear, glass, single-use vials with gray elastomeric stoppers and aluminum flip-off seals containing 50 mg or 100 mg as a sterile, preservative-free lyophilized powder for reconstitution, containing lactose monohydrate as an inactive ingredient (450mg or 900 mg respectively).

8.4. Irinotecan
8.4.1. Source:
Irinotecan is commercially available and will be purchased by [CONTACT_735633]. 
8.4.2. Adverse effects:
The most clinically significant adverse events for patients receiving irinotecan-based therapy were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, increased bilirubin, interstitial lung disease, and alopecia.  Irinotecan can induce both early and late forms of diarrhea that appear to be mediated by [CONTACT_129427]. Both forms of diarrhea may be severe. Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan) may be accompanied by [CONTACT_59598], increased salivation, miosis, lacrimination, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or ameliorated by [CONTACT_347033][INVESTIGATOR_735608] (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Late diarrhea should be treated 
09-C-0189    41 promptly with loperamide. Patients with diarrhea should be carefully monitored and 
given fluid, and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated, or antibiotic therapy if they develop ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. 
8.4.3. Formulation and preparation:
Irinotecan is supplied as 20 mg/mL solution (on the basis of the trihydrate salt); 45 mg sorbitol; and 0.9 mg lactic acid in single-dose amber 2mL (40 mg) and 5mL (100 mg) vials.  When necessary, pH has been adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Solutions should be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, (preferred) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final concentration range of 0.12 to 2.8 mg/mL using 100 to  500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. 
8.4.4. Stability/Storage:
Store at controlled room temperature 15º to 30ºC (59º to 86ºF). Protect from light. It is recommended that the vial (and backing/plastic blister) should remain in the carton until the time of use. Admixtures are physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (approximately 25ºC) and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2º to 8ºC), and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours. Refrigeration of admixtures using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, is not recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Freezing irinotecan stock solutions and irinotecan admixtures may result in precipi[INVESTIGATOR_328788]. 
8.4.5. Administration:  
Doses will be diluted in 100 to 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP and infused over 90 minutes.

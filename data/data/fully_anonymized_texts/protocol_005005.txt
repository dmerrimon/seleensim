rationale for this study is to determine whether telemonitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375513].
Part 1:  Demonstrate the reliability of remote pulmonary function testing, performed via telemedicine, 
for monitoring respi[INVESTIGATOR_375514] (ALS)
Primary Hypothesis:  There is no difference in the results of PFT and rPFT for respi[INVESTIGATOR_375515].
Secondary Hypothesis:   The respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489], patient, and caregiver will express confidence in 
conducting the rPFT, as determined by [CONTACT_375578].
Part 2:  Monitor more closely the course of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375516], performed via telemedicine.  
Primary Hypothesis:  Home respi[INVESTIGATOR_375517]-invasive ventilation (NIV) 
recommendation to be met in the experimental group signiﬁcantly closer to the initiation criteria, at a 
time when quality of life is higher, compared to the control group.
Secondary Hypothesis:  Telemonitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375518], and lengthen survival.
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
Part 1:  The primary endpoint is completion of a standard PFT and an experimental rPFT during a single 
clinic appointment.  At the endpoint, study outcomes will include:
1) The  best FVC and MIP results from that visit’s PFT
2) The  best FVC and MIP results from that visit’s rPFT
3) Survey  responses from study participants.
Part 2: The primary  endpoint for each person in the study is the completion of the fifth clinical visit, 
during which the control arm should have complete data for the following outcomes:
1) The  results of five PFT administrations at 3 month intervals
2) Patient  and caregiver monthly surveys
In addition, the  experimental group will have engaged in eight additional guided rPFT assessments with 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_375519].
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Study participants  will be followed after completion of study procedures, and their survival data will be 
recorded.
2.0 Background  
2.1 Scientific Background  and Gaps
Non-invasive ventilation  (NIV) lengthens survival and improves QoL for patients with ALS.
According to  the Quality Measurement Set put forth by [CONTACT_92071] (AAN), two 
parameters of high importance in ALS care are monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375520] [Miller2013].   The practice parameter of the AAN regarding ALS care states that NIV is effective in 
prolonging survival and slowing the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375521] [Miller2009].  NIV has been documented 
to have a positive effect on QoL in the areas of sleep quality, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], physical fatigue, and 
STUDY00006924
Approval: 4/25/2018
Page 4 of  20 (V.06/27/2016) depression [Butz2003].   NIV is recommended when a patient presents with either an FVC≤50% predicted 
or a MIP > -60 cm H 2O [Miller2009].  It is recommended that PFTs be done at least once every three 
months, and that doctors discuss options for NIV support regularly.  
The multidisciplinary  clinical model may not provide optimal management for patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375522].
Although disease  course varies substantially, some patients experience rapid respi[INVESTIGATOR_375521].  In 
prospective study of 38 newly diagnosed patients, half presented with chronic hypoventilation after one 
year, necessitating the introduction of NIV [LoCoco2006].   The authors suggest that efforts should be 
made to evaluate pulmonary function in these patients at least once every month.   Furthermore, it has 
been shown that early initiation of NIV at an FVC threshold of 65% predicted was associated with a 
significant increase in the median time from ALS diagnosis to death [Lechtzin2007].  The current practice 
of quarterly respi[INVESTIGATOR_375523].
Telemedicine has  impacted other areas of neurology, but is understudied for efficacy in ALS.
The practice of  telemedicine involves the delivery of medical care via long-distance and electronic 
communication between a health care professional and a patient or another health care professional.   
This type of intervention can expand medical coverage into underserved regions, while maintaining the 
high quality of care. Success with telemedicine in other areas of neurology, such as in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease [Samii2006], epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] [Ahmed2008], and stroke [Demaerschalk2009], provide a 
framework for achieving positive outcomes.
It is  largely unknown whether remotely-provided multidisciplinary care results in outcomes for ALS 
patients and their caregivers that are comparable to those achieved with traditional care.  A review by 
[CONTACT_375579]. identified 32 publications addressing telemedicine in ALS [Hobson2016], which concluded 
that patients are comfortable using the videoconferencing interface to discuss most concerns, they 
appreciated the reduced travel time and costs, and the use of telemedicine extended the period for 
which they received multidisciplinary care.   Some programs offered live interaction with providers as a 
way to delivered care to individuals in rural areas with no alternative treatment options [ALS-
Maine2010, Bedlack2014].   Other models utilized a traveling nurse to perform the assessment in the 
patient's home, which is stored and forwarded to the appropriate providers at the multidisciplinary 
clinic [Pulley2015, McClellan2013].  Others have taken on a more passive role, with monitoring of 
oximetry and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) data by a nurse led to fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], and higher 
treatment adherence [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]2010, Vitacca2010, Ashcroft2016].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_166821],  Hobson concludes “There is limited evidence to recommend the use of 
telemedicine or telehealth in the case of patients with ALS.  Using telehealth as an alternative to clinic 
visits appears technically feasible but further research needs to establish its safety and effectiveness” 
[Hobson2016].   To address gaps in telemedicine care, randomized controlled clinical trials must be used 
to identify methods that can meet or surpass the standards of in-person assessment.
2.2 Previous Data
Preliminary work  by [CONTACT_375580] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_375524], caregivers, and 
multidisciplinary ALS team members, although less so by [CONTACT_375581] (Figure 1 , [Morris2016, 
Geronimo2017]).  Overall, the three rater groups were concerned that the lack of physical contact 
[CONTACT_375582].  This led us to identify and act upon one area of 
care that could be improved in telemedicine – assessment of breathing function.

7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
Part 1: This  is a self-controlled study where each participant will be administered a standard of care PFT 
for measurement of FVC and MIP, as well as an rPFT, separated by [CONTACT_375592], for measurement of 
experimental FVC and MIP.   The rPFT is guided by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_375533], utilizing the 
telemedicine interface of the Hersey ALS clinic and devices for measuring FVC and MIP (Error! Reference  
source not  found.). 
Part 2:  This is a randomized controlled study to determine whether regular monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375534], rather than every 3-month intervals, over the course of a year, can lead to better

will make the decision to end the protocol early if the patient is unable to perform the 
procedures.  The patient can also opt to end the study at any time.
The study  survey is administered once a month for participants in both study arms and consists 
of four parts.  The initial survey administered at month [ADDRESS_469852] of daytime 
breathlessness and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_375561].
1) Sleep  Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) - part D [Flemons1998]. It is designed to assess 
quality of life pertaining to sleep disturbances, as well as the impact of treatment on QoL. It 
has been used as a sensitive measure of health-related QoL in ALS [Bourke2006, 
Jackson2001, Bourke2003].
2) Motor  Neurone Disease Dsypnoea Rating Scale (MDRS) - subscale D [Dorman2007]. Dorman 
et al. described an ALS-speciﬁc assessment, the Motor Neurone Disease Dsypnoea Rating 
Scale (MDRS), as one with high construct validity and responsiveness. The dyspnea subscale 
(MDRS-D) of this tool has patients choose which activities of daily living they have 
experienced shortness of breath in the past two weeks and how severe the epi[INVESTIGATOR_324508] 
[Dougan2000].
3) Short  Form 36 (SF-36) [Ware1992]. This is a generic, coherent, and easily administered 
quality-of-life measures which has been shown to be sensitive for mental and physical 
health assessment in ALS [Bourke2006, Jackson2001, Bourke2003].
4) SAQLI  parts E and F (NIV users only). These sections ask about problems that may have 
arisen due to NIV use and how respi[INVESTIGATOR_375562].

7.3 Duration  of Participation
Part 1: The study  procedures, including screening, consent, assessment, and survey, are expected to 
take 45 minutes.  Administration of the simulated PFT with patient participants will be performed on the 
day of a scheduled clinic visit.
Part 2: The participant team  will be enrolled for approximately one year.  During this time, participants 
will engage in approximately five standard PFT assessments as part of normal clinical activities, requiring 
no additional time commitment.  All participants will complete monthly surveys which will take [ADDRESS_469854]  Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number  of Subjects
Approximately (but no  more than) 103.  We will enroll 40 patient/caregiver teams for Part 1 and 40 
patient/caregiver teams for Part 2.  Participants in the two studies may overlap.  Up to 20 practice 
control participants may be recruited for Part 1.  Up to three respi[INVESTIGATOR_375564].
8.2 Sample  size determination
Our sample size  is predetermined based on our subjective ability to recruit patients within the time 
frame of the study. Power analysis was based on studies of FVC decline. Lo Coco et al., [LoCoco2006], 
showed that 50% of study participants dropped below 50% predicted FVC in one year. Given that our 
exclusion criteria for Part [ADDRESS_469855] many of the 37% of individuals in their study who were “slow 
progressors,” we estimate that 75% of patients enrolled in our study will meet the respi[INVESTIGATOR_375565]. This results in a sample size per arm of n=15, which provides 80% power to detect a 
difference in mean outcome between the two groups if the effect size is found to be 0.95.  
Assuming a monthly change  in FVC of 3.5±3.4% found by [CONTACT_375597]. [Schiffman1993], we 
conducted 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations of 40 participants declining at this rate for 12 months. Half 
were sampled once every three months, and half were sampled every month. 80.6±6.3% of simulated 
participants met the requirements for NIV recommendation, in roughly equal proportions across groups. 
The average FVC at recommendation was 47.0% predicted in the experimental group, and 43.4% 
predicted in the control group. The effect size of the difference in FVC between groups was .964±.343. 
Similarly, the two measures of QoL obtained at NIV recommendation are powered with an 80% chance 
to detect improvement of quality of life in the experimental group if the effect size is also found to be 
0.95. This corresponds to a mean score difference of 1.[ADDRESS_469856] deviation 
of 1.6 [Flemons1998]. Although there is no published data on the standard deviation of MDRS-D scores, 
the range and format of questions is similar enough to estimate a comparable difference between 
groups is needed.

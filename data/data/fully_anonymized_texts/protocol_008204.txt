 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized , Double -blind, P lacebo -controlled Phase II Study of 
BNC210 in Adults with Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) . 
Rationale for the Study:  BNC210  acts through negative allosteric modulation (NAM) of the 
alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  and is under development for 
the treatment of  anxiety , and trauma  and stressor -related  disorders . 
          
 
. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of BNC210 in 
subjects  with a diagnosis of PTSD, a stress and trauma related 
disorder with limited pharmacotherapy treatment options.  
Objectives:  Primary Objectives  
• To assess the effects of BNC210  on Investigator -rated 
symptoms of  PTSD  measured by  [CONTACT_9142] -Administered 
PTSD Scale for the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition  (DSM -5) (CAP S-5) scores .  
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the effects of BNC210 on Investigator -rated 
symptoms of PTSD measured by [CONTACT_776454] s (Intrusion ; Avoidance; Negative Alterations in 
Cognition and Mood ; Arousal and Reactivity ) of the CAPS -5. 
• To assess the effect s of BNC210  on other psychi atric outcomes  
in subjects with PTSD  including anxiety  and depression.  
• To assess the effects of BNC210 on  global functioning  and 
Quality o f Life  in subjects with PTSD . 
• To assess the effect s of BNC210 on patient -reported outcomes 
in subjects with PTSD . 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of BNC210 in subjects with 
PTSD.

Safety Analys es 
Suicidal ideation, self -injurious non -suicidal and suicidal behavior 
will be monitored from  Baseline to  week 1 5 using the Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).   
Other safety parameters ( e.g. vital sign measurements,  
electrocardiogram  (ECG ) readings, physical examination, and 
laboratory tests) will be monitored from Baseline to  week 1 5 and 
describe d using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_776455], and by [CONTACT_776456].  
All adverse events ( AEs) will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_6490], organ class and preferred term with:  
• The number of subjects with at least one AE and number of 
AEs for each treatment group and overall . 
• Analyses taking into account intensity and drug relationship to 
treatment could also be carried out.  
Description of potentially clinically significant values will be 
performed for vital signs, ECG parameters, blood chemi stry and 
hematology parameters.  All these parameters will be listed by [CONTACT_776457]. Th e data outside of normal ranges will be 
flagged.

 1 INTRODUCTION  AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM -5), Post-Traumatic Stress D isorder (P TSD ) results from exposure to a traumatic event 
during which an individual experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with the actual threat 
of death or serious injury, or the threat to physical integrity to self or others. PTSD symptoms 
can be divided into four clusters: (1) persistent re -experiencing of the trauma, (2) avoidance 
behavior associated with feelings of deta chment and emotional numbness, (3) negative 
alterations in cognitions and mood, and ( 4) symptoms of increased autonomic arousal.  
Treatment is based on early interventions, psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (cognitive behavioral therapy 
[Otis et al. 200 9], exposure, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR], etc.)  
and pharmacotherapy. For the latter, only two pharmacological agents, the antidepressants 
Paxil® (paroxetine) and Zoloft® (sertraline), belonging to the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors class (SSRIs), are FDA -approved for the treatment of PTSD, but  they have not 
been shown to ameliorate the full range of PTSD symptoms, and complete remission of 
symptoms is rare. Combat exposure, in particular, produces a virulent form of PTSD, which 
is highly resistant to current pharmacological interventions. Overa ll, antidepressants have (1) 
moderate efficacy (2) marginal efficacy on male military populations (3) rebound effect upon 
treatment discontinuation (worsening symptoms) (4) severe side effects upon initiation of 
treatment (depression, generalized anxiety, panic, substance abuse, suicidal ideation), (5) 
elevated risk of suicide in young adults (non -approved treatment for children) and (6) 
potenti al for sexual dysfunction.  
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (B ZD) use is not indicated for PTSD. Data on alprazolam show that it ha s a 
deleterious effect on PTSD recovery during exposure therapy ( Rothbaum et al. 2014 , Rosen 
et al. 2013 ) and it is now contraindicated  in the Veterans Administration Guideline 
(Kobayashi et al. 2015 ). The [ADDRESS_1066287] the use of BZDs in PTSD ( Bandelow et al. 2008 ). In 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_119262], the concomitant use of BZD with an antidepressant increased the 
risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], both in psychiatric and non -psychiatric wards ( Hawkins et al 2013 ). 
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a reduction in prescriptions, 30% of PTSD patients still received BZD in 
2012 ( Lund et al. 201 2). 
Community -based epi[INVESTIGATOR_776430] a lifetime prevalence of PTSD ranging 
from 8% to 12% ( Kessler et al. 1995 , Breslau et al. 1991 ), with at -risk individuals (victims of 
criminal violence, survivors of civilian disasters, combat veterans) showing a prevalence rate 
from 4% to 30% ( Berger et al. 2012 , Burri et al. 2014 , Thomas et al. 2010 , Winfield et al. 
1990 , Shore et al. 1989 , Jordan et al. 1991 ).

Protocol No.: BNC210.007  Date:  30-May-[ADDRESS_1066290] established safety, 
tolerabi lity and demonstrated a reduction of CCK -induced anxiety in healthy subjects, as well 
as cognitive profiling. A Phase II imaging (fMRI) study  
 showed significant effects of 
BNC210 on anxiety -related  brain activity and defensive  behavior  in drug -free GAD patients . 
In line with preclinical data demonstrating BNC210’s positive effects on fear extinction, and 
in order to expand the usefulness of BNC210 to other disorders related to anxiety, this 
molecule will be studied in PTSD patients where deficits in fear extinction are thought to 
contribute to the pathology of this disorder. Thus, PTSD is a condition with unmet medical 
needs, for which BNC210 may be of benefit.

 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Description of Overall Study Design  and Plan  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled, multi -center  study with a 
12-week, 4-arm treatment phase (placebo and BNC210).  Subjects will attend a Screening 
visit within 3 weeks before randomization to  confirm eligibility . Approximately 192 subjects  
who fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria  will be randomiz ed on 
Day 1 using a 1:1 :1:1 ratio. Subjects will then complete 12 weeks of their allocated treatment. 
The IP (total daily dose 300  mg, 600  mg or 1200  mg) or Placebo will be taken bid with food.  
Subjects will return to the clinical site at weekly  or 2-weekly intervals  to receive study 
medication, complete  safety assessments and questionnaires.  Subjects are then requested  to 
attend a post -study  visit at 1 5 weeks  (i.e., [ADDRESS_1066291] treat ment) . 
The details are included in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design Including Choice of Control Groups  
This randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase II study design was chosen to 
investigate whether BNC210 causes a decrease in symptoms of PTSD, as assessed by [CONTACT_150857] -5 (National Centre for PTSD ) compared to placebo . Subjects  will be randomized to 
ensure that there are no order effects  and to minimize bias . The study will be double -blind to 
ensure that the patients and clinic staff are unaware of the dosing assignment and to minimize 
the potential f or bias in study assessments or in reporting of AEs.  
Subjects will still receive standard of care, even if randomized to placebo as their wellbeing 
will be monitored through application of various questionnaires  and safety assessments.  
Subjects who recei ved psychotherapy on a regular basis in the previous 3 months before 
inclusion into the study may continue to receive this care. A stable as needed ( PRN ) dose of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_776431].

Investigator will be responsible for enrolling patients who are referred by [CONTACT_776465].  All patients will be evaluated a gainst the study eligibility 
criteria at Screening.  Only eligible patient s will proceed through to the treatment phase. 
Patients must complete all protocol defined visits at study centers  listed on the Clinical Trial 
Notification (CTN) form (Australia) and the  Investigational  New Drug (IND)  application  
([LOCATION_003]).   
At the Screening visit, each patient will participate in the informed consent process and sign 
and date the  patient  informed consent form ( PI[INVESTIGATOR_62724]) before any procedures specified in this 
protocol are p erformed.

 7 EFFICACY VARIABLES  
7.1 Definitions of Variables  
All the assessments/questionnaires below will be assessed at time-points  as captured  in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
7.1.1 Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM -5 (CAPS -5) 
The CAPS -[ADDRESS_1066328] week . Information about the frequency and intensity of each item is 
combined into a severity rating, and the CAPS -5 total severity is calculated by [CONTACT_776475] 20 PTSD symptoms in the DSM -5 (National Centre for PTSD ). The 
severity of PTSD is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1066329] for DSM -5 (PCL -5) 
The PCL -5 is a 20 -item self -report assessment of the 20 DSM -5 symptoms of PTSD 
(National Centre for PTSD ). Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 
(extremely).  
7.1.3 Clinical Global Impression scales – Improvement and Severity (CGI -I/CGI -S) 
The CGI -S is a rating scale designed to assess the severity of the subject’s  symptoms, and the 
CGI-I is designed to assess the change in the subject ’s condition since the initial assessment. 
Severity is rated on the CGI -S from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (amo ng the most extremely 
ill of subjects). The changes in the subject’s  condition are rated on the CGI -I from 1 (very 
much improved) to 7 (very much worse).  
7.1.4 Patient  Global Impression Scales – Improvement and Severity (PGI -I/PGI -S) 
The PGI -S is a self-rating scale designed to assess the  severity of the subject’s symptoms, and 
the PGI -I is designed to assess the change in the subject’s condition since the initial 
assessment. Severity is rated on the CGI -S from 1 (normal) to 4 (severe).  The changes i n the 
subject’s condition are rated on the CGI-I from 1 (very much better ) to 7 (very much worse).  
7.1.5 Assessment of Quality of Life ( AQoL -8D) 
The AQoL -8D is a [ADDRESS_1066330]’s quality of life 
on the following eight dimensions; Independent Living, Happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], Mental Health, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
Relationships , Self -Worth, Pain  and the Senses.  The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
complete.  
7.1.6 Hamilton Anxiety Rating  Scale (HAM -A) 
The HAM -A is an interview questionnaire that measu res severity of anxiety symptoms based 
on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and 
behavior  during the interview ( Hamilton, 1959 ). It takes approximately 15 -20 minutes to 
complete and each parameter is rated on a scale of 0  (not present)  to 4 (very severe) .

CONFIDENTIAL       Page 43 of 62 
 7.1.7 Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10 -item self-diagnostic a nd clinician -rated questionnaire to measure the 
presence and severity of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_620767]: 1) 
apparent sadness; 2) reported sadness; 3) inner tension; 4) reduced sleep; 5) reduced appetite; 
6) concentration difficulti es; 7) lassitude; 8) inability to feel; 9) pessimistic thoughts; and 10) 
suicidal thoughts ( Williams and Kobak, 2008 ). The rater must decide whether the rating lies 
on defined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1, 3, 5).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1066331] be completed at the same 
time during each visit ( + 1hr of baseline assessment start time).  
 
A Paired Associates Learning (PAL ) task will be used to assess epi[INVESTIGATOR_58589]. During the 
test, boxes are displayed on the screen and open in turn to reveal a number of patterns. 
Participants are instructed to try to remember the location in which each pattern was shown. 
After all the boxes have been opened, each pattern is then shown in the center of the screen in 
a randomized order, and the participant touches the box in which the pattern was located. If 
an error is made, all the patterns are re -presented to remind the participant of their locations. 
As the test progresses so the stages become more difficult as the number of patterns to be 
remembered increases, up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1066332] trial memory 
score.  
 
A Spatial Working Memory (SWM) task will be used to assess  the ability of the subject to 
retain spatial information and manipulate it in working memor y. It is a self -ordered task that 
also gives a measure of strategy. A number of colored  boxes are presented on the screen, and 
the computer hides a token in these boxes one at a time. The participant is instructed to touch 
the boxes in turn to search for t he token that has been hidden. When a token is found it should 
be placed in a home area on the right side of the screen. The participant then searches for 
more tokens until the same number of tokens as the number of colored  boxes has been found. 
The key ta sk instruction is that the computer will never hide a token in the same colored  box 
twice in the same problem. As the test progresses, so it becomes more difficult. The key 
outcome measures for this task are between errors and strategy.  
 
A Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP)  task will be used to assess  sustained attention, 
outputting measures of response accuracy, target sensitivity and reaction times. For the RVP 
task, single digits appear in a pseudo -random order at a rate of [ADDRESS_1066333] a series of 3 -digit target sequences (e.g. 3 -5-7; 
2-4-6; 4-6-8) and respond by [CONTACT_776476]. Nine target sequ ences appear every minute. Key outcome 
measures include target sensitivity and reaction times.

the CANTAB User Manual for details on how to capture this information.  
7.1.9 Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS is a rating scale designed to  measure impairment in three domains: work/school, 
social life, and family life/home responsibilities. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 (not at all) 
to 10 (extremely), for a total score of 0 to 30.   
7.1.10  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)  
The PSQI is a que stionnaire consisting of 19 questions designed to assess the following 
7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (i.e., how long it takes 
to fall asleep), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sl eepi[INVESTIGATOR_398334], and daytime dysfunction over the previous month. Each question is weighted on 
a scale from 0 to 3 and a global score is obtained, with lower scores correlating with better 
sleep quality.

 9.6 Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS ) 
The C -SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale designed to identify behaviors that may be 
indicative of a patient’s intent to commit suicide. The scale is administered via a semi -
structured interview and measures both passive and active suicidal ideation and the intensity 
and duration of the ideation. Both suicida l and non -suicidal self -injurious behavior is also 
assessed.  
9.7 Adverse Events (AEs)  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776436], recording, 
and reporting of events that meet the criteria and definition of various AEs as listed below. 
AEs will be recorded from first administration of IP through Week 1 5 (Post Study Visit). The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776436], recording and 
reporting of pregnancy and appropriate follow up.  
9.7.[ADDRESS_1066337] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefor e be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
AEs will not include:  
• A medica l or surgical procedure such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion (although the condition that leads to the procedure may be an AE).  
• A pre -existing disease or condition present at the start of the study that does not 
worsen during the s tudy  
• Any situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (for example, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_715836])  
• An overdose of either the IP or a concurrent medication without any resulting signs or 
symptoms . 
9.7.[ADDRESS_1066338] onset dates.  
The severity of each AE will be categorized using the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (Mild) :  usually transient; requires no special treatment and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.   No limitation in daily activity.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) :  produces a low level of inconvenience to the subject and may 
interfere with daily activities.  These events are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884].   Some limitation in daily activity.  
Bionomics Limited  Version 4. 0 
Protocol No.: BNC210.007  Date:  30-May-2018 
CONFIDENTIAL       Page 49 of 62 
 • Grade 3 (Severe) :  interrupts daily activity and requires systemic drug therapy or other 
medical treatment.   Unable to perform daily activity.  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a category 
utilized for rating th e intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
An AE is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined serious outcomes as 
described in Section 9. 8. 
9.7.[ADDRESS_1066339] be graded as 
follows:  
• Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the 
etiology  is unrelated to the study drug; the subject did not receive the study 
medication or the temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
study medication is not reasonable or the event is clearly related to other factors such 
as the ’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy.  
• Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug but which could also be explained by 
[CONTACT_776478], information on drug withdrawals may 
be lacking or unclear.  
• Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response 
on withdra wal (de -challenge): re -challenge information is not required to fulfill  this 
definition.  
• Definite:  a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug or in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tiss ues, 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug, and that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and 
reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure (re -challenge).  
9.7.4 Documentation of Advers e Events by [CONTACT_776479], it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776437] (e .g. progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776438]. Additional reporting 
requireme nts for an AE meeting serious criteria are discussed in  Section 9.8 below. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776439] a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In all cases, when available, the diagnosis 
should be reported as the event and not the individual signs/sympt oms.  
9.7.[ADDRESS_1066340] Abnormalities as Adverse Events  
Abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs and vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_776440] b e recorded as AEs.  
 
Bionomics Limited  Version 4. 0 
Protocol No.: BNC210.007  Date:  30-May-[ADDRESS_1066341] administration of IP will be reported as AEs.  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators  will exercise their medical a nd scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment 
is clinically significant.  
9.8 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
An SAE  is any AE that:  
• Results in d eath, or  
• Is life -threatening, or  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hosp italization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event/reaction in which 
the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not refer to 
an event/ reaction, which  hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Any pl anned procedures that require admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776441] (unless the underlying 
condition has worsened or the procedure results in a worsening of the subject’s condition).  In 
addition pregnancy that occurs during the course of the study or absence of a treatment effect 
will also not be considered to be an SAE.  
9.8.1 Reporting for Serious Adverse Events (24 Hours)  
SAEs must be followed until their signs and symptoms ha ve remitted or stabilized , until the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or until Week 1 5 (Post Study Visit),  whichever comes last.  
Investigators are not obligated to active ly seek SAEs after Week 1 5 (Post Study Visit ). 
However, if an Investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after study participation for a 
subject has concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study drug, it should be 
promptly reported.  
AEs meeting serious criteria MUST be reported promptly to the designated  Clinical Research 
Orga nization  (CRO ) Safety Desk  within 24  hours, and  to the HREC/IRB  in accordance with 
their safety reporting policy.  The SAE report form will always be completed as thoroughly as 
possible with all available details of the event and signed by [CONTACT_079] (or 
Designee). If the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776442], 
he/she will  not wait to receive additional information before reporting the event. The SAE 
report form will be updated when additional information is received.

 Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).   A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_776443].  
10.4 Sample Size  
Sample size estimation is based on the following:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
.  With the 
level of significance set to 0.[ADDRESS_1066346], a sample size of 36 subjects per arm is 
required to achieve a power of 80%.  For PTSD patients a relatively high withdraw al rate is 
anticipated, therefore the sample size was increased by 33% to 48 per arm (=1.33x 36) 
(Hoskins et al. 2015 , Marshall et al. 2001 ; Marshall et al. 2007 ; Tucker et al. 2001 ). Because 
this is a Phase II study  the level of significance will be 0.05 with no adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.

Further details of the MMRM and MI for missing values will be included in the SAP prior to 
database lock and subsequent unblinding.  
Each dose group will be compared to placebo. Because this is a Phase II study , the level of 
significa nce will be 0.05 with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Additional sensitivity 
analyses will include:  
• MMRM with the ‘as observed ’ (i.e. no imputation for missing values)  dataset.  
• MMRM  with the last observation carried forward (LOCF)  dataset . 
• MMRM  with the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF)  dataset .

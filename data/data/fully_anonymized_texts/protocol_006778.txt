Clinical Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of IDP-126 Gel in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of Clinical Centers : Multicenter, approximately 15 study centers in North America   
Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IDP -126 Gel in 
subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . The safety and efficacy of once daily application of 
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel. 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 12- week study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP -[ADDRESS_92755] a clinical diagnosis of 
moderate to severe acne (defined as an Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [ EGSS] of 3 or 4), presenting 
with 30-100 inflammatory facial lesions  (papules, pus tules, and nodules),  35-150 non-inflammatory facial 
lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤  [ADDRESS_92756] visits 
include Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, at which safety and efficacy 
assessments will be conducted  (Screening and Baseline may occur on the same day if no washout is 
required) . Study drug will be dispensed to the s ubjects at the Baseline, Week [ADDRESS_92757]  baseline study visit s (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  (in the evening), as instructed by [CONTACT_85167].  
The investigator will assess the subject’s face at each study visit. Information on reported and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination and vital sign  measurement s will 
be performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study ) for all subjects. Blood samples wil l be collected  
from subjects at Baseline  and Week 12, for CBC/Diff and serum  chemistry. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Basel ine (prior 
to randomization ), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Additionally , serum pregnancy testing will be performed 
at Baseline and Week 12.  
In addition, at selected study center s, standardized photography of the face will be performed at Baseline, 
and Weeks  4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized in a  2:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:  
• 120 Subjects to IDP -126 Gel ( clindamycin phosphate 1.2% /BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% ) 
• 60 Subjects to IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel

 Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
• IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel applied once daily for 12 weeks.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Co-Primary efficacy:  
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP -126 Vehicle Gel. 
Co-primary endpoints are:  
(1) Absolute  change from Baseline to Week 12 in - inflammatory lesion counts  
(2) Absolute  change from Baseline to Week 12 in - non-inflammatory lesion counts,   
      and,  
(3) Percent age of subjects who achieve at least a two -grade reduction from baseline and are Clear or 
Almost Clear at Week 12 in the EGSS. 
Secondary efficacy:  
• Percent change  in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percent  change  in non -inflammatory  lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
 
Supportive Efficacy:  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to  Week 2  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 8 from Baseline in the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4 from Baseline in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Sc ore 
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from Baseline in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
Efficacy Measurements:  
Lesion Counts  
At each visit , the e valuator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules , pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately , but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At baseline, eligible subjects may have no more than 2 nodules. Nodules will 
be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be counted at the same time rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The evaluator will als o 
count the total number of non-inflammatory  lesion s (open and closed comedones). The  same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits from baseline to week [ADDRESS_92765].  
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule: An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less than 5 mm in 
diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter  
Non-inflammatory  lesions  are defined as follows:

 Open comedone (blackhead): A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly pi[INVESTIGATOR_85131] (whitehead): A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with a white 
appearance  
 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At ea ch visit , the severity will be determined based on evaluator- blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
subject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same eva luator should assess the subject at both the 
Baseline and Week [ADDRESS_92766] clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], though not pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] -red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 
1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones a nd papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions  
 
Safety Measurements:  
Safety evaluations will include the following:  
• The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous reaction (erythema, scaling, 
hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], itching, burning, or stinging) graded at a level of [ADDRESS_92767] application of study drug.  
• The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous adverse event (AE) irrespective of severity grade at any point in the study fo llowing the first application of study drug.  
• Changes from baseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_67486].  
• Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of ne w and ongoing AEs.  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_85169] (scaling, erythema, hypo/hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study visit.  Itching, burning and stinging (cutaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as an average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling, erythema, and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (cutaneous safety) will be assessed by [CONTACT_85170]. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE.

 Statistical Methods  
All statistic al processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. Tests of lesion count superiority will be bas ed on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and 
analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an 
ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covar iate. The co -primary analysis of the dichotomized EGSS will be based on logistic regression with 
factors of treatment group and analysis center. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the method of Markov Cha in Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  
Additionally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to the 
MCMC imputation. The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS. Finally, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_85132].     
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts will be recorded for each Subject at Baseline and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each  Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” 
with a Subject considered a success if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at Week 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_92768] Clear.  
Populations Analyzed:  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted. The ITT population will consist of all randomized 
subjects who received study drug.  
All subjects who are randomized and receive at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug will be included in 
the safety population . A per -protocol (PP) analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the 
PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations ( i.e., 
any subject or investigator activity that could  have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration 
of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects 
in the ITT population who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications.  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit,.  
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_92769] baseline study visit prior to Week 12 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects may not miss more than [ADDRESS_92770] take 80% -120% of expected doses). The number of expected 
doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study.  
• Out of visit window at the Week [ADDRESS_92771] (and/or worsening of condition)
 will be included in the PP population. Prior to 
breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Approximately 180 subjects  with moderate or severe acne will be  enrolled and randomized to  the 
follow ing treatment groups:  
• 120 s ubjects to receive IDP-126 Gel, once -daily application  
• [ADDRESS_92772] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_85171], PP, and Safety analysis sets.

 Efficacy  Evaluation : 
Primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) populations.   
Secondary and supportive analyses will be conducted on the ITT population.   
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses include  the absolute change  from baseline  in inflammatory and in non -
inflammatory lesions, and the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity Score.  The pre -specified time 
point will be Week 12. All of the testing relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions will use the methods introduced in Section 1 2. 
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts from baseline  to Weeks 12, [ADDRESS_92773] a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s G lobal Severity Score from baseline to Week 12.  
Supportive:  
Additional supportive efficacy endpoints includ e percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions counts from B aseline at Week [ADDRESS_92774] a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2,  4, and 8. 
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who receive medication and are confirmed to have dosed at least once will constitute the 
safety population. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_85172], Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability 
Evaluations, vital signs/abbreviated physical examinations, and safety laboratory results.  
Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability  Evaluatio n scores (erythema, scaling, hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_92775] results will be provided.  
All previous and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary. Previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85133].  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorde d and classified using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug, the action taken regarding study drug  
usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_85173]. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
by [CONTACT_85174].  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_85175]. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_85176] e ach category.  
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92776] 5% of subjects (either treatment group). The percentage of subjects for each treatment group will be compared using a Fisher’s Exact test.  All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be 
listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing the verbatim descriptions given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, and drug relatednes s. The AE onset will also be 
shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_85177].  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued f rom the study and a list of subjects who experienced 
SAEs will also be provided.  
Subject Self -Assessments  
Subjects will be asked to complete an  Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire  during the study. The  
Investigator assessments (EGSS and  lesion counts) will be conducted inde pendently of this  subject self -
assessment. Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective 
responses will be compared between treatment groups for trends . 
 This study will be performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice including the archiving of essential study documents. This protocol follows guidelines outlined by [CONTACT_85178]. 
All data furnished to the investigator and his/her sta ff, and all data obtained through this stud, will be regarded 
as confidential and proprietary in nature and will not be disclosed to any third party, except for the [LOCATION_002]

In this protocol, “sponsor duties” refer to responsibilities that will be performed by [CONTACT_103], the sponsor’s designee, or the sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO) . In this protocol, “investigator” refers to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her des ignee, 
who is responsible for performing the study procedures and assessments. 
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92785] prevalent among 
teenagers, usually triggered by [CONTACT_85179] (Krakowski 2008) . Although acne generally resolves by [CONTACT_14898] 25, approximately 3% to 
8% of adults 25 to 44 years of age present with acne ( Goodman 2006, White 1998) . The 
pathogenesis is complex and appears to involve 4 primary features: stimulation of sebum gland acti vity, bacterial proliferation (especially Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494]), abnormal 
follicular hyperkeratinization and resultant obstruction of the sebaceous follicles, and the release of inflammatory mediators ( Thiboutot 2009) . These changes in acne patients result in 
the formation of clinical inflammatory lesions including superficial pustules such as comedones (popularly known as “blackheads” or “whiteheads”) and more deeply located papules, nodules, and cysts ( Krakowski 2008) . The areas most affected by [CONTACT_85180][INVESTIGATOR_85134], where the sebaceous glands are particularly active ( Webster 2002) . 
Given the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to acne, for maximum efficacy, consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy consisting of medications with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action ( Thiboutot 2009) . In 
particular, the guideline s advocate the use of a retinoid and an antibiotic (eg, clindamycin 
phosphate) or antibacterial (eg, benzoyl peroxide [ BPO ]) as first -line and maintenance 
therapy in patients with both inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesions ( Ghali 2009, 
Thiboutot 2009) .  
Although antibiotics like clindamycin were among the first effective treatments for acne, recent acne management guidelines discourage the use of antibiotics as monotherapy due to the development of bacterial resistance ( Nast 2012 , Thiboutot 2009) . The guidelines also 
recommend limiting both the frequency and duration of antibiotic use for acne, and to use antibiotics in conjunction with BPO to minimize the development of resistance at sites of application ( Thiboutot 2009) . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_85135], comedolytic, and 
anti-inflammatory, and  has bactericidal activity against Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494]  (Gollnick 
2003, Harper 2010, Tanghetti 2009) . To date, there is no evidence of P acnes  resistance to 
BPO ( Harper 2010 ). Further, the combination of BPO with chemical s tructures that contain a 
tertiary amine within their structure, such as clindamycin, increases the generation of BPO radicals and thereby [CONTACT_85181] a real biologic synergism ( Burkhart 2008)  that contributes to 
their complementary effects on acne pathogenesis.  
Retinoids (eg, adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) are anticomedogenic, anti -inflammatory, and 
inhibit microcomedone formation ( Ghali 2009, Zaenglein 2008) . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], daily retinoid 
monotherapy is used to inhibit the formation of comedones and usually clear even severe comedonal acne within a few months ( Shalita 2001) . Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a

 naphthoi c acid derivative with retinoid -like properties. In the cell, adapalene can bind 
specifically to retinoic acid nuclear (and not cytosolic) receptors to exert its effects 
(Zaenglein 2008) . Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies  have demonstrated that 
adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes (Pi[CONTACT_49230] 2007) . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_85136] (US) for more than [ADDRESS_92786] also been paired with antibiotic/BPO fixed-dose combination products 
(Bowman 2005, Del Rosso 2007, Kircik 2007, Tanghetti 2006)  and, consistently across 
studies of these products, regimens t hat included a topi[INVESTIGATOR_85137] ( Thiboutot 2009) . Adapalene (0.1% gel and cream formulations) has a 
lower  irritation potential relative to other retinoids ( Dosik 2005a , Dosik 2005b)  and is 
therefore well suited for use in combination topi[INVESTIGATOR_85138], particularly those containing BPO, which is also potentially irritating (Del Rosso 2007) .  
Thus, treatment with a combination of topi[INVESTIGATOR_85139], BPO, and adapa lene 
can be expected to provide optimal overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_85140]: each of these agents has some degree of anti -inflammatory activity; both the antibiotic and BPO decrease 
P acnes  proliferation ( Weiss 2004) ; BPO is also keratolytic ( Harper 2010) ; and adapalene 
additionally regulates keratinization ( Zaenglein 2008 ).  
A fixed -dose combination treatment is optimal to enhance patient adherence due to 
simplified application regimens (eg, once daily versus sequential morning/evening administration  of each active agent ) and also to preclude substance incompatibilities due to 
application errors (eg, oxidation by [CONTACT_85182]) (Thielitz 2013) . Of 
note, when an adapalene 0.1% gel and a clindamycin 1.2%/BPO 5% fixed-dose combination gel were combined in equal amounts by [CONTACT_8497], there was no resultant instability of any of the active components for up to 24 hours ( Bikowski 2006) .  
The current study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDP-126 Gel , a novel 
fixed -dose combination of clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapalene (1.2 %/3.1%/0.15%), 
relative to its vehicle for the treatment of acne vulgaris in subjects 9 years of age and older.

 6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily  
application of IDP-126 Gel  compared with vehicle  (IDP -126 Vehicle Gel) in subjects with 
moderate to severe acne vulgaris.  
7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel -group study 
designed to assess the safety , efficacy and tolerability of IDP-[ADDRESS_92787] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris ( a score of 3  or 4 [moderate to 
severe] on the Evaluator’s Global Severity Scale [ EGSS ]), presenting with 30-100 
inflammatory  facial lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 35-150 non- inflammatory  facial 
lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤  2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled into this study and randomized into 1 of 
2 treatment groups  in a 2:1  ratio:  
• 120 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 60 subjects  to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily  application  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  15 independent study centers. The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline, and at subsequent follow-up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12). 
An interactive web based Interactive R esponse Technology (IRT) will be employed to 
facilitate randomization of study subjects. Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers 
will be ge nerated centrally by [CONTACT_6606]. At each study  center , subject numbers will be 
assigned consecutively at the Screening visit , starting with 001. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_85141], in the 
evening,  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening prior to the Week 12 visit), with the exception of 
study visit days (Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be applied (also by [CONTACT_423]) after the study visit is completed, at the investigational center . The initial applicatio n 
will be done at the investigational center  as per instruction from the study coordinator or 
designee. The subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight in order to prevent sunburn. Use of sunscreens with at least a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 and protective clothing ( eg, a hat)  is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Subjects 
will apply their daily treatments at home as explained by [CONTACT_85183]. During post baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12), the subjects will be asked to return the ir used pumps of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps of study

 drug ( new pumps dispensed on Weeks 4 and 8 only ; Week [ADDRESS_92788] no new study drug 
dispensed; and Week 12 will be final visit) . During the study, each subject will only be 
permitted to use approved, non- medicated  cleansers , moisturizers , and sunscreens . 
During the study, s ubjects will be asked to complete the  Acne -Specific Quality of Life 
questionna ire (Acne-QoL, Appendix  17.3). The Investigator assessments (EGSS, lesion 
counts) will be conducted independently of this  subject self -assessment . The EGSS should be 
completed prior to the lesion counts.  The Acne -QoL questionnaire will be completed at 
Baseline and Week 12 . Inferential statistical analyse s will not be performed on the 
questionnaire; the subjective responses will be compared between treatment groups for 
trends. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination, along with vital sign measurements , will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study , final visit) for all subjects . 
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12 for CBC/Diff and 
serum chemistry.  For all female subjects of childbearing potential (FOCBP) , urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, confirmed at prior to randomization at 
Baseline, and then repeated at Weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_92789] will also be 
conducted at Baseline and Week 12. 
Subjects who terminate their study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.

9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double-blind study in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to the investigator/evaluator and all subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Eligible s ubjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 ( IDP-126 
Gel : IDP-126 Vehicle Gel ).  
The study center will assign e ach screened subject a unique 6-digit study subject number. The 
number will consist of the 3 -digit study center number (pre -assigned by S pons or/designee) and 
the 3 -digit chronological screening number, starting with 001 (eg, 101001, 101002). The  
randomization system will assign the study drug kit to subjects based on a randomization code ; 
the kit will be dispen sed to the subjects at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8 by [CONTACT_85192] . 
A study drug log will document the inventory, dispensing , and collecting  of study drug at each 
study center.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each study center . Study drug supplies will be distributed to the study center s to maintain the 
randomization ratio within each study center .  
As a double-blind study, the investigators /evaluators , the study center  staff, the Sponsor, and the 
clinical monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjec ts. 
Delegated staff members at each study center  will dispense the study drugs and will collect all 
used and unused study drug pumps as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are entered into the database, verified, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and the database is locked. 
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92802] discussing the situation with the m edical monitor and the Sponsor (or 
designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contact[CONTACT_85193] a Sponsor r epresentative. The investigator will record the code break in the 
subject’s source documents. 
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
Any concomitant medication or therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be 
recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions 
during the study for the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]/physical treatments  on the face that have a 
known beneficial effect for acne vulgaris:  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_85128]  1 week  
Non-allowed moisturizers or sunscreens on the face  1 week  
Antibiotics on the fac e 2 weeks  
Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -acne drugs on the face  2 weeks  
Soaps containing antimicrobials on the face  2 weeks  
Anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroids on 
the fac e 4 weeks  
Retinoids, including retinol on the face  4 weeks  
Chemical peel/Microdermabrasion on the face  4 weeks  
Light ( e.g. LED , PDT ) therapy on the face  [ADDRESS_92803] be noted in source documents and the eCRF.  
In addition, there is a mandatory washout period and restriction on use during the study for the 
following systemic drugs: 
Corticosteroids (including intramuscular injections ; 
inhaled corticosteroids are allowed)  4 weeks  
Antibiotics  4 weeks  
Other systemic acne treatments  4 weeks  
Systemic retinoids  6 months  
 
Subjects using concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85145] (including, but not limited to , those listed above) should not be 
withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. Examples of products/procedures that are prohibited during the course of the study include (but not limited to) acne surgery, use of comedone removal strips, and use of comedogenic products (makeup, shaving products). With the exception of the study drug and the treatments listed  above, no other 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/physical  treatment for acne will be permitted.  
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92804] will be considered concomitant therapy (e.g., facial procedures, surgical procedures, 
investigations, and operations), and any medication, both over-the- counter (OTC) or 
prescription, used by [CONTACT_85194] (eg,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Tylenol, 
birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vitamins). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication / 
therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant medication / therapy should be noted on the Concomitant T herapy or Medication source document and e CRF.  
All cleansers , moisturizers , sunscreens, and other topi[INVESTIGATOR_85146] t medicated  will be captured on the Prior and Concomitant Therapy source document and 
eCRF. Subjects must use investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleansers , moisturizers , and

Subjects should avoid excessive ultraviolet ( UV) exposure by [CONTACT_85195]. Use of  sunscreens with at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during the day 
(eg, a  hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.  
9.[ADDRESS_92805] does not return his or her study drug at a particular study visit, he or she will be instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the pump(s) dispensed at each specified study visit to the next subsequent study visit. Each pump will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth  of a gram ) by a study 
coordinator or designee prior to dispensing and after collecting . The subject will also be asked to 
complete a diary calendar and will be questioned regarding study drug use since the previous visit in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying the study drug. A subject who deviates meaningfully  from th e prescribed applic ation amount will be counseled. Any missed 
applications of study drug will be noted by [CONTACT_85196], which will be collected and placed  in the appropriate source document. Missed applications will be documented in the e CRF.   
9.[ADDRESS_92806] follow the instructions exactly. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures an d/or processes approved by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. Deviations usually 
have an impact on individual subjects  or a small group of subjects  and do not involve 
inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
substantial, additional risk to the subject, when the subject or investigator has failed to adhere to

30 critical  protocol requirements ( eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subjec t was enrolled 
without prior Sponsor approval, or when there is non-adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP  guidelines. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s  source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation or protocol change to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study subject  without prior IRB/IEC 
approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) to prevent future occurrences,  should be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC f or review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the 
regulatory authorities, if required.

(Baseline, Week  2, 4, and 8) where study drug will be applied by [CONTACT_85199] . The study drug will be applied as a thin coating that is 
gently rubbed into the skin. Study drug use will be limited to the face.  
The investigator and/or trained study center  staff member wi ll instruct the subject on the proper 
study drug application procedure during  the Baseline visit (see Appendix  17.1) . All subjects will 
be instructed to apply the study drug at approximately the same time every day for 12 weeks ,

33 after cleansing  with an investigator -approved cleanser. On study visit days (B aseline, Weeks 2, 
4, and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait until the end of their study visit to apply study 
medication at the investigational site ( Note: T his will affect evening application times on study 
visit days, which is acceptable. Subjects should not apply another dose of study drug in the evening on the study visit days). No time interval between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified. S tudy center  personnel oversight of a subject’s  on-site application of study drug is 
required  at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8, to ensure training /reinforcement  of proper application 
technique.  
During daily application, s ubjects will be instructed to gently wash their face s with a n 
investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their faces dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense one pea size amount of the study drug onto the fingertip.  The study drug gel should be dotted onto 6 areas  of the face: the chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, 
and right forehead. After distributing the gel in this manner, the subject should gently rub the gel 
into the skin. This amount of drug should be sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. The subjects  should gently smooth the study drug over the face evenly. The study drug 
should become invisible almost immediately following application with gentle rubbing. If this does not happen, the investigator should instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage. The subject should wash his/her hands after applying the study drug to the face.  Subjects should also 
be instructed to place the cap back onto the pump after every use. 
At each study visit, study staff will review the subject instructions for application of study drug 
to ensure proper use and compliance with application. The subjects will be instructed to continue using the same i nvestigator -approved, non- medicated  facial cleanser , moisturizer , and sunscreen, 
and not to change products during the study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they have changed their cleansing routine. Facial makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal 
daily routine; however, subjects should be instructed not to wear makeup during study visits as it 
may interfere with the evaluator’s assessments. Subjects must also agree to use non -
comedogenic makeup during the study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on the face.  Subjects should be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use investigator-
approved, non- medicated  sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during 
the day ( eg, a hat)  if exposure cannot be avoided.  
Subjects should be instructed to store the study drug at room te mperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact [CONTACT_85200] a replace ment  pump.  
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92812] will be made available to the Sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of 
accounting for all study drugs . Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be recorded 
with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Pumps will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the 
nearest tenth  of a gram ) before dispensing to and upon return by [CONTACT_748], and weights will be 
recorded on the pharmacy log and appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to Sponsor/designee for destruction at the conclusion of the study. If a subject 
loses/misplaces a cap, the pump should still be weighed using a cap from another pump/kit.

definitions of each lesion type counted: 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 
Papule:  An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less  
than 5 mm in diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in dia meter  
 
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 
Open comedon e (blackhead):   A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly

11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revised if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) wi ll be performed at Screening , 
Baseline and Week 12 ( end of treatment/study ); height will also be measured , but only at the 
Screening visit. Any abnormal physical exam ination  findings will be recorded and evaluated for 
AE reporting  
11.3.4 Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory analyses ( CBC/Diff and serum chemistry ) will be conducted on blood 
samples collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12. All results will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15863], should 
be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by [CONTACT_85207]’s documentation.  
For pre- menses females and FOCBP , a serum pregnancy test will be c onducted at Baseline and 
Week 12.  
11.3.5 Pregnancy Tests  
All females who are pre- menses and FOCBP  will undergo serum pregnancy testing at the 
Baseline and W eek 12  study visits, and urine pregnancy testing at Screening, prior to 
randomization at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. The urine pregnancy tests will be 
supplied by [CONTACT_2024]/designee. 
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92834] that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless 
of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. AEs  include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out-of- range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has a ppeared or worsened during 
the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study. The collection of AEs will begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to participate in the study.  
11.4.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_85208]. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered study drug -related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_85209], or reported 
spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. Any AEs deemed rel ated to treatment reported or 
observed at the final study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous safety and tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.

medical occurrence that , at any dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term “life thr eatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) . 
• Requires subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the above listed outcomes ; examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of your awareness of the event as outlined under Section 11.4.6. 
11.4.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required . 
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usuall y required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85153]; may be incapacitating or life threatening .

46 11.4.5 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related .” The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study drug. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship  between the drug and the AE. 
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal 
relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely or certai n alternative etiology 
exists.  
The following should be considered when assessing AE/SAE causality: 
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn 
and the SAE resolved, or the event recurred after re-introduction 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy 
• No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• Is the AE is directly related to study procedures or there is a lack of efficacy  
11.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within [ADDRESS_92836] within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.

Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully docum ent the event 
before notifying medical monitor and Sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85154]. Should the investi gator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to study drug ) 
that occurs within [ADDRESS_92837] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropriate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, regardless of the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_85155]. Documentation of the subject’s cause of d eath and a copy of the autopsy or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85156]. The 
Medical Monitor and CRO contact  [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_756] (and/or facsimile/email) of all subject deaths. W ritten follow -up must be r eceived 
by [CONTACT_85211]/IEC  within five ( 5) calendar days of initial notification.  
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. When a SAE persist s at the end 
of the study, the i nvestigator will conduct follow -up conta cts with the subject until the 
investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by [CONTACT_85212]/email to the medical monitor and Sponsor and/or Sponsor designee. 
11.4.7 Expedited Serious A dverse E vent Reports  
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure) and are related (i.e.,  the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. The Sponsor will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating study center s in writing for submission by [CONTACT_85213]/IEC. This notification will be in 
the form of a safety u pdate to the Investigator Brochure ( i.e., a “15 -day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determin e if the 
informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 

Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92838] 
review the following informatio n about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements 
• Contraceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent /assent  before study enrollment. 
During the study, all pre -menses females and FOCBP  should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_85214] (eg, missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study drug , the study drug must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report F orm will be submitted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  If any SAEs are associated with 
the pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, an SAE form must be filled out in addition to the Pregnancy Report Form and submitted as per section  11.4.6.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting procedure for an SAE under Section 11.4.6.  
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on 2- tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the 
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  E stimation will be done for each 
treatment group separately so that the pattern of missing ness for one group does not influence the 
estimation of missing data for another group.  Groups of complete datasets following the

subsequent imputation result inference with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. Descriptive statistics 
will also be derived from the multiply imputed datasets . 
Additionally, a model- based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to 
the MCMC imputation.  The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equatio ns) for the dichotomized EGSS. Fi nally, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_85157]. 
A statistical analysis plan, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
Evaluations and Analyses 
Inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory lesions and non-inflammatory lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and 
“failure” at Week 2, 4, [ADDRESS_92839] Clear.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire at Baseline 
and Week 12. 
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) 
population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP (supportive) population. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy  
There are three co-primary efficacy endpoints : 
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Absolute change in non- inflammatory  lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percent age of subjects who achieve at least a two -grade reduction from baseline and 
are Clear or Almost Clear at  Week 12 in the EGSS.  
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the following : 
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the EGSS  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8

This section provides the basic model and statistical approach which is used in combination with 
the multiple imputation procedures described in Section 12.1.[ADDRESS_92841] will be included in the model; otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods pr esented by  [CONTACT_85215] (1984) will be applied to the residuals 
resulting from an ANCOVA. A 2-sided p- value for the skewness test significant at 0.01 will 
imply the use of the nonparametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the results of the parametri c analysis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a nonparametric analysis 
be indicated, the absolute of percent changes in inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesions will 
be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the nonrank transformed analyses will also be presented.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_92842] of Superiority for EGSS  
The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a subject considered a success for those visits if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score is at least [ADDRESS_92843] Clear. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center.

Descriptive statistics will be presented for the following parameters by [CONTACT_85216]: 
• Frequency and percent distributions of the EGSS  at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12. 
• Frequency and percent distributions of dichotomized (two -grade reduction from 
baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear; two - grade reduction from baseline) EGSS at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to summarize inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.   
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize the absolute and percent change in 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
12.1.8 Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such tha t a minimum of 15 subjects will be enrolled for any investigator  (i.e., approximately at 
least [ADDRESS_92849] 5 subjects in the Vehicle Gel  arm) .  In the 
event that there are too few subjects for an investigator, then this investigator's data will be combined, within geographic region (i.e., US, Canada), to achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm.   The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_85217]. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrol lment, and so on.  This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_92850] insufficient 
subjects per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigato rs for the purposes of 
statistical analyses.  These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis cent ers, the magnitude of the site 
main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site -to-site variability is such that it 
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92851] at an alpha level of 0.10.  Change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA 
(unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_85218] a covariate.   For the purpose of 
testing consistency of treatment response, the dichotomized E GSS will be analyzed with a 
logistic regression procedure with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_85219]. Further examination will f ollow for any variables that have a significant 
ANC OVA or logistic regression interaction term.  In the event that the AN COVA or logistic 
regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers . 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or centers that contribute to the statistical significanc e of the appropriate test.  The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p-
value for the subset.  Subsets with p-values greater than 0.[ADDRESS_92852]-hoc aspects of the process will be given when the results are interpreted.  Conclusions will be presented by [CONTACT_85220]. 
12.1.9 Miss ing Efficacy Data Imputations 
Lesion Count Variable Missing Data Imputation 
Missing 12 -week data will be estimated by [CONTACT_85221]. 
Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple  imputation method.  The pattern of missing observations in each 
treatment group will not influence the missing value estimation in the other because the 
imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve [ADDRESS_92853] phases with these principal 
tasks:  
1. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and 
those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].  The missing lesion count values in ea ch data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The resulting 
data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each 
imputation.  
Syntax:

2. For each complete data set, the absolute change in lesion counts will be computed. 
Each complete data set will be analyzed as specified for the p articular analysis.

PROC MIANALYZE.

EGSS Missing Data Imputation 
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on percentage of EGSS successes 
wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated by (MCMC) . The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group will not influence the 
missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
The missing 12 week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain  Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis 
will involve 3 principal tasks: 
1. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and 
those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].  The missing EGSS values in each data set will be 
filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets. The resulting data 
sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set by [CONTACT_47915].  
Syntax:  
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 <options>; 
  where trtpn=(1, or 2); 
  mcmc chain=multiple; 
  var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12; 
run; 
2. For each complete data set, the dichotomous success rate (clear or almost clear with a 
2-point change from baseline) will be computed. The 12-week imputed EGSS values 
will be rounded to the nearest integer value prior to evaluating the success rate. Each complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment 
group and analysis center. 
3. The results from these anal yses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of [ADDRESS_92855] been pre-specified by [CONTACT_2329] a random number generator: 
• EGSS; IDP -126 Gel: Seed=[PHONE_1995]  
• EGSS; IDP -126 Vehicle: Seed= [PHONE_1996]  
12.1.[ADDRESS_92856] sensitivity analysis for absolute change in lesion count will use a repeated measures 
ANCOVA, with  treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8) as 
independent factors and a covariate of baseline lesion count.  In this analysis, data from all post-baseline visits will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sens itivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute 
missing data for the absolute change in lesion counts at Week 12.  Although the full details will be presented in the SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 3 principal tasks: 
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The imputation model 
used will be  regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count (ie, the imputation model will be the same as the 
analysis model). Appropriate modifications will be made should the analysis be based 
on a non- parametric method.  
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment 
group, and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count. 
3. Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC

• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts: Seed= [PHONE_1997]  
Sensitivity analyses for EGSS 
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized EGSS success will use a repeated measures 
logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), w ith dichotomized EGSS success 
as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8) as independent factors.  In this analysis, data from all post- baseline visits will be included with 
no imputation for missing dat a. 
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute missing data for the dichotomized EGSS data. Although the full details will be presented in the SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 3 principal tasks:

60 • [ADDRESS_92864] once. 
An ITT analysis will be conducted, as well as a PP analysis. Subjects will be eligible for the PP 
analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations 
(i.e., any subject or investigator ac tivity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the study drug or the precise evaluation of study drug efficacy). The PP 
analysis set  will include subjects in the safety analysis set  who do not meet any of the following 
criteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications . 
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_92865] baseline study visit prior to Week 12. 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., s ubjects may not miss more 
than [ADDRESS_92866] take 80%-120% of expected doses; t he 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study) . 
• Out of vi sit window at the 12-week visit. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect (and/or worsening of condition)  will be included in the PP 
population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the study that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
12.8.2 Sample Size Determination  
The power cal culations are based primarily on the observed Week 12 results of the Phase 2 
study, V01-126A-201. This study was a five-arm study including IDP-126 Gel versus each of the 
dual components and Vehicle Gel and is therefore a relevant study for powering the current study.  
A sample size of 120 for the active treatment arm and 60 for the vehicle treatment arm has 
greater than 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference in inflammatory lesions 
with a significance level of 0.05. The estimated absolute change from baseline in treatment means were 29.[ADDRESS_92867] 
deviation of 12.0. 
A sample size of 120 for the active treatment arm and 60 for the vehicle treatment arm  has 
greater than 9 9% power to detect a statistically significant difference in non -inflammatory 
Protocol V01- 126A -[ADDRESS_92868] 9 9% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
percentage of subjects who have at least  a [ADDRESS_92869] Clear are 52.5% and 8.1% for IDP -126 Gel versus its Vehicle Gel respectively . 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
 The method of multiple imputation will be used (see  Missing Efficacy Data Imputations  
section ). 
12.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple study center s in North America with the intention of 
pooling the results for analysis. Site specific data summaries, however, will be presented.  
12.8.5 Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_85230]- primary efficacy endpoints  
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of any one of the primary efficacy endpoints will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints. See Section  12.1.6 
for further detail  about control of Type I error across primary and secondary endpoints. 
12.8.6 Windowing Rules  
The timing of all study visits is relative to Baseline (Day 0). The Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 visits should occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled times, the Week 12 visit should occur within −3/+5 days o f the scheduled time.

Wash your face gently with  a mild cleanser approved by [CONTACT_85243] (not hot) 
water. Rinse thoroughly and gently pat dry with a cotton towel. Wait until skin is completely dry 
before applying the study drug. 
A thin layer  of study drug should be applied once daily in t he evening , at least 30 minutes prior 
to bed time  (about the same time every day) to the entire face for  twelve weeks .  Use the pump to 
dispense one pea-sized amount of study drug onto your fingertip (Figure 1) .  One pea- sized 
amount of study drug should be enough to cover your entire face.  
 
 
 
 
This dose should then be dotted on to 6 areas (chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, 
right forehead) on the face (Figure 2). After distributing the dose in this manner, gently rub the gel into the skin. This amount should be used to evenly cover the entire face excluding the 
mouth, eyes and lips. It is important to treat your entire face. 
                                                           
 
Do NOT treat only specific lesions. DO NOT APPLY MORE THAN THE PRESCRIBED 
AMOUNT.   Do NOT share your study drug  with anybody, study drug is for your use only and

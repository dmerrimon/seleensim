2.1. MECHANISM  OF ACTION  
Cassava Scien ces, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_533274], a novel drug candidate  designed to treat 
and slow the prog ression of Al zheimer’s  disease (AD). Simufilam  binds wit h femtomolar 
affinity to an altered con formation of filamin A (F LNA ) that is induced by [CONTACT_148986] 1-
42 (A42), present in AD brain  and critical to the toxicity of  A42.1-3 Simufilam  binding 
reverses th e altered FLNA conformation  and restores FLNA’s native shape,  preventing 
two t oxic signaling cascades of A 42. A42, in monomer or small oligomer form,  hijack s 
the 7-nicotinic  acetylcholine receptor ( 7nAChR) and signal s via this rec eptor to 
hyperphosphorylate tau . This signaling requires the recruitment of altered  FLNA to this  
receptor. Second, altered FLNA also lin ks to  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to allow A 42 to 
persisten tly activate this receptor. Normal FLNA does not associate w ith either 
7nAChR or TLR4. In addition to disrupting the normal functions of 7nAC hR and tau 
protein , A42’s toxic signaling to hyperph ospho rylate tau leads to the signature [CONTACT_533314] . In two AD mouse  models and in postmortem h uman AD brain 
tissue, simufilam  restored function of three receptors that are impai red in  AD: the 
7nAChR , the N-methyl -D-aspartate receptor (NMDA R), and the insulin receptor (IR).2,[ADDRESS_692369] simufilam  both to improve cognition  and to slow AD progress ion. Both 
mouse models used a dose of 20 mg/kg/day  (equivalent to 6 0 mg/m2/day) .  
2.2. SAFETY PHARMACO LOGY AND TO XICOLOGY  
A robust nonclinical ADME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology 
program has been conducted  with simufi lam. In vitro meta bolic profiling showed 
minimal meta bolis m across  several species including  humans. Simufilam  was rapid ly 
absorbed and eliminated in in vivo studies in rat and dog with nearly 100% oral 
bioavailability, a 2.[ADDRESS_692370]. A full battery of genot oxicity studies was c onducted (in vitro  bacterial Ames, in 
vitro chromosom al ab erration, and in vivo rat micronucl eus test) and were all  nega tive. 
An in vitro specificity screen showed no significant activation or inhibition of a panel of 
68 receptors, cha nnels and transporter s.

Ame ndment  #7    Page 13 of 39   CON FIDENTIA L Simufilam  was tested  in single dose and repeat d ose o ral toxicity studies in rats and dog s. 
A 6-month repeat d ose or al toxicity study in rat (PTI-125-NC-049) used the same doses 
as a 28-day study (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) , which  found 500 mg/kg/day  to be the 
no ob servable adverse effect level ( NOAEL ). In the [ADDRESS_692371] erized  by [CONTACT_533291] 500 and 1000 mg/kg ani mals, including in creased

hyperplasia. The presence of bile pi[INVESTIGATOR_533275]. These  findings 
correlated  with changes to the clinical chemi stry profile, including increased ALP and  
total/direct bilirub in. Ov er the 1 -month recovery period, there was complete recovery of 
the hepatocellular degeneration and partial recovery  of hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  The 
NOAEL from this 6 -month study was 50 mg/kg /day (equivalent to 300 mg/ m2). A second 
ongoing 6-month repeat  dose oral toxicity study in rat will more accurate ly determine the  
6-month NOAEL  in rat . Doses are vehicle and 125  and 250 mg/kg/day.   
In a 9-month  toxicity study in dog  (PTI-125-NC-050), the no observable effect level 
(NOEL)  of simufilam  was 25 mg/kg. The 200 mg/kg  (high) dose was decreased to 15 0 at 
1 month due to bod yweig ht loss thought unsus tainable for 9 months . Clinical signs were 
saliv ation and a few instances of muscle fascicula tions. There were no pathology 
findings , but the high dose  was co nsider ed adverse d ue to two unexplained d eaths.  The 
75 mg/kg/day NOAEL pro vides 38- and [ADDRESS_692372] -in-human, double -blind, Single Ascending Dos e clinical tria l was conducted in 
healthy normal volun teers , age 18 -45 with oral dosing solution . Doses were placebo, 50,

9. ADV ERSE EVENTS/SERI OUS ADVER SE EVE NTS  
9.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS  - DEFINITION  
An adverse  event  (AE) is any unde sirable  event that occurs  to a subject  during a 
study, whet her or not that event is consi dered study  drug-related.  Monitor ing for AEs 
will start at dosi ng. Examples include:  
• Any treatm ent-emergent signs  and symptoms (events  that are marked  by a 
change from  the subjec t's baseline/en try status  [e.g.,  an increase in severity or 
frequency of pre-existing  abno rmality  or disorder])  
• All reactions  from  study  drug, an overdose, abuse  of drug, withdraw al 
phenomena,  sensitivity or toxici ty to study drug 
• Apparently unrelated  illnesses  
• Injury or accidents  (Note:  if a medical condition is known to have  cause d the 
injury  or accident,  the medical condition  and the acciden t should be reported  as 
two separate medical events  [e.g., for a fall secondary  to dizzine ss, both 
"dizziness"  and "fall"  should  be recorded  separa tely]) 
• Extension s or exacerbations of symptoms , subjective  subject -reported events, 
Cassava Sciences, Inc. Clini cal Protocol P TI-125-04 
Simufilam (PTI-125), A small mo lecule to treat AD June 1 1, 2021 
Ame ndment  #[ADDRESS_692404] ronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  and in the 
subject's  clinical chart. 
In the event that a subject is withdra wn from the study because  of an AE, it must be 
recorded  on the eCRF  as such. The subject  shou ld be followed and treate d by [CONTACT_533302]. 
The Investigator  must report all directly observ ed AEs and all spontaneousl y 
reporte d AEs. The Investigator  will ask the subject a non-specif ic question (e.g., 
"Have  you noticed anything  different  since your dose of the study medication?")  to 
assess  whether any AEs have  been experi enced  since the last assessm ent. AEs will 
be identified  and documented on the eCRF in appropri ate medic al termino logy. The 
severity and the relationship to the study drug will be determined  and reported  on the 
CRF  (see bel ow). 
9.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING 
The severity of each AE should be character ized and then classified into one of three 
clearly defin ed categor ies as follows: 
• Mild - the AE does not interfere  in a signif icant manner with the subject's  
normal functionin g level. It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate - the AE produces  some impai rment  of functioning  but is not 
hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfor table  or an embarrassment. 
• Severe - the AE produces signif icant impair ment of functioning  or 
incapacitation  and is a definite hazard to the subject's health. 
These three categories  are based on the Investigator 's clinical judgment,  which in turn 
depen ds on considera tion of various factors such as the subject's  report, and the 
physic ian's observ ations. The severity  of the AE should be recorded  in the 
approp riate section of the Adverse  Event CRF. 
9.3. ADVERS E  EVENTS   -  RELATIONSH IP TO  STUD Y   DRUG 
The relations hip of each AE to the study drug will be classified into one of three  
defined  categories  as follows:  
• Unlikely  - a causa l relationship between  the AE and the study drug is unlikely.  
• Possible  - a causal  relations hip between the AE and the study drug is possi ble. 
Cassava Sciences, Inc. Clini cal Protocol P TI-125-04 
Simufilam (PTI-125), A small mo lecule to treat AD June 1 1, 2021 
Ame ndment  #7    Page 31 of 39   CON FIDENTIA L • Proba ble - a causal relationship  between the AE and the study  drug is probable. 
For example, the AE is a common  adverse  event known  to occu r with the 
pharma cological class the study drug belongs  to; or the AE abated on study  
drug discon tinuation and reappeared  upon re-challenge  with the study drug. 
These  three categorie s are based on the Investigator's  clinical  judgmen t and 
considerat ion of various factors  such as the subject' s report, the timing of the AE in 
relationship to study  drug admin istration/discontinu ation,  the Investig ator's 
observations and the Investigator 's prior experience.  The relationshi p of the AE to the 
study drug will be recorded in the eCRF. 
9.4. SERIOUS ADVERS E EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adverse Ev ent ( SAE)  includes  (but is not limited to) an experience 
occurr ing at any dose that results  in any of the following  outcom es: 
• Death 
• A life-threatenin g event  (i.e., the subject is at imme diate risk of death  from  the 
reaction as it occur s). "Life -threatening " does not include  an event that, had it 
occurred in a more  serious form,  might have caused  death. For example,  drug-  
induced hepatitis that resolved  without  evidence  of hepatic  failure would not be 
considered  life-threatening even  though drug-induced  hepa titis can be fatal.  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181318], not an emergenc y room  visit)  or 
prolon gation of  existi ng hosp italization. 
• A persi stent or signific ant disability/in capacity (i.e., a substantial  disruption of 
the subject's ability  to carry out normal  life functions). 
• A congeni tal anomaly/birth defect . 
 
In additi on, medi cal and scien tific judgment should  be exercise d in deciding whethe r 
other  situation s should be consi dered an SAE  (i.e., important  medical events that may 
not be immediately  life-threatening  or result in death but may jeopardize the subject 
or may require medical  or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the other outcom es 
listed  in the definition above) . Examples of such medical  event s include (but are not 
limited  to): allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convul sions  that do not resul t in in-patient 
hosp italizati on, or the development  of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.  
An unexpected AE is one for which  the specificity or severity  is not consistent with the 
current Investi gator's Broc hure. For example,  hepatic necrosis would  be unexpecte d (by 
[CONTACT_533303]) if the Investigator' s Brochure only listed  elevated  hepatic 
enzymes  or hepatitis.

(by [CONTACT_533304]) if the Investigato r's Brochure only listed  cerebral 
vascular  accidents. 
9.5. SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVEN TS REPORTING  
The reporting of SAEs  by [CONTACT_533305]  (e.g., FDA)  is a

Title of Study:  
A Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CTP -
543 in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Alopecia Areata  
Study center(s): Multicenter study; approximately 50 sites (North America and Europe an Union)   
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient first visit : April [ADDRESS_763101] visit : June 2022 Phase of development: 3 
 
Objectives:  
The overall objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy and safety following administration of 
CTP-543 in adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata.  
The primary objectives of the study are to assess:  
• The efficacy of CTP -543 on regrowth of hair following 24 weeks of treatment  
• The safety of CTP -543 following 24 weeks of treatment.  
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess:  
• Clinician - and patient -reported impression of the severity and improvem ent of alopecia areata  
• Patient -reported satisfaction with their scalp hair  
• Patient -reported levels of anxiety and depression  
• Changes in  eyebrows and eyelashes.    
Methodology:  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled multicenter study to e valuate the efficacy and 
safety of CTP -[ADDRESS_763102] 50% hair 
loss as measured by [CONTACT_580354].   
An independent Dat a Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform regular safety assessments based on 
a review of cumulative safety data.  The DMC may advise study and/or treatment arm cessation due to 
intolerability at any time.  
The Screening Period may last up to [ADDRESS_763103] -Treatment Safety Follow -up to assess safety following

CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  [ADDRESS_763114] will be outlined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan finalized prior to database lock for the Primary Efficacy Analysis.  
Safety  
Safety and tolerability of CTP -543 will be assessed by [CONTACT_580357], vital signs, 
concomitant medications, and clinical laboratory results, as well as physical examinations.  
Statistical methods:  
Sample Size:  
Power is calculated for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint for the continuity -corrected chi-square test using 
a 2-sided significance level of 0.025.   Based on Phase  2 results, the percentage of patients achieving an 
absolute SALT score ≤20 at Week 24 is assumed to be 40%, 2 6%, and 9% for the 12 mg BID CTP-
543, 8 mg BID CTP-543, and placebo groups, respectively.  P atients will be randomized in a 1:2:1 
ratio with a total N of approximately 440 patients (i.e., 110 for 12 mg BID, 220 for 8 mg BID, and 110 
for placebo).  These sample sizes will provide >99% power for the comparison of CTP -543 12 mg BID 
versus placebo and approximately 9 2% power  for the comparison of CTP -543 8 mg BID versus 
placebo . 
Efficacy Analyses:   
The Efficacy Population will include all patients who are randomized in the study and dispensed study 
drug during the Treatment Period.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion  of patients 
achieving an absolute SALT score of ≤[ADDRESS_763115] using baseline scalp hair loss (p artial 
vs complete/near -complete) as the stratification factor , for each active treatment group versus placebo .  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_580358] -treated patients (i.e., by [CONTACT_1570]).  
All data for analysis will be listed b y patient.  Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively 
(mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures 
will be presented as number and percentage .   
The final efficacy analysis will be conducted when all patients in the study have had the opportunity to 
complete Week 24.  Additional details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
CTP-[ADDRESS_763116] ing in a subset of patients .  
Population PK analysis will include the evaluation of various covariates that may include the effects of  
age, gender, race, and weight (or BMI) on the PK o f CTP -543.  Exposure -response relationships for 
both efficacy and safety parameters will also be assessed.  
Safety Analyses:  
The Safety Population will include all patients who receive study drug during the Treatment Period.  
Adverse events will be coded u sing MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_72065].  Clinically significant deteriorations in physical examination findings will be reported and 
summarized as adverse events .  Adverse events, vital sign measurements, physical examination 
findings, clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medications will be tabulated and 
summarized by [CONTACT_103719].  By -patient listings will be provided for any deaths, serious 
adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment.

NTRODUCTION 
4.1. Overview of Alopecia Areata 
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by [CONTACT_580359]-scarring 
alopecia affecting scalp or scalp and body hair.  Alopecia areata is clinically heterogeneous, 
a
ffects males and females, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 0.2% of the [LOCATION_002] 
population ( Safavi, 1992 ; Benigno, 2020).  There is no preventative therapy or cure.  Alopecia 
a
reata often presents as a cyclical disorder marked by [CONTACT_580360], and variation in the degree or pattern of hair loss gives rise to different 
subtypes of alopecia areata, such as patchy, ophiasis, totalis, or universalis.  Approximately 7% 
of patients have severe disease with almost complete hair loss and little or no regrowth 
(Villasante Fricke, 2015 ) .  Approximately 80% of alopecia areata patients experience the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_580329] 40 years of age and 40% by 20 years of age ( Villasante Fricke, 2015).  
Alope
cia areata can have a psychological impact with high rates of depression ( Sellami, 2014) 
a
nd anxiety reported, particularly in children and adolescents ( Bilgic, 2013 ), a nd therefore, 
psychological counseling is often recommended as part of the standard of care ( Al-
Mutairi, 2011).   
A c
ause for alopecia areata has not yet been identified, though as in other autoimmune disorders, 
genetic susceptibility and a wide array of environmental triggers are thought to be involved.  
Presently, treatments for alopecia areata include moderately effective intralesional corticosteroid 
injections or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], or aesthetic disguises such as makeup and wigs.  Currently, no existing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580330] (FDA), Health Canada, or any Competent Authority in the European Union 
indi
cating a significant unmet medical need.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for the Study 
Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA have shown Janus kinase (JAK) 
inhibitors to be a promising novel therapy.   
The JAKs are intracellular tyrosine kinases that play a central role in the signaling of cytokine 
and growth factor receptors (Ghoreschi, 2009).   Cytokine-induced receptor conformation 
changes activate the JAKs and trigger phosphorylation of the 6-member signal transducers and 
activators of transcription (STAT) protein transcription factor family.  Upon phosphorylation, 
S
TATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580331], psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple 
JAK inhibitors are in development for autoimmune di sorders such as atopic dermatitis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus and others  (L evy, 2015 ).  In a murine model of AA, CD81 T cells were 
shown to be central in AA, causing up -regulation of interleukin -15 in hair follicles and 
ultimately production of interferon -gamma, which targets the hair follicle for attack ( Xing, 
2014).  As downstream regulators of interferon -ga mma and interleukin -15, JAK inhibitors have 
been shown to eliminate the interferon signature [CONTACT_580399].

a 50% relative reduction in SALT score at Week 24 relative to Baseline.  The primary efficacy 
endpoint was met in both the 8 mg BID group and 12 mg BID groups.  The difference between 
the 4 mg BID group and the placebo group was not statistically significant.  The 8 mg BID and 
12 mg BID doses also produced significant results vs placebo when other analyses of SALT data 
(i.e., percentage of patients achieving SALT ≤ 20) were conducted as well as analyses of patient 
and clinician reported global impression.  The 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID doses were further 
assessed in two additional Phase 2 dose regimen clinical trials (see Section 4.4.2 ) in which onc e-
daily versus twice-daily dosing with CTP-543 were assessed.    
The definitive dose-ranging study (CP543.2001) and the completed dose regimen studies 
(CP
543.2002 and CP543.2003) demonstrated that both the 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID doses of 
C
TP-543 are effective and generally well tolerated.  Consequently, both of these doses will be 
studied in t
his Phase 3 registration study in adult patients with alopecia areata.   
Summaries of all clinical studies conducted to-date can be found in Section 4.4 below.  Further 
de
tails are provided in the current CTP-543 Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.3. Nonclinical Information for CTP-543 
A series of nonclinical studies were performed with CTP-543, which evaluated the in vitro  and in 
vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism properties, safety pharmacology, toxicology and 
tox
icokinetics, and genotoxicity.  All safety pharmacology and toxicology studies considered 
necessary for human safety assessment were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory 
Practice regulations.  
Further details of the nonclinical studies for CTP-543 are described in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.

tolerability, and PK profile of single and multiple ascending doses of CTP-543: a single dose 
crossover study of CTP-543 versus ruxolitinib; a food effect study of CTP-543; a mass-balance 
study, and a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with oral contraceptive (OC).  A brief description 
of these studies is described below.  Further details of the Phase 1 studies for CTP-543 are 
de
scribed in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Study CP
543.1001 was a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study consisting of a 
first- in-human single ascending dose study and a sequential multiple ascending dose study.  The 
objective of the study was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of CTP-543 in healthy subjects.  A total of 82 subjects were planned for the 
study; 32 subjects in 4 cohorts randomized at a ratio of 3:1 CTP-543 to placebo for the single

 a
scending dose part (Part A), and thereafter, 50 subjects in 5 cohorts randomized at a ratio of 4:1 
CTP-543 to placebo for the multiple ascending dose part (Part B).  The doses studied in the 
sing
le ascending dose study were 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg, and 48 mg.  The doses studied in the 
mul
tiple ascending dose study were 8 mg once daily, 8 mg twice daily, 24 mg once daily, 32 mg 
once daily, and 16 mg twice daily, dosed for 7 consecutive days. CTP-543 was generally well 
tol
erated in these studies and showed a dose proportional PK profile.   
Study CP543.1002 was a single dose cross-over study to assess safety and tolerability and to 
compare the metabolite and pharmacokinetic profiles of CTP-543 versus ruxolitinib.  A total of 
12 subj
ects were enrolled in the study; 2 groups of 6 subjects each were dosed with either 15 mg 
of ruxolitinib or 16 mg of CTP-543 in Period 1 who then crossed over to the alternate treatment 
for Period 2.  CTP-543 was generally well tolerated in this study and showed an increase in PK 
parameters c
ompared to ruxolitinib.   
Study CP543.1003 was a cross-over study to characterize and compare the relative 
bioavailability and PK profile of CTP-543 and metabolites under both fed and fasted conditions.  
A total of 14 subjects were enrolled and received single oral doses of 16 mg CTP-543.  The 
a
dministration of 16 mg CTP-543 under fed conditions resulted in a statistically significant 
decrease (approximately 40%) in peak exposure but not in total exposure compared to 
administration under fasted conditions.  Single oral doses of 16 mg CTP-543 appeared to be well 
tolerated in both fasted and fed conditions.  
Study CP543.1004 assessed the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance of oral 
[14C]-CTP-543 in healthy adult male subjects.  The study showed that there are no circulating 
metabolites above 10% of drug related material.  Additionally, all metabolites in excreta are 
below 25% of drug related material.  No adverse events were reported in this study.

score, from Baseline at Week 24.  The primary efficacy endpoint was met in both the 8 mg BID 
group and the 12 mg BID group.  The difference between the 4 mg BID group and the placebo 
group was not statistically significant. 
The primary efficacy endpoint result was supported by [CONTACT_580361]-based assessments and patient reported outcomes.  The 8 mg BID and 
12 mg BID groups differentiated from placebo on various SALT analyses and had significant 
improvements in alopecia areata as measured by [CONTACT_87791]-I and PGI-I compared with the placebo 
group. 
The improvements in alopecia areata symptoms observed in the CTP-543 treatment groups were 
progressive over time through 24 weeks and appeared to be dose responsive.  Significant 
differences from placebo were noted as early as 12 weeks into treatment. 
CTP-543 was generally well tolerated in all Cohorts.   
S
tudy CP543.2002 was a randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability 
of 
two dosing regimens (8 mg BID versus 16 mg QD) of CTP-543 in adult patients with 
m
oderate to severe alopecia areata.  Fifty-seven patients were randomized to receive  
CTP-543 eit
her 8 mg BID or 16 mg QD over a 24-week treatment period.  The trial measured the 
re
lative change in SALT score between Week 24 and Baseline.  Efficacy results in the 8 mg BID 
a
rm were consistent with the previously-reported 8 mg BID results from the CP543.2001 trial 
and showed superiority of the 8 mg BID dose group over the 16 mg QD dose group.  Treatment 
wa
s generally well tolerated in both arms of the study.      
C
P543.2003 was a randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two 
dosi
ng regimens (12 mg BID versus 24 mg QD) of CTP-543 in adult patients with moderate to 
s
evere alopecia areata.  Sixty-six patients were randomized to receive CTP-543 either 12 mg 
B
ID or 24 mg QD over a 24-week treatment period.  The trial measured the relative change in 
SALT score between Week 24 and Baseline.  The primary outcome for the CP543.2003 study 
wa
s the relative change in SALT score for each dose regimen from Baseline at Week 24.  
Following 24 weeks of dosing, subjects in the 12 mg BID dose group had a 60% relative change 
to 
Baseline in total SALT score at Week 24 compared to 52% in the 24 mg QD dose group.  
C
TP-543 was generally well tolerated in both 24 mg/day dosing regimens.   
Both dose re
gimen studies support the continued use of the BID dosing regimen in the Phase 3 
program.  
Study CP543.5001 is an Open-Label Extension study in patients with alopecia areata who were 
previously enrolled in a qualifying clinical trial with CTP-543 and completed through the 24-
we
ek Treatment Period.  Patients will receive daily treatment with CTP-543 at a dose of 8 mg 
B
ID or 12 mg BID for up to 164 weeks in this study.  Previously qualifying CTP-543 clinical 
trials include: Cohort 3 from Study CP543.2001, Study CP543.2002, and Study CP543.2003.   
Taken together, the safety results of the Phase 2 clinical trials performed to-date appeared to 
show an overall
 acceptable risk-benefit profile for CTP-543.

ERALL STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of CTP-543 in adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata.  Patients will 
require a definitive diagnosis of alopecia areata by [CONTACT_580363].  The patient’s alopecia areata will be 
c
lassified by [CONTACT_580364]: 
1) Partial scalp hair loss (SALT score ≥ 50 and < 95);   
2) C
omplete or near-complete scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 95). 
Patients will be between [ADDRESS_763131] 50% hair 
loss as measured by [CONTACT_580365], and should not be treated 
concurrently for alopecia areata or with other treatments that might affect hair regrowth.   
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform regular safety assessments.  
The
 DMC will convene to review accumulated safety data at regular intervals specified in the 
DMC Charter.  The DMC will determine if there are adequate safety data to support continuation 
of a
 particular dose group or individual patient and may advise study and/or treatment arm 
cessation due to intolerability at any time.  
The Screening Period may last up to [ADDRESS_763132]-Treatment Safety Follow-up to assess safety following treatment 
completion.

telemedicine visits and clinical laboratory blood draws at a local laboratory or via a Home Health 
Care agency, may be offered for those trial participants who may no longer have access to the 
investigational site.  Additional information will be documented in study manuals.  Significant 
c
ytopenias or other hematologic abnormalities will be managed by [CONTACT_580366], and signs and symptoms of infection will be closely monitored 
and treated promptly.  Patients who experience intolerable symptoms during treatment may 
disconti
nue treatment at the judgement of the Investigator, but will continue in the study and 
c
omplete all assessments unless they withdraw consent.  Patients may withdraw consent at any 
time.

.3. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio (12 mg BID:8 mg BID:placebo). Randomization will 
be
 stratified by [CONTACT_580367]: 1) Partial scalp hair loss 
(SALT ≥ 50 and < 95); 2) Complete or near-complete scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 95). The 
randomization schedule will be generated prior to study start. 
All st
udy patients, Investigators, and site study staff will be blinded to study drug assignment for 
the duration of the study.  Tablets and packaging of CTP-543 and placebo will be identical in 
a
ppearance. 
7.4. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Primary Endpoint 
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are considered optimal for obtaining 
unbiased estimates of the efficacy and safety of investigational products.  The Severity of 
Alope
cia Tool (SALT) ( Olsen, 2004 ) was introduced as part of investigative guidelines 
published by [CONTACT_580368].  The SALT has been used as the hair loss measurement scale in all 
the studies of CTP-543 in patients with alopecia areata to date.  The 24-week duration of the 
Tr
eatment Period has been shown to be sufficient in establishing hair regrowth with CTP-543 
and to significantly differentiate active doses from placebo as well as differentiate between doses 
of CTP-543.   
The selection of the 8 mg and 12 mg BID doses of CTP-543 for this study is supported by [CONTACT_580369]-543 observed in the completed and analyzed Phase 2 CP543.2001, 
CP543.2002, and CP543.2003 studies.  Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in CP543.2001 
showe
d that the proportions of responders (patients achieving at least a 50% relative reduction in 
SALT score from Baseline at Week 24) were significantly greater in the 8 mg BID group and 
12 mg BID group compared with the placebo group ( P <0.001 for both) and compared with the 
4 mg BID group ( P = 0.030 and P = 0.003, respectively).  For the analysis performed on the 
efficacy population, 9.3% of patients in the placebo group and 21.4% of patients in the 4 mg BID 
CTP-543  23 February 2021

 g
roup were responders, compared with 47.4% in the 8 mg BID group and 58.3% in the [ADDRESS_763135] 50%, 75%, and 90% relative reduction in SALT 
sc
ore by [CONTACT_10585] 24 compared with both the placebo group and the 4 mg BID group.  
Additi
onally, both the 8 mg BID group and the 12 mg BID group had significantly greater 
propo
rtions of patients who achieved an absolute SALT score ≤20 at Week 24 compared with 
the pla
cebo group.  Achieving a SALT score ≤ 20 has been reported by [CONTACT_580370]-meaningful treatment success for AA ( Wyrwich, 2020 ).  In the 
Wyrwich study, qualitative interviews were conducted in the US with hair expert dermatologists 
and AA patients who had experienced ≥50% scalp hair loss.  The clinicians judged that 80% 
sc
alp hair represented treatment success.  Adult and adolescent AA patients participating in the 
stud
y perceived that, short of 100% scalp hair, the presence of ~70-90% scalp hair (median 80%) 
represented treatment success.  Nearly all queried clinicians and patients in this study agreed that 
for
 patients with ≥ 50% scalp hair loss, successful treatment would be hair regrowth resulting in 
≤ 20% scalp hair loss.  
Therefore, based on the efficacy and safety data observed in the CP543.2001, CP543.2002, and 
C
P543.2003 studies, 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID of CTP-543 will be assessed further for efficacy 
a
nd safety in the Phase 3 program in patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata.  This 
P
hase 3 study will employ SALT as the hair loss assessment tool and the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be the percentage of patients who achieve a SALT score ≤ 20, as this represents a 
clinically-meaningful tr eatment success for patients with AA. This same primary endpoint is 
c
urrently being used in the ongoing Phase 3 study, CP543.3001.

.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria 
For all patients, it is the intent that patients who discontinue study medication (at any time) for 
a
ny reason will continue to be followed for all protocol-planned study visits through the 
completion of the 24-week treatment period, and will have all endpoints (including efficacy) 
collected a
ccordingly. 
The Investigator, Sponsor, or its designee may decide a patient should discontinue treatment at 
a
ny time and for any reason.  In addition, patients will discontinue randomized treatment if they: 
 Ex perience an intolerable adverse event: such events include, but are not limited to, 
adverse events ≥ Grade 4*, bone marrow-related events, a ≥ Grade 3* cardiac event 
(*CTCAE v5.0 criteria); 
 R equire a medication that is prohibited by [CONTACT_760].  However, under certain 
circumstances, and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, short-term use of a 
prohibit
ed medication may not necessitate withdrawal of treatment when its use is 
unlikely to unfavorably alter the risk-benefit of subject participation; 
 I n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], have any medically appropriate reason; 
 Become pregnant;  
 Ha ve a serious adverse event associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection;  
 The  Investigator believes that further treatment is undesirable or the risk-benefit 
prof
ile has become unfavorable. 
Furthermore, dose interruption s lasting more than [ADDRESS_763147] 
the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant electronic case report form (eCRF).  The 
specific reason for the withdrawal should be carefully documented on the eCRF.

.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment 
In the case of a medical requirement to break the blind to determine appropriate treatment for an 
adverse event, unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment can be achieved through the study-
specific Interactive Web Response System.  If possible, the Investigator should discuss the 
circumstances with the Medical Monitor(s) prior to accessing unblinding information.  In the 
event of a blind break, the Medical Monitor(s) will be notified through the electronic data 
capture system.  The patient for whom the blind is broken should be subsequently withdrawn 
from the study.  The details regarding the process of breaking the blind are outlined in the 
Me
dical Monitoring Plan and the Pharmacy Manual. 
8.5. Criteria for Study Termination 
The DMC will review cumulative safety data at regular intervals throughout the study.  Should 
safety signals arise that suggest treatment with CTP-543 poses an unjustified risk to patients, 
ter
mination of the study or modification of dosing arms may occur upon Sponsor review of the 
DMC recommendation.  The DMC may call for unscheduled data review meetings at any time to 
ensure appropriate safety monitoring.  
Eve
nts that could trigger an unscheduled review may include, but are not limited to:  
High frequency of dose interruptions  
High frequency of, or a trend in, SAEs  
High frequency of Grade 3/4 adverse events 
Trend in organ system-specific moderate and/or severe adverse events  
High frequency of patient discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events 
The
 Sponsor will notify Investigators of any recommendation of study termination by [CONTACT_1363].  
The Sponsor will notify Investigators of recommendation for study modification as necessary to 
protect patient safety including appropriate instructions for removing patients from treatment, 
while maintaining the blind.  
Any termination required by [CONTACT_580372], if instructed 
to do so, in a time frame that is compatible with the patient’s well-being.  The Sponsor reserves 
the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.

ESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS 
9.1. Description of Treatments 
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_580373]-543 or placebo in a 
1:2:1 ratio (12mg BID:8 mg BID: placebo). 
Tr
eatments arms will include: 
 12 mg CTP-543 every 12 hours 
 8 mg
 CTP-543 every 12 hours 
 Placebo every [ADDRESS_763148] dose of study drug in the clinic on Day 1 of 
the Treatment Period and will be instructed to take study drug approximately every 12 hours (± 3 
hours) without regard to food for the duration of the study.  
9.2. Dose-Adjustment Criteria 
No individualized dose adjustment is allowed during the Treatment Period except in the event of 
intolerability, for which a dose interruption or patient discontinuation may occur at the 
judgement of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor (see Section 9.2.1 below 
for
 details). 
The DMC will review cumulative safety data throughout the study in accordance with the DMC 
C
harter.  If the DMC determines that the high dose of CTP-543 should be stopped for safety 
re
asons, pati
ents receiving treatment at that dose will move to the low dose  of CTP-543 at the 
pa
tient’s next visit.  If an immediate hazard is suspected, patients without an imminent visit may 
ha
ve an Unscheduled Visit for potential dose adjustment to maintain the blind.  In the event of 
CTP-[ADDRESS_763149] their dose interrupted at the discretion of the Investigator.  The Medical Monitor(s) 
should be consulted whenever possible prior to decisions for dose interruption.  
Patients who withdraw consent and therefore are discontinued from the study should undergo an 
Early Termination Visit and subsequent Safety Follow-up Visit as appropriate per Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_763150] 4 weeks of the Treatment Period, 
and every 4 weeks thereafter for the remainder of the study.  Prior to dose interruption, 
hematology parameters should be confirmed with repeat testing at an Unscheduled Visit within 
72 hours, except in severe cases (i.e.: neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 109/L) where immediate 
interruption of dosing is necessary for the safety of the patient.  Blood draws confirming dose 
in
terruption criteria should occur prior to the first daily dose on the day of draw.

packaging, labeling and dispensing instructions can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The label(s) for the investigational product and placebo wi ll include the required caution 
statements and/or regulatory statements, as applicable per local regulations.   
Ade
quate supplies of study drug will be provided to each site by [CONTACT_36613].  Study 
drug should be stored in the original container between 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F), as stated on 
the pr
oduct label, in a secure, temperature-monitored, locked area, under the responsibility of the 
Investigator or other authorized individual until dispensed to the patients. 
Study drug dispensed to patients should be stored in the original bottle at room temperature as 
state
d on the package label.  No special handling procedures are required.  Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_763154] (STS) or Direct to Subject (DTS) shippi[INVESTIGATOR_580336] a patient is not able to attend in clinic visits or a site is closed.  Additional 
information can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.4.3. S tudy Drug Preparation and Administration 
No stud
y drug preparation is required.  Patients will take the first dose of study drug in the clinic 
on Day [ADDRESS_763155] to food.  Patients should be instructed to take one tablet in the morning and one tablet in 
the evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  If a dose is missed, the patient should skip the 
missed dose and resume dosing at the next scheduled dose.  The patient should not take two 
doses at the same time.  Deviations from prescribed dosing should be discussed at each visit for 
assessment of compliance and retraining when necessary. 
9.4.4.  Study Drug Return and Disposal 
The Sponsor (or designee) will review with the Investigator and relevant site personnel the 
process for study treatment return, disposal, and/or destruction, including responsibilities for the 
site versus the Sponsor (or designee).  Specific requirements for destruction or return are defined 
in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.4.5.  Study Drug Accountability 
To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all study drug will be 
recon ciled in full.  The Investigator or designee must maintain accurate records of the receipt of 
CTP-543  23 February 2021

CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 39  
    stud
y drug, including date received, lot number, amount received, condition of the package, and 
the disposition of study drug. 
Current dispensing records will also be maintained, including the date and amount of medication 
dispensed to each individual patient.  Returned study drug records will be maintained and final 
study drug reconciliation will also be recorded for each patient. 
9.5. Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
All medications, including over-the-counter therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., vitamins, herbal, and nutritional 
supplements) and vaccinations (including the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination), taken at the time of the 
S
creening Visit through the Follow-Up Visit will be recorded in the patient’s source 
doc
umentation and documented in the eCRF.  Additionally, any prior janus kinase (JAK) 
inhi

JAK inhibitors or immunosuppressants. 
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the wellbeing of the patient may be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  Use of medications that are prohibited per protocol will 
require patient withdrawal from the study.  However, under certain circumstances, and in 
c
onsultation with the Medical Monitor, short-term use of a prohibited medication may not 
ne
cessitate withdrawal when its use is unlikely to unfavorably alter the risk-benefit of subject 
participation or confound the study endpoints. 
The following treatments are not permitted during the study:

DY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
The schedule of assessments and procedures is presented in Table 2 and should be referenced for 
de
tails regarding the collection of each assessment at each visit.  Due to the COVID-19 
pa
ndemic, patient safety and some other assessments outlined below may be performed remotely 
if tra
vel restrictions, quarantine, and/or site closures are presented and the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_580338].

0.1. Demographic Characteristics and Medical History 
Demographic characteristics [i. e., sex, ethnic origin, date of birth (as appropriate per local 
regulations), and calculated body mass index] will be collected at the Screening Visit, between 
Da
y -28 and -1, and detailed on the eCRF.  
The patie
nt’s alopecia areata will be classified by [CONTACT_580375]: 
1)  Partial scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 50 and < 95);   
2) Complete or near-complete scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 95).  
Key criteria that distinguish alopecia areata from other forms of hair loss may include abrupt 
onset of disease, a history of recurrence and spontaneous remission, response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_580339], and distribution of hair loss pattern.  Care must be taken during 
the e
valuation to assess for other causes of hair loss such as trichotillomania, or scarring alopecia 
and other forms of non-scarring alopecia.  Evidence of thinning hair should be distinguished 
from pattern hair loss or telogen effluvium and evidence of inflammation should be investigated 
to rule out infe
ction, as appropriate. 
Thorough medical history, including current medications and any prior Janus kinase (JAK)

10.2. Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) 
The SALT score was introduced as part of investigative guidelines published by [CONTACT_580376] ( Olsen, 2004).  The SALT is a measure of hair loss that quantifies 
the a
mount of scalp surface without hair in a pre-specified quadrant of the scalp (right side, top, 
left side, back), that is further summed after applying a quadrant-specific multiplier indicative of 
scalp surface area contribution, to provide an overall score of total hair loss.  The SALT 
a
ssessment will occur via live examination of the patient during clinic visits.  If a patient is 
unable to attend an in-person clinic visit due to COVID-19, a SALT assessment will not be 
performed.  Missed assessments will be recorded in the eCRF as due to COVID-19.

.4. Global Impression Scales 
The Global Impression Scales are measures commonly used in clinical trials to allow integration 
of several sources of information into a single rating of the patient’s condition.  The Global 
Impression Scales employ a 7-point Likert scale measuring either disease state severity or 
improvement after treatment.  The Global Impression of Severity should consider the condition 
of the
 patient at the time of the assessment. The Global Impression Scale of Improvement will 
consider the condition of the patient at the time of the assessment compared to Baseline.  
I
n this study, the Global Impression Scale of Severity and the Global Impression Scale of 
Improvement will be performed by [CONTACT_580377] 2.  
10.4.1.
 Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI- S) 
The Clinical Global Impression Scale of Severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_580378]’s alopecia areata at the time of assessment.  The Investigator 
may select one of seven numeric choices re presenting “Among the most extreme hair loss” to 
“Normal, no hair loss ”.  To reduce variability, one rater should perform the CGI-S assessment 
for
 the patient.  An example of the CGI-S is provided in Section 17.3.1.  If a patient is unable to 
a
ttend an in-person clinic visit due to COVID-19, the CGI-S will not be performed.  Missed 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF as due to COVID-19.

 Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI- I) 
The Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. 
Compared to the patient’s alopecia areata prior to treatment at Baseline, the patient’s current 
state of alopecia areata will be assessed according to the Investigator’s perceived change.  The 
I
nvestigator may select one of seven numeric choices representing “Very Much Worse” to “Very 
Much Improved”.  To reduce variability, one rater should perform the C GI- I assessment for the 
patient for the duration of the study.  An example of the CGI-I is provided in Section 17.3.2.  If a 
pa
tient is unable to attend an in-person clinic visit due to COVID-19, the CGI-I will not be 
performed. Missed assessments will be recorded in the eCRF as due to COVID-19. 
10.4.3. Patien
t Global Impression of Severity (PGI- S) 
The Patient Global Impression Scale of Severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_580379]/her alopecia areata at the time of assessment.  The Patient may select one of 
se
ven numeric choices representing “Among the most extreme hair loss” to “Normal, no hair 
loss
”.  An example of the PGI-S is provided in Section 17.3.3.  If a patient is unable to attend an 
in-person c
linic visit due to COVID-19, the PGI-S should be performed via a virtual visit with 
video capability. 
10.4.4. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI- I) 
The Patient Global Impression Scale of Improvement will be assessed by [CONTACT_102].  Compared 
to t
he patient’s alopecia areata prior to treatment at Baseline, the patient’s current state of 
alopecia areata will be assessed according to his/her perceived change.  The patient may select 
one
 of seven numeric choices representing “Very Much Worse” to “Very Much Improved”.  An 
e
xample of the PGI-I is provided in Section 17.3.4.  If a patient is unable to attend an in-person 
c
linic visit due to COVID-19, the PGI-I should be performed via a virtual visit with video 
capability. 
10.5. Hair Satisfaction and Hair Quality Patient Reported Outcomes  
The Hair Satisfaction Patient Reported Outcome (SPRO) is a single item questionnaire answered 
by [CONTACT_580380].  The Hair Quality Patient Reported Outcome (QPRO) questionnaire 
provides additional details on key attributes of their hair and to help provide context to the SPRO 
response.  The SPRO and QPRO are provided in Section 17.4.  I f a patient is unable to attend an 
in-
person clinic visit due to COVID-19, the SPRO and QPRO should be performed via a virtual 
visi
t with video capability.  
10.6. HADS 
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]  (HADS) is a 14-item measure designed to assess 
a
nxiety and depression symptoms in medical patients.  Items are rated on a 4-point severity 
scale.  The HADS produces two scales, one for anxiety (HADS–A) and one for depression 
(H
ADS–D).  An example of the HADS is provided in Section 17.5.  I f a patient is unable to 
attend an in-person clinic visit due to COVID-19, the HADS should be performed via a virtual 
visit with video capability.

0.7. BETA  
The Brigham Eyebrow Tool for Alopecia (BETA) is a clinician-rated scale that assesses the total 
e
yebrow hair present.  The scale is used for each eyebrow in which the Individual Eyebrow 
S
core is derived by [CONTACT_580381] (D) x surface area (SA).  An expert panel will perform 
c
entral readings based on photographs of the eyebrows and will provide a score for each patient 
with eyebrow involvement.  The BETA will be performed at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24.   
Additi
onal detail on how to take the photographs for the central read of the BETA will be 
outlined in a separate study manual.  If a patient is unable to attend an in-person clinic visit due 
to COVID-19, the BETA may not be performed due to the inability to take photographs of the 
eyebrows.  Missed assessments will be recorded in the eCRF as due to COVID-19. 
10.8

pe
rform central readings based on photographs of the eyelashes and will provide a score for each 
patient with eyelash involvement.  The BELA will be performed at Baseline, Week 12, and 
W
eek 24.   Additional detail on how to take the photographs for the central read of the BELA 
will be outlined in a separate study manual.  If a patient is unable to attend an in-person clinic 
visit due to COVID-19, the BELA may not be performed due to the inability to take photographs 
of the eyelashes.  Missed assessments will be recorded in the eCRF as due to COVID-19.

0.9. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Whole blood (4 mL each) will be collected in K 2E DTA vacutainer collection tubes to evaluate 
plasma concentrations of CTP-543.   
The exac
t time of blood collection as well as the exact time of the preceding dose will be 
recorded.  To document the preceding dose time, patients should be instructed to record the last 
dosing time prior to the Week 12 and 24 visits directly on their dosing bottles.  All attempts to 
adhere to the pharmacokinetic schedule should be made.  However, the inability to follow the 
schedule or to obtain/process a sample will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Instructions for harvesting and preparing plasma samples prior to freezing and additional 
procedures for blood sample collection will be provided in separate study laboratory manual. 
10.10.  Vital Signs, Weight, and Height 
Vital signs will be measured after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]-supi[INVESTIGATOR_42428] [ADDRESS_763160] of care.  Patients should wear light clothing, 
e
mpty pockets of heavy objects, and remove his/her shoes before weight is measured.  Height 
will
 be measured per institution standard of care, after the patient has removed his/her shoes.  
Height will only be measured at the Screening Visit.  Weight and vital signs will be measured 
according to the Schedule of Assessments.  Weight and height will be used to calculate the 
patient’s body mass index at Screening.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments for assessment 
timepoints ( Table 2) .

Per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2) a complete physical examination will consist of an 
e
xamination of all major organ systems to include, but not be limited to, chest auscultation, 
a
bdominal auscultation and palpation, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat.  An assessment for 
a
ctive signs and symptoms of infection including tuberculosis, and skin examinations for non-
melanoma skin cancers, will be performed.  Evaluation for progressive multifocal 
leukoe
ncephalopathy (PML) symptoms such as facial droop, general weakness, clumsiness, 
trouble speaking, personality changes, memory problems, and vision changes will be assessed. 
Additi
onally, an assessment for the presence or absence of nasal hair will be performed during 
complete physical exams.

I
ndividual parameters including heart rate, PR, QT, QTcF, QRS, and RR intervals will be 
collected.  Repeat electrocardiograms (if deemed necessary) should be performed at least 5 
mi

    The
 results of clinical laboratory tests conducted at the Screening Visit (and prior to dosing) 
must be assessed by [CONTACT_580383]’s eligibility for participation in the 
study.  The Investigator should indicate review of the laboratory reports throughout the study by 
[CONTACT_580384].  
All clinical laboratory results that fall outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_580385], not clinically significant, or Abnormal, clinically significant.  
Laboratory results deemed Abnormal, clinically significant will be recorded as an adverse event 
in the eCRF (see additional criteria outlined in Section 11.1).  Clinically significant laboratory 
a
bnormalities indicative of hematologic or other effects requiring intervention should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor(s).  Additional tests and evaluations required to establish the 
significance or etiology of a clinically significant abnormal result or to monitor the course of an 
adverse event should be obtained when clinically indicated.  Whenever possible, the etiology of 
the clinically significant abnormal findings will be documented on the eCRF.   
10.14.  Unscheduled Visit 
In addition to regularly scheduled protocol visits, an Unscheduled Visit may be conducted to 
ensure appropriate safety monitoring or follow-up of the patient, at the discretion of the 
I
nvestigator.  For example, an Unscheduled Visit may be scheduled to monitor potential or actual 
c
linically meaningful safety laboratory results, for confirming hematology results to support dose 
interruption or resumption of dosing thereafter, for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_580340], or for other clinical 
signs, symptoms, or considerations that warrant additional safety follow-up.  Only those criteria 
requiring additional monitoring should be performed at an Unscheduled Visit.  An Unscheduled 
Visi

during the course of a study.  It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant 
il
lness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient’s health, including laboratory test 
values, regardless of etiology.  Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in 
the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an adverse event.  A 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than the 
individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.  A worsening of the condition under 
stud
y, alopecia areata, will not be reported as an adverse event.  
All patients will be monitored for adverse events during the study.  Assessments may include 
monitoring of the following parameters: the patient’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, physical 
examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. 
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug (ie, 
Day 1), will be considered a pretreatment adverse event and will be captured on the eCRF.  
Adve
rse events will be considered treatment-emergent if the onset is after the first dose of study 
drug.   
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an adverse event if the abnormality: 
 I s considered clinically significant; OR 
 re sults in discontinuation from the study; OR 
 is judged by [CONTACT_580386], modification/interruption of investigational product dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention.

egardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.   
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the adverse 
event.  If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not 
simply as an abnormal laboratory result (e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased 
plate
lets). 
Vaccine-related AEs (e.g. fever, fatigue, headache) resulting directly from the vaccination may 
occur.  The temporal relationship of the event(s) to the vaccination should be clearly described

1.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/intensity, 
re
lationship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.   
11.2.1.
 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that 
fulf
ills the following criteria: 
 I s fatal (results in death); 
 I s life-threatening (Note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe); 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay); 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
patient's ability to conduct normal life functions); 
 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 C onstitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medic
al or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the patient or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi
[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
Events not considered  to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 A pr ocedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., sampling for laboratory, 
pharmacokinet
ic and pharmacodynamic tests).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
serious adverse event. 
 Hospit alization or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70368], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an adverse event. 
 A pr ocedure that is planned (i. e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on study); 
must be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication remains a reportable serious adverse 
event. 
 An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing medical condition 
that does not worsen.  
 Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.

Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will be handled through the electronic data capture 
system or other appropriate means.  Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be 
ha
ndled by [CONTACT_756]. 
11.2.2. Severity/Intensity 
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the 
severity/intensity of the event.  
The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
(v5.0
) should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events.  These criteria will be provided 
in t
he Site Operations Manual.  If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the Investigator should 
grade the severity according to the following criteria:  
 Gr ade 1 (mild): does not interfere with the patient’s usual function 
 Gr ade 2 (moderate): interferes to some extent with patient's usual function 
 Gr ade 3 (severe): interferes significantly with patient's usual function 
 Gr ade 4 (life-threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating disability 
 Gr ade 5 (death): results in death 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
11.2.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event 
based on currently available information.  Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as 
additional information becomes available.  Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_324552]: 
Related for Regulatory Reporting Assessment :  
 De finitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The event 
resolves or improves upon withdrawal of drug (de-challenge).  The event would be 
considered as definitely related to the study drug upon results of a positive re-challenge 
procedure. 
CTP-543  23 February 2021 
Protocol CP543.3002  C oncert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 50  
     P robably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication).  However, 
the influence of other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s 
clinical condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is 
unlikely, and the event follows a clinically reasonable response upon withdrawal of drug 
(de-challenge).   
 P ossibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug).  However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events).  
Unrelated for Regulatory Reporting Assessment :  
 Unl ikely Related : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., 
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial 
medication) and in which other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
treatments). 
 Not  related : The adverse event is completely independent of study drug administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  There must 
be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370]. 
11.2.4. Duration 
For all adverse events whether or not considered serious, the Investigator will provide a record of 
the sta
rt and stop dates of the event.  Every effort should be made to resolve all adverse events 
with continued f
ollow-up with the patient until appropriate resolution can be achieved.  If an 
event is unresolved at the end of the study it will be recorded as ongoing.  
11.2.5. Action Taken 
The Investigator will record the action taken with investigational product as a result of an 
adverse e
vent or serious adverse event on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, or 
int
erruption of investigational product, as appropriate) and record if concomitant and/or 
additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome 
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., 
recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered, or death (due to the adverse event).   
11.3. Follow-Up  
Adverse events, severe adverse events and serious adverse events, including clinically significant 
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, or physical examination findings, will be followed, 
re
gardless of causality, for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or 
unti
l the event stabilizes, is otherwise explained, death occurs, or the patient is lost to follow up.

CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 51  
    that f
ollow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or 
causality of the adverse event.  This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or 
investigations, examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.  
[ADDRESS_763165] be informed within 24 hours upon learning that a patient, or male patien t’s 
partner, has become pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_763166] dose of
 study drug.  The Pregnancy Notification eCRF in EDC should be used to report the 
pre
gnancy to the Sponsor or its designee.  Patient pregnancies (or pregnancy of a male patient’s 
partner) must be followed until termination of pregnancy or the birth of the child.  The 
Pregnancy Outcome eCRF should be used to report information regarding the status of the 
infa
nt. 
If pregnancy occurs in a female patient, then study drug should be discontinued immediately.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
should be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event if reporting criteria are met.  
Spontaneous abortion, and any congenital anomaly or birth defect in the patient’s (or male 
patient’s partner’s) newborn should be reported as an SAE.  
If a female partner of a male patient taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
patient taking the investigational product should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. 
11.5. Recording Adverse Events 
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from 
the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study visit are to be recorded in the 
eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry.  The Investigator will 
provide
 information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, action(s) taken, 
outcome, and relationship to the study drug.  All adverse events should be documented in the 
pa
tient’s source documents.  
11.6. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator must report to Sponsor or its designee all adverse events that occur during the 
study from the ti
me written informed consent is given until the final study visit or early 
termination, regardless of their relationship to the study drug.  Serious adverse events and 
pre
gnancies will be reported from the time written informed consent is given through completion 
of the safety follow-up visit, as applicable.   
11.6.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is required to notify the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s designated Drug Safety 
Unit within 24 hours after becomi
ng aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event.  All 
se
rious adverse events will be reported through completion of the adverse event eCRF.  The

n the event patients incorrectly receive treatment associated with a different treatment group, 
they will be analyzed “as randomized” for efficacy and “as treated” for safety. 
12.4. Analyses 
For the Treatment Period, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_580358]-treated 
patients (i.e., by [CONTACT_1570]).  All data for analysis will be listed by [CONTACT_4676]. 
Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures will be presented as number and 
percentage.   
Additional details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
12.4.1. Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
Disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_21964].  The number and percentage of 
patients, who are randomized, treated, prematurely discontinued, (overall and by [CONTACT_233178]), and complete the study will be summarized.  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The number of patients in each treatment group will be summarized for each investigative site 
for the Treatment Period.  Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology and summarized by [CONTACT_39812].  Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_580388]-Therapeutic-Chemical classification and 
preferred term.   
12.4.2. Efficacy 
The primary analysis targets an effect of treatment (response rates at 24 weeks) among subjects 
given the opportunity for treatment who are dispensed study drug.  The treatment policy strategy 
is used for the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study treatment (either temporarily or 
permanently) and so the response rates at [ADDRESS_763170], irrespective of continued 
therapy, in line with the intent- to-treat principle.  
For the primary efficacy analysis and the key secondary efficacy analysis, a 0.025 (two-sided) 
alpha-level will be allocated to each dose for comparison with placebo to adjust for multiplicity 
of testing associated with two doses.  Additional secondary endpoints will be tested in the 
following order (see Section 12.4.3) and be considered statistically significant and alpha-level 
protected if they (and all prior endpoints in the hierarchy for that dose versus placebo) achieve 
statistical significance at the 0.025 level of significance.  Irrespective, nominal p-values will be 
provided.  Testing will be performed only for the Treatment Period.  Missing values will be 
handled as specifie
d in Section 12.4.4.

or proportions of patients achieving specified improvement criteria (eg, CGI-I and PGI- I 
re
sponders), pairwise treatment group differences from placebo at each scheduled evaluation will 
be assessed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test using baseline scalp hair loss as the 
stratification factor.   
Absolute and/or re
lative changes in SALT score, SPRO score, CGI-S and PGI-S values, BELA 
and BETA score, QPRO scores, and HADS anxiety and depression scores, will be assessed with 
a mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) model.  The model will include fixed factors for 
treatment group, study visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_435236], with baseline SALT score 
as a covariate.  Treatment group comparisons at each visit will be based on least squares mean 
estimates.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within-subject errors.  
The
 Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. 
12.4.3. Multiplicity 
Hie
rarchical testing will be used to control for multiple comparisons. For the primary efficacy 
analysis and the key secondary efficacy analyses, a ≤ 0.025 ( two-sided) alpha-level will be 
alloca
ted to each dose for comparison with placebo to adjust for multiplicity of testing associated 
with two doses.  The below figure displays the order of testing of the key secondary endpoints.  
Once p>0.025 is observed for a treatment group comparison, inference for additional endpoints 
is no longer alpha-level protected for that dose group, however nominal p-values will still be 
reported.

 Missing Data for SALT-based endpoints 
Prior to database lock, the classification of the missing data pattern for missing SALT scores will 
be finalized based on blinded data review and documented as either considered to be missing at 
ra
ndom (MAR) or potentially missing not at random (MNAR), consistent with general categories 
of reasons for missingness.  Subjects with missing data due to COVID-[ADDRESS_763172] captured the protocol-specified assessments. For example, missing at random will be 
c
onsidered plausible for COVID-19 related reasons such as site closures and travel limitations.  
In general, however, if a MAR assumption is not considered plausible, MNAR will be assumed.  
P
atterns of missing values across visits will be listed and summarized with numbers and 
percentages by [CONTACT_10659].

    12.4.5.
 Multiple Imputation  
A multiple imputation (MI) approach will be used to estimate missing SALT scores.  Analyses of 
the mult
iply imputed datasets will be performed for both the primary endpoint (percentage of 
subjects with absolute SALT scores ≤ 20) as well as key secondary endpoints employing SALT 
scores, between each dose and placebo, using the MMRM approach.  
The imputation will be implemented separately for each treatment, under the assumption that 
different treatments may have distinct posterior distributions. Missing values will be imputed 
with a sequential regression approach under the assumption of multivariate normality. Missing 
SALT scores will be imputed in a sequential manner using regression models with a number of 
pre
dictor variables. Covariates to be included are the baseline SALT score, in addition to the 
observed or imputed values of the previous time points.  
One hundred independent imputations will be done with SAS® PROC MI using the Fully 
C
onditional Specification (FCS) regression method for all imputed continuous variables and the 
discriminant function method for all imputed classification variables, if needed. For each 
continuous variable, all other variables are used as covariates, and for each imputed classification 
variable, all other continuous variables are used as covariates. The FCS method combines both 
the monotone and arbitrary missing data patterns into one procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Imputed Datasets 
For the analysis of the primary endpoint (i.e., the binary endpoint denoting a SALT score ≤ 20) 
the individual SALT scores will be categorized (≤ 20 versus > 20) and analyzed using a Mantel-
Haenszel test (comparing each dose to placebo, separately).  For each imputed dataset, treatment 
differences will be assessed using the Mantel-Haenszel estimate of a common risk difference, 
with the variance estimator due to Sato (used to construct confidence limits for the Mantel-
Ha
enszel estimate of the common risk difference in the SAS FREQ Procedure).  The resulting 
[ADDRESS_763173] errors will then be combined using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_580342] ≤ 20, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_580343] 24 if the result of the MI 
analysis is statistically significant at the alpha ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_763174] for the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_580344] (MNAR) are adjusted and also 
where all missing values are adjusted (i.e., two separate tippi[INVESTIGATOR_208412]).   
The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_580345] .  For the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275], δ T values 
(a
djustments for treated subjects) will represent a percentage difference between the imputed 
value and baseline and can vary from 0% to 100% of the difference for subjects with an imputed 
SALT score less than baseline, or zero otherwise.  For the placebo arm, δ P values will represent a 
percentage difference between the imputed value and 0 hair loss.  Accordingly, the maximum

sc
ores. 
12.4.6.
 Population Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK analysis will include the evaluation of various covariates including age, gender, 
race, weight (or BMI), on the PK of CTP-543.  Exposure-response relationships for both efficacy 
a
nd safety parameters will also be assessed.  
12.4.7.
 Study Drug Exposure 
Study drug exposure will be summarized for each treatment group.  The number of days on 
which study drug was dosed will be summarized for each treatment group. 
The total number of days on study drug will exclude dose interruptions.  The total number of 
da
ys of exposure to study drug will be summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum number of days on the dose.  Drug compliance will also be 
summ
arized. 
12.4.8. Safety 
All safety summaries will be descriptive with no statistical hypothesis testing and based on the 
Safety Population. Patients will be summarized according to the study drug received (i.e., as 
treated), should it differ from the randomized treatment arm.  All safety endpoints will be listed 
in b
y-patient data listings. 
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_580389].  Clinically significant deteriorations in physical examination findings will be 
reported and summarized as adverse events. 
Laboratory values will be converted to the project-defined unit of measurement, as applicable, 
before analysis.  Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values will be reported and 
summ
arized as adverse events (refer to Section 11.1 ) . 
Adver
se Events 
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug (i.e., 
Da
y 1), will be considered a pre-treatment adverse event.  Treatment-emergent adverse events 
(T
EAEs) will be defined as any adverse event that occurs after administration of the first dose of 
study drug through to the final study visit.  The number and percentage of patients who report 
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657].  
Treatment emergent adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_324559].

    P
atients who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be counted once for the 
preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by [CONTACT_580390].  If a patient reports multiple 
preferred terms for a system organ class, the patient will be counted only once for that system 
organ class. 
Proportions for adverse events that are gender-specific (e.g., dysmenorrhea) will be based on the 
number of patients from that gender. 
The number and percentage of patients who experience TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_580391]:

Additionally, treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_207247]: [ADDRESS_763175] dose of study drug on 
Day 1; if Day 1 values are unavailable, then values obtained at the Screening Visit will be used. 
Second, shift tables will summarize the number and percentage of patients with categorical 
changes from baseline defined by [CONTACT_580393] (Below reference range, Within reference range, and Above reference range).  The 
ba

-baseline category will be assigned and summarized in 2 ways for each laboratory parameter: 
smallest post-baseline value and largest post-baseline value. 
Third, treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory values will be 
identified.  Potentially clinically significant values are defined as those that meet Grade [ADDRESS_763177] dose of study drug on 
Day 1; if Day [ADDRESS_763178] 1 PCS vital sign value will be summarized 
descriptively.

    13. R
EGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
It is the responsibility of the clinical site and staff to notify the Sponsor and Sponsor’s designee 
immediately upon becoming aware of a serious breach of GCP or of the study protocol.  It is the 
re
sponsibility of the Sponsor or its designee to notify appropriate regulatory authorities of any 
se
rious breach which is likely to effect, to a significant degree, the safety or mental integrity of 
the patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
13.1. Good Clinical Practice 
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
doc
umentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized 
representative, and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_27727], as described in ICH Guideline E6 (R2) and in 
a
ccordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study 
will receive approval from the IRB/EC prior to commencement.  The Investigator will conduct 
a
ll aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the 
pertinent regulatory authorities. 
13.2. Sponsor’s Responsibilities 
The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for the following: 
 S electing qualified Investigators 
 P roviding Investigators with the information they need to properly conduct an 
investigation 
 Ensur ing proper monitoring of the investigation 
 Ensuring that the applicable regulatory authorities, and all participating Investigators 
are properly informed of significant new information regarding adverse events or 
risks associated with the medication being studied 
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of the Sponsor

     P erform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other 
records relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for 
each patient (e.g., clinic charts). 
 R ecord and report any protocol deviations. 
 Due  to the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility for site closures and/or travel 
restrictions, source data verification may be performed remotely.  
 C onfirm adverse events and serious adverse events have been properly documented on 
eCRFs and confirm any serious adverse events have been forwarded to the Sponsor and 
those serious adverse events that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the 
I
RB/EC by [CONTACT_51015]. 
The
 monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
As the Sponsor, Concert Pharmaceuticals has delegated some responsibilities to a designee, or 
Contract Research Organization. 
13.3. Investigator’s Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local 
regulations.  Each Investigator participating in this study is required to maintain complete and 
accurate study documentation in compliance with current GCP standards and all applicable local 
regulations related to the conduct of a clinical study. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_580347], any amendments to the protocol, the study drug, and their 
study-related duties and functions.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17459] a list of sub-
Investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated 
significant study-related duties.  Individuals ineligible from conducting or working on clinical 
studies, including those ineligible as a result of debarment under the Generic Drug Enforcement 
Act of 1992, will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies sponsored by [CONTACT_580394] 
P
harmaceuticals.  The Investigator is required to immediately disclose to the Sponsor in writing, 
if any person involved in the conduct of the study is debarred pursuant to a hearing by [CONTACT_324564]-fraud law, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending, or is (to the best of the 
Investigator’s knowledge) threatened.  
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all patients who sign an informed consent 
document.  Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the patient’s source 
documents. 
The Investigator or designee should inform the IRB/EC of any event likely to affect the safety of 
patients or the continued conduct of the study, in particular any change in safety.  Additionally, 
all updates to the Investigator’s Brochure will be sent to the IRB/EC and Regulatory Agencies, 
a
s required per country regulations.  Where applicable, a progress report will be sent to the 
I
RB/EC and the protocol will be reviewed annually (e.g., re-approved) or more frequently, as 
required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC or local regulations.  
CTP-543  23 February 2021 
Protocol CP543.3002  C oncert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 64  
    The
 Investigator will maintain a copy of all correspondence with/from the IRB/EC, including 
c
opi[INVESTIGATOR_580348].  The Investigator will also maintain a copy of the IRB/EC 
membership list with occupation and qualification (or a statement confirming compliance with 
GCP requirements for committee composition).   
In the US, the Investigator or designee will notify the IRB of the conclusion of the clinical study 
withi
n 1 month of completion or termination of the study.  The final report sent to the IRB will 
also be sent to the Sponsor along with the completed electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and 
all necessary regulatory documents, thereby [CONTACT_53617]’s regulatory responsibility.   
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to patient records (e.g., 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries. 
13.4. Protocol Amendments 
Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific 
study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  All amendments to the protocol will 
be written by [CONTACT_1034].  The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without 
prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Except for 
administrative amendments, Investigators must await IRB/EC approval of protocol amendments 
before implementing the change(s).  The Sponsor will ensure submission of any protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies and Ethics Committees. 
Tr
ial conduct may be impacted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Challenges may arise (e.g., 
qua
rantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for the 
investigational product, etc.) leading to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures, 
including administering or using the investigational product or adhering to protocol-mandated 
visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing.  Taking into consideration Regulatory Agency guidance, 
amendments to protocol defined criteria may be implemented without IRB approval or before 
filing an amendment to the IND/CTA in order to minimize or eliminate immediate hazards or to 
prote
ct the life and well-being of research participants (e.g., to limit exposure to COVID-19).   
Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research 
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the study.  However, a protocol change 
int
ended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients should be implemented 
immediately, and the IRB/EC notified within 5 days or per local regulations.   
W
hen, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/EC, the Investigators, and/or the 
Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the 
potential risk to the patient, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification.  
In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained from patients enrolled in the study before 
continued participation under the new amendment. 
13.5. Audits and Inspections 
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct audits at the study site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to: drug supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, laboratory specimen processing, and comparison of eCRFs with 
CTP-543  23 February 2021 
Protocol CP543.3002  C oncert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 65  
    sourc
e documents.  The Investigator agrees to cooperate with audits conducted at a reasonabl e 
time and in a reasonable manner. 
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also audit the Investigator/site during or after the study.  
The
 Investigator should contact [CONTACT_76631], and must fully cooperate 
with the audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner. 
The Investigator is required to make all study documentation promptly available for inspection, 
review or audit at the study site upon request by [CONTACT_2728], its representatives, or any appropriate 
regulatory agencies. 
13.6. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_580395].   
A qua
lity control and quality assurance plan addressing aspects of the study that may impact data

ATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
14.1. Confidentiality 
All information disclosed or provided by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee), or generated or produced 
during the study including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the Investigator’s 
Brochure, and the results obtained during the course of the study, are confidential.  The 
Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose 
the information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
Submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB/EC is expressly 
permitted, IRB/EC members having the same obligation of confidentiality.  Authorized 
re
gulatory officials and sponsor personnel (or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and 
copy the records.  The copi[INVESTIGATOR_580349].  Study drug, patient bodily fluids, and/or other materials 
collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in 
writing by [CONTACT_324566](s) or regulatory authorities. 
Patients’ names may, however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized 
officials in the event of inspections.  Documents containing the full name [CONTACT_580400].  This information will not be 
transferred to the Sponsor nor be contained in regulatory filings.   
14.2. Patient Data Protection 
Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates 
must also provide all authorizations required by [CONTACT_1769] (e.g., protected health information 
a
uthorization).  
Patients will be identified only by [CONTACT_324567].  The patient will not be identified by [CONTACT_71403], in any study samples or 
study reports.  All data generated in this study is for research purposes only.  The Sponsor, its 
pa
rtner(s) and designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of 
this study.  Every effort will be made to keep the patient’s personal medical data confidential.  
The Sponsor will protect individual patient information to the fullest extent possible during this 
study.  At no time will a patient become identified in any publication or presentation.  However, 
the patient may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit or 
inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to patient information is at the 
discretion of the Sponsor and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as 
de
termined solely by [CONTACT_324568]. 
14.3. Data Collection 
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will use an 
electronic data capture system.  Data reported in the eCRFs should be consistent with and 
subst
antiated by [CONTACT_102]’s medical record and original source documents.  Any discrepancies 
must be explained.

rior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a Delegation of Authority 
form (Site Signature [CONTACT_53633]), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individuals who are 
authorized to make or change entries on eCRFs. 
14.4. Case Report Form Completion 
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate according to the 
Monitoring Plan.  Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while monitoring.  
Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately.  Additionally, the 
Sponsor’s designee and the Sponsor may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which 
could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution.  The completed eCRF for 
each patient must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_580350]. 
14.5. Database Management, Data Clarification, and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor’s designee (i.e., a designated Contract Research Organization) will be responsible 
for data management.  Data Management will develop a Data Management Plan (DMP ) 
document, and provide it to the Sponsor for approval.  The DMP document will define all 
activities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed DMP will be based on the 
protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data-flows, eCRFs, data cleaning procedures, 
other supporting documents, and data management standards and practices. 
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data 
Manager after entry.  The sites will respond to the data queries in a timely manner. 
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated 
Contract Research Organization standard operating procedures. 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.  Any 
changes to the database after that time will only be made by [CONTACT_580397], Statistician, Data Manager, and Quality Assurance Auditor according to designated 
standard operating procedures of the Contract Research Organization. 
14.6. Inspection of Records 
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the Sponsor or designee must verify data entered in 
the e
CRF entries against the source documents.  The objective of source document verification is 
to compl
y with GCP and international regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud.  
Source document verification means ensuring that source documents are an accurate and 
confirmable reflection of the patient’s evaluations during participation in the study and that all 
relevant information recorded in the source document is accurately entered into the eCRF.  All 
sourc
e documents should be correctly labeled and filed and associated with a single, verifiable 
patient. 
All data required for this study should be captured in source notes.  No data obtained by [CONTACT_324570].  All source 
documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_580398]-543  23 February 2021

The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply 
original source documentation for this clinical study. 
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the eCRF the following information: 
 I nformation to confirm that the patient exists [e.g., initials, date of birth (applicabl e 
per local regulations), and sex]; 
 C onfirmation that the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
 C onfirmation that the patient is taking part in the clinical study; 
 C onfirmation of the informed consent process; 
 Visi t dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures; 
 I nformation concerning all adverse events; 
 De tails of concomitant and investigational medications. 
Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical study monitoring, the purpose of 
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the eCRF has been fully and 
accurately completed, source document verification has been carried out, and the study timelines 
and enrollment goals and requirements have been met.  In light of the COVID-[ADDRESS_763180] retain study records from investigational drug studies for a period of 
2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for 
which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and the 
appropriate regulatory authority is notified. 
The
 Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, and take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study essential documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform the Sponsor.  The relevant 
records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.

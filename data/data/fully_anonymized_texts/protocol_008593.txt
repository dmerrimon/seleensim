 Scientific Background 
Many major gynecologic surgeries are increasingly becoming outpatient procedures (1-
3). One criterion for same-day discharge is adequate pain control. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], many 
women report suboptimal pain control after discharge following vaginal surgery (4). 
Furthermore, at 6 weeks postoperatively, only 50% of patients felt that they had fully 
recovered from surgery (4). Thus, even though a minimally invasive approach, there are 
areas for improvement in postoperative recovery after vaginal surgery. 
 
Various local anesthetic techniques, including pudendal nerve blocks, have been 
studied as forms of preemptive analgesia to improve pain associated with vaginal 
surgery.  While the methodologies vary making direct comparison difficult, the studies 
assessing preemptive analgesia at the time of vaginal surgery have yielded mixed 
results, particularly for api[INVESTIGATOR_257124] (5-9) and an effective and 
generalizable way to reduce postoperative pain in a population of Female Pelvic 
Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery patients undergoing vaginal reconstructive 
surgery with api[INVESTIGATOR_257125]. 
 
We utilize a novel injection technique in which we inject the study medication via a 
transobturator approach into the levator ani muscles directly.  We utilized this approach 
in addition to the pudendal nerve blockade to deliver study medication to the levator ani 
muscles themselves and any distal nerve branches of the levator ani nerve, with the 
idea that this would decrease pain and edema at the operative site and improve 
postoperative pain control. We add dexamethasone to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_257126]-inflammatory qualities (10). These anti-inflammatory 
properties have been translated to the surgical realm and the addition of perioperative 
dexamethasone has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective way to improve 
perioperative recovery in multiple disciplines, including gynecology (11-15).  
 
Study Objectives 
 
Our primary aim is to determine if bilateral transobturator levator ani muscle injections 
and transvaginal pudendal nerve blocks with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_257127] (NRS) on postoperative day 
1 after vaginal reconstructive api[INVESTIGATOR_257124].  
 
Our secondary aims include postoperative nausea and vomiting (measured by [CONTACT_257140]), analgesic consumption (measured in 
morphine equivalents), same-day discharge, postoperative pain at 6 hours, 48 hours, 72 
hours and 1 week (measured by [CONTACT_257141]), need for either self-catheterization or 
indwelling catheter, safety and adverse events, and time to resume normal activity 
(measured by [CONTACT_257142] 1,2,6 and 12 weeks postoperatively). 
 
Study Design & Methods 
 
We performed a 3-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of bilateral 
transobturator levator ani muscle injections and transvaginal pudendal nerve blocks 
Page 3 of 6 
 prior to native tissue vaginal api[INVESTIGATOR_257128]. 
Women were randomized to one of three study medication groups distributed over 4 
injection sites: 22mL of 0.9% saline (placebo group), 22 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
(bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195]), or 20 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 4mg (2mL) of dexamethasone 
(combined group).  
 
Recruitment occurred and written informed consent was obtained during regularly 
scheduled preoperative office visits. If no preoperative visit was scheduled, informed 
consent was performed by [CONTACT_257143]. Block randomization occurred 1-2 days 
prior to scheduled surgery in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_312492] protected, secure location and only accessed by [CONTACT_257144]. 
We also took additional steps to ensure a double-blinded design. After randomization 
but before the start of the prolapse procedure, pharmacy personnel delivered the study 
medication to the operating room in a single, clear syringe labeled “Study Medication” 
and the corresponding study identification number. All syringes were identical. 
Additionally, normal saline, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_257129], 
which allowed us to blind physicians to the study medication being administered. 
Patients were also blinded to the study intervention until [ADDRESS_312493] of the obturator foramen 
through the obturator internus muscle. The trajectory of the needle at this point was 
angled slightly posteriorly towards the ischial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], traveling parallel to the arcus 
tendineus levator ani and arcus tendineus fascia pelvis. The spi[INVESTIGATOR_257130], maintaining the same trajectory and with the 
vaginal hand ensuring that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_257131]. Once the 
tip of the needle was at a depth where it had reached the ischial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_257132]. Bilateral pudendal nerve blocks were performed transvaginally after the 
transobturator injections. The pudendal nerve blocks were performed according to 
previously described technique (21,22). Five milliliters of study medication were injected 
at each of the four injection sites for a total of [ADDRESS_312494] been previously published (23). In summary, patients received 
intravenous propofol, ketamine, lidocaine, muscle relaxant and dexamethasone for 
induction and intravenous ketamine and lidocaine for maintenance (23). The 
intravenous dexamethasone given upon induction is part of the protocol to prevent 
postoperative nausea and vomiting. To standardize intraoperative local anesthetic, the 
amount of additional local infiltration was limited to 50ml of 0.5% lidocaine with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. According to our ERAS protocol, all surgeries were planned to be same-
day surgeries. Any deviations from protocol were documented. 
 
Our primary outcome was a numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score on postoperative 
day (POD) one. The NRS is an eleven-point scale ranging from 0 to 10 presented 
visually on a horizontal line. Higher scores represent more postoperative pain. 
 
Secondary outcomes included pain scores at additional timepoints (6 hours after 
surgery, POD 2, POD 3 and 1 week after surgery), same day discharge rates, voiding 
status at time of discharge, postoperative narcotic consumption measured in oral 
morphine equivalents, postoperative ibuprofen consumption, postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV), postoperative activities assessment, and adverse events.  PONV was 
assessed using the PONV Intensity scale, a four-question assessment to measure 
clinically significant nausea and vomiting with higher scores signifying more clinically 
significant PONV (26). Time to resume normal activities was measured by [CONTACT_257145] (AAS), a 13-point scale on which patients rate their difficulty 
performing a range of activities from “No difficulty” to “Not able to do it.” A final score 
ranging from 0-100 is transformed, with higher numbers reflecting less difficulty with 
activities (27). Assessments were completed by [CONTACT_257146]. Women were followed for 12 weeks postoperatively and 
no additional office visits were required as part of the research protocol. 
 
Eligibility Criteria  
 
Women were eligible for inclusion if they were ≥18 years old and scheduled for a 
vaginal native tissue repair with api[INVESTIGATOR_58299] (uterosacral ligament 
suspension, sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11592], levator myorrhaphy or colpocleisis) and 
able to undergo general anesthesia. Concomitant procedures including hysterectomy, 
anterior and posterior colporrhaphies, perineorrhaphies and midurethral sling 
placements were permitted. All patients needed to be available for at least 12 weeks of 
follow-up.  Women were excluded for any of the following reasons: planned mesh-
augmented api[INVESTIGATOR_257133], laparoscopic, robotic or 
abdominal surgery, known adverse reaction or allergy to intervention medication, 
evidence of fistula or infection, chronic pelvic pain as an active issue, daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_257134] 5 of 6 
 consumption, history of pelvic radiation, daily steroid use, diabetes mellitus, 
immunosuppression, planned surgery under regional anesthesia, non-English speaking 
or inability to complete questionnaires, bleeding diatheses, or weight less than 50kg. 
We incorporated a weight less than 50kg as an exclusion criterion to ensure that the 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_257135]-based maximum dose, as recommended by 
[CONTACT_257147] (16).  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
All results will be analyzed by [CONTACT_7586]-to-treat based upon the study group to which 
subjects were randomized. One-way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, Chi-square, and Fisher’s 
Exact will be used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Based 
upon prior studies demonstrating that pain after vaginal surgery ranges from a 2 to 5 on 
numeric scales (range 0-10) and literature suggesting that a 33% decrease in pain is 
clinically significant, we elected to assess a 2-point change in NRS scores between 
treatment groups (5,7,9,28). Based upon an ANOVA evaluated at the 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_312495] deviation of 17.5, a sample size of 21 patients per arm 
provided 90% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores. To account for 20% 
attrition, we increased to 25 patients per arm for a total of 75 women. 
 
We hypothesized that concurrent bilateral transobturator levator ani muscle injections 
and transvaginal pudendal nerve blocks with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_257136].

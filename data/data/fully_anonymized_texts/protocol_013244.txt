Sample Size:N = 40 (20 participants per dose group). The final sample size will 
be determined by [CONTACT_694290] 20 participants per group.
Accrual Ceiling:N = 100
Study Population:Individuals aged 18 to 80 years with systemic lupus erythematous 
(SLE).
Accrual Period:48 months
Study Design:This is a study of the acute effects of glucocorticoids on the

Page 7 of 43Précis
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune syndrome that causes pervasive 
immune dysregulation in all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Most patients with 
SLE require glucocorticoid treatment at some point of the disease course, but the specific effects 
of glucocorticoids that lead to therapeutic benefit in this condition are not well understood. In 
addition, the glucocorticoid dosing regimens that are administered to patients with SLE in 
clinical practice are arbitrary and not based on detailed knowledge of the effects of 
glucocorticoids at different doses on cells of the immune system. This study aims to improve our 
understanding of the effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system of patients with SLE, and 
to test for possible differences in these effects at a range of clinically relevant doses.
A consistent outcome of glucocorticoid exposure is a significant reprogramming of a cell’s 
transcriptional state. The exact changes, however, vary substantially across cell types. Studies of 
specific cell populations, therefore, are necessary to gain a realistic view of the transcriptional 
effects of glucocorticoids. Given that cell composition and molecular behavior are known to 
differ among pathological states, the study of patients with SLE is necessary to identify the 
effects of glucocorticoids that are most likely to be responsible for their clinically beneficial 
effects in this condition.
In this study, participants with SLE, aged 18-80 years, will be randomized to receive a single 
intravenous infusion of 1 of 2 doses of the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg or 
250 mg). Blood will be collected within 75 days before infusion, immediately before the 
infusion, and again at 2 and 4 hours after the start of the infusion. Blood samples will be 
processed for isolation of hematopoietic cell subsets, including neutrophils, B cells, 
CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. 
Laboratory studies will be performed on the purified cells, with the goal of understanding the 
human response to glucocorticoids in vivo at the level of RNA (eg, RNA sequencing [RNA-seq], 
small-RNA-seq, real-time polymerase chain reaction), DNA (eg, chromatin immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_694277], methylation analysis, DNA sequencing, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), and protein (eg, flow 
cytometry, mass spectrometry). At each time point, serum methylprednisolone levels will be 
measured and flow cytometry for standard cell-lineage markers will be performed.
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 [ADDRESS_941830] salient knowledge 
gaps involve disease-specific effects and cell type–dependent effects. This study aims to directly 
address these two gaps, by [CONTACT_694293].
The glucocorticoid dosing regimens that are administered to patients with SLE in current clinical 
practice are arbitrary and not based on detailed knowledge of the effects of glucocorticoids at 
different doses on cells of the immune system. This unfortunately means that there may be 
unnecessary harm in current clinical practice. While repeated exposure to very high doses of 
glucocorticoids can lead to debilitating side effects, the extent to which such doses have effects 
on cells of the immune system that differ substantially from those achieved with lower doses 
remains unclear. Because the level of disease activity in patients with SLE tends to fluctuate over 
time, and higher doses are generally used to treat patients with higher disease activity, this 
patient population is particularly susceptible to the potential harm of arbitrary glucocorticoid 
dosing regimens. Therefore, a secondary aim of this study is to analyze the transcriptional 
response to in vivo administration of glucocorticoids at a range of clinically used doses. 
Glucocorticoids act primarily by [CONTACT_694294] (GR), a 
nuclear receptor of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily.3 The ligand-bound GR 
translocates into the nucleus and can directly bind DNA at specific recognition sequences known 
as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), increasing or decreasing transcription rates 
depending on the type of GRE.4,[ADDRESS_941831] (tethered) GR binding appear to 
cluster around and amplify the activity of direct binding sites.[ADDRESS_941832] been 
hypothesized to result from intercalation of glucocorticoid molecules into the membrane.13 They 
also include interactions with membrane-bound forms of GR.14-16
While the mechanisms are diverse, a consistent outcome of glucocorticoid exposure is a 
significant reprogramming of a cell’s transcriptional state.17,[ADDRESS_941833] been valuable tools for the study 
of the molecular biology of GR signaling. However, their genomic composition and chromatin 
landscape are known to differ substantially from those of human primary cells. Similarly, 
complex cell mixtures, such as whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 
have offered an initial glimpse of the genes and pathways affected by a glucocorticoid stimulus 
in primary human cells,17,[ADDRESS_941834] studied 
the genome-wide transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in 9 primary human hematopoietic 
and non-hematopoietic cell types from healthy human volunteers.24 For each cell type, we 
performed total RNA-seq before, 2 hours after, and 6 hours after in vitro stimulation with 
methylprednisolone or vehicle. We found that the number of genes that responded to the 
glucocorticoid stimulus differed substantially among cell types. In addition, the specific 
transcripts that responded to the glucocorticoid stimulus were very different in each cell type. Of 
the 10,665 glucocorticoid-responsive transcripts identified, 5184 (48.6%) were significantly 
differentially expressed after glucocorticoid treatment in only 1 of the 9 cell types, and only 
23 (0.2%) were significantly differentially expressed after treatment in all cell types. In principle, 
the observed differences in the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids among cell types could 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 [ADDRESS_941835] demonstrated the utility of this approach in uncovering functional effects of glucocorticoids 
by [CONTACT_342310] B cells, which play a key role in antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. 
Cross-talk between the B-cell receptor (BCR) and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways 
plays a central role in the integration of functional B-cell responses25 and in the development of 
autoreactive B cells.[ADDRESS_941836]-level map suggested that pharmacologic doses of 
glucocorticoids had strong transcriptional effects on key genes in both pathways. Based on this, 
we hypothesized that glucocorticoids could functionally impair BCR and intracellular TLR 
signaling in human B cells.
To determine whether the in vitro findings on BCR signaling genes were consistent with 
transcriptional changes in B cells exposed to glucocorticoids in vivo, we measured the 
expression of key BCR signaling genes over time in a cohort of 20 unrelated healthy volunteers 
who received a single IV dose of methylprednisolone as part of our clinical protocol, 16-I-0126, 
“Genomic Responses of Human Immune and Non-Immune Cells to Glucocorticoids” (principal 
investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_694278]). Consistent with the in vitro data, we observed a significant drop in the 
expression of CD79B, which encodes Igβ, a protein required for BCR assembly and for signal 
initiation after antigen stimulation.27,[ADDRESS_941837], expression of CD79A, which encodes Igα, 
was not significantly affected. The gene CR2, which encodes a key component of the B-cell 
co-receptor complex that enhances BCR-mediated signaling,29 was also significantly reduced in 
expression in response to glucocorticoid.
We also observed decreased expression of BTK, which encodes a key tyrosine kinase 
immediately downstream of the BCR complex, and of BLNK, which encodes a B-cell adaptor 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE

Page 11 of 43protein central to BCR signaling. Interestingly, the gene that encodes the key upstream kinase 
LYN was significantly reduced in expression after glucocorticoid administration in vivo, 
although it had not reached statistical significance in vitro, and the opposite was true of the 
upstream kinase SYK, which emphasizes the importance of studying these phenomena in vivo 
and in multiple unrelated individuals. 
Consistent with our observation of a glucocorticoid-induced drop in transcriptional output from 
the immunoglobulin and CD79B loci, in vitro exposure of human B cells to glucocorticoid led to 
a significant drop in surface expression of the BCR when compared to vehicle-treated cells. We 
found, however, that within 4 hours of glucocorticoid exposure, human B cells still had sufficient 
levels of BCR on the cell surface to allow stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies, with the goal of 
functionally assessing signaling downstream of the BCR. We then measured phosphorylation of 
CD79A (an upstream signaling component) and of PLCγ2 (a downstream signaling component) 
in response to BCR stimulation with anti-IgM, in the presence of glucocorticoid or vehicle. We 
measured signaling by [CONTACT_51213]-flow cytometry to simultaneously assess the response of total, 
naïve, and unswitched memory B cells. We found that glucocorticoids impair IgM-BCR 
signaling. Interestingly, for both readouts, the observed reduction in signaling in total B cells 
appeared to be primarily driven by a stronger and significant effect on unswitched memory 
cells.[ADDRESS_941838], glucocorticoids did not 
significantly alter the response to the TLR8 stimulus. To extend these findings, we measured 
expression of CCL3 and CCL4, two genes that are responsive to TLR7 and TLR8 stimulation but 
whose expression is unaffected by [CONTACT_694295] B cells. Consistent with our prior 
observations, glucocorticoids significantly decreased the transcriptional response of CCL3 and 
CCL4 after TLR7 stimulation, whereas no significant difference was observed after TLR8 
stimulation.

Page 12 of 431.2 Scientific Rationale
In summary, our in vitro and in vivo work to date suggests that:
a. A genomics approach can serve as an entry point for the unbiased study of glucocorticoid 
responses in primary human cells and it can uncover specific mechanisms of immune 
regulation that can be further characterized by [CONTACT_694292].
b. The response to glucocorticoids is highly cell type–dependent. Therefore, information at 
the level of individual cell types and the study of patients with specific diseases will be 
necessary to identify the effects of glucocorticoids that are most likely to be responsible 
for their clinically beneficial effects.
These observations are the basis for the present study. We will analyze the genomic response to 
in vivo glucocorticoid administration in patients with SLE by [CONTACT_694296] ( Figure 1). This will 
allow us to study, in a clinically realistic setting, the effects of glucocorticoids at different doses 
on the immune system of patients with SLE; the level of interindividual variation in 
glucocorticoid responses at the molecular level; and the differences at baseline and in response to 
glucocorticoids between cells from patients and those from the previously studied healthy 
subjects.
Figure 1. Study design. Patients with SLE will be enrolled. Each participant will be randomized to one of 2 dose 
groups and will receive a single IV dose of the glucocorticoid (GC) methylprednisolone. Blood will be sampled 
serially for purification of hematopoietic cell subsets. Total RNA will be purified from each cell subset and total 
RNA-seq and small RNA-seq will be performed. The transcriptome-level changes in response to GC for each cell 
type will serve as the basis for the identification of the key molecular pathways and cellular functions that are 
affected by [CONTACT_694297]. Important observations will be followed up by [CONTACT_694298].
Glucocorticoids remain a mainstay of therapy in a broad range of conditions, despi[INVESTIGATOR_694279]-recognized adverse effects and a large and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_694280]
 [ADDRESS_941839] human cell types and in relevant 
disease states. We believe this work will be an important step towards achieving that goal.
1.3 Choice of a Glucocorticoid, Route of Administration, and Dose
Chemical modifications to the 21-carbon corticosteroid backbone (eg, introduction of a 
carbon 1-2 double bond, methylation at carbon 6, and fluorination at carbon 9) have led to the 
diverse set of glucocorticoids that is currently available for clinical use. These modifications 
have mostly altered the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs, and the relative proportion of 
mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid activity, but they do not appear to have significantly altered 
the mechanism of action or the side effect profile of glucocorticoids. Therefore, the choice of a 
specific glucocorticoid for our study was based on the frequency of its use in clinical practice 
and on the availability of an IV formulation (to reduce potential interindividual variation in rates 
of absorption). 
Methylprednisolone is widely used in clinical practice, with indications in the management of 
diverse conditions including lupus nephritis,30 dermatomyositis,31 acute asthma exacerbations,32 
and relapses of multiple sclerosis.33 IV methylprednisolone has also been used in multiple studies 
of healthy volunteers since the early 1970s, including our own,24,34-36 without reports of serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in those studies. Sodium succinate and phosphate esters are available for 
IV use. The pharmacokinetics of IV methylprednisolone are also dose-linear,35,[ADDRESS_941840] to glucocorticoid use is that of the minimum dose 
that can effectively suppress the immune system. The dosing regimens for glucocorticoids that 
are commonly used in clinical medicine are mostly arbitrary and based on historical precedent 
rather than on an objective assessment of their effects on the immune system.3,13 While the 
glucocorticoid receptor is nearly saturated at prednisone-equivalent doses in the high-dose range 
(30-100 mg/day),3 much higher doses are often used in the clinic, despi[INVESTIGATOR_694281] a lower dose. To determine the extent to which the 
transcriptional response to a single dose of glucocorticoid varies by [CONTACT_2715], we will randomize 
study participants into 1 of 2 dose groups: 1 mg/kg or 250 mg.3 The 1-mg/kg dose was selected 
because it is commonly used as a starting dose in multiple clinical settings, including in patients 
with moderate SLE disease activity. The 250-mg dose was selected because that was the dose 
used in our clinical study of healthy volunteers; administering the same dose to patients with

 [ADDRESS_941841] whether the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids differs between the two 
doses being studied.
3. To identify similarities and differences, at baseline and in response to glucocorticoids, 
between the transcriptome of cells from patients and those from the previously studied 
healthy subjects.
3 Study Design
3.1 Description of the Study Design
Potential participants will present to the NIH CC for a screening visit. Objective documentation 
of the diagnosis of SLE, the specific clinical manifestations, and the level of disease activity will 
be established. A baseline whole blood sample will be obtained at screening. Each enrolled 
participant will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 methylprednisolone dose groups: 1 mg/kg or 
250 mg. 
All enrolled participants will return for a day-long study visit (“infusion visit”) within 75 days of 
the screening visit. Following collection of a pre-infusion whole blood sample, participants will 
receive a single IV dose of methylprednisolone (based on the dose group assignment), infused 
over 30 minutes. Whole blood samples will then be obtained serially, 2 and 4 hours after the start 
of infusion.
Participants will be discharged after collection of the 4-hour blood sample, measurement of vital 
signs, and documentation of any adverse events (AEs). Two follow-up phone calls will be made 
to document any AEs related to the methylprednisolone. If any AEs that may require treatment 
are documented on the follow-up phone calls, then participants will be asked to return to the NIH 
CC’s outpatient clinic for evaluation by [CONTACT_458].

Page 15 of 43We propose an adaptive study design, in which we will recruit an initial cohort of 20 participants 
into each of the 2 dosing groups. After processing the samples from these participants, we will 
perform differential expression analysis to determine if recruitment of additional participants (up 
to the accrual ceiling of 100) would affect the biological interpretation of the data. If additional 
data would be unlikely to change the study outcome, then no further recruitment will be pursued.

Page 19 of 435.4 Randomization
Study participants will be randomized evenly to 2 dose groups. The purpose of randomization in 
this setting is to produce balanced dose groups where participants are comparable between 
groups in terms of possible confounding factors such as age, sex, or concomitant medication use. 
To further ensure that participants are similar in terms of SLE severity between the groups, we 
will adopt stratified randomization according to their disease activity using the Safety of 
Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment SLE Disease Activity Index 
(SELENA/SLEDAI) score on the day of enrollment. Participants will be classified into 1 of 
3 disease-severity categories: low (SELENA/SLEDAI score = 0-4), intermediate 
(SELENA/SLEDAI score = 5-8), or high (SELENA/SLEDAI score > 9).  Randomization will be 
carried out within each category. This stratified randomization method ensures the proportion of 
participants with high disease activity is the same between the dose groups.
The study statistician will design the randomization scheme. The randomization code list will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_694300].  
5.5 Preparation, Administration, and Dosage of Study Agent
Methylprednisolone will be prepared according to the package insert and depending on the dose 
group to which each participant has been assigned.37 The study agent solution will be 
administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes, for a total single dose of 1 mg/kg or 250 mg of 
methylprednisolone. Pulse oximetry will be followed during the infusion for safety monitoring.
5.6 Concomitant Medications and Procedures
All concomitant prescription and nonprescription (including over-the-counter) medications taken 
during study participation will be recorded. For this protocol, a prescription medication is 
defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician.
5.7 Prohibited Medications and Procedures
Treatment with the following drugs/medications will not be permitted during participation in this 
study:
Desmopressin.
CYP3A4 inducers nafcillin, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, or troglitazone.
CYP3A4 inhibitors clarithromycin, itraconazole, or ketoconazole.
Belimumab or rituximab.
Receipt of any vaccine.

Page 21 of 43oRandom morning serum cortisol level.
oLiver function tests (hepatic panel).
oComplement levels: C3 and C4.
oAnti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies.
oErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
oHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
oLipid panel.
oSerum creatine kinase (CPK).
oSerum pregnancy test (for participants capable of becoming pregnant).
oProthrombin/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT).
oHIV and hepatitis A, B and C (viral markers screen test, which includes HBsAg, 
anti-HCV IgG, anti-HAV IgM). Test results obtained within the past [ADDRESS_941849] results obtained within 30 days of the 
screening visit under protocol 94-AR-0066 will be accepted for screening.
After eligibility is confirmed, participants who are receiving glucocorticoid therapy may be 
directed to undergo a taper before the infusion visit, as described in section 6.2, below.
6.1.1 Management of Patients who are Experiencing a Lupus Flare at the Time of the 
Screening Visit
Patients who are eligible for enrollment based on the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria, but 
who are experiencing a lupus flare at the time of their screening visit, will be considered for 
enrollment only when the following two criteria are met:
a. The infusion visit can be scheduled for a date that is within 7 days of enrollment, and 
b. The severity of the flare does not require administration of glucocorticoids prior to 
the anticipated date of the infusion visit.
The above criteria will apply irrespective of whether the patients are on glucocorticoid therapy at 
the time of their screening visit, but patients who are experiencing a lupus flare while on 
glucocorticoid therapy will not be deemed eligible for a glucocorticoid taper. For patients on 
glucocorticoid therapy who are experiencing a lupus flare at the time of their screening visit, the 
maximum prednisone or prednisone-equivalent dose will be ≤ 15 mg/day. Patients on higher 
doses of chronic glucocorticoid therapy who are experiencing a flare are deemed likely to require 
an infusion earlier than [ADDRESS_941850] clinical practice. In the setting of this study, the rationale for 
tapering is two-fold:
i. Patients in whom the dose of glucocorticoid can be tapered to zero can be 
studied in the same context as those who were not receiving glucocorticoids 
prior to the study.
ii. Patients in whom the dose of glucocorticoid is tapered, but their disease 
activity increases during the taper, can provide very valuable information. 
Identifying the genes and molecular pathways that differ between a chronic 
stable dose, a disease flare at a lower dose, and the subsequent response to a 
glucocorticoid infusion, can help identify the genes that glucocorticoids 
regulate chronically to sustain clinical remission.
To maximize the safety of glucocorticoid tapering in this study, enrolled participants will be 
considered eligible for a glucocorticoid taper if they are on a stable prednisone or prednisone-
equivalent dose ≤ 10 mg/day and have not had escalation of other immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_694284], as indicated in inclusion criteria 7 and 8, and in exclusion criterion 4.
The taper will be managed by [CONTACT_694301] 
(LCTU). The LCTU staff are actively involved in the care of patients in the study of the natural 
history of SLE (94-AR-0066), in which all participants in this study will also be enrolled. The 
tapering protocol is described in Error! Not a valid bookmark self-reference..

reached. Then, decrease dose by 1 mg/week until the taper is 
complete.
≤ 5 mg/day Decrease dose by 1 mg/week until the taper is complete
The taper will be considered complete when a participant reaches one of two endpoints:
1. The participant is no longer receiving a glucocorticoid, or
2. Upon clinical evidence of a disease flare.
For participants whose taper ends because they are no longer receiving a glucocorticoid, the 
infusion visit will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_941851] dose of 
glucocorticoid. After the infusion visit, participants will be followed up by [CONTACT_694302]/or their outside rheumatologist for further management of the disease and decision to restart 
glucocorticoid medication.
For participants whose taper ends due to clinical evidence of a disease flare, or if a disease flare 
occurs between the end of the taper and the infusion visit, then the infusion visit will be 
scheduled within 7 days after the documentation of the flare. After the infusion visit, participants 
will be followed by [CONTACT_694303]/or their outside rheumatologist for further management 
of the disease and decision to restart glucocorticoid medication. If the severity of the flare 
requires intervention prior to a scheduled infusion visit, then the participant will be withdrawn 
from the study and will continue to be managed by [CONTACT_694303]/or their outside 
rheumatologist, as appropriate. 
Of note, exogenous glucocorticoid administration suppresses the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal 
(HPA) axis, and the time following a glucocorticoid taper that it takes for the HPA axis to return 
to normal function can vary among individuals. Formal documentation of the function of the 
HPA axis by a cosyntropin stimulation test is not part of routine clinical practice after 
glucocorticoids are tapered, unless a person is experiencing signs or symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency. Therefore, cosyntropin stimulation testing will not be part of this study. It is 
unclear whether the baseline function of the HPA axis influences the transcriptional response by 
[CONTACT_694304]. Although this study is not designed 
to address that question, the glucocorticoid panel that will be obtained before and after 
medication administration on the day of infusion ( Table 2) includes measurement of plasma 
cortisol. Morning cortisol levels > 15 µg/dL are predictive of a normal result on a short 
cosyntropin stimulation test in nearly all patients, and values < 5 µg/dL predict an abnormal 
result in nearly all patients.39,40 Therefore, depending on the distribution of values in this group 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 24 of 43of participants, these data could eventually be used to stratify the participants by [CONTACT_694305], to assess whether this leads to measurable differences in the response 
to exogenous glucocorticoids.
6.3 Infusion Visit (day 0)
Targeted physical exam with vital signs (on initial encounter and prior to discharge).
Acute care panel (results will be obtained before infusion).
IV catheter insertion.
Serum pregnancy test (for those capable of becoming pregnant; results will be obtained 
before infusion). For participants tested within the past [ADDRESS_941852] will not be 
repeated.
Interim medical history and medication review.
Pre-infusion blood draw.
IV infusion of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (30 minutes).
Blood pressure monitoring every [ADDRESS_941853] blood sample.
Pulse oximetry monitoring during the infusion. 
Nursing staff will monitor participants for the presence of behavioral abnormalities 
(altered mood, hyperactivity, disorientation, psychosis).
Blood draws at 2 and 4 hours (± 10 minutes) after the start of infusion.
In participants whose glucocorticoid taper ends due to clinical evidence of a disease flare, the 
following additional procedures will be performed on the day of the infusion visit:
SELENA-SLEDAI score.
Urine collection for the following:
oUrinalysis with microscopic examination.
oSpot urine protein, creatinine, and protein-to-creatinine ratio.
Blood draw for the following:
oComplete blood count with differential.
oComplement levels: C3 and C4.
oAnti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies.
6.4 Follow-up Phone Calls
A follow-up phone call will be made between days 1 and 3 after the infusion visit to document 
the presence or absence of side effects related to the study drug. A second follow-up phone call 
will be made 5 days (± 2 days) after the infusion visit. If any AEs that may require treatment are 
documented on the follow-up phone calls, then the participant will be asked to come to the NIH 
CC’s outpatient clinic for evaluation by [CONTACT_458]. Participation in this study will 
be complete after the second phone call or, if applicable, after any follow-up visits.

Page 25 of 437 Study Procedures/Evaluations
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate infusion: Participants will receive a single IV dose of 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate (based on the dose group to which they are assigned) 
administered through an IV catheter over a period of 30 minutes.
Blood draw: Blood will be drawn at screening, immediately prior to the study agent infusion, 
and 2 hours (± 10 minutes) and 4 hours (± 10 minutes) after the start of the infusion. Blood will 
be used for laboratory and research evaluations and storage as indicated in Table 2. The amount 
of blood drawn for research purposes will be within the limits allowed for adult research 
participants by [CONTACT_79837] (Medical Administrative Series Policy M95-9, Guidelines for Limits 
of Blood Drawn for Research Purposes in the Clinical Center: http://cc-
internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95-9.pdf).
ECG: 12-lead ECG will be performed at screening to rule out electrical cardiac abnormalities 
and ensure eligibility to receive the study agent.
SELENA/SLEDAI: The SELENA/SLEDAI index is a tool for measuring disease activity in 
patients with SLE. The score is determined by [CONTACT_694306] [ADDRESS_941854] results will be shared with the participant throughout the study. 
Unexpected or incidental medical findings unrelated to the study may occur and may require the 
participant to follow up with an appropriate physician/healthcare provider for standard medical 
care or follow-up.
The genetic research in this study is not designed or intended to produce data regarding health 
risks, incurable conditions, or information contradictory to stated biological relationships 
between individuals. Therefore, it is not expected that the results from these studies will be 
returned to volunteers. In the rare event of detecting an incidental finding related to a 
participant’s health, we will share the information with the participant. Genetic counseling and 
advice is available from the NIH to help participants understand the implications of incidental 
findings, if necessary.

8 Potential Risks and Benefits
8.1 Potential Risks
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate infusion: Side effects from a one-time IV dose of 
methylprednisolone may include metallic or bitter taste in the mouth during and possibly after 
infusion, upset stomach, sleep disturbance (insomnia, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/fatigue), increased appetite, 
water retention, weight gain, temporary increase in blood glucose, temporary increase in blood 
pressure, changes in white blood cell counts (eg, leukocytosis , neutrophilia, monocytopenia, or 
eosinopenia), mood disturbance or unusual behavior, electrolyte imbalance, muscle cramps, back 
pain, headaches, flushing, and frequent urination lasting 1-[ADDRESS_941855] been 
reported in patients receiving methylprednisolone.
Serious cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurologic/psychiatric, and other side effects of 
IV methylprednisolone have been reported in patients with underlying disease. 
There are reports of cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest following the rapid administration 
of large IV doses of methylprednisolone (greater than 0.5 g administered over a period of less 
than 10 minutes). Bradycardia has been reported during or after the administration of large doses 
of methylprednisolone sodium succinate and may be unrelated to the speed or duration of 
infusion. 
Glucocorticoid taper: For individuals who are eligible for the study and undergo a 
glucocorticoid taper, the progressive reduction in the dose of glucocorticoid may result in 
destabilization of SLE, potentially leading to a disease flare.
Blood draw and IV placement: The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, bleeding, 
fainting, and, rarely, infection.
ECG: ECGs are of minimal risk to the participants and cause no significant side effects. The 
electrodes may feel cold when applied; in rare cases, some people will develop a rash or skin 
irritation where the patches are placed. This type of irritation usually resolves by [CONTACT_694307][INVESTIGATOR_73201].
RNA-seq, DNA sequencing, and genome-wide genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Studies of RNA molecules will be 
performed to identify changes in gene expression in response to the study agent. Studies of DNA 
molecules (genome-wide genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) will be performed to identify variants in the genome that 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 28 of 43may influence gene expression. These studies will involve assays of specific regions of the 
genome. Depending on the findings, sequencing of DNA (either specific regions or the entire 
DNA molecule) may be performed in the future. Incidental findings from genetic studies may 
have psychological implications for participants and family members. Genetic counseling and 
advice is available from the NIH to help participants understand the implications of incidental 
findings, if necessary. Following genetic testing, data will be shared in a controlled-access public 
database in accordance with NIH guidelines, for other investigators to benefit from the 
information (eg, dbGaP, the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). However, no personal, 
identifiable information will be shared in this process, as the results will only be shared with a 
code.
8.2 Potential Benefits
This research is not designed to benefit study participants. This research is designed to provide 
generalizable knowledge about SLE pathogenesis and the mechanisms of action of 
glucocorticoids in SLE. The study may also inform the development of future anti-inflammatory 
and immunosuppressive medications.
9 Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens, and Data
Intended Use: Samples, specimens, and data collected under this protocol may be used to study 
the body’s response to glucocorticoids. Genetic testing will be performed.
Storage: Samples are stored in a secure facility with limited access. Samples and data will be 
de-identified prior to storage using a code assigned by [CONTACT_473]. All data, including the 
database linking the code with a specific individual, will be kept in password-protected 
computers. Only investigators or their designees will have access to the samples and data.
Tracking: Samples and data acquired under this protocol will be tracked using the Clinical 
Research Information Management System of the NIAID (CRIMSON). After de-identification, 
laboratory specimens will be tracked using the Biological Specimen Inventory system, under a 
NIAID-wide contract for laboratory specimen banking and tracking.
Disposition:
In the future, other investigators (at NIH or outside) may wish to study these samples 
and/or data. If the planned research falls within the category of “human subjects 
research” on the part of the NIH researchers, IRB review and approval will be obtained. 
This includes the NIH researchers sending out coded or linked samples or data, or getting 
results that they can link back to their participants.
At the time of protocol completion, samples will be either destroyed or, after IRB 
approval, transferred to another existing protocol. Data will be archived by [CONTACT_694308]
 30 November 2021
Page 29 of 43team in compliance with requirements for retention of research records; alternatively, 
after IRB approval, the data may be transferred to another repository.
Loss or Destruction:
Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples (for example, due to freezer 
malfunction) or data (for example, misplacing a printout of data with identifiers) that 
meets the definition of a protocol deviation, unanticipated problem (UP), and/or 
compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study, will be reported to 
the NIH IRB.
Additionally, participants may decide at any point not to have their samples stored. In this 
case, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_132268]. Participants who revoke permission to 
have their samples stored will be withdrawn from the protocol. However, this decision 
will not affect the individual’s participation in any other protocols at NIH.
10 Data Sharing Plan
Human data generated in this study will be shared for future research as follows:
De-identified data in an NIH-funded or approved public repository. Gene expression data 
will be made available through the Gene Expression Omnibus and Sequence Read 
Archive repositories.
De-identified data in public repositories.  
Identifiable data in the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS, 
automatic for activities in the CC) or the Genomic Research Integration System (GRIS).
De-identified or identifiable data with approved outside collaborators under appropriate 
agreements.
In publications and/or public presentations.
Data may be shared before publication, at the time of publication, or shortly thereafter.
Study participants will be offered co-enrollment in the NIAID Centralized Sequencing Program 
(protocol 17-I-0122). For participants who choose to enroll in that protocol, genome sequencing 
and microarray analysis will be performed as part of that protocol. Data generated as part of the 
Centralized Sequencing Program is shared with the referring investigators via the NIH Genomic 
Research Integration System (GRIS).
11 Remuneration Plan for Participants
Participants will be compensated for their time and inconvenience according to the following 
schedule:
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 30 of 43Screening visit: $60 
Infusion visit: $180 
Total = $240
In the event that additional study-related visits need to be scheduled after the infusion visit, as 
detailed in section 12.5 below, each additional visit will be compensated at $60. Travel costs 
may be covered as per the current NIH/NIAMS policy.
12 Assessment of Safety
AEs and other reportable events are defined in NIH Human Research Protections Program 
(HRPP) Policy 801.
12.1 Toxicity Scale
The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE according to the “Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” (v 5.0) which can be found at 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm 
12.2 Causality
Causality (likelihood that the event is caused by [CONTACT_4526]) will be assessed considering the 
factors listed under the following categories:
Definitely Related
reasonable temporal relationship
follows a known response pattern
clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship
there is no alternative etiology
Probably Related
reasonable temporal relationship
follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents)
no evidence of a more likely alternative etiology
Possibly Related
reasonable temporal relationship
little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 31 of 43Unlikely Related
does not have a reasonable temporal relationship
OR
good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology
Not Related
does not have a temporal relationship
OR
definitely due to an alternative etiology
Note: Other factors should also be considered for each causality category when appropriate. 
Causality assessment is based on available information at the time of the assessment of the AE. 
The investigator may revise the causality assessment as additional information becomes 
available.
12.3 Recording/Documentation
At each contact [CONTACT_6635], information regarding AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_132304]. All events, both expected/unexpected and related/unrelated will 
be recorded on a source document. Source documents may include, but not limited to, progress 
notes, laboratory reports, consult notes, and phone call summaries. Source documents will be 
reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_5051]. All reportable AEs that are identified will be 
recorded in CRIMSON. The start date, the stop date, the severity of each reportable event, and 
the principal investigator’s judgment of the AE’s relationship and expectedness to the study 
agent will also be recorded in CRIMSON.
12.4 Expected Events
Some signs or symptoms are induced by [CONTACT_694309], and any combination of these is expected to occur. These events will not be reported 
unless they reach a grade of 3 or higher (as defined in the CTCAE, v 5.0), are deemed a risk to 
the participant’s rights or wellbeing, or are deemed appropriate to report under specific 
circumstances by [CONTACT_458]. Examples include:
Hyperglycemia
Leukocytosis
Neutrophilia
Monocytopenia
Eosinopenia
Flushing

for an AE (eg, the participant is lost to follow-up), then the reason a final outcome could not be 
obtained will be recorded by [CONTACT_79845].
12.6 Halting Rules for the Protocol
Halting the study requires immediate discontinuation of study agent administered for all 
participants and suspension of enrollment until a decision is made whether or not to continue 
enrollment and study agent administration.
The halting rules are:
2 or more participants experience the same or similar SAEs that are possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study agent;
OR
any safety issue that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79809].
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79810]. The data and safety 
monitoring board (DSMB) may also recommend a halt.
12.6.1 Reporting a Study Halt
If a halting rule is met, then a description of the AE(s) or safety issue must be reported by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 1 business day to the IRB. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_694285].

Page 33 of 4312.6.2 Resumption of a Halted Study
The principal investigator, in collaboration with the DSMB, will determine if it is safe to resume 
the study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_694286].
12.7 Study Discontinuation
The IRB, the NIAID, and other oversight bodies as applicable, as part of their duties to ensure 
that research participants are protected, may discontinue the study at any time. Subsequent 
review of serious, unexpected, and related AEs by [CONTACT_694310].
12.8 Premature Withdrawal of a Participant
An individual participant will be withdrawn for any of the following:
An individual participant’s decision. (The investigator should attempt to determine the 
reason for the participant’s decision.)
Non-compliance with study procedures to the extent that it is potentially harmful to the 
participant or to the integrity of the study data.
A participant becomes pregnant between screening and the infusion visit.
A participant experiences a disease flare during tapering of current glucocorticoid therapy 
that requires intervention before the infusion visit.
A participant experiences an anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, or angioedema 
requiring medical therapy during the glucocorticoid infusion.
The investigator determines that continued participation in the study would not be in the 
best interest of the participant.
A participant who has a flare at screening visit and not scheduled for infusion within [ADDRESS_941857] of human protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs 
(small RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) that are differentially expressed in response to 
glucocorticoids in patients with SLE, for each of the studied cell types and doses.
The secondary endpoints of this study are:
1. A comparison of the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids between the [ADDRESS_941858] of transcripts that are different, between patients with SLE and the previously studied 
healthy controls, at baseline or in response to glucocorticoids.
15.2 Bioinformatics Pi[INVESTIGATOR_694287]-RNA sequencing runs (bcl files) will be converted to FASTQ 
format with the software program bcl2fastq. Quality control of the resulting FASTQ files will be 
performed with the software program FastQC. RNA-seq data will be aligned to the most recent 
human genome assembly using the software program STAR.[ADDRESS_941859] recent version of the GENCODE will be used to obtain raw read counts for each transcript, 
with the featureCounts program of the package Subread.45 
15.3 Identification of Glucocorticoid-responsive Genes
To identify glucocorticoid-responsive genes, differential expression analysis for the RNA-seq 
and small-RNA-seq data will be performed in R, with the package DESeq2.46
For each cell type, we will assess the level of variation in the baseline measurements by 
[CONTACT_694311] 0-hour (pre-infusion) 
values on the day of the glucocorticoid infusion. For participants who undergo a glucocorticoid 
taper, this analysis will contrast the pre- and post-taper patterns of gene expression. We will then 
perform differential analysis comparing each of the two post-infusion time points (2 hours and 
4 hours) independently against the baseline. DESeq2 (section 15.6) adopts the method of 
Benjamini-Hochberg to adjust for multiplicity. We will draw conclusions based on the 
Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values, which control for the family-wise false discovery rate 
(FDR) in the presence of multiple comparisons. We will employ a cutoff FDR47 value of < 5% to 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 [ADDRESS_941860] responsive to the glucocorticoid stimulus in each 
cell type. 
A separate analysis will compare data obtained at the same time point (2 hours or 4 hours) 
between the high-dose and low-dose groups, to test whether there are significant differences in 
the transcriptional effect of glucocorticoids at the two doses. Finally, we will identify differences 
and similarities between the baseline transcriptome and the transcriptional response to 
glucocorticoids in patients with SLE recruited in this study and in healthy volunteers recruited in 
our previous study. Since the healthy and the SLE participants come from two different studies, 
they are not directly comparable in many aspects. Therefore, these results will be derived from 
the two studies separately and no formal comparison will be made across the two studies. We 
will present the baseline distribution of gene expression, the distribution of gene expression 
changes, and the subset of differentially expressed genes. For each cell type, we will generate a 
list of protein-coding or non-coding transcripts that are shared and a list of transcripts that are 
different between SLE patients and healthy controls.
Sequencing library preparation and sequencing batches will be carefully designed such that 
samples from the same participant and cell type are run in the same batch and samples from 
different participants are evenly distributed across batches. This will keep batch effects to a 
minimum in the identification of differentially expressed genes. For analyses across different 
participants, such as comparisons among different cell types, linear regression will be adopted 
with batch as a regression variable to adjust for batch difference. While prior experience suggests 
that library preparation is the greatest source of batch-to-batch variation in RNA-seq 
experiments, if the source of batch effects is unclear or cannot be adequately modeled, then the R 
package SVA will be used.
15.[ADDRESS_941861] deviations 
will be reported for all continuous variables; percent will be reported for categorical variables.
15.6 Adaptive Sample Size Determination
Given the high-throughput data generation strategy of next-generation sequencing, the use of 
different starting materials for sequencing (mRNA, small RNA, DNA), and the use of serial 
sampling, standard sample size calculation methods are not appropriate in this case and an 
adaptive study design is a more realistic approach. Sample size consideration will be based 
primarily on the power to identify differentially expressed genes. The primary endpoint of the 
study is a list of human protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs that are differentially 
expressed in response to glucocorticoids in patients with SLE, for each of the studied cell types 
and doses. With a sample size of 20 in each dose group, there would be 90% power to detect a 
change of effect size 0.[ADDRESS_941862] a differentially expressed 
gene with 90% power if the gene expression difference before and after glucocorticoid was no 
less than 0.72 SD.  
Due to the specific properties of RNA-seq data, an advanced mixed-effects negative binomial 
modeling approach will be adopted for evaluating gene expression change and the significance 
of the change. This will be achieved with the R package DESeq2, a widely adopted tool for 
differential expression analysis on sequencing data, which targets the issue of large number of 
genes and small number of samples. In DESeq2, data from all genes are shared and utilized in 
assessing the differential expression of each gene. This leads to more stable estimation of 
differential expression and its variability, and consequently to better power for detecting 
differentially expressed genes.
Based on the data from our previous study of healthy volunteers (protocol 16-I-0126) and a 
bootstrap procedure, with a sample size of [ADDRESS_941863], we propose an adaptive study design 
similar to the one we performed on the study with healthy volunteers. Specifically, we will 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 38 of 43recruit an initial cohort of 20 participants in each dose group. Based on the observed data from 
20 participants, we will then assess the gain in discovery with up to 30 additional participants per 
group. We will perform a bootstrap procedure, sampling with replacement up to 50 units from 
the 20 observed participants in each group to evaluate the improvement in gene detection. For 
example, if the subset of genes that can be detected as differentially expressed over time and the 
subset of genes that can be detected as differentially expressed over the 2 doses do not change 
significantly above a number, then we will stop at that number. If there is change in the gene 
subsets, but the pathways and the biological interpretation of the data remain unchanged, then 
additional participants will be unlikely to change the outcome of the study and no further 
recruitment will be pursued. Due to the adaptive sample size determination, we will again use a 
nominal significance level α < 0.05.
16 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects
16.1 Informed Consent Process
Informed consent is a process where information is presented to enable persons to voluntarily 
decide whether or not to participate in research. It is an ongoing conversation between the human 
research participant and the researchers that begins before consent is given and continues until 
the end of the participant’s involvement in the research. Discussions about the research will 
provide essential information about the study and include: purpose, duration, experimental 
procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask 
questions and have them answered.
The participants will sign the informed consent document prior to undergoing any research 
procedures. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. 
A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The 
researcher will document the signing of the consent form in the participant’s medical record. The 
rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_114813].
We anticipate the enrollment of Spanish-speaking participants in this study. The English 
language consent document will be translated in full into Spanish by [CONTACT_694312]. For 
Spanish-speaking participants, the Spanish language consent form will be presented by [CONTACT_694313], unless the investigator is fluent in Spanish.
Two Step Consenting Process
In certain cases, when prospective participants would like to learn additional details about the 
study before coming to the NIH (e.g., due to geographical distance or other logistical and 
personal reasons), we would like to do a two-step informed consent process. In the first step, we 
will either mail or email the informed consent document to the patient; this will be followed by a 
Glucocorticoid Genomics in SLE
 30 November 2021
Page 39 of 43telephone call or videoconference, to go over the informed consent form document orally. For 
patients who agree to participate at that point, the second step will involve scheduling a 
screening visit at the NIH Clinical Center. As with any other screening visit, a member of the 
study team will then answer any additional questions and obtain the patient’s written signature [CONTACT_694316]. This informed consent process will then be documented in the 
subject’s medical records.
16.[ADDRESS_941864] all documents and records required 
to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records. Records will 
be kept locked and data will be coded. Any personally identifiable information maintained for 
this study will be kept on restricted-access computers and networks. Personally identifiable 
information will only be shared with individuals authorized to receive it under this protocol. 
Individuals not authorized to receive personally identifiable information will be provided with 
coded information only, as needed. Clinical information will not be released without written 
permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1201], NIAID, and the 
Office for Human Research Protections.
16.3 Participation of NIH Employees
NIH employees may participate in this protocol. We will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion 
of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will give each employee a copy of the “NIH 
Information Sheet on Employee Research Participation.”
For NIH employees:
NIH staff may be a vulnerable class of participants.
Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either beneficial or 
adverse, on the participant’s employment or work situation.
The employee participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance 
with NIH CC policies, which define the scope and limitations of the protections.
For NIH employee participants, consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_132291]’s team. Those in a supervisory position to any employee and co-workers of 
the employee will not obtain consent.
The importance of maintaining confidentiality when obtaining potentially sensitive and 
private information from co-workers or subordinates will be reviewed with the study staff 
at least annually and more often if warranted.

A Phase tI Trial oiDoxil , Carboplatin ald Ber,aciauuab in Triple Negative Previotsly Untreated l\,Ietastatic Breast Cancer
One such biologic agent that has de.monstrated significant activity in breast carcer, is the
antiangiogenic agent. bevaciztunab. a htunanized monoclonal antibody directed to vascular
endothelial growth factor. Compoturds targeting angiogeaesis are of particular interest as
extensive laboratory data suggests that angiogenesis plays au essential role in breast caucer
development, invasion aud metastasis.
Hyperplastic mru'ine breast papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603] (2) and histologically nonual lobules adjacant to
cancerous breast tissue (3) supporl angiogenesis in preclinical nodels suggesting that
aogiogenesis plecedes transformation of Dlammary hyperplasia to maliguancy. Transfection of
hrmor cells with angiogenic stirnulatory peptides sucb as fibroblast grorvth factor-l or -4 (4,5) ,
vascular enclothelial growth factor (VEGF) (6.7). or progelatirrase-B (rnahix metalloproteinase-9,
MMP-9) (8). increases trmror growth, invasiveness, microvasculafure and rnetastasis (9).
Converssly, transfecliorr of hnnor cells rvith inhibitons of angiogenesis, including
tluombospondin-l (10) or tissue inhibitor of rnetalloproteinase-4 (TIMP-4) (11) decreases
growth ald uretastasis (12). Clidcopathologic conelarious also confuru the central role of
angiogenesis in breast carcer progression. Fibrocystic lesions rvith the highest vascular density
were associated with a greater risk of breast cancer (13). Two distinct vascular pattems have been
described in association with ductal carcinoma in sinr: a diffirse increase in stromal vascularity
befiveen duct lesions and a dense rin of microvessels adjacent to the basement merubrane of
iudividual ducts (14,15). Microvessel density (N,{VD) was llghest rvith lustopathologically
agpgessive DCIS lesions and rvas associated with increased VEGF expression (16).
Recoguitiou that angiogenesis is esseutial to the growth of solid turuors (17) has led to
identification of angiogenic factors responsible for stirnulating nerv blood vessel formation. Of
the ideutified augiogenic factors, vascular endothelial grolvth factor (\EGF: also knowu as
vascular penneability factor) is the most potent aud specific and is a cmcial regrtlator of both
nonnal and pathologic angiogenesis (18). \EGF expression is regulated by [CONTACT_210959]. The biologic
effects of VEGF arc mediated tluough biuding and stinrulation of nvo receptors on the surface of
endothelial cells. Flt-l (fins-like tyrosiue kinase) and KDR ftinase domain regrou). Though
multiple angiogenic factors are coilrrotlly exprcssed by [CONTACT_210960], the l2l-
arnino acid isofonn of \{EGF predominates (19). Several srudies have found an iuverse
corelation betweeu VEGF expression and overall suryival in both nodepositive and node-
negative patients (?0-22). Eppenberger confinned the negative progrostic value of VEGF
expressiorr for both relapse and survival (23).
hrhibition of VEGF usilg an anti-\rEGF fironocloral antibody blocks the gtowth of a nusrber of
human carcer cell lirres in uude nrice including non-surall cell hurg caucer (Calu-6), colorectal
cancer (LS174T, HM-7, LSLiM6), brcast cancer (MCF-7. MDA-MB-435), prostate cancer (D-
145). head aud neck caocer (IG), aud ovarian cancer (SK-OV-3) (18.24). In addition, the
cornbination of auti-VEGF antibody aud cheurotherapy in nude mice iujected rvith hurran cancer
xeuografts resulted in an incrcased antitumor efTect corupared rvith antibody or cheurotherapy
treatment alone (25). A recombinant htunanized version of a mtuine anti-human VEGF
ruonoclonal antibody, named bevacizrutab Sevacianmab, Genenteclu South San Francisco), has
been created for clinical rue (26).
Version Date: l0/l7i [ADDRESS_252255] deuronstrafed the courbimtiou of cytotoxics with
bevacizurab to be syiergistic (27).
Tlre activity of siugle ageuf bevacizrunab in the metastatic setting set the fi'aurework for the
desigu and implementatiou of a phase Itr trial of weekly pacliraxel versus weekly paclitaxel plu
bevaciztunab as fust line therapy for locally recument or mefastatic breast cancer (E2100). The
results of this shldy demoustrated a sippi[INVESTIGATOR_210945] 5 rnonth pragression free sruvival and
a doubling of the response rate from L4% lo 28% with the addition of bevaciaurrab to paclitaxel.
The impressive tesults of this trial have established bevacizumab and weekly paclitaxel as the
uew standard to which fuhue up fiont ruetatstatic regimens rvill be couipared (28).
BEVACIZUMAB CLINICAL EXPERIENCE
Bevacizttmab has beeu shrdied in a mulfitude of Phase I. tr, aud III clirrical tials in urore tharr
5000 patients and in multiple tumor types. The follorviug discussion sruruuarizes bevacizumab's
safety profile and plesents soure of the efficacy rcsulls pertilent to tius parlicular trial. Please
refer to the bevacizurnab Investigator Brochure for descrrptions of all corupleted Phase I,II, and
Itr hials reported to date.
In a large phase Itr shrdy (A!1F2107g) in patie*ts with metastatic colorectal cancer, the addition
of bevacizuntab, a mouoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor
O/EGF), to irinotecar/S-fluorcuacilileucovorin (IFL) chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and
statistically sigrrificanf increase iri duration of survival, with a hazard ratio of death of 0,67
(median survival 15.6 vs. 20.3 rronths: p < 0.001). Similar iucreases were seen in progression-
free stuvival (6.2 vs. 10.6 uronths: p < 0.001), overall respoilse rate (35o,/o vs. 45%; p < 0.01) and
duration of respouse (7.1 vs. 10.4 ruonths; p < 0.01) for the combiuation ann versus the
cheurotherapy orrly ann (bevacizrunab htvestigator Brochtue, October 2005).

Recent atteution has been devoted to a classification system rvhich employs three conunotly

subtypes make up the hormone receptor exprcssing hunorc aud cany a favorable proguosis.
These ttuuors have gene expression paffems which are siruilar to the lurninal epi[INVESTIGATOR_210947]. HER2
subtypes refers to the group of honlone receptor negative hunors with a speci{ic gene
expression pattem. Although not all fiunors which are HER2 positive by [CONTACT_210962]

category rnost HER2 positive tmnors would fit this criteria (30,32,34). While these tumors

et-fectiveuess of h'asfuzrunab in HER2 positive patieuts can significantly irnpact on the

cornmonly seen in Africat Alterican womeu and are conmtonly seen in wornen who are
BRCAI caniers (30.32,40,4-5.46). While this classification systeur is based on tlre urore
complex and extensive genetic profiling assays, the simplified rnethod of classificatiou based
on the uriversally available and cormronly employed ER, PR and HER2ner clilical assays
make this system appealitg and clinically trseflll. Accordingly, cli:ricians are utilizing the
corubination of ER, PR and HEPCne:r- to classifo patients into these subtypes and are
increasingly utilizing "Triple Negative" (ER-. PR-, }IER2-) il clinical decision uraking and
protocol design. Receut data using more exteusive inununhistochemical staiuing and gene
profiling sfudies have demonstlated that these "basal-like" cancers are nlole commonly
positive for HERI expression, basal cytokeratins and c-Kit (29,36.40). These hunors also are
charactedzed by [CONTACT_210963]1 caniers (45).
Therc are prcelincial and cliaical evidence demonsfi'ating that loss of BRCAI f,urction
predicts response to select chemotherapy agelts (47). fudeed. a retrospective review of the
literahre exarnining the futteraction of BRCAI and rcsponse to chemotherapy suggests that

STUDY TITLE:  Use of Arginine Vasopressin in Early Postoperative Management after Fontan 
Palliation  
 
 
A. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
 
The treatments  for preventing and managing low cardiac output syndrome after congenital heart 
surgery with cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_851391] s of 
phosphodiesterase inhibitors  (milrinone) and catecholamines (epi[INVESTIGATOR_147686])  for 
inotropic and vasoactive effects , all of which have associated risks which can contribute to morbidity  
and mortality .  Vasopressin, a vasoactive drug with efficacy in septic shock , has also been utilized to 
improve postoperative hemodynamics after cardiac surgery in chi ldren.   It is a common institutional 
practice to use vasopressin in this patient population , but usually after escalation through two or three 
other vasoactive drugs . There have  been  several studies  in pediatrics and adults which suggest that  
vasopressin is not inferior to  other  vasoconstrictor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and advantageous  when looking at 
specific end points . 1-[ADDRESS_1183867]-operative medication strategy.  The proposed study is a double blinded, randomized , 
placebo control study of vasopressin infusion immediately after the completion Fontan operation. The 
goal is to identify a vasoactive treatment strategy  that improves hemodynamics with lower  
catecholamine infusion burden, reduces volume of fluid resuscitation, and reduces in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851367]  
 
B. HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Specific Aim 1 :  
To assess the hemodynamic profile of patients undergoing Fontan palliation as characterized by 
[CONTACT_851392]  (VIS) , fluid balance, organ perfusion pressure, transpulmonary pressure 
gradient  (CVP  minus LAP) , arterio -cerebral  and arterio -somatic saturation differen ce between the two 
groups ( Vasopressin [ VP] and non-vasopressin [ non-VP] groups ) during the first [ADDRESS_1183868] Update 5.10.18   
 
Rationale:   
The vasoactive inotropic score has been shown to be a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality by 
[CONTACT_851393]. 6,[ADDRESS_1183869] 
tube output, less positive fluid balance in the early postoperative period and a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851368]. 12  
 
Specific Aim -2:  
To assess the difference in incidence  of oliguria, hyponatremia,  and organ dysfunction between the 
two groups (VP and non -VP).   
 
Hypothesi s 
Low dose VP will not negatively effect sodium levels, urine output, renal function or transaminases.   
 
Rational e 
Vasopressin is a neurohypopphyseal hormone naturally occurring in the body (endogenous).  It is 
synthesized in the hypothalamus and released in posterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_851369]/increased systemic vascular resistance for 
improved regulation of blood pressure or increases in plasma osmolarity to retain water in the body. 
When higher -dose exogenous vasopressin is administered for vasoconstriction, it can also cause  
hyponatremia, oliguria, and  transaminitis  from decreased renal and mesenteric blood flow 13,14. This 
is of particular interest in  patients after completion Fontan due to predictable increases in intra -
abdominal venous pressures that further potentiate risk to the kidneys and liver.  
 
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1183870] tube drainage 
and duration, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS) between the two groups (VP and non -VP).  
 
 
Vasopressin Study  Protocol  
Last Update 5.10.[ADDRESS_1183871] step between the ages 2 -6 years.  Although operative 
mortality is less than 5 %, 15-[ADDRESS_1183872] significant physiologic vulnerability, with  longer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851370], resulting in  significant resource utilization for institutions 
and patients/families.  After the Fontan procedure, cardiac output is more vulnerable to changes in 
venous preload and pulmonary vascular r esistance because there is no high -compliance cardiac 
pump (functional right atrium and ventricle) in the pulmonary circulation Because the single 
(functionally left) ventricle does all work of both systemic and pulmonary circulations, systemic blood 
flow is more vulnerable to changes in systemic venous pressure pulmonary vascular resistance.   The 
most readily reversible cause of low cardiac output syndrome after the Fontan operation is 
hypovolemia.  Aggressive fluid resuscitation in the post -operative peri od can have adverse 
consequences, in particular in the setting of ongoing capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], and third spacing of fluid.  This 
characteristic is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_851371] -CPB period and in particular the postoperative 
Fontan patients who have a n increase in their venous pressure.  The adverse effects of fluid 
resuscitation to maintain cardiac output can include worsening lung function, edema and positive fluid 
balance.  These effects can result in prolonged ventilator support, development of ple ural effusions, 
requirement for aggressive diuresis and longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These potential deleterious effects are 
more pronounced in patients with Fontan anatomy, because higher venous pressure can worsen 
pulmonary vascular resistance and initiate a spi[INVESTIGATOR_851372]. Thus strategies that maintain cardiac output with less fluid administration would be helpful.  
 
The mechanisms related to the development of pleural effusions in the post -Fontan patients have 
been we ll described and include an inflammatory response to CPB, generalized capi[INVESTIGATOR_851373] , and the activation of the renin -angiotensin pathway resulting in reabsorption of 
water and other electrolytes.  Pleural effusions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_851374], 
intravascular volume, protein, clotting factors and anticipating resolution with diuretic therapy or 
requiring more definitive treatment with chest tube placement, or even sometimes a dditional 
procedures including pleurodesis or thoracic duct ligation.  
 
Vasopressin is a neurohypopysial hormone that most notably increases systemic vascular resistance 
without directly affecting cardiac contractility.  In addition to vasopressin’s ability to increase mean 
arterial pressures by [CONTACT_851394], vasopressin has also been 
described to decrease capi[INVESTIGATOR_851375].  Vasopressin has also been described as a cor onary and pulmonary 
vasodilator  by [CONTACT_851395]. 18,[ADDRESS_1183873] 
tube output and overall resource utilization.  
 
Specific Aim -4 
To measure vasopressin levels pre -cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) and immediately post -CPB (prior 
to initiating study drug ) 
 
Hypothesis  
Patients receiving the place bo will have lower vasopressin levels, which will be associated with higher 
post-operative catecholamine support and higher volume of fluid resuscitation during the first post -
operative day.  
 
Rationale   
Vasopressin is an alternative vasoactive therapy that improves postoperative hemodynamics and 
decreases dependence on traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851376]. Landry and colleagues first reported a beneficial 
use of AVP in critically ill adult patients with septic shock in whom maximal inotropic and vasopressor 
therapy failed to maintain blood pressure.  These patients also demonstrated a deficiency of 
vasopressin that was probably secondary to a defect in baroreflex -medi ated release of the hormone.

Fontan population.  
 
C. BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE, AND RATIONALE  
 
Neonatal and pediatric interventions associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) continue to 
produce improved outcomes.  There are no established guidelines for managing patients after 
congenital heart surgery due to lesion -specific unique challenges in the post -operative period.  
Volume resuscitation and catecholamine infusions are the traditional treatment methods to maintain 
adequate perfusion.  However, these two treatment modalities are associated with increased risk of 
worsening lung function and prolonged ventilator support with aggressive fluid resuscitation, 
increased myocardial oxygen demand, and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_851377].  G iven the multifactorial 
etiology of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, it is often unclear which catecholamine 
infusion is optimal to improve circulatory function. Vasopressin, an alternative vasoactive therapy 
commonly utilized in shock, has been utilized to improve postoperative hemodynamics in neonatal 
and pediatric patient populations and has recently gained more attention.

reported in 1999 in a cas e series of 11 patients with vasodilatory shock in the postoperative period. 4 
This case series reported initiation of vasopressin for hypotension refractory to traditional treatment 
methods and reported a signifi cant rise in hemodynamics with improved blood pressure in all patients 
as well as weaning inotropic support in 10/[ADDRESS_1183877] deficient levels of vasopressin

incidence of arrhythmias, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and shorter intensive care unit 
stay when compared to lesion -matched control  group. More recently in 2016, a single center 
retrospectively reviewed their experience with vasopressin and patients undergoing Fontan 
operations over a 10 year period and it’s effects on chest tube output.  They determined that patients 
receiving vasopr essin perioperatively had less chest tube output and shorter duration of chest tube 
drainage in addition to shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851378]. [ADDRESS_1183879] of

groups.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vasopressin Study  Protocol  
Last Update 5.10.18  D. DESIGN AND METHODS  
This is a double -blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled, study of vasopressin use in patients 
following Fontan palliation.  All patients undergoing Fontan palliation at CHW will be screened for 
eligibility into this study using the following inclusion and  exclusion  criteria:  
Inclusion  
1. Planned completion of Fontan palliation  
2. English or Spanish speaking.  
3. Completed Informed consent  
 
Exclusion   
1. Previous attempt at completion Fontan with subsequent takedown  
2. Planned concomitant atrioventricular valvuloplasty o r neoaortic valve or arch 
reconstruction at time of completion Fontan.  
3. History of renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy  
4. Absence of informed consent  
5. Concurrent  enrollment  in other interventional studies  
 
Patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be approached for consent prior to 
surgery, most often during their pre -operative visit to the cardiology clinic.  Consent procedures will be 
explained in more detail in Section N.  
 
Randomization  
Patients whose famil ies give permission for them to participate will be identified by [CONTACT_851396]. At this time,  an order will be placed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_851379]/placebo , which  will trigger initiation of the  randomization procedure by [CONTACT_851397] . After randomization, study drug or placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_851398]’s study group assignment .   
 
Blinding  
Blinding of the study drug/placebo will be done in the pharma cy. The prepared placebo will look no 
different than prepared study drug.  The infusion pump will note the drug as “Fontan Vasopressin 
Study” as reference. The study team will remain blinded throughout enrollment, data collection, and 
data analysis for all  study subjects.  Data will be unblinded for the purpose of safety reviews and 
available only to the members of the DSMB.  
 
E. TOTAL NUMBER OF HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS PROPOSED FOR THIS STUDY 
AT THIS SITE AND GLOBALLY.  WHAT ARE THESE  
 NUMBERS BASED ON?  
 
Based on 2015 census, we anticipate about 2 5 patients per year will meet our inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. From previous studies at CHW 80 -90% of families for patients with congenital heart disease 
will agree to participate in studies involving blood draws  and drug trials. We anticipate being able to 
enroll [ADDRESS_1183880]’s operative plan and anesthetic management will proceed per 
current institutional practices. The investigational pharmacist will deliver study drug/placebo to the OR  
during the course of the subject’s surgery. Following the modified ultrafiltra tion period (MUF) the 
anesthesiologist will start the study drug/placebo infusion. The subject will receive low dose 
vasopressin or  placebo  started at 0.3mU/kg/min and will not be titrated.  Total infused volume will be 
calculated using the subject’s pre -surgical dosing weight.  
 
After study drug initiation the attending provider  will treat the patient per standard of care . If the 
subject require s vasoconstrictor therapy, open label vasopressin or any other appropriate 
medications will be added  at the discr etion of the attending physician.  
 
The study drug/placebo infusion will be maintained at this rate for 20 hours when it will be weaned off 
at 0.1 mU/kg/min every hour over [ADDRESS_1183881]’s care team will monitor and titrate the study 
drug/placebo wea n so it is tolerated clinically by [CONTACT_423].  
 
Throughout the active study period, p ostoperative care will be provide d per usual practice with goal -
directed interventions with vasoactive medications and fluid based on standard monitoring including 
invas ive pressure (venous and arterial) monitoring and use of two -site near infrared spectroscopy.  
 
Vasopressin is used in our standard practice;  we are proposing that we randomize the vasoactive 
medication to an earlier point in our standard protocol.  The study does not constrain use of other 
intraoperative or postoperative pharmacology such as milri none, epi[INVESTIGATOR_851380].   
 
Study Sample Collection  
During the course of the study, non -SOC arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels will be drawn on all 
subjects consented for this study at [ADDRESS_1183882]’s medical record in order to maintain the blind.  Cystatin levels will be 
included in the subject’s EMR . 
 
All samples will be preferentially collected from an indwelling venous or arterial line. This will be done 
as close as possible to the target time. In a minority of cases, if no catheter is available the sample 
will be collected at the same time as an alr eady scheduled clinical blood draw. This should be done 
as close as possible to the target time.  Of note, the sample collection times in the CICU correspond 
with the timing of standard of care labs being collected in post -operative Fontan patients.  We 
anticipate being able to draw the majority of study labs simultaneously with standard of care to reduce 
the number of times a subject’s line is accessed. The following time points will be used for AVP 
sample collection:

H. RISKS AND THE PRECAUTIONS, WHICH  WILL BE TAKEN TO MINIMIZE RISK 
EXPOSURE  
 
Study Drug Administration  
The standard risks and side effects of exogenous vasopressin infusion are minimal and rarely occur 
at the lower -dose infusion at which we will be running.  However known side effects, which can be 
seen include : hyponatremia , decreased urine output , nausea,  tremors, vertigo, diaphoresis, and 
thrombocytopenia.  Other side effects that are rare, but more serious include anaphylaxis, clinical 
evidence of regional ischemia . The standard treatment for the less serious s ide effects would be 
symptomatic. The standa rd treatments for addressing the more serious side effects would be to titrate 
down or discontinuing infusion.  
Sample Collection  
Procedures for venipuncture and obtaining blood samples from indwelling catheters are routine in 
pediatric intensive care unit s and all care will be taken to ensure protecting the child from the potential 
risks. Ideally, samples will be collected through an indwelling catheter, or concurrently with a clinically 
ordered blood draw to minimize the number of needle sticks per patien t. As with all blood draws, 
there is a chance the patient may experience slight  pain, bleeding or bruising at the venipuncture 
sight.  There is also a slight chance of fainting or infection as a result of the venipuncture, but no 
greater risk than with a r outine blood draw.  
 
Data Collection  
Data will be extracted from the subject’s medical record  by [CONTACT_851399]. Files will be  maintained on paper and electronically for the study.  
Any paper records maintained will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the critical care research office. 
A list linking the patient’s identity , along with other collected PHI,  to an assigned study subject 
number will be maintained separately from the clinical data that is extracted from the medical records.

J. PROVISIONS FOR MONITORING DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS; AND 
ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF SUBJECTS 
WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE VULNER ABLE  
 
During the active phase of this stud y, research team members will  monitor subjects in real time for 
potential serious adverse events (SAEs) related and unrelated to study drug/placebo administration. 
We will monitor subjects for known risks during ac tive study drug administration (risks listed in section 
H). The study team will work closely with the care team for this subject to ensure accurate collection

K. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL  TO HUMAN RESEARCH 
PARTICIPANTS AND SOCIETY  
 
The benefits of this study are unknown. The research team believes that initiating low dose 
vasopressin in the immediate post -operative period will reduce  the need for  inotropic support which 
could minimize fluid resuscitation and  arrhythmias in the post -operative period.  There is a chance 
this may d ecrease chest tube output meaning decreased duration of CT placement and likely 
decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851382] , however, all of thi s is 
only speculative.  This study will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the postoperative period 
for these patients and improved treatment protocols in the future.  
 
L. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_851383] (listed below) of vasopressin, if present, will act as potential s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_851384].  However, if these side effects are noted in the subject it is at the discretion of the 
CICU attending to determine if the study inf usion will be stopped or other catecholamine infusions will 
be stopped in an effort to reverse the noted side effects. If the CICU attending determines it is 
necessary to stop the study drug/placebo infusion earlier than the protocol dictates, data and blo od 
sampling collection will continue per protocol.

completed.  
 
In the event that the DMC  find a serious adverse event  deemed related to study -drug administration , 
enrollment will be temporarily halted until further review of this event is completed. In this  study 
serious adverse events are considered anaphylaxis, hyponatremia < 120mEq/dL, evidence of 
regional ischemia  or any other unanticipated event listed in the CTCAE (version 4) of grade 4 or 
higher that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_851386].  After the D MC has

2. Continue enrollment as is  
3. Continue enrollment with protocol modifications  
4. Discontinue enrollment due to futility.  
 
N. DESCRIBE HOW THE CONSENT AND ASSENT PR OCESS WILL TAKE PLACE.  INCLUDE 
A LIST OF APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO WILL BE INVOLVED  
Once patients are identified, guardians will be approached by [CONTACT_851403]. Information about the study and any associated risks and benefits will be 
presented to the parent(s)/guardian by a study investigator during the preoperative evaluation about 
one week prior to surgery. Families will be able to consent at this time, or take documentation home 
for further review.  If the family does not consent during the pre -operative visit the study team will 
meet with the family prior to the start of the subject’ s procedure to determine their willingness to 
participate.  
 
The Principal investigator, all of the listed sub -investigators, and the research coordinators listed as 
part of the study team will be able to obtain consent for the study. To ensure a robust co nsent 
conversation one coordinator and one of the PI/Sub -I members will be present for each consent 
conversation.  In the case that the subject is admitted to the CICU at the time of consent, study team 
members who are part of the subject’s CICU care team will not participate in the consent 
conversation.  We do not anticipate obtaining assent for this study as the Fontan procedure is not

cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_851404].  
 
Data will be compared using a t -test for continuous normally distributed data. For skewed data, such 
as LOS, data will be compared using a Mann Whitney U.  Categorical data will be analyzed using a 
Chi-square test. If the expected value of any cell is less than five th en a Fishers Exact test will be 
used.  Dichotomous outcome variables will be analyzed using logistic regression and potential 
confounders will be controlled for.  All tests will be conducted as two -tailed tests with a significance 
level of 0.05.  
  
P. FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS  
There is no cost to the patient, their guardians, or their insurance company for participation in this 
study. Investigators have no financial relationships to disclose . Some funding from this study has 
been obtained from CHW to be used to offset the cost of lab testing.  
 
Q. ADVERTISEMENTS / FLIERS  
No advertisements or fliers will be used for recruitment in this study.

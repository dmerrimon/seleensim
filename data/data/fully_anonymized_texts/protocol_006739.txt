The following changes are reflected in Protocol Amendment No. 1:
Extend the study  duration from 24 months to 5 y ears to identif y any potential 
neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders through annual assessments at 
years 3, 4, and 5, specifically  autism and attention deficit hy peractivity  disorder.
Add an assessment using a modified version of the CHI questionnaire at 3, 4, 
and 5 years of the child’s chronological age to collect data to identify  any 
potential neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders.
Add an additional assessment of the M -CHAT-R/F at 18 months (corrected age) 
per American Academ y of Pediatrics guidelines
Reviseto indicate that the M -CHAT-R/F (assessed at 18 and 24 months) and the 
CBCL/1.5-5 (assessed at 24 months) are mandatory for all infants, regardless of 
ASQ-3 results, per American Academ y of Pediatrics guidelines
Remove as a neurodevelopment endpoint the p roportion of infants referred for 
an additional behavior assessment using the M -CHAT-R/F and CBCL /1.5-5
Clarify that any infant serious adverse events ( SAEs)and/or AEs of special 
interest that were unresolved at the end of the Phase III treatment studies and 
any new SAEs reported during this study  should be followed to stabilization or 
resolution in those children participating in the follow- up study.
Revise the subgroups that may  be included in the safety analyses to reflect study  
design of Phase III SPTL Study 200719 (NEWBORN -1)
Clarify unblinding text to indicate that there is no requirement for the 
investigator to discuss unblinding with the [COMPANY_003] medical monitor in order to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_494519] a child’s treatment assignment, if needed
Incorporate other admin istrative changes
2014N194466_02 2018-NOV-01 Amendment No. 2
The following changes are reflected in Protocol Amendment No. 2 :
Reduction of study  duration from 5 y ears to 24 months due to :
‒Termination of the retosiban development program, such that there will be no 
further in utero exposure to retosiban, and hence safet y data from this ongoing 
study will not inform the potential risk for future use of retosiban. 
‒Lowrecruitment for interventional studies 200719 (NEWBORN -1) and  2019N413355_00

200721 (ZINN) . Hence,the number of infants exposed to retosiban in utero 
and included in the current (200722) study is small.
‒The independent d ata monitoring c ommittee (IDMC)recommendation that the 
neonatal follow -up be limited to 2 4monthsof age given no safety issues
detected in their unblinded review of available 200722 data and also that 
statistical analy sis at a 5-year timepoint would not provide an y meaningful 
resultsdue to the small number of enrolled subjects.
Reclassification of all resource utilization endpoints as exploratory  endpoints 
due to the reduced sample size
Correction of an error in the mean BSID -III score for the cognitive impairment, 
fine motor and gross motor scales to <[ADDRESS_655106] that these are not composite 
scores
Incorporation of other administrative cha nges 2019N413355_00

12DEFINITIONS
Child Aged from 2 years to up to 12 y ears, per definition of the 
US Food and Drug Administration
Chronological age Defined as the time elapsed after birth; it is usually  
described in day s, weeks, months, and y ears
Corrected age Calculated b y subtracting the number of weeks an infant is 
born before 400/7weeks’ gestation from the chronological 
age. This term is used to describe children up to [ADDRESS_655117], 
signifying the end of Phase III spontaneous preterm labor
(SPTL) treatment studies, is the estimated date of delivery  
(EDD) plus 28 day s; this is referred to as [ADDRESS_655118] EDD
Estimated date of delivery Defined as 400/7 weeks’ gestation for all subjects in the 
PhaseIII SPTL treatment studies
Gestational age Determined b y (1) known fertilization dat e, either invitro 
fertilization or intrauterine insemination, (2) last menstrual 
period confirmed b y the earliest ultrasound prior to 
240/7weeks’ gestation, or (3) the earliest ultrasound alone 
prior to 240/7weeks’ gestation, whichever is the most 
accurate method available for each subject in the Phase III 
SPTL treatment studies
Infant Aged from [ADDRESS_655119], render these newborns susceptible to injury  and 
abnormal development and function, which often leads to long- term health problems and 
disability. The risk for medical disability  is inversely related to the gestational age at 
birth; the most common disabilities include cerebral pals y, cognitive d ysfunction, 
blindness and impaired vision, hearing loss, and disorders of ps ychological development 
(i.e., behavior and emotion).
Over the past decade s, few medical interventions have been designed to prevent preterm 
birth and/or reduce the severity  of prematurity  complications. Such treatments may  also 
improve long-term outcomes. One of the major advances in perinatal medicine has been 
the finding that antenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of imminent preterm 
birth reduces the risks for neonatal mortality  and morbidity . Corticosteroids now 
represent the standard of care for an acute antenatal intervention to improve neonatal 
outcomes in the developed world [RCOG, 2011; ACOG , 2012].
However, there is an increasing awareness that the intended beneficial effects of perinatal 
interventions do not necessarily  correlate with long -term outcomes. Dexamethasone in 
high daily doses appears to reduce mortality and the incidence of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia but treatment is associated with numerous short- and long-term adverse 
outcomes, including neurodevelopmenta l impairment. As a result, treatment with high 
dose dexamethasone is not recommended [ Watterberg , 2010]. The ORACLE II Stud y is 
an example of a perinatal treatment that was associated with adverse long -term outcom es 
and no neonatal benefit. ORACL EII studied the effect of antibiotics to improve neonatal 
outcomes in women with spontaneous preterm labor (SPTL ) with intact membranes and 
no evidence of clinical infection. No reduction in neonatal complications was obse rved. 
However, the long -term follow -up revealed an increase in functional impairment and a 
higher risk for cerebral palsy  in children whose mothers had received antibiotics 
[Kenyon, 2001; Ken yon, 2008]. These observations have led to an appreciation that 
perinatal interventions may  affect growth and development and have highlighted the 
importance of long- term safet y and outcome studies after randomized, controlled studies 
of perinatal interventions. 
The goal of this study (ARIOS), therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban ([COMPANY_004]221149) or comparator in utero in the 
PhaseIII SPTL treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not associated 
with significant adverse outcomes in earl y childhood.
InMay 2017, the corresponding treatment trials 200719 ( NEWBORN -1, placebo 
comparison) and 200721 ( ZINN, atosiban comparison) were terminated early due to poor 
recruitment a nd the length of time needed to complete the studies. The placebo -controlled 
trial enrolled only 23 of the target 900 participants over 17 months, and the atosiban 
comparator trial enrolled 97 of the target 330 participants over 29 months. Maternal,  2019N413355_00

14fetal,and neonatal adverse events were no more common with retosiban than placebo or 
atosiban. The development program was subsequently  terminated with no further in utero 
exposure of retosiban planned.
Objectives
The study  objective is to assess the safety  andoutcomes in infants and children who were 
exposed to retosiban or comparator in the Phase III SPTL treatment studies.
Specific objectives include the following:
Primary
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of infant and child morbidity  and 
mortality in infants and children exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of neurodevelopment in infants and 
children exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
Exploratory
To characterize parental productivity  loss related to a sick child and infant resource 
utilization in terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], length of stay , emergency  room/urgent 
care (ER/UC) visits, surgical procedures, and referral to specialt y care or therap y 
visits for infants (up to age 2 years)exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
Study Design
ARIOS is a long -term infant and child follow-up study that will prospectively  assess 
safety and outcomes of all infants and children born to women who received at least 
1dose of retosiban or comparator in any of the Phase III SPTL treatment studies. The 
final assessment of the Phase III SPTL treatment studies is a collection of neonatal 
morbidity  data and will occur at 28 days after the estimated date of delivery  (EDD), 
where EDD is defined as 400/7weeks’ gestation. After this time, infants become eligible 
for this follow- up study. Ideally, the Phase III SPTL study investigators will obtain 
consent and medical release for this stud y when the women’s acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_507754]. The infant will be able to be consented into the study  until the later date of either 
the date of discharge from the birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507737] [ADDRESS_655120] reached 
24monthschronological age. This study does not require medical interventions or study 
visits to an investigational site. I nstead, parents or legal guardians will be prompted at 
certain time points to complete developmental questionnaires and other data regarding 
their child’s health status via an electronic device. Data collected during this follow-up 
study will be managed by  a centralized research coordinating center (RCC). Regionall y
based pediatricians will serve as the study  principal investigators (referred to as RCC -PIs) 
for the follow -up study. All communications the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507755]/legal 
guardian or the child’s health care provider (HCP) will occur remotel y; there wil l be no 
clinic visits. 2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
200722
15The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete a Child Health I nventory 
(CHI) at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age . The CHI 
questionnaire completed upto the 24-month time point willscreen for infant mortality  
and morbidity  and will capture data on resource utilization. I f the parent/legal guardian 
indicates that the child has been newl y diagnosed (after [ADDRESS_655121] EDD) with chronic 
conditions or congenital anomalies, follow- up by [CONTACT_404432]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507756]. Persistence or resolution of conditions will 
be determined in subsequent questionnaires after the initial report. 
If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has had a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507757], the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507758], including a death certificate, if applicable. If the 
parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has had an ER/UC visit, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507759] a true 
emergency . Additional details regarding ER/UC visits will be provided in the S tudy 
Procedures Manual. After review of all records, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507760] -up data from the relevant HCP or medical facility  if clarification is 
needed on an y reported study  endpoints or serious adverse events.
During the 24 months of participation in the study, if the parent/l egal guardian indicates 
that the infant has been treated b y specialists or has had ER/UC visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
he/she will be asked to complete a productivity  questionnaire to evaluate loss of parental 
productivity .
When a congenital anomaly  is reported, it will be reviewed b y an expert in teratology  
who is engaged by [CONTACT_404432] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507761] . The 
birth defect evaluator’s responsibilities will include the review, evaluation, and 
classification of all reports of birth defects.
To screen for a delay  in the areas of communication, gross motor, fine motor, 
problem-solving, and personal- social skills, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to 
complete the 9 -, 18-, and 24-month Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3 (ASQ-3) when the 
infant’s corrected age corresponds to 9, 18, and 24 months ;for example, parents/legal 
guardians of an infant born 3 months premature will complete the 9 -month ASQ -3 at 
12months chronological age. An y child with a score in the black zone ( 2SD below the 
mean) in an y of the 5 domains of the ASQ -3 will be referred to a qualified assessor for a 
developmental evaluation (e.g., using the Bay ley Scale for Infant Development, third 
edition [BSI D-III]), unless the child is alread y under the care of a spe cialist who has 
recently conducted a BSID -III evaluation. Based on results from the ASQ -[ADDRESS_655122] for Autism in Toddlers –Revised with Follow -Up 
(M-CHAT-R/F) will be completed for all infants at 18 and 24 months (corrected age) and 
the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL /1.5–5) will be comple ted for all 
infants at 24 months ( corrected age)to assess the risk for other behavioral problems or 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If at any of these time points a child has an 
M-CHAT-R/Fscore that indicates further evaluation is required and/or a CBCL/1.5–[ADDRESS_655123] for a formal assessment.

Parental productivit y loss related to infa nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], ER/UC visits, or

subsequent health and survival . Infants born too early  and too small have a much greater 
risk of death and both short -and long-term disability  than those born at term [ Saigal, 
2008]. Early  morbidity  due to prematurit y includes respi[INVESTIGATOR_129383] s syndrome, 
intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sepsis. Late consequences of 
prematurit y include chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy , sensory impairment, and 
cognitive deficits. An estimated 14.9 million babies were born prematurel y in 2010, 
representing 11% of all live births worldwide [ Blencowe , 2012]. Preterm birth rates 
ranged from approximately  5% in several European countries to 18% in some African 
countries. In 201 3, nearly 450 000 pre term births, defined as childbirth occurring before 
37 completed weeks’ gestation, occurred in the [LOCATION_002] [ Martin, 2015]. These 
preterm infants had an infant mortality  rate approximately  15times the rate for full -term 
infants; the highest infant mortality  rate occurs in infants born prior to 32 weeks’ 
gestation [ Matthews, 2010]. Although the risk for complications decreases with 
increasing gestational age, infants born just a few weeks b efore term carry  an increased 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_507767], resulting in excessive mortalit y and morbidity  
rates during the birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as compared with the rates in full -term infants 
[Engle, 2007].  
Prematurity  directly influences the level of medical care, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 
associated costs; prematurity  sequelae extend the need for continued medical care into 
childhood. Estimates for [ADDRESS_655132] in the Uni ted States at a 
minimum of 26.2 billion dollars or 51 600 dollars per infant born preterm; roughl y 
two-thirds of this cost was for medical care [ Behrman, 2007]. 
Oxytocin plays a key role in term and preterm labor. I t is a potent uterotonic whose role 
in the initiation and progression of human labor, both term and preterm, has been activel y 
investigated for man y years. Although preterm labor may  well be a s yndrome with 
various etiologies, ox ytocin action on the uterus , in all likelihood, represents a common 
step in activation of the my ometrium. Paracrine rather than endocrine mechanisms are 
thought to mediate this process, in which the effects of ox ytocin are governed by  
[CONTACT_59627]-specific ox ytocin receptor expression, wh ich leads to direct contractile effects in 
myometrium and prostaglandin formation in the decidua. Prostaglandins in turn mediate 
myometrial contractions and cervical ripening [ Fuchs, 1982; Benedetto , 1990].
Retosiban ([COMPANY_004]221149) is a potent, competitive, and highl y selective ox ytocin receptor 
antagonist. Retosiban inhibits spontaneous and oxytocin -induced contractions in human 
myometrial tissue. Retosiban wasbeing developed for the treatment of spontaneous 
preterm labor (SPTL ) in women with intact membranes.
Phase III SPTL treatment studies wereconducted to demonstrate the ability  of retosiban 
to prolong pregnancy  and improve neonatal health, as well as to describe the maternal , 
fetal, and neonatal safet y profiles. The treatment studies were terminated due to limited  2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_655133] ered to 219 healthy subjects. A review of the safet y data in 
these health y subjects showed no effects on vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, or 
laboratory  values that were attributable to study  drug.
No clinically  significant adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs (SAEs) have been reported 
in the completed Phase I studies of healthy  volunteers.
Study OTA105256 was the first Phase II clinical study  of retosiban in preterm labor 
(n=93)[Thornton, 2015; GlaxoSmithKl ine Document Number CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/06] . The 
study was designed to investigate the safety  and dose response of retosiban given 
intravenously  to women with intact membranes in preterm labor between 300/7 and 356/7 
weeks of gestation. Final results showed that intravenous retosiban treatment was 
associated with a significant difference in day s to delivery  and significant reduction in 
preterm births. The mean difference in day s to delivery  was 8.2days relative to placebo 
(95%credible i nterval: 2.7, 13.74). Median prolongation of pregnancy  was 35days in 
women treated with retosiban, compared with 25 day s in women assigned to the placebo 
group. The treatment difference was consistent across gestational ages. The proportion of 
preterm bir ths was 18.7% in the retosiban group and 47.2% in the placebo group. The 
relative risk for preterm birth in the retosiban group was 0.38 (95% credible interval : 
0.15, 0.81).
The Phase 3 program included 2global blinded, randomized, controlled trials (2007 21 
[ZINN] and 200719 [NEWBORN -1]) and a single infant follow -up trial (200722 
[ARIOS]). Eligible subjects were aged [ADDRESS_655134] membranes in spontaneous preterm labor at 240/7to 336/7weeks’ 
gestation. ZINN (N=330) aimed to show superiority  of retosiban (IV) over atosiban on 
time to delivery  (first subject first visit [ FSFV]wasMarch2015). NEWBORN -1 
(N=900) was designed to demonstrate neonatal benefit (based on a composite endpoint) 
as well as time to delivery  or time to treatment failure over placebo (FSFV 
February2016). The intervention trials were terminated early  on 11May2017 because of 
slow recruitment and the retosiban project was discontinued permanently . Last subject 
last visit ( LSLV)was 24July2017 for NEWBOR N-[ADDRESS_655135] 2017 for ZINN. 
Meaningful anal yses of these well -controlled trials could not be performed due to small 
numbers of completing participants. Mean time to delivery  or treatment failure in the 
placebo-controlled trial w as 18.9 day s with retosiban (n=10) versus 11.1 day s with 
placebo (n=13). Two neonates in the retosiban and 4 in the placebo group had 
≥1component of the neonatal composite endpoint. The adjusted mean time to delivery in 
the atosiban comparator trial was 32.51 day s with retosiban (n=50) compared with 
33.71days with atosiban (n=47; P>0.05). Maternal, fetal, and neonatal AEs were no 
more common with retosiban than placebo or atosiban.

1.2. Rationale
Advances in perinatal intensive care have resulted in increased survival rates for high risk 
newborns but limited improvement in morbidity . The immaturity  of organs, such as the 
brain, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, render these newborns susceptible to injury  and 
abnormal development and function, which often leads to long -term health problems and 
disability. The risk for medical disability  is inversely  related to the gestational age at 
birth; the most common disabilities include cerebral pals y, cognitive d ysfunction, 
blindness and im paired vision, hearing loss, and disorders of ps ychological development 
(i.e., behavior and emotion).
Over the past decades, few medical interventions have been designed to prevent preterm 
birth and/or reduce the severity  of prematurity  complications. Such treatments may  also 
improve long-term outcomes. One of the major advances in perinatal medicine has been 
the finding that antenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of imminent preterm 
birth reduces the risks for neonatal mortality  and morbidity . Corticosteroids now 
represent the standard of care for an acute antenatal intervention to improve neonatal 
outcomes in the developed world [ACOG, 2012; RCOG , 2011].
However, there is an increasing awareness that the intended beneficial effects of perinatal 
interventions do not necessarily  correlate with long -term outcomes. Dexamethasone in 
high daily doses appears to reduce mortality and the incidence of bronchopulmon ary 
dysplasia but treatment is associated with numerous short- and long-term adverse 
outcomes, including neurodevelopmental impairment. As a result, treatment with 
high-dose dexamethasone is not recommended [ Watterberg , 2010]. The ORACL E II 
Study is an example of a perinatal treatment that was associated with adverse long -term 
outcomes and no neonatal benefit. ORACL E II studied the effect of antibiotics to 
improve neonatal outcomes in women with SPTL  with intact me mbranes and no evidence 
of clinical infection. No reduction in neonatal complications was observed. However, the 
long-term follow -up revealed an increase in functional impairment and a higher risk for 
cerebral pals y in children whose mothers had received a ntibiotics [ Kenyon, 2001; 
Kenyon, 2008]. These observations have led to an appreciation that perinatal 
interventions may  affect growth and development and have highlighted the importance of 
long-term outcome studies after randomized, controlled studies of perinatal interventions. 
The goal of this study (ARIOS), therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero in the Phase III SPTL 
treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not associated with significant 
adverse outcomes in early childhood.

1.3.1. Risk Assessment
This study  is a follow-up safet y study of infants and children exposed to treatment while 
in utero during their mother’s participation in a Phase III SPTL treatment study  of 
retosiban or comparator for SPTL . Infants and children enrolled in this study  will not be 
administered an y investigational product; ther efore, there are no anticipated or known 
risks to the infants and children who participate in this safety  study. 2019N413355_00

(12retosiban: 15 atosiban). Within both 
studies, only 1cord blood sample 
tested positive for retosiban at a 
concentration of 1.9 µg/L. The 1.9 µg/L 
is approximately 0.006x to 0.01x the 
cord blood concentrations that were 
observed in the pregnant monkey 
toxicity studies (cord blood 
concentrations = 159 to 313 µg/L). 
There were no adverse effects 
observed in the offspring in monkey 
studies, wh ere growth and development 
included a full assessment of reflexive 
behaviors, infant ECG and blood 
chemistry were analyzed. Furthermore, 
a rat post -natal study starting in juvenile 
rats that were 1day old did not show

mean milk intake of a fully brea st-fed 
2-month old infant [Begg ,1999; 
Bennett, 1988; Hagg ,2000; Kristensen ,

retosiban that a breast -fed child would 
be exposed to is 0.54 µg/kg/day 
(3.6µg/L x 0.15 L/kg/day). This is 
approximately 0.5% of the human dose. 
This is the worst -case scenario because 
the mother is not being administered

lactation period, and ret osiban is

1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment
Babies born prematurel y are at risk for death, short -term medical complications, 
long-term disabilities, and developmental problems; these risks are inversely  related to 
gestational age. Although babies born before [ADDRESS_655144] risk for death 
and poor health outcomes [ Saigal, 2008; Lundqvist, 2009; Ma tthews, 2010], late preterm 
infants (defined as 340/7 to 366/7 weeks)are now known to carry  a higher risk of morbidity  
and mortality  than term infants [ Engle, 2007]. Approximately  40% to 45% of preterm 
births are preceded b y SPTL; the remainder is associated with preterm premature rupt ure 
of membranes and clinical indications for delivery [ Romero, 2000; Goldenberg , 2008]. 2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_655145] of antenatal corticosteroids [ RCOG, 2011; ACOG, 2012; Roos, 2013].
Given the inverse relationship between the risks for prematurit y complications and 
gestational age at birth, the development of a treatment that significantl y prolongs 
pregnancy  in women with SPTL  would be invaluable if associated with improved 
perinatal outcomes. Results from the Phase II study  OTA105256 offer hope that retosiban 
may prolong pregnancy  to such a degree that perinata l outcomes could be favorabl y 
affected[Thornton, 2015].However, t he results from the Phase III interventional studies
didnot provide compelling evidence that retosiban couldprolong time to delivery  of 
retosiban relative to placebo or atosiban , but b
ecause of the low enrollment numbers and 
inadequate statistical power, results should be interpreted with caution.
The benefit to infants and children participating in this study  is the focus on following 
morbidity  andneurodevelopment for up to 24monthsfollowing exposure to retosiban or 
comparator medication. Participating infants and children will have the benefit of access 
to developmental screening (Ages and Stages Questionnaire -3 [ASQ-3], Child Behavior 
Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 [CBCL /1.5–5], and the Modified Checklist for Autism in 
Toddlers–Revised with Follow -Up [M-CHAT-R/F]), which may not be routinely  
provided and will allow parents/legal guardians to monitor and track the child’s 
developmental milestones ina formalized manner. I n addition, screening results may  be 
shared with the child’s phy sician (HCP or other) as requested b y the parent/legal 
guardian. In the event a potential issue is identified and further follow -up is warranted, 
the child will be refer red to developmental specialists/qualified assessors for further 
evaluations as part of this study. In this manner, neurodevelopmental issues may  be 
identified earlier than would have been normally .

Additional contacts may  occur at the discretion of the RCC personnel to complete the 
data collection. 
The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete the CHI at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 
21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age. The CHI questionnaire completed up 
to the 24-month time point will screen for infant mortality  and morbidity  and will capture 
data on resource utilization .If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has been 
newly diagnosed (after [ADDRESS_655155] EDD) with chroni c conditions or congenital 
anomalies, follow-up will be undertaken with the applicable HCP to confirm the 
parent/legal guardian report. Persistence or resolution of conditions will be determined in 
subsequent questionnaires after the initial report. If pro tocol-specific evaluations are in 
progress at the end of the child’s protocol -defined participation in this study  (24months
chronological age) and results have not y et been received or reported, the time period 
may be extended to collect those reports.
Ifthe parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has had an y emergency room/urgent 
care (ER/UC) visits, he/she will be asked to record the number of visits and to indicate if 
the visit resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has 
been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507775] y surgeries, medical records from the applicable medical

birth defect evaluator’s responsibilities will include the review, evaluation, and 
classification of all reports of birth defects.
To screen for developmental issues, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete 
the 9-, 18- , and 24-month ASQ -3 when the infant’s corrected age corresponds to 9, 18, 
and 24 months, for example, parents/legal guardians of an infant born 3 months 
premature will complete the 9 -month ASQ -3 at 12 months chronological age. Any  child  2019N413355_00

31who scores in the black zone ( 2 SD below the mean) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) in any of the 
5domains of the ASQ -3 will be referred to a qualified assessor for a developmental 
evaluation (e.g., using the Bay ley Scales of Infant Development, third edition 
[BSID-III]), and a neurologic examination will be conducted, if indicated. An overall 
assessment of delay  in the areas of communication, gross and fine motor, 
problem-solving, and personal- socialdevelopment will be rendered. As p art of normal 
management, some infants may  already have undergone a formal developmental 
evaluation using the BSID- III; in these cases, if testing was recent ( 3 months), the 
BSID-III will not be repeated and RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507778] H CP. 
BSID-III retesting will be requested if the child’s ASQ -[ADDRESS_655157] BSID III referral. Based on results from the 
ASQ-3 administered at 24 months corrected age and if no cerebral pals y diagnosis has 
been made to date (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the infant may  be referred to a qualified 
examiner for a formal assessment of cerebral pals y.
The M-CHAT-R/F will be completed for all infants at 18 and 24 mo nths (corrected age) 
and the CBCL/1.5–5 will be completed for all infants at 24 months ( corrected age) to 
assess the risk for other behavioral problems or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).If at 
any of these time points a child has an M- CHAT-R/Fscore that i ndicates further 
evaluation is required and/or a CBCL /1.5–[ADDRESS_655158] of care with their primary  care pediatrician 
or health care provider.
The 24-monthdata will form the final study endpoint assessment timing; h owever, if data 
havebeen collected fr om a baby /infant after they  have passed the 24- monthendpoint, 
then this data will be included as a data listing within the clinicalstudyreport.
Data and genetic samples from the Phase III SPTL treatment studies may  be used as part 
of a genetic anal ysis using data collected in this study , if relevant. No additional genetic 
samples are required. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety  
concerns. Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, including t hose 
specified in the Time and Events Table ( Table 2), are essential and required for study  
conduct. All specified completion windows for applicable questionnaires (CHI , ASQ-3, 
CBCL/1.5–5, M-CHAT-R/F, and productivity ) are provided to help standardize the data 
and avoid overlap. Information captured outside of these windows will be collected and 
analyzed separatel y, and questionnaires completed outside the completion window will 
not be considered protocol deviations. 2019N413355_00

[ADDRESS_655159] information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing Study  Procedures Manual (SPM). The SPM will provide 
the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does no t 
impact subject safet y.
3.2. Discussion of Design
Longitudinal infant outcome studies are often fraught with a high rate of loss to follow-up 
that can introduce ascertainment bias [ Callanan, 2001; Tin , 1998]. The design of this 
study takes into account the operational and practical challenges involved in retaining 
infants, especiall y those who may have a diverse set of outcomes due to varying 
gestational age at birth. Rather than requi ring visits for formal outcome interviews and 
assessments of the infants and children, parent/legal guardian- reported outcomes will be 
the first-line source of health and developmental information, and parents will record data 
using an eDC sy stem to allow entry of data regardless of where it is obtained. The child’s 
primary HCP will be asked to provide data when the parent/legal guardian reports a 
chronic condition, birth defect, genetic condition or syndrome; or a change in a 
previously  reported condition. If the child’s primary HCP is unable to provide the 
information, another relevant HCP involved with the care of the child will also be asked 
to provide data. All congenital anomalies will be reviewed b y an expert in teratology  who 
is engaged b y the RCC -PI[INVESTIGATOR_507779].
Studies have affirmed that parents are a reliable source of information regarding their 
child’s health and development. The validity  of parental reports of infant and child 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507780] [ Spencer, 
2000]. Likewise, it has been demonstrated with validated tools such as the ASQ -3 that 
parents’ observations are useful in performing developmental screening [ Squires, 1998; 
Rydz, 2005]. Using the parents/legal guardians as first-line reporters will ensure the 
quality of data and enhance long -term retention in the safet y follow-up. Furthermore, 
because parents tend to spend more time with their child than an yone else, their 
assessments are likel y to be reliable. To guard against reporting bias, the parent/legal 
guardian, child’s HCPs, and all study  staff will be masked until completion of the 
follow-up study with respect to the mother/ child’s Phase III SPTL treatment assignment 
(see Section 5.3).
4. SUBJECT SELECTION A ND WITHDRA WAL CRITERI A
Enrollment of infants into this follow -up study will depend upon enroll ment of mothers 
into the Phase III SPTL  treatment studies. Efforts will be taken in those studies to 
maximize enrollment of all infants.
4.1. Number of Subjects
The sample size for this study  will depend on the total number of subjects enrolled in the 
Phase III SPTL treatment studies.  2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_655160] eligibility  is provided in the IB[GlaxoSmithKline Document Number
CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/06] .
Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they  can potentially  jeopardize 
the scientific integrit y of the study, regulatory acceptability, or sub ject safety . Therefore, 
adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. 
Infants eligible for enrollment in the study  must meet all of the following criteria:
1.Mother is randomly  assigned and dosed (retosiban or comparator) in [ADDRESS_655161] EDD.
3.Written informed consent is obtained from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the 
infant. The parent/legal guardian of participants aged [ADDRESS_655162] also 
provide writ ten agreement for the infant to participate in the study  where required by  
[CONTACT_507874].
4.3. Exclusion Criteria
Because this study  is focused on safet y and infant outcomes, all infants who meet the 
inclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll in the study
. There are no formal exclusion 
criteria for participation.
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria
Achild may be withdrawn from the study  due to loss to follow -up or if the child’s 
parent/legal guardian voluntarily  withdraws consent. A ll data collected up to the time of 
withdrawal will be included in the anal ysis. If a parent/legal guardian fails to complete an 
assessment, but wishes to remain in the study , they will be allowed to continue by

The Phase III SPTL treatment study  treatment group and strata to which mothers were 
assigned will be maintained during anal ysis of data from the child follow-up study.
5.3. Blinding
The parent/legal guardian, child, the child’s HCPs, and all study  personnel (from this 
study) will remain blinded to the treatment the mother received in the Phase III SPTL 
study and will remain blinded throughout the duration of t his child follow-up study.
The child will be given a new subject identification number at the start of this follow -up 
study. The child’s subject identification number from the Phase III SPTL treatment 
studies will be masked to maintain the blind of the fol low-up study as treatment 
assignment will be unblinded at the conclusion of the Phase III SPTL treatment studies. 
The details of maintaining stud y blinding will be provided in the SPM.
There is no formal interim analy sis planned for this study . The indepen dent data 
monitoring committee (IDMC) will review unblinded data from this study  along with 
data from an y ongoing Phase III SPTL treatment study  periodically  in accordance with 
the IDMC charter. Unblinded data will be provided by  [CONTACT_507876].

case of an emergency  OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of 
the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinic al management or welfare of the 
subject as judged b y the RCC -PI. 
RCC-PIs have direct access to the subject’s individual study  treatment by  [CONTACT_13172] a 
designated [COMPANY_003] unblinded safet y specialist via the SAE 24 -Hour Safet y Hotline; the 
designated unblinded safety specialist will perform the emergency  unblinding and inform 
the RCC-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507782]’s treatment assignment (refer to the SPM for details). 
It is preferred (but not required) that the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507783]’s treatment assignment. 
After the subject has been unblinded, the investigator should not reveal the treatment 
assignment to the [COMPANY_003] medical monitor unless that information is important for the safety  
of subjects currently  enrolled in the study  (refer to the SPM for details). 
The date and reason for the unblinding must be fully documented in the eCRF.
This protocol will be filed to the Investigational New Drug Application of the United 
States. Serious AEs requiring an expedi ted investigational new drug safet y report 
(blinded for investigational drug treatment) will be sent to all participating RCC -PIs. 
Further reporting to RCC- PIs or regulatory  authorities will be performed in accordance

The child’s parent/legal guardian will be the primary  data reporter to the study . 
Confirmation of key  study endpoints will be obtained from applicable HCPs or health 
care facilities. The infants and children will be followed beginning from after [ADDRESS_655163] EDD and until 24monthschronological age. Baseline characteristics and 
demographic data will be captured from the Phas e III SPTL  treatment studies and 
combined with child follow-up data for analy ses. Refer to Table 2for a summary  of data 
points to be collected and the time frame for assessment.
The time points for parent -completed questionnaires are scheduled to maintain the 
participant’s interest in study  continuation and minimize losses to follow -up. 
Questionnaires will be associated with the child’s age; in some cases
, the age will be 
chronological and in other cases, it will b e corrected for prematurity . The timing of the 
first questionnaire is scheduled to begin at 2 months chronological age and end at 
24monthschronological age. Contingent on the infant’s chronological age at the time of 
entry into the follow -up study, all of the questionnaires may  not be completed for each 
participant. The SPM will provide explicit details on study procedures to ensure proper 
timing of questionnaires.
It is noted that as part of the Phase III SPTL treatment studies, the infant’s mother will be 
asked to complete the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) using the same eDC  2019N413355_00

6.2. Safety
The focus will be on collecting the safety  outcomes as defined in the objectives (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death) and SA Es, including congenital anomalies. Nonserious AEs will 
not be tracked. All SAEs and safet y outcomes will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or loss to follow -up.
6.2.1. Morbidity and Mortality Endpoints
The main objective of the study  is to characteriz e the clinical safet y in terms of infant 
morbidity  and mortality  in infants and children exposed to retosiban or comparator during 
the Phase III SPTL treatment studies. The morbidity  endpoints will be assessed at 2, 6, 9, 
12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of t he child’s chronological age. Based on the discretion of 
the RCC-PI, medical records may  need to be obtained from the applicable medical 
facility for any infants who have not y et been discharged from their birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1and Section 6.3).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Parent/Legal Guardian -Completed Child Health Inventory
The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete the CHI at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 
21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age. At each time point, the completion 
window is +6 weeks; however, CHI questionnaires completed outside the completion 
window will not be considered a protocol deviation.
The CHI administered at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of the child’s 
chronological age will screen for infant mortalit y and morbidity  and capture data on 
resource utilization. To facilitate data collection, parents/legal guardians will be provided 
with an electronic device that will enabl e them to provide the protocol -required data. 
They will have the option to use alternative way s to access the same s ystem (e.g., their 
own personal devices). Further details will be provided in the SPM.
The CHI will collect information about the child’s overall health after the child has 
reached [ADDRESS_655168] EDD. The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to relate  2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
200722
40information from contacts with the health care s ystem including ER/UC visits, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgeries, use of special equipment, nonmedical therap y, and visits to 
medical specialists. Simple questions will be asked to ascertain whether chronic 
conditions or congenital anomalies related to the study  endpoints are affecting the child’s 
health. 
At the initial completion of the CHI, the pare nt/legal guardian will be asked about all 
morbidity  and mortality  endpoints and, if required based on the child’s age, the resource 
utilization endpoints. At subsequent completions of the CHI, up to 24 months 
chronological age, the parent/legal guardian will be asked the status of previously  
reported conditions (e.g., worse, better, or resolved), as appropriate. They  will also be 
asked if an y of the other morbidity  and mortality  endpoints and resource utilization 
endpoints , as required, have occurred since the last assessment.
The parent/legal guardian will be asked to record anthropometric data such as weight, 
length, and head circumference for the child at each well-child visit in a special electronic 
diary. Data from the diary  will be extracted to correspond with study  data collection time 
points (e.g., 6 -month well-child visit anthropometric data will be associated with the 
6-month study  data collection).
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Confirmation of Parent -Reported Data
If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has been n ewly diagnosed (after 
28days post EDD) with chronic conditions or congenital anomalies via the CHI , 
follow-up will be undertaken via the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507788]. At subsequent CHI s, if the parent/legal guardian indicate s that a previousl y 
reported condition has worsened or resolved, the HCP will also be asked to provide 
confirmation. If the condition qualifies as an SAE, additional information will be 
requested to assist the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507789].
The specific process by  [CONTACT_507878]. 
All morbidity  and mortality  endpoints (defined in Section 6.2) will require medical 
confirmation. All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507790]. All surgeries, except routine, simple outpatient procedures 
(e.g., circumcision), require confirmation b y medical records. If the parent/legal guardian 
indicates that the child has had an ER/UC visit, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507791] a true emergency . Additional 
details regarding ER/UC visits will be provided in the SPM. I f follow-up with the HCP is 
recommended, medical confirmation of the follow -up is required. 
The confirmation process is iterative and may  be triggered at multiple times throughout 
the study to provide confirmation of parent-reported conditions and events. Medical input 
will override parent -reported data. An overview for the collection and review of data for 
the CHI is provided in Figure 2. 2019N413355_00

6.2.5. Parent/Legal Guardian -Completed A SQ-3, M-CHAT-R/F, and 
CBCL/1.5 –[ADDRESS_655176]
The parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete standardized developmental 
screening of the infant through completion of the ASQ- 3. The ASQ -3 was developed and 
validated to be used as a developmental screening tool; it has been used global ly and 
translated into a number of different languages. The tool has been demonstrated to 
reliably and accuratel y identify children with delays who should receive further in -depth 
assessment. The ASQ -3 includes a series of questions designed to assess 5 ar eas of 
development: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem -solving, and 
personal-social. The questions target behaviors that are appropriate for particular 
developmental milestones; there are individual ASQ -3 questionnaires for age intervals 
ranging from 2 to 66 months. These behaviors are eas y for parents to observe, and they  
are asked to indicate whether or not the child can perform the behavior.
The 9-, 18-, and 24-month ASQ -3 questionnaires will be used in this study . These time 
points comply  with recommended developmental screening assessment guidelines from 
the American Academ y of Pediatrics [ Council on Children with Disabilities , 2006]. The 
parent/legal guardian will be asked t o complete the 9 -, 18-, and 24-month ASQ -3 when 
the infant’s corrected age corresponds to 9, 18, and 24 months, for example, parents/legal 
guardians of an infant born 3 months premature will complete the 9 -month ASQ -3 at 
12months chronological age. To fac ilitate data collection, the parent/legal guardian will 
be provided with an electronic device that will enable them to provide the 
protocol-required data. They  will have the option to use alternative way s to access the 
same system (e.g., their own personal devices). Further details will be provided in the 
SPM. The completion window for the ASQ -3 is +30 day s at Month 9 and ±30 day s at 
Months 18 and 24; however, questionnaires completed outside the completion window 
will not be considered a protocol deviation . It is essential to make age adjustments for 
prematurit y when selecting the appropriate ASQ -3. Based on results from the ASQ-3 
administered at 24 months corrected age and if no cerebral pals y diagnosis has been made 
to date(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the infant may  be referred to a qualified examiner for a 
formal assessment of cerebral pals y. 
The M-CHAT-R/F will be completed for all infants at 18 and 24 months ( corrected age) 
and the CBCL/1.5 –5 will be completed fo r all infants at 24 months ( corrected age) to 
assess the risk for other behavioral problems or ASD. If at any of these time points a 
child has an M- CHAT-R/Fscore that indicates further evaluation is required and/or a 
CBCL/1.5–[ADDRESS_655177] for a formal assessment. An overview for the 
collection and review of data for the M -CHAT-R/F and CBCL/1.5–5 is provided in 
Figure 3. 2019N413355_00

46The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent -reported autism screening tool designed to identify  
children 16 to 30 months of age who should receive a more thorough assessment for 
possible earl y signs of ASDor developmental delay  [Robins, 2014]. The M -CHAT-R/F 
consists of 20 questions that are answered with either “y es” or “no.” Total scores on the 
M-CHAT-R/F between [ADDRESS_655178] scores that indicate 
that further evaluation is required (either after an initial medium -risk score and further 
follow-up or an initial high -risk score ) will be considered to have possible signs of ASD
or developmental delay  and will be referred to a developmental specialist for a formal 
assessment.
The CBCL /1.5–5 is a widely  used parent -completed questionnaire of the Achenbach 
System of Empi[INVESTIGATOR_60519] y Based Assessment (ASEBA). The ASEBA is based on carefully  
conducted empi[INVESTIGATOR_507799], in a standardized format, 
behavioral problems and social competencies ( Achenbach, 2001). The CBCL /1.5-5 
includes approximately  100 items that describe specific kinds of behavioral, emotional, 
and social problems that characterize preschool children between the ages of 1.5 and 
5years. Scores on the full CBCL /1.5-[ADDRESS_655179] scores above the 97th percentile for a 
subset of prespecified questions that relate to attention or hyperactivit y problems 
syndrome or the American Psy chiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
(DSM)-oriented attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder scale will be considered to have a 
behavior problem, which will trigger a referral to a developmental specia list for a formal 
assessment. 
The completion window for the CBCL/1/5- 5 and M-CHAT-R/F is +6 weeksat 
18months (M -CHAT-R/Fonly) and +12 weeks at 24 months; however, questionnaires 
completed outside the completion window will not be considered a protocol deviation.
For further details regarding the CBCL/1.5 –5 and M-CHAT-R/F, refer to the SPM.

Recommendations
The ASQ -3 scores for this study  will be interpreted and recommendations will be offered 
according to the following:
The child’s development will be considered to be on schedule if the child’s 
ASQ-3 scores are in the white zone (higher than 1 SD below the mean), and no 
further action is required.
If the child’s ASQ -3 scores are in the grey  zone (1 SD below the mean), the 
parent/legal guardian may share the ASQ -[ADDRESS_655181] results with the child’s HCP. 2019N413355_00

47If any of the child’s ASQ -3 scores are in the black zone ( 2 SD below the 
mean), then the child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked if the child is already 
under the care of a developmental specialist who can or has made a formal 
assessment (e.g., using the BSID -III). If a recent ( 3months) BSID -III was 
conducted, the BSID -III will not be repeated and the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507800]. If the child is not currently under the care of a 
developmental specialist, then the parent/legal guardian will be referred to a 
qualified assessor for developmental evaluation (e.g., using the BSID -III), and a 
neurologic examination will be conducted, if indicated. 
BSID-III retesting will be performed if the child’s ASQ- [ADDRESS_655182] BSID -III referral.
If, at 24 months corrected age, the child’s ASQ -3 gross motor domain score is in 
the black range and the child has not alread y been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, 
the parent/legal guardian will be referred to a qualified examiner for a formal 
assessment to determine if this condition is present.
Reports from all specialists will be incl uded in the subject’s source documents. For

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an AE
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temp orally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-
existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study  treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae. 2019N413355_00

200722
51Events that do notmeet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
thedisease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an SA E
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life threatening
NOTE: The term “life threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507802]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23917]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23919], the 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” o ccurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from Baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE: The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and ac cidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which 
may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether report ing is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507803] [ADDRESS_655183] results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., electrocardiograms, radiological scans, vital sign 
measurements), including those that worsen from Baseline, felt to be clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507804]. 
However, an y clinicall y significant safet y assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_404432]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507805]’s condition, are notto be reported as SAEs.
6.2.9. Cardiovascular Events
The RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507806]:
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrhythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack

7. DATA MANAGEMENT
7.1. Data Handling Conventions
For this study , child data will be entered into [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003] -defined eCRFs, transmitted 
electronically  to [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003], and combined with data provided from other sources, e.g., 
data obtained directly  from the parent/legal guardian via an electronic device provided by  
[CONTACT_456], its designated vendor, or the patient’s own devices using a secure and 
validated data s ystem. The RCC staff will enter data provided on paper into the 
specificall y designed eCRF pages. 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003] 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrit y of the data, e.g., removing 
errors and inconsistencies in the data. Adverse events and concomitant medications terms 
will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) and an 
internal validated medication dictionary , [COMPANY_004]Drug.
All eCRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained b y [COMPANY_004]. In all cases, 
subject initials will not be collected or transmitted to [COMPANY_004] according to [COMPANY_004] policy .
7.1.1. Attempts to Obtain the Follow -Up Information
When follow -up data are due, the applica ble reporter will be contact[CONTACT_507886] -up information. Subsequent attempts, as necessary , will be made through 
various modes of communication. If there is still no response, a final communication will 
be sent indicating the case is lost to follow-up. If this communication prompts a response 
or the requested data are later received before the study  closes, the case will be re- opened 
and will no longer be considered lost to follow- up. Once re -opened, an y data from 
assessments that had not been entered at the time the participant was lost to follow-up 
may be collected, if appropriate. If at any  point in the follow -up process the reporter 
indicates that the participant is lost to follow -up, no further attempts will be made. 2019N413355_00

other cases with some follow- up data will be analyzed up to the length of childfollow-up.
7.2. Validation Procedures
The ongoing data collection from parents/legal guardians will follow a specific script to 
elicit information from contacts with the health care s ystem. The child’s HCP will also be 
contact[CONTACT_507887]’shealth and resource utilization when triggered b y 
information from the parent/legal guardian. As indicated in the previous sections, for 
conditions or events that may meet SAE criteria, medical confirmation and/or medical 
records will be obtained to provid e details of the conditions. All study  data will be 
captured in carefully  designed eCRFs specific to the study  objectives.
The ASQ -3, CBCL/1.5 -5, and M- CHAT-R/F questionnaires that parents/legal guardians 
will administer at the specific ages or time points have been validated in English and 
selected languages.
Ensuring that the data obtained and delivered to [COMPANY_004] are of high qualit y will be an 
ongoing, multistep process involving programming of edit checks for critical data 
variables in the data management s ystem and visual review for completeness, logic, 
consistency , and accuracy . As is recommended in regulatory  guidance documents, eCRFs 
will be carefully  designed to ensure data quality  and integrit y.
7.2.1. Follow-Up Process for Clarification of Information
If there are discrepancies in the data, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507813]. Subsequent attempts will be made, if necessary. If no further information is 
obtained on an otherwise evaluable case, the discrepant information in the data fi elds may 
be left blank, identified as “unspecified.” On a case- by-case basis, qualified study  staff or

been randomized and received retosiban or comparator in an y of the Phase III treatment 
trials. Of these mothers, the infant safety  population includes the mother/infant pairs who 
enrolled into the study, the mother/infant pairs who decline to consent to the study , and 
the mother/infant pairs whose fetus/neonates/infants died prior to the enrol lment of the 
study. Subjects will be analy zed according to their a ctual treatment in case this differs 
from their randomized treatment.
8.3.2. Analysis Data Sets
In this stud y, the anal ysis data set is the primary  population.
8.3.3. Treatment Comparisons
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Comparisons of Interest
The primary  treatment groups are retosiban, place bo, and atosiban.
The primary  comparisons between these treatment groups will be:
Retosiban versus placebo 
Retosiban versus atosiban 2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L

[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Comparisons of Interest
A secondary  treatment group will include the pooling of placebo and atosiban into a 
group called “all comparators.” The secondary  comparison will be the following:
Retosiban versus all comparators
8.3.4. Interim A nalysis
There is no formal interim analy sis planned for this study . The IDMC will review 
unblinded data from this study  along with data from a ny ongoing Phase III SPTL 
treatment study  periodically  in accordance with the IDMC charter. The unblinded 
periodic safety  updates will be performed and delivered to the IDMC by  [CONTACT_507888]. 
In the event of earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507814] y 
and/or lack of efficacy , children will continue to be followed until they  have reached 
24monthschronological age. 
For any subject for which the CHI questionnaire at 3, 4, and 5 y ears of the child’s 
chronological age was completed prior to Amendment 2, data will be reported.
Further anal ysis details will be provided in the reporting and anal ysis plan (RAP) and/or 
IDMC charter.

11.1. Appendix 1: Protocol Changes
Protocol Amendment Number 01
Protocol Amendment Number 01 is applicable to all RCCsitesparticipating in this study. 
Protocol changes specified in Amendment Number 01 are summarized as follows: 
Extended the study duration from 24 months to 5 y ears. The rationale for this change 
was to identify  any potential neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders through 
annual assessments at years 3, 4, and 5, s pecifically  autism and attention deficit 
hyperactivit y disorder .
Added an assessment using a modified version of the CHI  questionnaire at 3, 4, and 
5years of the child’s chronological age. The rationale for this change is to address 
US Food and Drug Administration recommendations to extend the duration of the 
follow-up period to [ADDRESS_655196] 
data to identify any potential neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders at3, 4, 
and 5years of the child’s chronol ogical age .
Added an additional time point for the assessment of the M- CHAT-R/F at 18 months 
(in addition to the assessment at 24 months). The rationale for this change was to 
follow current recommendations from the American Academ y of Pediatrics for the 
assessment of the M -CHAT-R/F[Council on Children with Disabilities, 2006].
Revised criteria for assessment using the M-CHAT-R/F, which is assessed at 18 and 
24months, and CBCL /1.5-5, which is assessed at 24 months, to make these 
assessments mandatory  forall infants, regardless of ASQ -3 results. Previous 
requirement for CBCL/1.5–5 and M -CHAT-R/F was limited to children with ASQ -3 
nonmotor (communication, problem -solving, and/or personal- social) domain scores 
in the black zone at 24 months corrected age. The rationale for this change was to 
follow current recommendations from the American Academ y of Pediatrics [Council 
on Children with Disabilities , 2006].
Removed as a neurodevelopment endpoint the proportion of infants referred for an 
additional behaviorassessment using the M- CHAT-R/F and CBCL/1.5-5. Because 
the CBCL /1.5-5 and M-CHAT-R/F will be assessed for all infants at specified time 
points, regardless of ASQ- 3 results, this endpoint is no longer applicable to this 
study.
Clarified that an y infant SAEsand/orAEs of special interest that were unresolved at 
the end of the Phase III treatment studies and an y new SAEs reported during this 
study should be followed to stabilization or resolution in those children participating 
in the follow -up study.   2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
200722
68Removed standard care tocoly tic therapy  as a subgroup that may  be explored as part 
of the safet y analysis. This subgroup is no longer relevant because the PhaseIII 
SPTL Study 200719(NEWBORN -1)prohibits concomitant tocoly tic treatment 
during stud y drug admini stration.
Added the following subgroups that may  be explored as part of the safet y analysis: 
established progesterone use, magnesium sulphate use, and tocol ytic usefollowing 
study drugdiscontinuation . The rationale for this change was to align endpoints with 
thosein Phase III SPTL Study  200719(NEWBORN -1).
Incorporated administrative changes as detailed in a Protocol Clarification Letter 
dated 19-Jan-2015, clarifying that there is no requirement for the investigator to 
discuss unblinding with the [COMPANY_003] med ical monitor in order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y unblind a 
child's treatment assignment if needed.
Incorporated other administrative changes. The rationale for these changes is to 
ensure a clear and complete protocol for use at the RCCsites.

Summary , Rationale :
One of the major advances in perinatal medicine has been the finding that antenatal 
corticosteroids given to women at risk of imminent preterm birth reduces the risks for 
neonatal mortality  and morbidity . Corticosteroids now represent the standard of care for 
an acute antenatal intervention to improve neonatal outcomes in the developed world
[RCOG, 2011; ACOG, 2012].
The goal of this study  (ARIOS) , therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban ([COMPANY_004]221149) or comparator in the planned 
Phase III SPTL treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not associated 
with significant adverse outcomes in earl y childhood.
Summary, Objectives
The study  objective is to assess the safety  and outcomes in infants and children who 
were expose d to retosiban or comparator in the Phase III SPTL treatment studies.
Specific objectives include the following:
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of infant morbidity  and mortality  in 
infants and children exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of neurodevelopment in infants and 
children exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
To characterize parental productivity  loss related to a sick child and infant resource 
utilization in terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], length of stay , emergency  room/urgent 
care (ER/UC) visits, surgical procedures, and referral to specialt y care or therap y 
visits for infants (up to age 2 years) exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
Summary , Study Design :
ThisARIOS is a long-term infant and child follow-up study thatwill prospectivel y 
assess safet y and outcomes of all infants and children born to women who received at 
least [ADDRESS_655197] reached 5 years  2019N413355_00

require medical interventions or study  visits to an investigational site. Instead, parents or 
legal guardians will be prompted at certain time points to complete developmental 
questionnaires and other data regarding their child’s health status via an e lectronic 
device. Data collected during theinfant thisfollow-up study will be managed by  a 
centralized research coordinating center (RCC). Regionally based pediatricians will serve 
as the study  principal investigators (referred to as RCC -PIs) for the fol low-up study. All 
communications the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507755]/legal guardian or the infant’s child’s 
health care provider (HCP) will occur remotel y; there will be no clinic visits.
The infant'schild’sparent/legal guardian will be asked to complete a Ch ild Health 
Inventory  (CHI)at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age 
and a modified CHI at 3, 4, and 5 years of the child’s chronological age . ThisThe 
CHIquestionnaire completed up to the 24-month time point will screen f or infant 
mortality and morbidity  and will capture data on resource utilization. At the 3 -, 4-, and 
5-year time points, the CHI will screen for child mortality and morbidity , including 
any indicators of neurodevelopmental impairment. If the parent/legal gu ardian 
indicates that the child has been newl y diagnosed (after [ADDRESS_655198] EDD) with chronic 
conditions or congenital anomalies, follow- up by [CONTACT_404432]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507756]. Persistence or resolution of conditions will 
be determined in subsequent questionnaires after the initial report. 
If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has had a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507834], the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507835], including a death certificate, if applicable. If the 
parent/legal guardian indicates that the child has had an ER/UC visit, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507836] a true 
emergency . Additional details regarding ER/UC visits will be provided in the SPM. After 
review of all records, the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507837] -up data from 
the relevant HCP or medical facility  if clarification is ne eded on an y reported study  
endpoints or serious adverse events (SAEs).
During the first 24 months of participation in the study, Iif the parent/legal guardian 
indicates that the infant has been treated b y specialists or has had ER/UC visits or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509], he/she will be asked to complete a productivity questionnaire to evaluate 
loss of parental productivity .
To screen for a delay  in the areas of communication, gross motor, fine motor, 
problem-solving, and personal- social skills, the parent/legal guar dian will be asked to 
complete the 9 -, 18-, and 24-month Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3 (ASQ-3) when the 
infant’s corrected age corresponds to 9, 18, and 24 months, for example, parents/legal 
guardians of an infant born 3 months premature will complete th e 9-month ASQ -3 at 
12months chronological age. An y child with a score in the black zone ( 2SD below 
the mean) in an y of the 5 domains of the ASQ -3 will be referred to a qualified assessor  2019N413355_00

71for a developmental evaluation (e.g., using the Bayley  Scale for Infant Development, 
third edition [BSI D-III]), unless the child is already  under the care of a specialist who has 
recently conducted a BSID -III evaluation. Based on results from the ASQ -3 administered 
at 24 months corrected age , parents/legal guardians may be asked to complete the Child 
Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL /1.5–5) and the Modified Checklist for 
Autism in Toddlers–Revised with Follow -Up (M-CHAT-R/F) to assess the risk for other 
behavioral problems or autism spectrum disorder or, alterna tively,and if no cerebral 
palsy diagnosis has been made to date , the infant may  be referred to a qualified 
examiner for a formal assessment of cerebral pals y.
The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers –Revised with Follow- Up 
(M-CHAT-R/F) will be comple ted for all infants at 18 and 24 months (corrected 
age) and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL/1.5 –5) will be 
completed for all infants at 24 months (corrected age) to assess the risk for other 
behavioral problems or autism spectrum disorder( ASD). If at any of these time 
points a child has an M -CHAT-R/F score that indicates further evaluation is 
required and/or a CBCL/1.5 –[ADDRESS_655199] for a formal 
assessment.

Section 1.1, Background
Preterm birth rates ranged from approximately  5% in several European countries to 18% 
in some African countries. I n [ZIP_CODE], overnearly450 000 preterm births, defined as 
childbirth occurring before 37 completed weeks’ gestation, occurred in the United Stat es 
[Martin, 20 1315].
Section 1.1.1, Previous Human Experience
Study OTA105256 was the first Phase II clinical study  of retosiban in preterm labor 
(n=93) [Thornton, 2015 ; GlaxoSmithKline Document Number CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/03 ]. 
The study  was designed to investigat e the safet y and dose response of retosiban given 
intravenously  to women with intact membranes in preterm labor between 300/7and 356/7
weeks of gestation. Final results showed that intravenous retosiban treatment was 
associated with a significant differen ce in days to delivery  and significant reduction in 
preterm births. The mean difference in day s to delivery  was 8.2days relative to placebo 
(95% confidence credibleinterval [CI]: 2.7, 13.74). Median prolongation of pregnancy  
was 35 day s in women treated with retosiban, compared with 25 day s in women assigned 
to the placebo group. The treatment difference was consistent across gestational ages. 
The proportion of preterm births was 18.7% in the retosiban group and 47.2% in the  2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
200722
74placebo group. The relative risk for preterm birth in the retosiban group was 0.38 (95% 
CIcredibleinterval: 0.15, 0.81).
The emerging safet y profile for retosiban appears favorable. Results from protocol 
specified maternal- fetal and neonatal safet y assessments were absent of an y concerns and 
were similar between the retosiban and placebo groups. Furthermore, no clinically  
significant disparities in AEs were noted between groups [Thornton, 2015] . All reported 
AEs, whether maternal, fetal, or neonatal, were generall y consistent with those reported 
eitherin the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004])Document Number 
CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/03] , IB Supplement 1 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 
2015N228508_00], or in the study  population.
Section 1.2, Rationale :
One of the major advances in perinatal medicine has been the finding that antenatal 
corticosteroids given to women at risk of imminent preterm birth reduces the risks for 
neonatal mortality  and morbidity . Corticosteroids now represent the standard of care for 
an acute antenatal int ervention to improve neonatal outcomes in the developed world
[RCOG, 2011; ACOG, 2012].
The goal of this study  (ARIOS) , therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban ([COMPANY_004]221149) or comparator in uteroin the 
planned Phase III SPTL treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not 
associated with significant adverse outcomes in early  childhood.
Section 1.3.1., Risk Assessment
This study  is a follow-up safet y study of infants and children exposed to treatment while 
in uteroduring their mother’s participation in a Phase III SPTL treatment study  of 
retosiban or comparator for SPTL . Infants and children enrolled in this study will not be 
administered an y investigational product; therefore, ther e are no anticipated or known 
risks to the infants and children who participate in this safety stud y.
The intent of this study  is to ensure there have been no unintended consequences to the 
infants and children from exposure to retosiban or comparator duri ng their mother’s 
participation in the Phase III clinical stud y of retosiban, specifically  with respect to the 
following:
Potential Risk of 
Clinical SignificanceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Retosiban [e.g., [COMPANY_004]221149]
Fetal exposure 
throu gh placental 
transferPreclinical data indicate very minimal, if 
any, maternal central nervous system 
(CNS) penetration or placental transfer 
of retosiban as supported by [CONTACT_14504]: 
In pregnant monkeys there was no Analysis of maternal blood and cord 
blood samples will be performed to test 
for levels of retosiban in women who 
deliver at an investigative center within 
12hours of the completion of study

75Potential Risk of 
Clinical SignificanceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Retosiban [e.g., [COMPANY_004]221149]
detectable retosiban in the cord 
blood when mothers were dosed up 
to 100 mg/kg (approximately 
7times the human exposure). 
However, approximately 4% of 
circulating drug was detected in the 
cord blood when mothers were 
dosed at 300 mg/kg (approximately 
24-fold the human exposure).
Retosiban i s a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein and breast cancer 
resistant protein transporters, which 
are thought to play a role in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_507838], thereby [CONTACT_507896].
In reproductive toxicology st udies in 
pregnant monkeys, there were no 
adverse mother and infant 
behavioral or locomotor effects 
observed that were suggestive of 
CNS toxicity. 
In rodent neurobehavioral safety 
studies, there were no adverse 
clinical signs observed at doses up 
to 1000 m g/kg.Phase III SPTL treatment studies.
Surveillance for signals indicating 
adverse fetal or neonatal effects with 
inutero exposure to retosiban will be 
performed throughout this study.
Infants exposed to retosiban in utero 
will be followed for a miniumum of [ADDRESS_655208] milk 
appears low but could occur in the 
situation where the infant is fed breas t 
milk/colostrum produced within 
12hours of treatment. Since 
lactogenesis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_507839] 30 to 
48 hours postpartum in mothers going 
to term (and is further delayed in 
mothers who deliver preterm), it seems 
unlikely that any drug would be in the 
plasma postpartum to transfer into the 
milk.Breast milk/colostrum samples will be 
collected for measurement of retosiban 
when delivery occurs and lactation has 
started within [ADDRESS_655209] 
milk will be followed for a miniumum of 
24 months up to 5 years in this study to 
assess safety and neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.

76Section 1.3.2., Benefit Assessment
Giventhe inverse relationship between the risks for prematurit y complications and 
gestational age at birth, the development of a treatment that significantl y prolongs 
pregnancy  in women with SPTL  would be invaluable if associated with improved 
perinatal outcomes. Results from the Phase II study  OTA105256 offer hope that retosiban 
may prolong pregnancy  to such a degree that perinatal outcomes could be favorabl y 
affected [Thornton, 2015] . There are currentl y no safet y findings that would preclude 
further developm ent of retosiban for an indication for the treatment of SPTL in 
conjunction with standard of care treatments in women with an uncomplicated, singleton 
pregnancy .
The benefit to infants and children participating in this study is the focus on following 
morbidity  and neurodevelopment for a miniumum of [ADDRESS_655210] the benefit of access to developmental screening (Ages and Stages Questionnaire -3 
[ASQ-3], Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 [CBCL /1.5–5], and the Modified 
Checklist for Autism in Toddlers– Revised with Follow -Up [M-CHAT-R/F]), which may  
not be routinely  provided and will allow parents/legal guardians to monitor and track the 
infant’schild’sdevelopmental milestones in a formalized manner. In addition, screening 
results may  be shared with the infant’schild’sphysician (health care providers [HCPs] or 
other) as requested b y the parent/legal guardian. In the event a potential issueis identified 
and further follow -up is warranted, the infantchildwill be referred to developmental 
specialists/qualified assessors for further evaluations as part of this study . In this manner, 
neurodevelopmental issues may be identified earlier than would have been normally .
Section 1.3.3., Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion
For detailed information on the identified risks and benefit:risk assessment of retosiban, 
refer to the IB and IB Supplement 1 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 
CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/03 ; GlaxoSm ithKline Document Number 2015N228508_00 ]. The 
overall benefit:risk assessment of retosiban appears favorable for the mother and 
fetus/infant. Although, experience in pregnant women is limited, no clinical or preclinical 
safety issues have been identified t hat preclude further development.

80at prespecified intervals until they  reach 5 years chronological age (see Table 2). This 
study does not require medical interventions or study visits to an investigational site. 
Instead, parents or legal guardians will be prompted at certain time points to complete 
developmental questionnaires and other data on their children’s health status via an 
electronic device. Data collected duri ng the infant thisfollow up study  will be managed 
by a centralized RCC. Regionall y based pediatricians will serve as stud y principal 
investigators (referred to as RCC -PIs) for this study . All communications the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507841]/legal guardian or the infant’s child’s HCP will occur remotely; there will 
be no clinic visits. An overview of the study  design is shown in Figure 1.

care (ER/UC) visits, he/she will be asked to record the number of visits and to indicate if 
the visit resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If the parent/legal guardi an indicates that the infant
childhas been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507775] y surgeries, medical records from the applicable 
medical facility  will be obtained and abstracted for pertinent details, including principal 
and secondary  discharge diagnoses, t ype of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507763] (e.g., neonatal 
intensive care unit [NI CU], Pediatrics, pediatric intensive care unit [PI [INVESTIGATOR_6890]], Nursery  
level3, ICU), and length of stay . If the parent/legal guardian indicates that the infant
childdied after [ADDRESS_655223] 24 months of participation in the study, Iif the parent/legal guardian 
indicates that the infant has been treated b y specialists or has had ER/UC visits or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], he/she will be asked to complete a pro ductivity questionnaire to evaluate 
loss of parental productivity .
To screen for developmental issues, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete 
the 9-, 18- , and 24-month ASQ -3 when the infant’s corrected age corresponds to 9, 18, 
and 24 months, for example, parents/legal guardians of an infant born 3 months 
premature will complete the 9 -month ASQ -3 at 12 months chronological age. Any  child 
who scores in the black zone ( 2 SD below the mean) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) in any  of the 
5domains of the AS Q-3 will be referred to a qualified assessor for a developmental 
evaluation (e.g., using the Bay ley Scales of Infant Development, third edition 
[BSID-III]), and a neurologic examination will be conducted, if indicated. An overall 
assessment of delay  in theareas of communication, gross and fine motor, 
problem-solving, and personal- socialdevelopment will be rendered. As part of normal 
management, some infants may  already have undergone a formal developmental 
evaluation using the BSID- III; in these cases, if testing was recent ( 3 months), the 
BSID-III will not be repeated and RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507843]. 
BSID-III retesting will be requested if the child’s ASQ -[ADDRESS_655224] BSID III referral. Based on results from the

Section 3.2., Discussion of Design
Longitudinal infant outcome studies are often fraught with a high rate o f loss to follow up 
that can introduce ascertainment bias [Callanan, 2001; Tin, 1998]. The design of this 
study takes into account the operational and practical challenges involved in retaining 
infants, especiall y those who may have a diverse set of outcom es due to vary ing 
gestational age at birth. Rather than requiring visits for formal outcome interviews and 
assessments of the infants and children , parent/legal guardian -reported outcomes will be 
the first-line source of health and developmental informatio n, and parents will record data 
using an eDC sy stem to allow entry  of data regardless of where it is obtained. The child’s 
primary HCP will be asked to provide data when the parent/legal guardian reports a 
chronic condition, birth defect, genetic condition or syndrome; or a change in a 
previously  reported condition. I f the child’s primary  HCP is unable to provide the 
information, another relevant HCP involved with the care of the infantchildwill also be 
asked to provide data. All congenital anomalies will be reviewed b y an expert in 
teratology  who is engaged by  [CONTACT_404432]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507779].
Studies have affirmed that parents are a reliable source of information regarding their 
infant’s child’s health and development. The validity  of parental reports of infant and 
childhospi[INVESTIGATOR_507844] 
[Spencer, 2000]. L ikewise, it has been demonstrated with validated tools such as the 
ASQ-3 that parents’ observations are useful in performing de velopmental screening 
[Squires, 1998; Ry dz, 2005]. Using the parents/legal guardians as first -line reporters will 
ensure the quality of data and enhance long -term retention in the safet y follow-up. 
Furthermore, because parents tend to spend more time with their infants childthan 
anyone else, their assessments are likel y to be reliable. To guard against reporting bias, 
the parent/legal guardian, infant’schild’sHCPs, and all study  staff will be masked until 
completion of the follow -up study with respect to the mother/ infant’schild’sPhase III 
SPTL treatment assignment (see Section 5.3).

Aninfantschildmay be withdrawn from the study  due to loss to follow -up or if the 
infant’schild’s parent/legal guardian voluntaril y withdraws consent. All data collected 
up to the time of withdrawal will be included in the anal ysis. If a parent/legal guardian 
fails to complete an assessment, but wishes to remain in the study , they will be allowed to 
continue by  [CONTACT_507875].
Section 5.1., Investigational Product and Other Study Treatment
This is a safet y follow-up study of infants and children exposedto treatment during their 
mother’s participation in a Phase III SPTL treatment study  of retosiban or comparator for 
SPTL. Infants and children enrolled in this study will not be administered any  
investigational product.
Section 5.2., Treatment Assignment
The Phase III SPTL treatment study  treatment group and strata to which mothers were 
assigned will be maintained during anal ysis of data from the infantchildfollow-up study.
Section 5.3, Blinding
The parent/legal guardian, infantchild, the infant’s child’sHCPs, and all study  personnel 
(from this study ) will remain blinded to the treatment the mother received in the Phase III 
SPTL study and will remain blinded throughout the duration of this infantchild
follow-up study.
The infantchildwill be given a n ew subject identification number at the start of this 
follow-up study. The infant’schild’s subject identification number from the Phase III 
SPTL treatment.
The RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507845]’s a subject’s treatment 
assignment only in the case of an emergency  OR in the event of a serious medical 
condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical 
management or welfare of the subject as judged by [CONTACT_404432] -PI. 
The RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507846] h [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003] medical monitor or appropriate 
[COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003] study  personnel before unblinding the infant’s treatment assignment. The [COMPANY_003] 
unblinded medical monitor will authorize the unblinding, and the treatment assignment 
will be provided. The date and reason for th e unblinding must be recorded in the 
appropriate data collection tool.
[COMPANY_004]’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance department may  unblind the 
treatment assignment for any  infant with an SAE. The [COMPANY_003] medical monitor may  unblind 
the treatment assignme nt after discussing the rationale for unblinding with the RCC -PI. 
Notification of unblinding will be sent to [COMPANY_004], [COMPANY_003], and the RCC site. 2019N413355_00

84This protocol will be filed to the Investigational New Drug Application of the United 
States. Serious AEs requiring an expedited investigational new drug safet y report 
(blinded for investigational drug treatment) will be sent to all participating RCC -PIs. 
Further reporting to RCC- PIs or regulatory  authorities will be performed in accordance 
with local regulations. If the S AE requires that an expedited regulatory  report be sent to 
one or more regulatory  agencies, a copy  of the report, identify ing the subject’s treatment 
assignment, may  be sent to RCC -PIs in accordance with local regulations and/or [COMPANY_004] 
policy.
RCC-PIs have di rect access to the subject’s individual study treatment by 
[CONTACT_13172] a designated [COMPANY_003] unblinded safety specialist via the SAE 24 -Hour Safety 
Hotline; the designated unblinded safety specialist will perform the emergency 
unblinding and inform the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507847]’s treatment assignment (refer to 
the SPM for details). 
It is preferred (but not required) that the RCC- PI [INVESTIGATOR_507848]’s treatment assignment. 
After the subject has been unblinded, the investigator should not reveal the 
treatment assignment to the [COMPANY_003] medical monitor unless that information is 
important for the safety of subjects currently enrolled in the study (refer to the SPM 
for details). 
The date and reason for the unblinding must be fully documented in the eCRF.
Section 6, Study Assessments and Procedures
The infant’schild’sparent/legal guardian will be the primary  data reporter to the study . 
Confirmation of key  study endpoints will be obtained from applicable H CPs or health 
care facilities. The infants and children will be followed beginning from after [ADDRESS_655227] EDD and until 24 months corrected age (for preterm infants) or 24 months 5 years
chronological age (for term infants) . Baseline characteristics and d emographic data will 
be captured from the Phase III SPTL treatment studies and combined with infantchild
follow-up data for anal yses. Refer to Table 2 for a summary  of data points to be collected 
and the time frame for assessment.
The time points for pare nt-completed questionnaires are scheduled to maintain the 
participant’s interest in study  continuation and minimize losses to follow up. 
Questionnaires will be associated with the infant’schild’sage; in some cases the age will 
be chronological and in oth er cases, it will be corrected for prematurity . The timing of the 
first questionnaire is scheduled to begin at 2 months chronological age and end at 24 
months corrected age (for preterm infants) or 24 months 5 yearschronological age (for 
term infants) . Contingent on the infant’s chronological age at the time of entry  into the 
follow up study , all of the questionnaires may  not be completed for each participant. The 
SPM will provide explicit details on study  procedures to ensure proper timing of

The main objective of the study  is to characterize the clinical safet y in terms of infant 
morbidity  and morta lity in infants and children exposed to retosiban or comparator 
during the Phase III SPTL treatment studies. The morbidity  endpoints will be assessed at 
2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months and 3, 4, and 5 years of the child’s chronological 
age. Based on the discretion of the RCC -PI, medical records may  need to be obtained 
from the applicable medical facility  for any infants who have not y et been discharged 
from their birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section 6.3).
Section [IP_ADDRESS]., Parent/ Legal Guardian- Completed Child Health Inventory
The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete the CHI at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 
21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age and a modified CHI at 3, 4, and 5 
years of the child’s chronologi cal age. At each time point, the completion window is +6 
weeks; however, CHI questionnaires completed outside the completion window will not 
be considered a protocol deviation.
The CHI will be administered at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of the child’s 
chronological age will toscreen for infant mortality  and morbidity  and tocapture data on 
resource utilization. At 3, 4, and 5 years of the child’s chronological age, the CHI will 
screen for child mortality and morbidity, including any indicators o f

parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete the 9-, 18 -, and 24-month ASQ -3 when 
the infant’s corrected age correspo nds to 9, 18, and 24 months, for example, parents/legal 
guardians of an infant born 3 months premature will complete the 9 -month ASQ -3 at 12 
months chronological age. To facilitate data collection, the parent/legal guardian will be 
provided with an electro nic device that will enable them to provide the protocol required 
data. They  will have the option to use alternative way s to access the same sy stem (e.g., 
their own personal devices). Further details will be provided in the SPM. The completion 
window for t he ASQ-3 is +30 day s at Month 9 and ±30 day s at Months 18 and 24; 
however, questionnaires completed outside the completion window will not be 
considered a protocol deviation. I t is essential to make age adjustments for prematurit y 
when selecting the approp riate ASQ -3. Based on results from the ASQ -3 administered at 
24 months corrected age and if no cerebral palsy diagnosis has been made to date (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) parents/legal guardians may  be asked to complete the CBCL/1.5 –5 and

according to the following:
The child’s development will be considered to be on schedule if the child’s 
ASQ-3 scores are in the white zone (higher than 1 SD below the mean), and no 
further action is required .
If the child’s ASQ -3 scores are in the grey  zone ( 1 SD below the mean), the 
parent/legal guardian may share the ASQ -[ADDRESS_655239] results with the child’s HCP.
If any of the child’s ASQ -3 scores are in the black zone ( 2 SD below the 
mean), then the child’s p arent/legal guardian will be asked if the child is alread y 
under the care of a developmental specialist who can or has made a formal 
assessment (e.g., using the BSID -III). If a recent ( 3 months) BSID -III was 
conducted, the BSID -III will not be repeated an d the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507856]. If the child is not currently under the care of a 
developmental specialist, then the parent/legal guardian will be referred to a

SAEs
Any nonprotocol -specified abnormal laboratory  test results (hematology , clinical 
chemistry , or urinalysis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., electrocardiograms, 
radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from Baseline, 
felt to be clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the RCC -PI [INVESTIGATOR_507857]. However, an y clinicall y significant safet y assessments that are 
associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_404432]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_507858]’s condition, are not to be reported as SAEs.

Section 6.3.1., Parent/Legal Guardian -Completed Productivi ty Questionnaire
Duringthe first 24 months of participation in the study, Iif the infant's parent/legal 
guardian reports in one of the CHI questionnaires that the child is being treated b y a 
specialist or has had emergency  department visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213980], they  will be asked 
to complete the productivity  questionnaire.
Section 7.1., Data Handling Conventions
For this study , infantchilddata will be entered into [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003] defined eCRFs, 
transmitted electronically to [COMPANY_004]/[COMPANY_003], and combined with data provid ed from other 
sources e.g., data obtained directly from the parent/legal guardian via an electronic device 
provided b y the sponsor, its designated vendor, or the patient’s own devices using a 
secure and validated data sy stem. The RCC staff will enter data provided on paper into 
the specifically  designed eCRF pages.
Section 7.1.2., L oss to Follow -Up
InfantsChildren for whom follow -up information is never obtained will be considered 
lost to follow -up. These cases will be tallied in the applicable sections of the study

100Section 8.1., Hypotheses
The objective of the study is to describe the safet y and morbidity  and mortality  outcomes 
of infantschildren exposed to treatment during Phase III SPTL studies investigating 
retosiban or comparator for the treatment of SP TL. These mortality  and morbidity  
endpoints (as described in Section 6.2) will be descriptively  summarized.
Section 8.3.4., Interim Analysis
In the event of earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507814] y 
and/or lack of efficacy , infantschildren will continue to be followed until they  have 
reached 24 months corrected age for preterm infants and 24 months 5 years
chronological age for term infants.
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1., Outcomes
The primary  objective of the planned analy sis will be to u se descriptive statistics to 
describe the safet y and morbidity  and mortalit y outcomes of infants children exposed to 
treatment during the Phase III SPTL studies investigating retosiban or comparator for the 
treatment of SPTL . The endpoints to be descriptiv ely summarized are those described in 
Section 6.2 . Descriptive statistics will be calculated by  [CONTACT_507889], where appropriate.
For binary  outcomes, all summary  tables will include the number and percentage of 
subjects w ith the response/event. The associated 95% CI  will also be reported. For those 
endpoints that occur in more than 5 infantschildren or 1% of the infants children in any 
treatment group, odds ratios and associated 95% CIs will be calculated to compare 
retosiban to placebo, atosiban, and pooled comparator treatment groups. For continuous 
variables, all summary  tables will include: n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum. All summary  tables will include N for each group (i.e., the total 
numberof subjects randomized to each group within the appropriate population).
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of neurodevelopment in infantschildren 
exposed to retosiban or comparator, the proportion of infants children with at least 1 of 
the indicators of neurodevelopmental impairment (see Section 6.2.6) at the end of the 
study will be anal yzed using a logistic regression model. The model will use a logit link 
function to estimate the log odds of percentage of infants children with indicators of 
neurodevelopmental impairment. The model will include terms for treatment group. The 
number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group, the odds ratios of response 
rates (retosiban versus placebo, retosiban versus atosiban, and retosiban versus all
comparators) and the 95% CI s for the odds ratio of response rates and p values will be 
presented. The anal ysis may be repeated for each of the individual indicators of 
neurodevelopmental impairment. 2019N413355_00

101To further describe the infant safet y profile of retosib an, the following subgroups may  be 
explored:
Gestational age of pregnancy  at randomization
Established progesterone use (yes or no)
Magnesium sulfate use
Tocolytic use following study drug discontinuation
Maternal age
Region
For each subgroup, infant childsafety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_507902], as previousl y described. Full details of all planned anal yses will be provided in 
the RAP.
Section 9.2.1., Release of Participant Medical Information
In order to collect data from the participant’sHCPs, medical release forms for each 
clinician who will report data to the study  must be completed and signed by  [CONTACT_58076]’s 
child’sparent/legal guardian.
Section 9.2.2., Subject Confidentiality
Each participant’s identity will be known onl y to the thir d-party contractor, RCC -PIs, and 
relevant HCPs (e.g., pediatrician or specialist). InfantChildidentification numbers will 
be assigned and used to identify  study participants. The dataset used in the anal ysis of 
data will contain coded participant identif iers only.
Section 9.5., Study and RCC Site Closure
Recruitment in participating countries will begin with initiation of the Phase III SPTL 
treatment studies. Recruitment will continue until the Phase III SPTL treatment studies 
end recruitment. Follow -up will continue until each child enrolled completes the 5-year
24 month questionnaire at either 24 months corrected age (for preterm infants) or 
24months5 yearschronological age (for term infants) . Study close-out and final 
reporting activities will be initiated on completion of the follow -up on the last study  
participant.

103Protocol Amendment Number 0 2
Protocol Amendment Number 0 2is applicable to all RCC sites participating in this study . 
Protocol changes specified in Amendment Number 0 2are summarized as follows:
Reduction of study  duration from 5 y ears to 24 months due to:
‒Termination of the retosiban development program, such that there will be n o 
further in utero exposure to retosiban, and hence safet ydata from this ongoing 
study will not inform the potential risk for future use of retosiba n.
‒Low recruitment for interventional studies 200719 (NEWBORN -1) and 
200721 (ZINN) . Hence,the number of infants exposed to retosiban in utero 
and included in the cu rrent (200722) study  is small.
‒The independent d ata monitoring c ommittee (IDMC) recommendation that the 
neonatal follow -up be limited to 2 4monthsof age given no safety issues 
detected in their unblinded review of available 200722 data and also that 
statistical analy sis at a 5-year timepoint would not provide an y meaningful 
results due to the small number of enrolled subjects.
Reclassification of all resource utilization endpoints as exploratory  endpoints 
due to the reduced sample size
Correction of an err or in the mean BSID -III score for the cognitive impairment, 
fine motor and gross motor scales to <[ADDRESS_655249] that these are not composite 
scores
Incorporation of other administrative changes
Justification for the Reduction of the ARIOS S tudy Duration fr om [ADDRESS_655250] -marketing setting. In May 2017, the 
corresponding treatment trials 200719 (placebo comparison) and 200721 (atosiban 
comparison) were terminated early  due to poor recruitment thatmade completion of the 
trials unfeasi ble in a reasonable timeframe. The placebo- controlled trial enrolled on ly 
23of the target [ADDRESS_655251]-marketing setting for which there would be a need to inform potential risks. 2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
200722
104Due to the early termination of 200719 and 200721, the sample size of ARIOS is small 
with a total of 98 babies enrolled (6 placebo treated s ubjects from NB -1, 43 atosiban 
treated subjects from ZINN and 49 retosiban treated subjects from N EWBORN -1 and 
ZINN). This represents just 8% of the planned [ADDRESS_655252] 2018, the retosiban IDMC , composed of 1 pediatrician, 2 neonatologists , 
2maternal-fetal medicine specialists and a statistician, confirmed that there were no 
safety concerns identified following review of ZINN and NEWBORN- 1 clinical study  
reports as well as ARIOS adverse events (including congenital anomalies), 
neurodevelopment screening assessments (ASQ- 3, CBCL/1.5-5, and MCHAT -R/F), and 
neurodevelopment referrals, from an ARIOS data cut on 15 June 2018, with 34 out of a 
total of 98 babies having alread y completed 24monthsof safety follow-up. The IDMC 
also recommended that the neonatal follow -up be limited to 24 months of age given that 
thesmall number of enrolled sub jects, in particular placebo subjects for comparison, 
would not yieldmeaningfu l results. Twent y-four months, in the I DMC collective opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
would allow for detection of major neonatal adverse outcomes and safet y signals and as 
such would be sufficient, e specially considering that there will be no future development 
of retosiban.
Furthermore, 24- monthoutcomes are considered by [CONTACT_507903] (Marlow, 2014). [CONTACT_507910] ,who is an IDMC 
member, in collab oration with regulatory  agencies, has developed a manuscript (in press) 
that recommends that 24-monthfollow-up is appropriate for safet y follow-upin this 
population .
Reduction of the study  duration from [ADDRESS_655253] o f 
care as prescribed b y their pediatrician or health care provider following completion of 
the study. Therefore,there is no safet y risk to the neonate by [CONTACT_507904]-up period from 5 y ears to24 months.
Administrative changes
Otheradministrative changes were incorporated into this amendment . The rationale for 
these changes is to ensure a clear and complete protocol for use at the RCC sites .

106PROTOCOL SUMMARY, Rationale
The goal of this study  (ARIOS), therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban ([COMPANY_004]221149) or comparator in utero in the 
plannedPhaseIII SPTL treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not 
associated with significant adverse outcomes in early  childhood.
In May 2017, the corresponding treatment trials 200719 (NEWBORN -1, placebo 
comparison) and 200721 (ZINN, atosiban comparison) were terminated early due to 
poor recruitment and the length of time needed to complete the studies. The 
placebo-controlled trial enr olled only 23 of the target 900 participants over 
17months, and the atosiban comparator trial enrolled 97 of the target 
330 participants over 29 months. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal adverse events were 
no more common with retosiban than placebo or atosib an. The development 
program was subsequently terminated with no further in utero exposure of 
retosiban planned.
PROTOCOL SUMMARY, Objectives
Primary
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of infant and child morbidity  and 
mortality in infants and chi ldren exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of neurodevelopment in infants and 
children exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
Exploratory
To characterize parental productivity  loss related to a sick child and infant resource 
utilization in terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], length of stay , emergency  room/urgent 
care (ER/UC) visits, surgical procedures, and referral to specialt y care or therap y 
visits for infants (up to age 2 years) exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero
PROTOCOL SUMMARY, Study Design
Infants and children will be followed at prespecified intervals until they  have reached 
5years24monthschronological age.
The child’s parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete a Child Health I nventory 
(CHI) at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of the child’s chronological age and a 
modified CHI  at 3, 4, and 5 y ears of the child’s chronological age. The CHI questionnaire 
completed up to the [ADDRESS_655254] 24 months of participati on in the study , if the parent/legal guardian 
indicates that the infant has been treated b y specialists or has had ER/UC visits or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], he/she will be asked to complete a productivity  questionnaire to evaluate 
loss of parental productivity .
Ifat any of these time points a child has an M -CHAT-R/Fscore that indicates further 
evaluation is required and/or a CBCL /1.5–[ADDRESS_655255] for a fo rmal 
assessment.

Section 1.1, Background
Retosiban iswasbeing developed for the treatment of spontaneous preterm labor (SPTL ) 
in women with intact membranes. 2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_655262] Phase II clinical study  of retosiban in preterm labor 
(n=93) [Thornton, 2015; GlaxoSmithKline Document Number CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/ 0306].
The emerging safet yprofile for retosiban appears favorable. Results from 
protocol-specified maternal- fetal and neonatal safety  assessments were absent of any  
concerns and were similar between the retosiban and placebo groups. Furthermore, no 
clinically significant dispariti es in AEs were noted between groups [Thornton, 2015]. All 
reported AEs, whether maternal, fetal, or neonatal, were generally  consistent with those 
reported in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 
CM2006/[ZIP_CODE]/03], IB Supplement 1 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 
2015N228508_00], or in the study  population.
The Phase 3 program included 2 global blinded, randomized, controlled trials 
(200721 [ZINN] and 200719 [NEWBORN-1]) and a single infant follow -up trial 
(200722 [ARIOS] ). Eligible subjects were aged [ADDRESS_655263] membranes in spontaneous preterm labor at 240/7to 
336/7weeks’ gestation . ZINN (N=330) aimed to show superiority of retosiban (IV) 
overatosiban on time to delivery (first subject first visi t [FSFV] was March 2015). 
NEWBORN -1 (N=900) was designed to demonstrate neonatal benefit (based on a 
composite endpoint) as well as time to delivery or time to treatment failure over 
placebo (FSFV February 2016). The intervention trials were terminated early on 
[ADDRESS_655264] visit (LSLV) was 24 July2017 for 
NEWBORN -1 and 25 August2017 for ZINN. Meaningful analyses of these 
well-controlled trials could not be performed due to small numbers of completing 
participants. Mean time to delivery or treatment failure in the placebo- controlled 
trial was 18.9 days with retosiban (n=10) versus 11.1 days with placebo (n=13). Two 
neonates in the retosiban and 4in the placebo group had ≥1 component of the 
neonatal composite endpoint. The adjusted mean time to delivery in the atosiban 
comparator trial was 32.51 days with retosiban (n=50) compared with 33.71 days 
with atosiban (n=47; P>0.05). Maternal, fetal, and neonatal AE s were no more 
common with retosiban than placebo or atosiban.

The goal of this s tudy (ARIOS), therefore, is to assess the safet y and outcomes of infants 
and children who were exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero in the planned
PhaseIII SPTL treatment studies and provide assurance that treatment is not associated 
with significa nt adverse outcomes in earl y childhood.

SignificanceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Retosiban [e.g., [COMPANY_004]221149]
Fetal exposure 
through placental 
transferPreclinical data indicate very minimal, if 
any, maternal central ne rvous system 
(CNS) penetration or placental transfer 
of retosiban as supported by [CONTACT_14504]: 
In pregnant monkeys there was no 
detectable retosiban in the cord 
blood when mothers were dosed up 
to 100 mg/kg (approximately 
7times the human exposure). 
However, approximately 4% of 
circulating drug was detected in the 
cord blood when mothers were 
dosed at 300 mg/kg (approximately 
24-fold the human exposure).
Retosiban is a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein and breast cancer 
resistant protein transporters, which 
are thought to play a role in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_507838], thereby [CONTACT_507896].
In reproductive toxicology studies in 
pregnant monkeys, there were no 
adverse mother and infant 
behavioral or locomoto r effects 
observed that were suggestive of 
CNS toxicity. 
In rodent neurobehavioral safety 
studies, there were no adverse 
clinical signs observed at doses up 
to 1000 mg/kg.Analysis of maternal blood and cord 
blood samples will be was performed to 
test fo r levels of retosiban in women 
who deliver delivered at an 
investigative center within 12 hours of 
the completion of study treatment 
infusion as part of the Phase III SPTL 
treatment studies.
Surveillance for signals indicating 
adverse fetal or neonatal eff ects with 
inutero exposure to retosiban will be 
performed throughout this study.
Infants exposed to retosiban in utero 
will be followed for up to 5 years
24months in this study to assess 
safety and neurodevelopmental 
outcomes. 2019N413355_00

For both N EWBORN -[ADDRESS_655267] samples were 
collected wit hin NEWBORN -1 
(3placebo: 1 retosiban) and 27 
within ZINN (12 retosiban: 15 
atosiban). Within both studies, only 
1cord blood sample tested positive 
for retosiban at a concentration of 
1.9 µg/L. The 1.9 µg/L is 
approximately 0.006x to 0.01x the 
cord blood concentrations that were 
observed in the pregnant monkey 
toxicity studies (cord blood 
concentrations = 159 to 313 µg/L). 
There were no adverse effects 
observed in the offspring in monkey 
studies, where growth and 
development included a full 
assessment of reflexive behaviors, 
infant ECG and blood chemistry were 
analyzed. Furthermore, a rat post -

Clinical 
SignificanceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Retosiban [e.g., [COMPANY_004]221149]
Neonatal exposure 
via breast milkWhile there are no clinical data on the 
degree of retosiban transfer into breast 
milk, the available data based on 
physiochemical properties suggest 
retosiban will be excreted into breast 
milk if dosed close to or during the time 
of milk production. Given the rapid 
clearance of retosiban, the risk for 
neonatal drug exposure via breast milk 
appears low but could occur in t he 
situation where the infant is fed breast 
milk/colostrum produced within 
12hours of treatment. Since 
lactogenesis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_507839] 30 to 
48 hours postpartum in mothers going 
to term (and is further delayed in 
mothers who deliver preterm), it seems 
unlikely that any drug would be in the 
plasma postpartum to transfer into the 
milk.Breast milk/colostrum samples will be

114Potential Risk of 
Clinical 
SignificanceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Retosiban [e.g., [COMPANY_004]221149]
Positive breast milk samples were 
detected within 1maternal subject in 
NEWBORN -[ADDRESS_655271] concentration being 
0.36 µg/L. Assuming a standardized 
milk consumption of 0.150 L/kg/day 
(the mean milk intake of a fully 
breast -fed 2 -month old infant [Begg, 
1999; Bennett, 1988; Hagg, 2000; 
Kristensen, 1999]), the worst- case 
dose of retosiban that a breast- fed 
child would be exposed to is 0.54 
µg/kg/day (3.6 µg/L x 0.15 L/kg/day). 
This is approximately 0.5% of the 
human dose. This is the worst- case 
scenario beca use the mother is not 
being administered retosiban post -
partum during the lactation period, 
and retosiban is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] ,
which would rapi[INVESTIGATOR_507861]. Furthermore, based 
on body surface area ,this potential 
infant dose is greater than [ADDRESS_655272] -natal 
development study (rat post -natal 
develo pment study NOAEL = 
30mg/kg/day; human equivalent 
dose = 4800 µg/kg/day ). The 
potential lactational dose of 
retosiban that would therefore pose 
any significant risk to a newborn is 
negligible.

Section 1.3.2, Benefit Assessment
Given the inverse relationship between the risks for prematurit y complications and 
gestational age at birth, the development of a treatment that significantl y prolongs 
pregnancy  in women with SPTL  would be invaluable if associated with improved 
perinatal outcomes. Results from the Phase II study  OTA105256 offer hope that retosiban 
may prolong pregnancy  to such a degree that perinatal outcomes could be favorabl y 
affected [ Thornton, 2015].There are currentl y no safet y findings that would preclude  2019N413355_00
2014N194466_02 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_655273] of care treatments in women with an uncomplicated, singleton 
pregnancy However, the results from the Phase III interventional studies did not 
provide compel ling evidence that retosiban could prolong time to delivery of 
retosiban relative to placebo or atosiban, but because of the low enrollment 
numbers and inadequate statistical power, results should be interpreted with 
caution.
The benefit to infants and chi ldren participating in this study  is the focus on following 
morbidity  and neurodevelopment for up to 5years24monthsfollowing exposure to 
retosiban or comparator medication.

Section 6.3.1, Parent/Legal Guardian -Completed Productivity Questionna ire
During the first 24 months of participation in the study , if the infant's parent/legal 
guardian reports in one of the CHI questionnaires that the child is being treated b y a 
specialist or has had emergency  department visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], they  will be asked 
to complete the productivity  questionnaire.
Section 8.1, Hypotheses
If deemed appropriate, point estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
may be calculated for the comparison of retosiban to placebo and retosiban to atosiban 
for some safet y endpoints. No type I error adjustments are planned.
Section 8.2.1, Sample Size Assumptions
The sample size for this study  will depend on the total number of subjects enrolled in the 
Phase III SPTL treatment studies. AtIn May 2017 , thetime of protocol publishing , 
2 Phase III SPTL treatment studies are planned that will enroll at total of approximately  
1100 mothers. However, were terminated early due to the number feasibility of studies 
and/or size of recruiting the studies may change depending on in a timely manner, 
meaning that theoutcome of the first planned Phase III SPTL treatment study , such that 
the total number of mothers enrolled could be size of these studies was lower or higher
than currently  planned. originally planned. This has resu lted in a greatly reduced 
sample size for this study.
Section 8.3.1, Analysis Populations
The primary  population for safet y assessment will be all infants whose mothers have 
been randomized and received retosiban or comparator in any of the Phase III 
treatment trials. Of these mothers, the infant safety population includes the 
mother/infant pairs who enrolled into the study with at least 1 observation , the 
mother/infant pairs who decline to consent to the study, and the mother/infant pairs 
whose fetus/neona tes/infants died prior to the enrollment of the study . Subjects will 
be analyzed according to their actual treatment in case this differs from their randomized 
treatment. All analyses will be based on the primary  population dataset. 2019N413355_00

130Section 8.3.4, Interim Analysis
In the event of earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507814] y 
and/or lack of efficacy , children will continue to be followed until they  have reached 
5years24monthschronological age. 
For any subject for which the CHIquestionnaire at 3, 4, and 5 years of the child’s 
chronological age was completed prior to Amendment 2, data will be reported.
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1, Outcomes
For binary  outcomes, all summary  tables will include the number and percentage of 
subjects with the response/event . The associated 95% CI  will also be reported. For those 
endpoints that occur in more than 5 children or 1% of the children in an y treatment 
group, odds ratios and associated 95% CIs will be calculated to compare retosiban to 
placebo, atosiban, and pooled comparator treatment groups. For continuous variables, all 
summary tables will include: n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and 
maximum. All summary  tables will include N for each group (i.e., the total number of 
subjects randomized t o each group within the appropriate population).
To characterize the clinical safet y in terms of neurodevelopment in children exposed to 
retosiban or comparator, the proportion of children with at least 1 of the indicators of 
neurodevelopmental impairment (see Section 6.2.6) at the end of the study  will be 
analyzed using a logistic regression model. The model will use a logit link function to 
estimate the log odds of percentage of children with indicators of neurodevelopmental 
impairment. The model will inc lude terms for treatment group. The number and 
percentage of subjects in each treatment group, the odds ratios of response rates 
(retosiban versus placebo, retosiban versus atosiban, and retosiban versus all 
comparators) and the 95% CI s for the odds ratio of response rates and p values will be 
presented. The anal ysis may be repeated for each of the individual indicators of 
neurodevelopmental impairment.
To further describe the infant safet y profile of retosiban, the following subgroups may  be 
explored:
Gestational age of pregnancy  at randomization
Established progesterone use (y es or no)
Magnesium sulfate use
Tocolytic use following study  drug discontinuation
Maternal age
Region
For each subgroup, child safet y data will be summarized by [CONTACT_507907] p, as 
previously  described. Full details of all planned analy ses will be provided in the RAP. 2019N413355_00

131Section [IP_ADDRESS], Health Outcomes Analyses
The primaryobjective of the exploratory planned anal ysis will be to use descriptive 
statisticsisto characterize reso urce utilization in infants exposed to retosiban or 
comparator in the Phase III SPTL treatment studies. The Exploratory endpoints to be 
descriptivel y summarized are those described in Section 6.[ADDRESS_655294] privacy  
requirements, and the ethical principles th at are outlined in the current version of the
Declaration of Helsinki 2008, including, but not limited to:

Follow-up will continue until each child enrolled completes the 5-year questionnaire at 
5years chronological age.24-month questionnaire at [ADDRESS_655295] 
completed the 24 months assessments will not be required to complete the CHI 
questionnaire at 3, 4, and 5 years of the child’s chronological age.

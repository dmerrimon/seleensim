Study Title  
 
5-Cog Battery to  improve detection  of cognitive  impairment and  dementia  
 
Objectives  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_786216], cognitive impairment 
related to dementia is frequently under -diagnosed in primary care settings, and is a more 
prevalent problem among older African- Ameri cans and Hispanics than among older 
whites. To overcome the technical, cultural and logistic barriers of current cognitive screens and dementia care in primary care settings we propose to validate a 5 -minute 
cognitive screen (5- Cog) coupled with a decision tree to identify persons at high risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_786217] -ethnic primary care populations with socio- economic 
challenges. The primary objective is to test the ability of the 5 -Cog battery and decision 
tree paradigm  to improve  dementia  care in primary  care patients  with cognitive  concerns.  
The 5 -Cog battery includes the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_786218] (PMIS),
1 
Motoric  Cognitive  Risk Syndrome  (MCR)  diagnosis,2-[ADDRESS_1081373] (Symbol Match). Our cognitive assess ment algorithm will sort patients with 
‘cognitive impairment’ from those with ‘no cognitive impairment’. Moreover, it is coupled with a decision tree to guide clinicians through the follow up on any 5- Cog 
results.  
 
Design  and Outcomes  
We propose  to conduct  a single -blind randomized  clinical  trial (RCT)  in 1,200 primary 
care patients age 65 and older presenting with cognitive complaints. Non- medical 
professionals  will administer  the 5-Cog in the intervention group and a 5-minute  health 
literacy and gr ip strength assessment in the active control group.  
 
Interventions  
The interventions will be given after randomization and before the patients sees the 
physician. After completing the intervention or control assessments, the tester will 
provide  results  to the treating  physician with follow -up recommendations  based  on the 
decision tree.  
 
Participants  randomized  to the active  control  will receive a health  literacy  questionnaire, 
the Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL) and grip strength assessment to match time (5 minutes), tester exposure and decision tree procedure in the 5- Cog arm. To 
parallel the study procedures and flow in the 5 -Cog arm, a decision tree for the active 
control arm will also be created. Results of the control screen and the decision tree will be presented to the physicians at the same visit.

 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary  Objective  
The 5-Cog battery  and decision tree will improve dementia  care in primary  care settings  for 
patients with cognitive concerns. Improved dementia care will be measured by [CONTACT_786240] (MCI) or dementia diagnoses, laboratory investigations to rule out reversible causes  of cognitive impairment, new dementia medication prescriptions, 
and specialist referrals for dementia care, and will be tracked using the electronic medical 
record (EMR) system.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
Utilization (emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) for patients in both arms will be 
tracked  and reviewed  at regular  intervals  throughout the study period. Utilization  is defined 
in terms of specialty visits, emergency room visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s up to 12 months 
following the screening visit. This will be tracked via the EMR in both groups. 
 
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Background  
Cognitive impairment related to dementia is frequently under -diagnosed in primary care 
settings despi[INVESTIGATOR_786222].5-7 Missed detection delays 
treatment of reversible conditions as well as provision of support services and critical 
planning.8 This problem is more  prevalent  among older African -Americans  and Hispanics 
than among older whites.5-7 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_786223] (PMIS): A major limiting factor in identifying 
dementia in health disparate populations are the l ack of cognitive screens that account for 
cultural differences and variable literacy rates. Also,  many cognitive screens are lengthy 
and not designed for non- specialist use, limiting their application in primary care. The 
Memory Impairment Screen (MIS) is a brief, [ADDRESS_1081376] can be given as an interference task,  which  prevents patients  from  using strategies  such as mentally  rehearsing 
items  that may lead to false negative ‘normal’ performance.  In the 5-Cog, we will fill the 2- 
minute interference period with the MCR diagnosis and paper- based Symbol Match Test.  
We developed highly reliable alternate forms of the PMIS, which enable repeated administration.
12 Professionals and non-professionals (health aides with 10 years 
schooling) successfully  administered  the PMIS  in rural  and urban populations in India and 
[LOCATION_003].13, 14  High inter -rater reliability was seen between administration of PMIS by 
[CONTACT_786241].15 The PMIS pi[INVESTIGATOR_786224] a computer screen  
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/2022  
10 5-Cog UH3 Protocol, Version 1.5  
 and using cards.16 These findings  support  the feasibility  of using  the PMIS  in various 
settings and by [CONTACT_786242].  
 
Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR): Many pre -dementia syndromes based on 
cognitive tests or biomarkers have been proposed17, [ADDRESS_1081377] examination limits feasibility in resource - 
poor primary  care settings.  Increasingly, the simultaneous  existence of motor  and cognitive 
impairments has been recognized as an important clinical marker of brain pathologies. 
Hence, incorporating measures of motor function (gait speed) into dementia risk assessments may improve predictive power.
19 We described the MCR syndrome; 
chara cterized by [CONTACT_786243].4, 20  The MCR criteria are similar to 
those used for Mild Cognitive Impairment syndrome (MCI).21, [ADDRESS_1081378] criterion in MCI with gait speed in MCR, but retain the remaining MCI criteria (cognitive complaints and absence of dementia). MCR diagnosis is easy to 
implement  because  it only requires  verification  of cognitive  complaints  and a stopwatch to 
measure gait speed over a fixed distance . 
In a multi- country study of over 26,000 persons aged 60 and older, MCR affected 1 in 10 
participants.
20 Advancing age was associated with MCR but there were no sex differences 
in prevalence.  Participants  with MCR  had a higher  disease burden and performed  worse  on 
cognitive tests than non- MCR participants.20 MCR was associated with a 70% increased 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_786225]  (on MMSE).[ADDRESS_1081379] even when the analysis was restricted to cognitively healt hy adults 
(Mini -Mental State Examination scores ≥28), supporting MCR as a very early clinical 
marker of cognitive decline.20 MCR diagnosis in older adults was associated with deficits 
in executive function, attention and language as well as overall cogniti ve status.23 In 4 
longitudinal cohort studies, participants with MCR were twice as likely to develop 
dementia, and were at 2.2 times the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_6237]’s disease specifically.20, 
24, 25  MCR predicted dementia with greater accuracy than its in dividual components of 
either slow gait or subjective cognitive complaints.20 Because MCR is diagnosed 
independently of cognitive  tests,  we avoid redundancy (diagnostic  circularity)  by [CONTACT_786244] -dementia and dementia syndr omes. In our multi -country 
study, clinical overlap between MCR and MCI cases was only 39%; indicating that the 
presence of either syndrome alone failed to identify a large pool of at -risk seniors.[ADDRESS_1081380]: Match is a tablet -based test of executive functions and 
speed  developed by [CONTACT_786245]  (UCSF).  Our team 
has created a paper -based version of the Symbol Match stimuli to act as a screening tool

disparate populations. Notably, we developed the PMIS,  which  is a brief  cognitive screener 
that relies on culture fair pi[INVESTIGATOR_786226] a medical professional.
1 The PMIS demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99% for 
detecting dementia in a low -literacy population in India.[ADDRESS_1081382] -line assays that can be followed up with more thorough and complex 
cognitive testing.

Building on our work, we propose to validate  a 5-minute  screen  (5-Cog) to identify  persons 
with or at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_6124], and to flag them for further evaluation. We propose to do this in multi-ethnic Bronx primary care populations with socio- economic 
challenges. The [ADDRESS_1081383], Symbol Match. 
 
The 5 -Cog will sort out patients with or at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ‘cognitive impairment’ 
from those with ‘no cognitive impairment’.  The 5 -Cog battery will overcome many of the 
implementation  barriers of previous cognitive screens;
13, 29, [ADDRESS_1081384], easy 
to implement (requires only pen, paper and stopwatch), administered by [CONTACT_105]- clinicians 
(research assistants) after minimal training, not educationally or culturally biased, not confounded by [CONTACT_786246]. 
 
[ADDRESS_1081385] to validate the 5-Cog battery and decision tree (Fig. 1). The trial will span 42 months and involve an ethnically diverse Bronx primary care population of 1,200 older patients  with cognitive concerns  (Fig.  2). We chose an active 
control (health literacy and grip) to balance time and tester exposure in the 5-Cog group. 
Our primary outcome is improved dementia care, which is an outcome that infor ms health 
decisions and is valued by [CONTACT_437263], older patients and their caregivers. We bring together an inter-disciplinary team  with major  aging and clinical  trial experience.  We 
have developed partnerships with clinicians in our primary ca re clinic site.  
 
Design  considerations:  We will take a pragmatic,  real world  approach  in our trial.  We will 
not ask physicians to deny patients any procedures offered routinely. For instance, clinicians  have access  to the PMIS  and other cognitive screeners  (not included in  the 5-Cog 
screen) in our EMR. We will not ask clinicians to avoid using these screeners in enrolled patients. But we will track cognitive screener use by [CONTACT_786247] 5-Cog arms via the EMR.  We hypothesize that time constraints and other barriers  as well as the absence 
of the MCR and Symbol Match procedure in the EMR will limit use and efficacy of cognitive screeners by [CONTACT_200791]. The proportion of older women is higher than men in our clinics and aging studies.
3, 14, 31  Consistent with our pragmatic approach, 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/2022  
12 5-Cog UH3 Protocol, Version 1.5  
 we will not strive  for equal  sex distribution  within  a study arm, but balance sex  distribution 
by [CONTACT_786248] a stratification variable. There is no trial design without weakness 
and we will clearly state these in any publications.  
 
Recruitment: We will enroll 1,200 older patients with cognitive concerns (reported by [CONTACT_786249]) over 30 months; estimated enrollment  rate is 8-10 per 
week.  This enrollment  rate 
conservatively assumes a  
>50% refusal rate from potentially eligible participants. Our enrollment  rate in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_786227] 6 -8 per 
week when participants were asked to complete a longer battery of assessments. While we anticipate that many 
potential participants may be attending our primary care clinics for their Medicare Annual  Wellness 
visit,
12 we will a lso recruit 
patients attending the clinics for other medical reasons. Montefiore Medical  Center  is the main 
healthcare system for  
Bronx county;  one of the most  ethnically  diverse  communities  in the nation with an elderly 
population of 140,000 (U.S. census data). Patients age 65 and older account for >20,000 primary care visits at Montefiore annually; ensuring an adequate pool for recruitment. The non-clinician tester will approach all patients age [ADDRESS_1081386] will be screened at the same visit to determine 
eligibility. Information regarding demographics, socio- economic status and medical 
illnesses will be collected.  
 
Primary Outcome: Our primary outcome is improved dementia care. This outcome is collected  prospectively from  EMR  and related  medical  records  by [CONTACT_603387]  (blinded to 
study arm allocation and test results), and do not require patient interviews. This primary outcome is defined as meeting any one of the following endpoints within 90 days of the clinic visit at which the patient was randomized. Similar composite endpoints to define  

IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081387]  been  used in several  prior clinical  trials  in cognitively impaired 
patients.32-36 
1. New  diagnosis  of dementia (relevant  ICD -10 codes)  or MCI  (331.83)  documented  in the 
EMR. The recent DSM -V criteria37 include categories of ‘major neurocognitive 
disorder’ and ‘mild neurocognitive disorder,’ which overlap with dementia and MCI. 
These categories will also be included but a recent internal audit indicated that they are 
as yet not in widespread use in our pr imary care clinics (cf. specialty clinics).  
2. Tests ordered for reversible causes of cognitive impairment as recommended by [CONTACT_786250]  (e.g. thyroid function tests,  B-[ADDRESS_1081388] 
or MRI scans).15, 38 -41 
3. New  prescripti ons for dementia  medications  in EMR.  
4. Referral  for cognitive/dementia  evaluation  by [CONTACT_577530]  (Neurology, Geriatrics  or 
Psychiatry) in EMR. 
 
Secondary/exploratory outcomes : Health care utilization data ( secondary outcome ) is 
abstracted  from  EMR.  Additiona l tests (described  below)  take approximately  60 minutes  of 
participants’ time. To avoid interrupting clinic flow, these tests will be done at the same visit as the enrollment, but after the patient sees their clinician. These tests are exploratory outcomes used to generate new hypotheses or provide insights int o 5-Cog efficacy.  
 
a) Health care utilization (secondary outcome). Utilization (emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602])  for patients  in both arms  will be tracked  up to [ADDRESS_1081389] in our institution. All visit notes and diagnoses are to be entered within 48 hours of the encounter. A series of electronic reminders is sent to clinicians to complete delinquent entries. Patients in both arms will be covered by [CONTACT_786251] -for-service Medicare 
beneficiaries attributed to the Montefiore Next Generation Accountable Care Organization.
42-44 Montefiore either processes or has access to claims data for these 
patients, enabling analysis of encounters and costs through the Montefiore EMR and reports received monthly from CMS. The detailed claims -level data will allow for 
tracking and analysis of the utilization of numerous healthcare services. A significant amount of data on care and services that patients receive from p roviders outside of 
Montefiore will also be available for inclusion in our analyses.  
b) Neuropsychological  Battery  (exploratory  outcome):  The battery  will take 60 minutes 
to complete and will include the measures below (Table 1). The tests are selected from those used for diagnostic testing in our dementia clinic, and with established norms for 
different ethnic groups and educational levels.
[ADDRESS_1081390]. 
Weiss (Cognitive Core); blinded to 5- Cog results. The battery is administered in 
English or Spanish to probe general mental status (MoCA) as well as specific cognitive domains, particularly memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -R
45), processing speed 
(Symbol Digit Modalities Test46), language (letter fluency,47, 48  category fluency,48 
[LOCATION_011] Naming Test48), and visuo- spatial abilities (clock drawing12).49For ethical 
reasons, if results from the neuropsychological testing are in the dementia range, [CONTACT_174983] will inform the treating physician after the 90- day window to determine  
improved dementia care outcomes.

or Alzheimer’s  Association  or having health  care proxies or living  wills  recorded  in the 
EMR.  
 
4 SELECTION  AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
Our target population is seniors with cognitive concerns in primary care clinics. While we 
anticipate that many potential participants might be attending Medicare A nnual Wellness 
visit,  we will also recruit  eligible  patients  who will be attending the primary  care clinic  for

Recruitment, enrollment, and participation of participants in this project are not limited by 
[CONTACT_547], skin color, racial/ethnic  group, or economic  status.  We will monitor  recruitment  and 
retention patterns to ensure adequate representation of women and minorities. Since this study focuses exclusively on geriatric syndromes, it will not include children. 
 
4.3 Study  Enrollment  Procedures  
Potential participants may be referred by [CONTACT_786253]- clinician research 
assistant  (RA) by a message sent in the EMR,  a phone  call to the RA or by [CONTACT_786254]. Once a referral is received the RA will review the patient’s electronic medical  records  or medical  chart  to determine  their eligibility  for participation  based  on the 
criteria above. Next, they will locate the patient within the clinic by  [CONTACT_786255].  
 
Potential participants may also be identified by [CONTACT_786256]. The RA will review all patients’ charts that are ≥65 years and older with an  appointment at the clinic that day to determine their eligibility 
based  on the criteria  described  above. Next,  they will locate the patient  within  the clinic  by 
[CONTACT_786257].  
 
After identifying the patient referred by a clinic staff member the RA will confirm the cognitive  complaint.  Before  offering  a patient  enrollment  in the study, the RA will ensure 
that they (or their family member or friend, or a clinic staff member) have a cognitive complaint or concern about them. This information will be recorded in the database.  
 
If the potential participant was identified by [CONTACT_786258] e and 
determined  to be eligible  based  on criteria  from  the EMR,  the RA will greet  the patient  and 
say “I am X, and I am a RA. We are conducting a research study here at the clinic.” The RA will give a study flyer to the potential participant and say, “Woul d you mind please 
reviewing this flyer and answering the questions on it? I will give you a few minutes, and will come back to review it with you. Do you have any questions, or problems reviewing  
 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140

16 5-Cog UH3 Protocol, Version 1.5  
 this flyer?” If the patient  is there with family  or friends,  the RA can encourage the patient 
to let their family or friend review it with them if they are comfortable.  
 
If the patient  says or marks  “Yes” to either  of the questions on the flyer  OR was referred  to 
you by [CONTACT_786259], say, “It looks 
like you may be eligible for our study. We are conducting a research study to validate a new cognitive screening tool. If you are interested in participating in the study, I will ask you to complete some tasks that involve memory, health and mobility. You will receive a total of $10 for completing  the 5- minute  assessment  before  seeing  your doctor. In addition, 
to the 5- minute assessment before seeing your doctor, if you are interested in completing a 
60-minute cognitive assessment after you see you doctor we will pay you an additional $10. Are you interested in participating?”  
 
Those expressing interest  should be invited  to come to the research  office to complete  the 
informed consent, randomization and the assessments. 
 
COVID-19 amendment  to enrollment  and recruitment  procedures:  In response to the 
COVID-[ADDRESS_1081391] informed consent (see section 6.2 for details). The RA will ask the same questions as are on the flyer t o potential participants 
over the telephone on the day before their appointment. 
 
In a case where the patient was identified  to the RA by a clinic  staff member  or physician, 
the RA will screen them for eligibility through their medical chart and if they ha ve an 
appointment scheduled, they will reach out to the patient on the day before their appointment to tell them  about the study, screen  and conduct the verbal  informed consent. 
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
5.1 Interventions  & Administration  
Intervention arm (5 -Cog): The [ADDRESS_1081392]. The 5-Cog battery will be 
given after randomization and before the patients sees the physician. After completing the 5-Cog screening,  the tester  will send a message through the EMR  system  to provide 5-Cog 
results and a decision tree to the treating physician. The cognitive assessment algorithm will sort patients with ‘cognitive impairment’ from those with ‘no cognitive impairment’.  
 
Active control:  Participants  randomized  to the active control will receive a health  literacy 
questionnaire and grip strength assessment  to match  time (5 minutes),  tester  exposure, and 
gait assessment procedure in the 5 -Cog arm. The Short Assessment of Health Literacy 
(SAHL) has comparable tests in English and Spanish, with good reliability and validity. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081393] term are presented. This tests the participant’s  comprehension as well as pronunciation of health -related  terms.  The 
test takes 3 minutes and requires minimal training. Grip strength is measured in dominant hand with a Jamar  handgrip dynamometer.
50-52 Grip strength is a validated  health  indicator 
in aging.50-52 Low grip strength is a component of frailty definitions and predicts 
disability.50-52 To parallel the study procedures and flow in the 5- Cog arm, a decision tree 
will be created. Results and the decision tree will be sent to the physicians through the EMR system at the same visit.  
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
The tester  will obtain informed  consent, prior  to randomizing patients  to either  the 5-Cog or 
control interventions. We will follow the example of other pragmatic clinical trials of dementia screening in primary care clinics
53 by [CONTACT_786260]. This will minimize effects of unmeasured case mix 
differences and clinic- level clustering. As noted by [CONTACT_314095] ,53 the risk for “spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036] ” 
from having participating primary care clinics treat both intervention and usual -care 
patients is likely to be small given low levels of dementia detection.[ADDRESS_1081394]. Wang 
(Statistics Core) will computer -generate a randomized block design which will be used to 
assign study identification numbers and place patients into either 5- Cog or control groups.  
 
The IRB  requires  us to disclose  the tests to participants  in both study arms;  therefore,  it is 
not feasible to blind patients.  Participants  and the RA who carries  out the 5-Cog or health 
literacy and grip strength assessments are not blinded to group assignment. However, 
investigators, data analysts collecting outcome data of improved dementia care, and the 
statistician remain blinded to individual assignments.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1081395]  access  to the PMIS  and other  cognitive  screeners  in the EMR.  We will 
not ask clinicians  to avoid using these screeners  in enrolled patients. But we will track 
cognitive screener use by [CONTACT_786247] 5- Cog arms via the EMR.

 5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Our primary outcome is based on information from EMR on Bronx- based patients 
receiving primary care in our institution. This will minimize missing data issues. We will 
aggressively implement data management processes (supervised by [CONTACT_786261]). The goals of data management  are to ensure (a) data collected  during the study are properly and 
accurately entered and documented, (b) data are stored in an electronic format that allows easy retrieval and exportation, and c) participant confidentiality. The study programmer in collaboration with the statistician manages the data. They will work with other Data and Statistical Core team members to correct identified issues and conduct quality audits of database.  
 
We realize that not all patients will complete all of the additional tests for exploratory outcomes. However, our sample of 1,[ADDRESS_1081396] sensitivity  analyses  for exploratory outcomes even  assuming a refusal  rate of 50% for some 
or all of these additional tests used for secondary and exploratory outcomes.

6.2 Description  of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation  
The RA will review  all patients’  charts  that are ≥[ADDRESS_1081397] an 
appointment on the following  day and describe the study to them  and ask them  if they 
would be interested in participating. If interested, the RA will confirm the cognitive 
complaint. Before offering a patient enrollment in the study, the RA will ensure tha t 
they (or their family member or friend, or a clinic staff member) have endorsed a cognitive complaint or expressed concern about them. 
 
Consenting Procedure  
Those with cognitive complaints, expressing interest in the study will be invited to participate at  their appointment on the following day. Consent will be obtained from 
participants through a verbal consent process prior to enrollment. The non- clinician 
tester  will obtain verbal  consent over the telephone prior to the patient  coming to the 
clinic  for their appointment when  they will also be randomized  and receive the study 
assessments.  
 
The consent script describes the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy of the script c an be given to each 
participant  and this fact will be documented in the participant’s  record.  Language in the 
consent form  will describe data sharing. For example,  “We will store  information about 
you in a “bank”, which is a library of information from many studies. This information cannot be linked to you. In the future, researchers can apply for permission to use the information for new studies to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. Your information may be kept for a long time, perhaps longer than 50 years. If you agree to the future use, some of your de-identified health information (not linked to you) may be placed into one or more scientific databases. These may include databases maintained by [CONTACT_48160].” 
6.2.2 Randomization & Assessments  
Randomization  
The tester will obtain informed consent, prior to randomizing patients to either the 5- Cog or control interventions. We will follow the example of other pragmatic clinical trials  of demen tia screening  in primary  care clinics
53 by [CONTACT_786262].  This will minimize  effects  of unmeasured 
case mix differences and clinic-level clustering. As noted by [CONTACT_314095],53 the risk for 
“spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036] ” from having participating primary care clinics treat both intervention and 
usual- care patients is likely to be small given low levels of dementia detection.54 The 
patient -based randomization should conservatively bias results in favor of usual care. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081398]. Wang (Statistics Core) will computer -generate a randomized block design which 
will be used to assign study identification numbers and place patients into either 5-Cog 
or control groups. Patients  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_25890] (< or >75  years).  Briefly, 
an encrypted file containing the group assignment is prepared for each study identification number. The file is stored in RedCap the database program used for this trial. The assignments are presented to the RA in sequential order at the time the participant is enrolled, following  the eligibility  assessment,  and administer  the indicated 
screen. Participants and the RA who administers the tests are not blinded to group assignment. However, investigators, data analysts collecting outcome data, and the statistician remain blinded to individual assignments.  
 
Assessments  
Intervention arm (5-Cog): This simple, [ADDRESS_1081399]. Our cognitive assessment algorithm will sort patients with or at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ‘cognitive impairment’ from those with ‘no cognitive impairme nt’. 
Moreover, it is coupled with a decision tree to guide clinicians through the necessary steps to follow up on 5- Cog results. Because primary care clinicians and staff may not 
have the time to complete even a 5 -minute screen,
12, 15, 16  non-clinicians (RAs) will 
administer  the 5-Cog and communicate  the results  to primary  care physicians for further 
action.  
 
Active control:  Participants randomized to the active control will receive a health 
literacy questionnaire and grip strength assessment to match the t ime (~5 minutes), 
tester exposure, and gait assessment procedure in the 5-Cog arm. The SAHL has comparable  tests in English (SAHL -E) and Spanish (SAHL -S), with good reliability  and 
validity in both languages. Participants are presented with [ADDRESS_1081400] term is presented. This tests  the participant’s  comprehension as well  as pronunciation of 
health -related terms. The test takes 3 minutes to complete and requires minimal 
training. Grip strength is measured in dominant hand with a Jamar handgrip dynamometer.
50-52 Grip strength is a validated health indicator in aging.50-52 Low g rip 
strength is a component of frailty definitions and predicts disability.50-52 To parallel the 
study procedures and flow in the 5- Cog arm, a decision tree will be created. Results  and 
the decision tree will be presented to the physicians at the same visi t. 
 
Additional Assessments: In order to avoid interrupting the normal clinic flow, these 
additional assessments,  which  will be used  as covariates  or exploratory outcomes  in our 
analyses, will be done following the clinician’s assessment of the patient. The se 
exploratory measures  will help us generate and test new hypothesis and provide insights 
into the effects of the 5- Cog battery. We realize that not all patients will be able to 
complete part or all of the tests due to other commitments. Nonetheless, our overall sample size of 1,200 participants provides a sufficient pool assuming a non-completion rate of 50%.

6.2.3 Outcome assessment  
Our primary outcome is improved dementia care. This outcome is collected 
prospectively from EMR and related medical records by [CONTACT_786263].  This primary  outcome is defined  as meeting  any one of the 
following endpoints within 90 days of the clinic visit at which the patient was randomized.  
1. New diagnosis of dementia (relevant ICD -10 codes) or MCI (331.83) 
documented in the EMR. The recent DSM- V criteria
37 include categories of 
‘major neurocognitive disorder’ and ‘mild neurocognitive disorder,’ which overlap with dementia and MCI. These categories will also be included but a recent  internal  audit indicated  that they are as yet not in widespread  use in our 
primary care clinics (cf. specialty clinics).  
2. Tests  ordered  for reversible  causes  of cognitive impairment as  recommended  by 
[CONTACT_786264]  (e.g. thyroid function tests,  B- 
[ADDRESS_1081401] or MRI scans).

 7.2 Methods  and Timing  for Assessing , Recording,  and Analyzing Safety  Parameters  
 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject,  including any abnormal  sign (for example,  abnormal physical exam  or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. AEs encompass both physical and/or psychological harms. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):  An adverse event  that meets  any of the following 
criteria:  
• Results  in death 
• Is life threatening, or places  the participant at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
event as it occurred  
• Requires  prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes  persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity  
• Is another  condition which  investigators judge to  represent  significant hazards  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
AE Reporting: All AEs will be collected  on an Adverse Event Form  in electronic format 
and recorded in the RedCap database. All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_786266] a year to the NINDS Program Official.  
SAEs Reporting: When SAEs occur that are unanticipated (i.e., events other than those 
described in the protocol, consent form and DSMP), and that are related to the 
intervention, they will be reported  to NINDS  Program  Officer within  48 hours of study’s 
knowledge of the SAE.  The expedited  report  will be followed by a detailed,  written  SAE 
report as soon as possible. Follow up information may be required. 
 
Relatedness:  The potential event relationship to the study intervention and/or 
participation  is assessed  by [CONTACT_6962]. The comprehensive scale  to categorize 
an event is listed below: 
• Definitely  Related:  The AE is  clearly  related to  the investigational procedure – 
i.e. an event  that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from  administration  of 
the study intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_786228]’s clinical state.  
• Possibly Rel ated:  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern  to the suspected  intervention, but that could readily  have been  produced 
by a number of other factors. 
• Not Related:  The AE is clearly not related to the investigational procedure - i.e. 
another cause of the event  is most plausible; and/or a clinically  plausible temporal 
sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/2022  
24 5-Cog UH3 Protocol, Version 1.5  
 Expectedness:  AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or 
unexpected, meaning  not anticipated  based  on current  knowledge found in the protocol 
and the consent form. Categories are: 
• Unexpected:  The nature or severity  of the event  is not consistent with information 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol or consent form. 
• Expected:  The event  is known to be associated  with the intervention or population 
under study. 
 
Classification  of AE Severity:  
• Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require  therapy  or a medical  evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient  – i.e. no 
doctor visit or medical treatments were required.  
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_485689];  moderate experiences  may cause some interference 
with functioning – i.e. minimal medical treatment was needed, possible doctor visit or physical therapy. 
• Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require  systemic  drug therapy  or other treatment;  they are usually incapacitating  – 
i.e. medical  attention  was required, possible hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Note:  Severity  is not synonymous with seriousness.  SAEs  are a subset of the reported 
AEs.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1081403].  The internal  safety  monitoring committee  will meet 
with the entire research team to review the study protocols. Particular attention will be paid to outcome definition, study design, procedures for recording and reporting adverse events, informed consent procedures and documentation. 
 
At the initial meeting, the internal safety monitoring committee may recommend modifications or clarification of the protocol, and it will formulate its operating procedures (e.g., meeting  schedule,  reports  due dates  for the study statistician,  unblinding 
policy, and what interim data may be released to the investigators). At the initial meeting the plans for interim monitoring for efficacy and futility will be presented to the internal safety monitoring committee as an aid for monitoring the trial.  
 
We will train competent  staff to conduct the assessments,  ensure they understand the data 
collection procedures and process, and understand adverse event reporting requirements.

[ADDRESS_1081405] to validate the 5-Cog battery coupled with 
decision  tree in an ethnically  diverse Bronx primary  care population of 1,200 older patients 
with cognitive concerns. We chose an active control (health literacy and grip) to balance 
time and tester exposure in the 5-Cog arm. Our primary outcome is improved dementia care. 
 
Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is improved dementia care, defined as meeting any one of the following endpoints within  one month of the clinic  visit at which  the patient 
was randomized. 1. New diagnosis of dementia (relevant ICD -10 codes) or MCI (331.83) documented in 
the EMR. The recent DSM -V criteria include categories of ‘major neurocognitive 
disorder’ and ‘mild neurocognitive disorder,’ which overlap with dementia and MCI. We will track  these diagnoses but not use these solely  to define the outcome as they are 
as yet not being widely used as diagnostic or billing codes in our primary care sites. 
2. Tests ordered for reversible causes of cognitive impairment as recommended by [CONTACT_786268]  (e.g. thyroid function tests,  B-[ADDRESS_1081406] or MRI scans).  
3. New  prescriptions for medications  for dementia  or MCI  indications in EMR.  
4. Referral  for specialist  evaluation  for cognitive impairment (Neurology, Geriatrics  or 
Psychiatry) in EMR. 
 
9.2 Sample  Size and  Randomization  
This randomized study has 600 subjects for each of the 2 groups. Assuming a non- 
completion  rate of EMR  entries  of 10% over 90 days and that 25%, 30% or 35% of control 
subjects will experienc e ‘improved dementia care,’ we can detect odds ratios of 1.46, 1.[ADDRESS_1081407] of 5-Cog on improving dementia care with 80% power 
using a two-sided test with significance level of 0.05. There is a paucity of studies 
examining efficacy of brief  cognitive screens  in primary  care.  One non- randomized  trial of

26 5-Cog UH3 Protocol, Version 1.5  
 screening  by [CONTACT_786269] a decision tree in primary  care  clinics  showed 
new physician action in 17% of patients with a positive screen in intervention sites 
compared to 1% in control sites. [ADDRESS_1081408] or initiating dementia treatment (similar to our primary outcome) . While our 
projected effect size used for sample size estimation is conservatively lower than that reported in this previous study,
[ADDRESS_1081409] size from this previous study was not used to 
calculate power given its preliminary,  non- randomized  nature but is presented  in support of 
our assumptions. A review of 8 studies of detection of mild dementia in primary care showed that  sensitivity  ranged  from  9% to  41%.
55 Detection  rates  in clinics  are even  lower 
for earlier dementia stages such as MCI.56 These observations support our assumptions of 
lower rates of improved dementia care in our control group. 
 
Cohort retention: This is not a major  issue  for this RCT  as primary  outcomes are based  on 
clinical  encounters information  collected  from  EMR  and other administrative  data sources 
in patients residing in Bronx County and receiving primary care in our institution. Also, primary outcomes do not require repeat in- person testing after baseline assessments.  
• Non
-completion: We realize that not all patients will complete the additional tests 
described  above as covariates  or exploratory outcomes.  We will complete  as many  of 
the tests as possible depending on patients’ availability. Nonetheless, our overall sample size of 1,[ADDRESS_1081410] sensitivity analyses assuming non-completion rate of 50%. 
• O
ver - or under- detecting  cognitive impairment: Given  the high sensitivity  and validity 
of 5-Cog procedures for dementia detection, we do not expect under-detection to be a 
major issue. We will set PMIS cutscores to maximize sensitivity and will improve cognitive concern ascertainm ent. A major consequence of over -detection is the strain 
on limited primary care resources resulting from more dementia assessments. Our decision tree provides guidance to primary care physicians regarding next steps in cognitively impaired patients. Red flags are built within our decision tree to channel patients  for specialist evaluations. These steps  were  developed  in consultation with our 
primary care partners. We will carefully monitor clinical, logistical and economic impact of introducing 5-Cog in our primary care sites, and make any necessary system changes to optimize clinical encounters. It is encouraging that introducing PMIS into our local EMR has not resulted in significant bottlenecks or overburdening specialists. We have also not observed any significant bottlenecks or negative feedback from primary care staff regarding implementing the first phase of the 5-Cog battery at our site. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1081411] testing or interventions will generate a computerized block randomization scheme to  assign  study identification  numbers to either  5-Cog or 
control arms. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_25890] ( < or >75 years). Briefly,  
an encrypted file containing the group assignment is prepared for each study identification  number. The file is stored  in RedCap  the database  program used for this 
trial. The assignments are presented  to the research  assistants (RA) in sequential  order 
at the time the participant is enrolled, following the eligibility assessment, and

Our primary outcome is improved dementia care. This outcome is collected prospectively from EMR and related medical records by [CONTACT_603387] (Administrative & Statistics Cores) and do not require patient interviews. This primary outcome is defined  as meeting  any one of the following endpoints  within  [ADDRESS_1081413] been used in several prior clinical trials in cognitively impaired patients.
32-36 
1. New  diagnosis  of dementia  (relevant  ICD-10 codes)  or MCI  (331.83)  documented 
in the EMR. The recent DSM -V criteria37 include categories of ‘major 
neurocognitive disorder’ and ‘mild neurocognitive disorder,’ which overlap with dementia and MCI. These categories will also be included but a recent internal audit indicated that they are as yet not in widespread use in our primary care 
clinics (cf. specialty clinics).  
2. Tests ordered for reversible causes of cognitive impairment as recommended by [CONTACT_786270]  (e.g. thyroid function tests,  B-[ADDRESS_1081414] or MRI scans).
15, 38 -41 
3. New  prescriptions  for dementia  medications  in EMR.  
4. Referral  for cognitive/dementia  evaluation  by [CONTACT_577530]  (Neurology,  Geriatrics 
or Psychiatry) in EMR. 
9.4.2 Secondary  outcomes  
Health care utilization (emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) for patients in both arms will be tracked up to [ADDRESS_1081415] in our institution.  All visit notes  and diagnoses 
are to be entered within 48 hours of the encounter.  
 
9.5 Data Analyses  
We will examine data for  potential  outliers  and analyze the robustness  of our findings  
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081416] will be used to compare ‘improved dementia care’ outcome within [ADDRESS_1081417]- intervention between  the intervention and control groups. Logistic  regression  model adjusted 
for covariates will also be used. We will use intent ion to treat analysis .
57 Pre-specified 
baseline covariates to account for confounders in the planned analysis include age, gender, education, and chronic illnesses. Baseline distribution of covariates will be compared to assess adequacy of randomization. We do not discount residual/unmeasured confounding – though this is more of an issue in observational studies without randomization. We will report adjusted and crude estimates of associations to assess confounding, and discuss limitations of the study.  
 
Primary outcome: Chi- square test will be used to compare ‘improved dementia care’ 
outcome within  [ADDRESS_1081418] (HTE) is the nonrandom, explainable variability in the 
direction and magnitude of treatment effects for individuals within a population. The main goals of HTE analysis are to estimate treatment effects in clinically relevant subgroups and to predict whe ther an individual might benefit from a treatment. In this RCT, we will 
specifically address HTE due to gender (male/female), ethnicity (African - 
American/Hispanic/Caucasian)  and education  (less than high school/ high school graduate). 
Treatment  effects  in these subgroups will be evaluated  using stratified  analysis.  Alternative, 
an interaction term between the subgroup characteristic and treatment group will also be tested.  
 
Secondary outcome: Utilization is defined in terms o f specialty visits, emergency room 
visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_276796] 12 months following the screening visit. This will be tracked via the EMR in both groups. The rates of utilization will be compared between the two groups using analytical approaches described for the primary outcome. We will also compare  ‘days free of utilization’  (number of days from  screening  to first epi[INVESTIGATOR_786229] -up) in both groups using linear mixed effect and survival 
models.
58, [ADDRESS_1081419] to integrate data collected from the EMR system with study data. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081420] will check exported data files for data integrity and flag in the event of inconsistent or missing data. 
 
Forms or screens will be designed to meet the data collectio n needs, applying standards for the 
structuring of variables  to permit the pooling of shared/common variables  across  the consortium. 
The database manager  will develop a data entry/management  system  so that the interviewers  can 
not only enter the data directly into the computer during the interview, but they can also run reports and compute scores during the interview if need be. Data collected from both methods will be integrated by [CONTACT_786271].  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1081421]  manager 
will re -run data editing programs periodically as a final quality control check. Any 
inconsistencies  identified  will be validated  with the original  source  and stored  in report  form  for 
evaluative purposes. From the cleaned data, data sets will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_786230].  
Data sets will be frozen  on a semi -annual  basis  by [CONTACT_786272].  As projects  are completed 
(closed), cleaned data sets, their data dictionaries, and their command files and output files will be archived.  
 
The exchange of data across the consortium will be reviewed by [CONTACT_786273] -Consortium  Coordinating Team  (CCCT)  and handled  by 
[CONTACT_786274] (see Section 13 for details of committees).  
 
Data  sharing:  A data sharing  agreement  with collaborators  at Northwestern  University  will 
account for sharing data across sites which inc lude the following data elements:  
 
Demographic information, including all elements (except years) of dates related to an 
individual  (including birthdate, admission  date,  discharge  date,  date of death, and exact  age 
if over 89)  
 
Data extracted from EHR

visits, emergency room visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_786231]. All visit notes and diagnoses are to be entered within 48 hours of the encounter. A series  of reminders  are send to clinicians  via EMR  to complete  delinquent 
entries.  
10.3.3 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol  deviations  will be documented and reviewed  in bi-annual  reports  sent to the 
internal safety monitoring committee.  
10.3.4 Monit oring  
A study protocol, Manual of Operations and DSMP for all study activities will be developed during study setup  and approved by [CONTACT_786275].  Data will be maintained in a Database 
Manager System (RedCap).  
 
The database system will have automated checks for ranges of values and logical validity  of data entered  and will be programmed to import  subject  data directly  from  the 
computerized test data files. Imported data files will be checked for data integrity and flagged in the event of inconsistent or missing data. Hand entered data will be verified using double entry routines to guard against ke y punch errors. This system will provide  
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081424] protection and distribution  of analytic  data files containing only necessary  information on an as-needed 
basis; there will be an interface to export all or selected data from RedCap and transfer these to any of the statistical packages (SAS, S -PLUS, Stata, SPSS) used by [CONTACT_786276].  
 
Full backups  of the entire  database will be performed  daily. For added  security,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_786232], fire -resistant

13 CROSS  CONSORTIUM  COMMITTEES  
The Consortium for  Detecting Cognitive Impairment, Including Dementia (DetectCID), is a 
collaborative network of research  programs that are performing  cross -site validation  of paradigms, 
tools, and protocols that will increase  the frequency, and improve the quality of patient  evaluations 
for detecting cognitive impairment in primary care and other everyday clinical settings. The members  of the consortium include Albert  Einstein  College of Medicine,  Northwestern  University 
and The Regents of the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco (UCSF). The DetectCID Consortium was created pursuant to joint funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders  and Stroke and the National  Institute  on Aging under grant number UG3NS105557, and 
the exchange of Data is for the research activities of DetectCID.  
 
The committees  described  below guide cross  consortium projects  and are not responsible for local 
governance.  
 
Steering Committee  
The Steering Committee is the governing leadership and decision- making body for the project. It 
includes the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_786234] a voting member,  and up to  [ADDRESS_1081428].  This Committee’s  primary  purview will be to maintain  the cross -project 
scientific synergy of the Consortium. They will oversee cross -validation projects, establish 
milestones and timelines, and monito r progress. They will coordinate the activities of and gather 
input from critical stakeholders whose investment and support are important for project success, including the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Alzheimer’s  Association, etc.  This Committee will review proposals for cross -site projects and 
ensure equitable shared -data publication practices  across  sites.  They  will also receive reports from 
and provide scientific, logistical, and administrative governance for t he other Committees.  The 
Steering  Committee  will meet  via videoconference  monthly throughout the project  for a minimum 
of 1 hour. These meetings may be extended to 1.5 hours, with one hour dedicated to private discussion, and 30 minutes joined in a regular rotation by [CONTACT_786281], who will provide a report of their key activities, issues, and recommendations, and receive feedback from the Steering Committee to guide their progress. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9140  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  12/12/[ADDRESS_1081429] one expert in statistics, research design and/or data science from each site.  This Committee will maintain an updated and clear 
understanding of the  key scientific  goal s of the project, as  articulated by [CONTACT_40972], 
and will work with the project leadership to derive specific statistical analysis plans to most effectively  answer  the Consortium’s scientific  questions. Regular  discussion of analytic  plans and 
methods across projects will ensure that the best statistical approaches are shared when common 
problems arise.  This Committee  will also facilitate  sharing of analytic  code to reduce  redundancy 
and maximize efficiency of data analysis across the Consortium. This Committee may choose to meet less frequently (i.e., only quarterly) during the middle years of the project but will likely require monthly meetings during early and later project periods. 
 
Data  Sharing  and Harmonization Committee  
The Data Sharing and Harmonization Committee is responsible for identifying opportunities for, and implementing, practices that promote data sharing and harmonization. While the exact membership of these Committees will be determined by [CONTACT_40972], this Committee should include a scientist from each site who is familiar with that site’s patient data collection practices,  and individuals with research  technology expertise.  Project  managers  are encouraged  to 
attend  these meetings,  and individuals with administrative/regulatory  expertise will be included as 
needed.  The team will develop an overview of the protocols, paradigms, and available data 
generated by [CONTACT_786282], and will provide recommendations, subject to final approval by [CONTACT_786283],  for how those resources  would most effectively 
be shared and included in cross -validation studies. This may include potentially harmonizing the 
collection of certain common data elements across sites (e.g., the exact protocol for collection of demographic and  clinical  severity  information, etc.)  to promote unified datasets  for later  analysis. 
They will evaluate and may adopt elements of already well -established harmonization schemas, 
such as some of the NACC  standards for ADCs.  It will be the purview of this Committee  to ensure 
maximal data sharing of Consortium data, both within and beyond the Consortium, and to investigate and make recommendations about data sharing tools and repositories that would be facilitate this sharing. This Committee will likely be responsible for establishing relia nce 
agreements across site IRBs to facilitate sharing of de- identified clinical data. This Committee 
may choose to meet  less frequently (i.e., only quarterly) during the middle  years  of the project  but 
will likely require monthly meetings during early and later project periods. 
 
Clinical Practice Committee  
The Clinical Practice Committee is responsible for paradigm implementation and maintaining relationships with  primary  care  providers, health  systems,  and health  disparities  populations. This 
Committee will be responsible for guiding successful strategies for the implementation of protocols in everyday clinical settings across health disparities populations, and to guide implementation research proto cols and benchmarks for success. While the exact membership of 
these Committees  will be determined  by [CONTACT_774468],  this Committee  should include

 representatives with expertise in implementation science, primary care, and health dis parities 
research. Meetings will be monthly to initiate the work, and during the planning phases for the 
implementation  projects;  frequency  may be less often  (quarterly  at minimum)  during other phases.

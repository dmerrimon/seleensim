Synopsis  
 
Concept and Rationale:  
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents a potential curative treatment for patients with 
relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) B- cell lymphomas , and is presently the modality that yields the best 
chance of prolonged progression -free survival in this population of patients.  
 
Unfortunately, approximately half of these patients suffer from relapsed disease and die from their disease within  [ADDRESS_821163] .  
 
Zydelig  (Idelalisib)  is the [ADDRESS_821164] indolent B -cell 
lymphomas (i NHL) with remarkable activity in heavily treated patients, leading to an overall response 
rate (ORR) of 57 %, a median progression free survival (PFS) of [ADDRESS_821165] for patients with iNHL  and 
transformed iNHL (tiNHL) . The goal of this strategy is to increase the likelihood that patients are able to 
maintain a remission after ASCT at 1 and 2 years of follow -up.   
 Mirroring the paradigm incorporating BCR/ABL TKI , lenalidomide and Sorafenib  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618218] -
transplant treatments of Ph+ ALL , MM,  and FLT3 ITD AML respectively, we propose inhibiting the 
proliferation and survival of iNHL cells by [CONTACT_542974] B- cell receptor signaling (BCR) via inhibiting the 
downstream molecular target PI3Kδ with Zydelig  in the post -transplant setting.  
   
Primary Objective(s):  
1. Determine the toxicity and safety  of incorporating Zydelig  into the po st- ASCT maintenance 
setting for iNHL and tiNHL immediately after ASCT.  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
8 
 Secondary Objective(s) : 
1. Assess the efficacy of incorporating Zydelig into the post -ASCT maintenance setting for iNHL and 
tiNHL immediately after ASCT with a corresponding endpoint of  1-year PFS after the 
transplantation . 
2. 2-year Progression Free Survival ( PFS) . 
3. Non -relapse mortality (NRM).  
4. Overall survival (OS) . 
5. Correlatives  studies : 
a.  To perform pharmacodynamics studies . 
b. To understand mecha nism of resistance to Zydelig.  
c. To assess the effect of Zydelig  on the immune system .

8. Patients with active hepatic disease, liver cirrhosis, or known  HBV/HCV infection   
9. Patients with de novo diffuse large B- cell lymphoma  
10. Patients with h/o PCP or CMV infections  
 
Intervention and Mode of Delivery : 
Oral Zydelig  at 150 mg twice daily continuously on 28 -day cycle s. 
Dose delays/ modification s  as below for  Grade 2 or above  for some  hematological and non -
hematological toxicities  such hepatotoxicity, diarrhea/colitis/intestinal perforation, pneumonitis, 
infections, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia,  or any other grade [ADDRESS_821169] possibly related to Zydelig . 
 
Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:  
iNHL  and tiNHL  patien ts will be eligible after ASCT.  
Start of therap y would occur after engraftment , minimum at day [ADDRESS_821170].  
Patients will continue on Zydelig  up to one year or to progression/relapse/de ath or unacceptable 
toxicity, whichever occurs first . 
 HDT/ASCT will occur as soon as possible based on successful mobilization, collection and infusion of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells at a minimum of 2x10
6 CD34+/Kg of weight.  
Myeloablative transplant preparative regimen  is based on institutional standards . 
Engraftment will be defined as ANC over 500 cells/mm3 and non -transfused platelet count of 20 K/mm3. 
Standard supportive care in the post -transplant setting will be given . 
 
Toxicities will be evaluated to include standard hematologic toxicities for solid tumors (i.e. count  
suppression etc.). Dose reductions will be pursued as described below for both hematologic and non -
hemato logic toxicities grade 2 and above  
 
Initial dose will be 150 mg PO  BID. Dose modifications for toxicities du e to Zydelig  will follow the 
package  insert recommendations as below . For other severe or life -threatening toxicities related to 
Zydelig , withhold drug until toxicity is resolved. If resuming Zydelig  after interruption for other severe or 
life-threatening toxicities, reduce the dose to 100 mg twice daily. Recurrence of other severe or life-
threatening Zydelig -related toxicity upon rechallenge should result in permanent discontinuation of 
Zydelig . Toxicity, as well as graft failure will be monitored continuously throughou t the trial.  
 
Statistical Methods: 
We are studying a cohort of [ADDRESS_821171] by 20% based on an approximate 
baseline PFS of 60% for iNHL and tiNHL.1,2 The expected 1 -year PFS will be around 80%.  
Survival without progression or death will be determined using the Kaplan -Meier 
estimates at [ADDRESS_821172] . 
1.2.3.  Non -relapse mortality (NRM) . 
NRM is defined as death in the absence of competing risks, relapse or progression of disease. This secondary endpoint will be characterized and presented as a cumulative 
incidence at [ADDRESS_821173]. 
1.2.4.  Overall survival (OS) . 
Survival without death will be determined and presented as Kaplan -Meier estimates at [ADDRESS_821174].  
1.2.5.  Correlative  studies.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Zydelig  (Zydelig , GS-1101, Cal -101)  
Zydelig  is is an inhibitor of PI3Kinase delta which is highly expressed in malignant lymphoid B-
cells. PI3Kδ inhibition results in apoptosis of malignant tumor cells. In addition, Zydelig  inhibits 
several signaling pathways, including the B- cell receptor. Zydelig  was r ecently approved by [CONTACT_941] 
U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) for the treatment of the following:  
• relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in combination with rituximab, in patients for 
whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to  other co -
morbidities  
• relapsed follicular B- cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) in patients who have received at least 
two prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
•  relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in patients who have received at least two prior 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].1,2,3-5  
 
2.2. Study Disease –  Indolent B -cell Lymphomas /Transformed B -cell Lymphomas  
Early published clinical trial of Zydelig  in multipl e relapsed and treated indolent B -cell 
lymphomas showed a respectable ORR of 57% (6%  CR) a short median time to response of 1.[ADDRESS_821175] for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
12 
 months and a prolonged median duration of response of 12.5 months. Responses were  seen in 
all lymphoma subtypes. The estimated median progression -free survival and overall survival 
were 11 months, and 20 months, respectively. The estimated survival  rate at one year was 80%. 
This population of patients included patients who already ha d undergone HDT/ASCT , and these 
patients had no  different responses to Zydelig  compared to the other patients.4 
There are some reports in the literature showing that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway 
might be activated in aggressive B- cell lymphoma.6-10 Other PI3K inhibitor s, such as SAR245408, 
showed  some activity in 25% of aggressive B- cell lymphoma.11 
 
2.3. Rationale  
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents a potential curative treatment for  
patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) B- cell lymphomas and is presently  the modality 
that yields the best chance of prolonged survival w ithout disease in this population of patients.   
Unfortunately, approximately half of these patients suffer from relapsed disease and die from 
their disease in [ADDRESS_821176] indolent B -cell 
lymphomas (iNHL) with remarkable activity in heavily treated patients, leading to response rate (ORR) of 57%, a median progression free survival  (PFS) of [ADDRESS_821177] ASC T for patients with 
iNHL and transformed iNHL (tiNHL). The goal of this strategy is to increase the likelihood 
patients are able to maintain a remission after ASCT at 1 and 2 years of follow -up.   
Mirroring the paradigm incorporating BCR/ABL TKI and Sorafe nib targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618218] -
transplant treatments of Ph+ ALL and FLT3 ITD AML respectively, we propose inhibiting the 
proliferation and survival of iNHL cells by [CONTACT_542974] B- cell receptor signaling (BCR) via 
inhibiting the downstream molecular ta rget PI3Kδ with Zydelig  in the post -transplant setting.

Coordinator/Coordinating Center Contact, Veronica Rodriguez . The following documents are to be 
submitted for review: signed i nformed consent, eligibility checklist completed and signed, all 
supporting documents that demonstrate eligibility requirements have been met such as lab results, 
pathology reports, medical history/progress note of Investigator. Please fax or email these 
documents to: Veronica Rodrigiez , Fax: 410 -328-1975, [EMAIL_11761] . Instructions 
concerning correlative/special studies will be conveyed at the time of registration. Upon review and verification of eligibility,  an email or fax document will be sent to the registering center to confirm 
dose assignment.  
 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Zydelig  Administration  
Treatment will be orally administered on an inpatient and outpatient basis with the starting 
dose of 150 mg by [CONTACT_326372] a day  for continuous 28 -day cycles .  Treatment will continue  
until progression, intolerance, or patient/physician discretion  to stop therapy . Zydelig  will be 
started with count recovery  (ANC over 500  cells/mm
3, non -transfused platelet count over 
20,000 K/mm3) in patients  who are at least 30 days after induction and/or transplant but no 
more than [ADDRESS_821183] -transplant . 
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 9.  Appropriate dose 
modifications for Zydelig  are described in Section 7 . No investigational or commercial agents , or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618220] a dministered with the intent to treat the 
patient's malignancy.  
 
Patients should swallow Zydelig  tablets whole each morning and evening (i.e. every 12hours). 
Tablets may be taken with or without food. Patients should keep  track of adherence to Zydelig  
thera py by [CONTACT_10540] “Patients Drug Diary”  (see appendix B ). This diary will be collected at the 
end of each cycle. At the time of collection, the diary will be reviewed by a staff member and the patient will be prompted to complete any blank entries before com pletion of the visit. Should a 
patient miss  or vomit  a dose of Zydelig  within less than [ADDRESS_821184] selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  
 
Agents typi[INVESTIGATOR_618221] , unless toxicity is observed.  
 
For management of skin toxicity ( rash); i.e.,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669], topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560] s or keratolytic 
creams can be used.  
 Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity . 
 For management of grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis , diarrhea,  or hepatotoxicity,  Zydelig  needs to be 
held .  Systemic corticosteroids can be started at the discretion of the investigator.  
 Recent reports showed increased risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV)  associated with Zydelig . Because of th ese known ris ks, Trimethoprime -
sulfamethoxazole ( TMP -SMX ) will be given as one double -strength tablet daily or three times 
per week , or as one single -strength tablet  once  daily .  For patients who cannot take TMP -SMX, 
we will offer dapsone 100 mg tablet once a day or at ovaquone suspension 1500 mg once a day. 
Blood CMV PCR will be monitored once a month; no prophylaxis is required. PCP prophylaxis and CMV monitoring will start once the patient start s taking Zydelig and will end 1 month after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618222]. Patients wil l be taken off the study drug if they develop  PCP pneumonia , if 
CMV PCR becomes  detectable in the blood  or they develop  CMV infection.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for 1 year or 12 cycles (28 days per cycle) after transplant or until one of the following criteria applies: 
- Disease Progression  
- Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
- Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
- Evidence of PCP pneumonia or CMV vire mia, confirmed at [ADDRESS_821185] 1 day apart with any value  >500IU/mL in plasma or evidence of documented CMV 
disease .  
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
- General or specific changes in the patient ’s condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

8. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE, PROGRESSION, AND RELAPSE   
For purposes of this  study, patients should be restaged every 3 cycles during treatment (i.e., 
cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.), then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for another year.  
The Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma is adopted.13 
 
8.1 Complete Response  
Comp lete response (CR) is defined as the following:  
•  Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -
related symptoms ( if present before therapy ). 
• In patient s whe re the CT or PET/CT scan was positive before therapy, a post- treatment 
residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET/CT -negative.  
•  The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT or 
PET/CT, should be considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to 
lymphoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spl een may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of 
hematopoietic growth factors, or other causes other than lymphoma.  
•  If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must 
have cleared on repeat bone marrow biops y. The biopsy sample on which this 
determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064]. A sample that is negative by [CONTACT_70116], but demonstrating a small 
population of clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a CR until data becomes  available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.  
 
8.2 Partial Response  
Partial response (PR) is defined as the following:  
•  At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of 
the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions; b) if possible, they should be from disparate regions of the 
body; and c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease 
whenever these sites are involved.  
•  No increase should be observed in the si ze of other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
•  Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD, or, for single nodules, in 
the greatest transverse diameter.  
•  With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
usuall y assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
•  Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified in the report (e.g., large -cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by 
[CONTACT_58472] 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
[ADDRESS_821204] persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement, will 
be considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, 
patients should be considered partial responders.  
•  No new sites of disease should be observed.  
•For patients  if the CT or PET/CT was positive before therapy, the post- treatment PET 
should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  
 8.3 Stable Disease  
Stable disease (SD) is defined as when the patient fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see below). The CT or PET/CT should be positive at prior sites of disease, with no new areas of involvement on the post-
treatment CT or PET/CT.  
 
8.4 Progression or Relapse  
Disease progression  (PD) or relapse is defined as  any one of the following:  
•  Lymph nodes should be considered abnorma l if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is > 1  cm. Lymph nodes ≤ 1 cm by ≤ 1 cm will not be 
considered as abnormal for relapse o r progressive disease.  
•  Appearance of any new lesion > 1.[ADDRESS_821205] or PET/CT withou t histologic confirmation.  
 
•  At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node  with a diameter of the short axis of < [ADDRESS_821206] increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm, or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
•  At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node > 
1 cm in its short axis.  
•  Lesion s should be PET -positive if a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]- avid lymphoma or one that was PET -
positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PET 
systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_821207]).  
 
8.5 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
Measurable extra  nodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal 
disease. For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that 
is not easily assessable  (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or 
absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_618247].  
 
Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they ar e superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
[ADDRESS_821208] or PET/CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  should be per formed with cuts of [ADDRESS_821209], abdomen, and pelvis. Head & neck and 
extremities usually require specific protocol s. 
 
Ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are clinically not easily 
accessible when the efficacy  endpoint s of the study is objective response evaluation. It is a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable no des, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].

intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or Medically Significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133604]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life Threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of the investigational 
condition that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred  (Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to 
conduc t normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216696], regardless of length of stay, even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for 
continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096]] for a 
preex isting condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject exposed to the investigational condition 
regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Other important medica l events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical  intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of 
time and units.  
Action 
Taken  Did the adverse event cause the study treatment to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to Test Condition  Did the investigational condition cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the 
investigational condition caused the adverse event will be provided  by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified 
physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This 
initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship 
between the test drug and the adverse event based upon t he available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the investigational 
condition and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in 
number and/or intensity), the more likely the investigational condition caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the investigational condition such 
as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the

10. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
10.1 Zydelig  (GS-1101, CAL -101) ()  
 
 
The substance acts as a phosphoinositide  3-kinase inhibitor; more specifically, it blocks 
P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3 -kinase . 
 
10.2 Availability  
Zydelig  (CAL -101) will be supplied and distributed by [CONTACT_10869], Inc. Zydelig  is 
supplied in bottles of 60  tablets of 1 00 mg and 150 mg strengths. The bottles of Zydelig  
are white high -density polyethylene with a child -resistant cap and a polyester or cotton 
coil. The tablet shape is plain -faced, modified oval. The tablets contain the inactive 
ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The 100 mg tablets are orange film coated, and the 150 mg tablets are pi[INVESTIGATOR_618228]. Tablets should be swallowed whole . 
 
10.3 Storage and Stability  
Zydelig  tablets should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 25ºC (77ºF), with a 
range from 15ºC (59ºF) to 30ºC (86ºF). While stability of study drug tablets stored at 

August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
34 
 controlled room temperature has been confirmed, brief excursions to temperatures a s 
low as – 10°C or as high as 40°C (eg, during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) will not adversely affect the drug. 
Updated stability data will be provided to the sites, as appropriate.  
At the end of the study, any remaining unused Zydelig  should be destroyed according to 
local institutional procedures.  
 
Preparation  
Zydelig  should be dispensed in the original container.  
 
Administration  
The prescribed dose of Zydelig  should be taken orally. At each dose administration, the 
tablet number corresponding to the appropriate dose of study drug is to be swallowed whole with 100 to 200 mL (~ 4 to 8 ounces) of water. In case of breakage of the tablets in 
the oral cavity, addit ional water should be taken as a rinse.  
Zydelig  may be taken with or without food. There are no known dietary restrictions 
related to study drug use.   Overdose Precautions  
In Phase 1 studies, an MTD for Zydelig  was not reached when administering the dru g 
continuously at dose levels of 350 mg/dose BID (700 mg per day). However, in this protocol, an overdose is defined as administration of more than the prescribed daily study drug ( Zydelig ) dose (ie, >300 mg in a single day).  
 In a subject who experiences  an overdose, consideration should be given as to whether 
study drug administration should be temporarily interrupted. If the overdose ingestion is recent and substantial, and if there are no medical contraindications, use of gastric lavage or induction of  emesis may be considered. Observation for any symptomatic side effects 
should be instituted, and biochemical and hematological parameters should be followed closely (consistent with the protocol or more frequently, as needed). Appropriate supportive management to mitigate adverse effects should be initiated.  
 Inadvertent Exposure and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_618229], Zydelig  does not appear to be acutely 
toxic, genotoxic, or irritative at levels that are likely to result from inadvertent exposure to 
the contents of broken tablets. However, personnel handling the drug should use 
reasonable precautions to avoid eye contact, skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion of the 
study drug product. For further information regarding i nadvertent exposure and spi[INVESTIGATOR_618230], please consult the Zydelig  investigator brochure.

 Distribution  
Idelalisib is greater than 84% bound to human plasma proteins with no concentration 
dependence. The mean blood -to-plasma ratio was 0.7. The population apparent central 
volume of distribution at steady state is [ADDRESS_821221] PI3Kδ in vitro. Idelalisib undergoes minor 
metabolism by [CONTACT_15924]1A4. The population apparent systemic clearance at steady -state is 
14.9 L/hr. The population terminal elimination half- life of idelalisib is 8.2 hours. Following 
a single dose of 150 mg of [14C] idelalisib, 78% and 14% of the radioactivity was excreted in feces and  urine, respectively. GS -563117 accounted for 49% of the radioactivity in the 
urine and 44% in the feces.  
 
Specific Population  
Age, Gender, Race and Weight  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that age, gender, race, and weight had no 
effect on id elalisib exposure . 
 
Patients with Renal Impairment  
A pharmacokinetic study following a single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was performed in 
healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min). Creatinine clearance had no effect o n idelalisib exposure. No dose adjustment is needed 
for patients with CrCl ≥15 mL/min.  
 
Patients with Hepatic Impairement  
A pharmacokinetic study of Zydelig was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with 
hepatic impairment. The geometric mean AUC incr eased up to 1.[ADDRESS_821222] or bilirubin values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) compared to 
subjects with normal AST or ALT or bilirubin values. Limited safety and efficacy data are available for patients with baseline AST  or ALT greater than 2.[ADDRESS_821223], as these patients were excluded from Studies 1 and 2. Patients with baseline hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs of Zydelig toxicity . 
 
Drug Interactions  
 
In Vitro Studies  
Idelalisib is a substrate for aldehyde oxidase, CYP3A, and UGT1A4 in vitro. Idelalisib 
inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and UGT1A1 and GS -563117 inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP3A and UGT1A1 in vitro. Idelalisib and GS -563117 are not likely to inhibit 
CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Idelalisib induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, but does not induce 
CYP1A2 in vitro. GS - 563117 does not induce these enzymes. Idelalisib and GS -563117 are 
substrates of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and BCRP in vitro. Idelalisib is not a substrate o f 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. GS - [ADDRESS_821224] of Other Drugs on Idelalisib  
A single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after rifampin (a strong 
CYP3A and P -gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 8 days in healt hy subjects. Rifampin 
decreased the geometric mean idelalisib AUC by 75% and the geometric mean Cmax by 
58%. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with strong CYP3A and P -gp inducers. A single dose 
of 400 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A and 
P-gp inhibitor) [ADDRESS_821225] of Idelalisib on Other Drugs  
A single oral dose of midazolam 5 mg was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 
15 doses in healthy subjects. The geometric mean midazolam Cmax increased by 2.4 -fold 
and the geometric mean midazolam AUC increased by 5.4 -fold. Avoid coadministration of 
Zydelig with CYP3A substrates, as Zydelig is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A single dose of 10 mg of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 12 doses in healthy subjects. No changes in exposure to rosuvastatin were observed. A single dose of 0.5 mg of digoxin (P -gp substrate) was administered alone 
and after Zydelig 150 mg for 19 doses in healthy subjects. No changes  in exposure to 
digoxin were observed.  
 
10.5 
Toxicity .  
Hepatotoxicity  
Fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 18% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 11% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. Elevations in 
ALT or AST greater than [ADDRESS_821226] 12 weeks of treatment and were reversible with 
dose interruption. After resumption of treatment at a lower dose, 26% of patients had recur rence of ALT and AST elevations. Discontinue Zydelig for recurrent hepatotoxicity. 
Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity. Monitor ALT and AST in all patients every [ADDRESS_821227], ALT and total bilirubin weekly until the abnormality is resolved . 
  
Severe Diarrhea or Colitis  
Severe diarrhea or colitis (Grade 3 or higher) occurred in 14% of patients treated with 
Zydelig monotherapy and 19% of p atients treated with Zydelig in combination trials . 
Diarrhea can occur at any time. Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig and other drugs that cause diarrhea. Diarrhea due to Zydelig responds poorly to antimotility agents. Median time to resolution ranged betwee n 1 week and 1 month across trials, following 
interruption of Zydelig therapy and in some instances, use of corticosteroids . 
 
Pneumonitis  
Fatal and serious pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Zydelig. In randomized 
clinical trials of combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients treated 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
37 
 with Zydelig compared to 1% on the comparator arms. Time to onset of pneumonitis 
ranged from  <1 to 15 months.  Patients taking Zydelig  who present with pulmonary 
symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hyp oxia, interstitial infiltrates  on a radiologic exam, or 
a decline by [CONTACT_726] 5% in oxygen saturation should be evaluated for pneumonitis.  If 
pneumonitis is suspected, interrupt Zydelig  until the  etiology of the pulmonary symptoms 
has been determined.  P atients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by [CONTACT_618253].   
 
Infections  
Fatal and/or serious infections occurred in 21% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and  36% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. The most 
common infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and febrile neutropenia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and interrupt Zydelig for Grade 3 or higher infection. 
Serious or fatal Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
occurred in  <1% of patients treated with Zydelig. Consider prophylaxis for PJP. Interrupt  
Zydelig in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade, and permanently  
discontinue Zydel ig if PJP infection of any grade is confirmed. Interrupt Zydelig in the  
setting of positive CMV PCR or antigen test until the infection has resolved. If Zydelig is  
subsequently resumed, patients should be monitored (by [CONTACT_954] ) for CMV reactivation at 
least mo nthly .  
 
Intestinal Perforation  
Fatal and serious intestinal perforation occurred in Zydelig -treated patients. At the time of 
perforation, some patients had moderate to severe diarrhea. Advise patients to promptly 
report any new or worsening abdominal pain , chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting. 
Discontinue Zydelig permanently in patients who experience intestinal perforation  
 
Severe Cutaneous Reactions  
Fatal cases of Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) have 
occurred in patients  treated with Zydelig. If SJS or TEN is suspected, interrupt Zydelig until 
the etiology of the reaction has been determined. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue Zydelig. Other severe or life -threatening (Grade ≥3) cutaneous reactions, 
inclu ding dermatitis exfoliative, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, 
rash maculo - papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, exfoliative rash, and skin disorder, have 
been reported in Zydelig- treated patients. Monitor patients for the development of severe 
cutaneous reactions and discontinue Zydelig.  
 Anaphylaxis  
Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients on Zydelig. In patients who develop serious allergic reactions, discontinue Zydelig permanently and institute appropriate supportive measures.  
 Neutropenia  
Treatment- emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 25% of patients treated with 
Zydelig monotherapy and 46% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. Monitor blood counts  closely.

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
39 
 A true  proportion of s tudy subjects that are not removed from the study for toxicity or intolerance 
of 0.70 or higher will be considered satisfactory in this particular patient population. If the true 
proportion of severe toxicity - free patients is 50% or less, then Zydelig will not be considered a 
prom ising maintenance treatment post Autologous stem cell transplantation d ue to unacceptable 
toxicity . 
 A single -stage open -label design wil l be used for the study. With [ADDRESS_821229] who 
developed severe toxicity is less or equal to 30% rate is less than 20%. Hence, the study will have an adequate about 80% power. Addressing the safety of Zydelig,  a maximum width 90% c onfidence 
interval for any grade 3 or higher toxicity will be about 32%, assuming that a total of 31 patients are 
enrolled. For instance, if 3 out of 31 patients (10%) develop grade 3 or higher non -hematologic 
toxicity, then a 90% confidence interval for the true toxicity rate is between 3% and 24%. For 31 
patients in this study, if the true unknown probability of a rare toxicity is 10%, the probability of observing 1 or more toxicities is 96%, for 5% it is 80%, and if the true toxicity rate is 3% then the probability of observing one or more rare toxicities is 61%.  
 
We plan to accrue 34 eligible patients to account for about 10% possible drop -out 
 
14.1 Study Design/ Primary Endpoints  
This single cohort open -label study  will accrue [ADDRESS_821230] used at 100/ 150 mg PO BID. Within patient 
dose reductions are allowed for hematologic and non -hemato logic toxicities above grade 
2. The proportion of patients removed from the study due to toxicity will  be reported , 
along with all toxicities specified by [CONTACT_16624] . 
 
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618231]: Toxicity  will be monitored continuously . If it 
becomes evident that the proportion of patients being removed from the study for toxicity convincing ly exceeds 50%, the study will be halted for a safety consultation.  The

14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_821231]. PFS function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach with 90% 
Confidence Interval.  
Analysis of secondary objective(s):  
The 1 -year PFS will be estimated and reported using the Kaplan -Meier curve with the 
corresponding 90% confidence interval.  
14.4.2  2-year PFS will be calculated with the same method as 1- year PFS (see 13. 4.1).

 19. APPENDIX D CORRELATIVE STUDIE S 
 
 19 .1 Background and Overview  
It is clear that some lymphomas become “addicted” to one or more oncogenic pathways, including the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR  axis. Patients with iNHL who are reliant on this pathway may be more responsive to 
Zydelig , which blocks PI3Kδ (1). However, there are no approved predictive biomarkers for PI3K/mTOR 
inhibitors’ activity. A recent report demonstrated that PTEN, p- AKT, and p -p70S6K correlated with 
response to trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, lending suppo rt to the importance of 
the activation status of key proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as predictive biomarkers for 
response (2).  
 Similarly to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Zydelig  activity is limited by [CONTACT_618258] 
(3
). For example, p110α -mediated constitutive activation of PI3K has been shown to be a mechanism of 
resistance in this pathway through limiting the efficacy of p1 10δ-selective inhibition ( 4). The MEK1/2 
(mitogen -activated kinase 1/2)/ERK1/2 (extracellular signal- regulated kinase 1/2) pathway is one of the 
most frequently dysregulated signaling cascades in cancer, including in hematological malignancies ( 5). 
While PI3K inhibition induces compensatory activation of p -ERK, co -inhibition of the PI3K and ERK 
pathway potentiates the activity of PI3K inhibitors in several malignancies, including T -cell lymphomas 
(6-8). Given tha t the nature of our study lacks adequate power to definitively evaluate these biomarkers, 
our goal in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_618235]. 
 A s  a  P I [ADDRESS_821236] on the immune system ( 9
). It has been associated 
with colitis, pneumonitis, and hepatotoxicity suggestive of an autoimmune process. A recent report has 
demonstrated that inhibition of PI3Kδ in mice has  a protective effect against several non -hematological 
cancers (10). The mechanism of action shown in this study was PI3Kδ -mediated inactivation of myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg) resulting in upregulation of CD8+ T cells. 
In addition, PI3Kδ play a role in the anti- tumor response of the natural killer (NK) cells ( 11, 12). Given 
these interesting results, we will determine whether regulatory T cell, CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, NK cell, and MDSC populations c hange in patients enrolled in this trial, immediately prior to Zydelig , and at [ADDRESS_821237] starting Zydelig  treatment (4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months following the start of 
Zydelig ).  
 Whole exome sequencing (WES) has emerged as a powerful method for correlating genetic mutations 
with treatment response. Cancers are often associated with genetic alterations that result in up - or 
down- regulation of particular signaling pathways that can now be furth er defined through WES. Van 
Allen et al. recently performed whole exome sequencing on samples from patients with urothelial carcinoma that showed that somatic mutations in ERCC2 , a component of the nucleotide excision repair 
pathway, correlate with response to cisplatin ( 13
). We propose to perform a similar approach using WES 
on formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue sections or frozen tissue blocks from enrolled, 
consented patients and to compare DNA from tissue samples to germline DNA that will be extracted 
from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or histologically normal tissue. In addition, we will repeat a biopsy at the time of relapse and perform WES in order to assess  for the acquisition of 
additional genetic alterations that might explain the mechanism of resistance.  
 In summary, correlative studies will be performed on samples from consenting patients to examine the following aims:  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
47 
 • Expression levels of p -AKT, PI3Kδ , PI3Kα, PTEN, p -p70S6K, and p -ERK pre - and post -Zydelig . 
Tumor samples (either bone marrow [BM] or lymph node [LN]) will be examined using 
immunohist ochemistry (IHC).  
• Flow cytometric characterization of circulating MDSCs, NK cells, regulatory T cells, CD 4+ T cells, 
and CD8+ T cells pre -Zydelig  and at 3 time points following the start of Zydelig  (post -Zydelig ) at 
weeks 4 and 12, and at 6 months.  
• Whole exome sequencing of tumor and germline DNA pre -Zydelig  and at relapse post -Zydelig .  
• Participation in the  correlative studies portion of this study is highly encouraged but 
optional.  
 
19.2 Time Points  
Peripheral blood and tumor samples for WES and IHC will be collected at 2 time points:  
 
 Pre-treatment: FFPE or frozen tissue blocks samples taken from patients at time of 
transformation or relapse prior to starting Zydelig  will be acquired . . Tissues obtained closer to 
starting Zydelig  are highly preferred, but earlier biopsies for patients who will not have repeat 
biopsies just prior to study enrollment are acceptable. These samples will serve as a baseline 
for tracking acquired mutations or other genetic alterations associated with th erapy 
resistance at relapse. The purpose of IHC and WES here is to evaluate biochemical and genetic markers for PI3K pathway activation and assessment of recurrent somatic mutations in lymphoma.   
 
 Post -Zydelig  treatment: Samples taken following relapse of lymphoma after SCT and Zydelig  
treatment should be strongly encouraged for all patients, especially for those who had a 
biopsy just prior to starting Zydelig . These samples will be compared to baseline samples  for 
tracking acquired alterations in signaling pathways associated with therapy resistance at 
relapse. The purpose of IHC and WES here is to identify biochemical and genetic factors that may contribute to “escape” from Zydelig -mediated suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, 
and to assess for changes in recurrent somatic mutation profiles and clonal architecture compared to a prior biopsy.  
 
For immunological studies, peripheral blood will be collected immediately prior to starting Zydelig  
and at the following time points after starting Zydelig : 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.  
All samples, except for frozen specimens intended for WES, will be shipped to Maciej Kmieciak, 
PhD at VCU Massey Cancer Center ( 19.6.4). Frozen tumor specimens intended for WES will b e 
shipped to the Fehniger Lab at Washington University ( 19.7 ).

19.9 Sample Processing at Washington University  
Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be isolated from FFPE or frozen tissue samples including diseased tissue and 
paired non -malignant tissue (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Qiagen). Quality control and mass assessments will 
be performed to ensure gDNA integrity prior to sequencing (Agilent bioanalyzer). From gDNA, Illumina sequencing libraries will be generated as described (19
). Whole exome capture will be performed per 
manufacturer’s instruction (Nimblegen V3). Illumina sequencing will be performed as described (19). 
Somatic calls will be made using the latest version of the somatic variant bioinformatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] (The 
Genome Institute at Washington University), utilizing sequencing data from paired lymphoma and non -
malignant tissue. Validation of variants may be confirmed using a custom -capture (Nimblegen), followed 
by [CONTACT_618261] ( 20). 
 
19.10 Sample Tracking  
Submission of all tumor samples will be logged into the appropriate fields in the database.

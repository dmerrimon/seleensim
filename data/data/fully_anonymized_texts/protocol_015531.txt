  4 2  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
Over 130,000 people are diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer (asLC) in the U.S. each 
year. asLC patients experience significant psychological and physical sequellae from the 
disease and its treatment.  Of the few supportive interventions tested in asLC patients, palliative 
care (PC) unequivocally has the strongest evidence base for addressing asLC patients' physical 
and psychological concerns. PC is an interdisciplin
mental, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_757444]. Multiple randomized controlled trials have shown delivering PC 
alongside cancer treatment improves asLC patient outcomes (e.g., symptom burden, quality of 
life) and reduces care costs. The evidence for PC is so strong that national clinical oncology 
guidelines now state PC should be delivered to all asLC patients within 12 weeks of starting 
cancer treatment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_627251], less than 15% of asLC patients receive PC. 
Underutilization of PC is an implementation problem.  
 
Barriers to implementing PC at multiple levels are well documented. Most asLC patients 1) do 
not know what PC is or what concerns it can address, 2) mistakenly equate PC with end of life, 
and 3) are relucta
Cancer care providers 1) do not understand how PC can help manage patient concerns during 
cancer treatment, 2) do not have time to adequately assess and discuss concerns that PC could 
manage, and 3) fear patient reactions when mentioning PC. Finally, healthcare systems rely on 
providers to refer patients to PC, but do not provide the tools or training needed to support PC 
communication and referrals. 
 
Our preliminary work has identified a multilevel implementation strategy as a promising 
approach to improve utilization of PC. We have developed our multilevel implementation 
strategy, called mPal, with patient, provider, and system administrator feedback. We now 
propose to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_757445] 60 patients (30 intervention, 30 
-level implementation strategies or usual 
care; provider and system intervention components will not be randomized.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
A.1. Advanced stage lung cancer (asLC) is common, highly burdensome to patients, and 
disproportionately affects rural residents. Lung cancer has the second highest cancer 
incidence and highest cancer mortality in the U.S.8 Each year, roughly 130,000 people are 
diagnosed with asLC. asLC is associated with high physical and psychosocial morbidities,9 
including poorer physical and role function,10 higher depression,11,12 and more unmet supportive 
care needs compared to other cancers.13 asLC disproportionately affects rural, impoverished, 
medically underserved residents.14 Kentucky leads the nation in asLC incidence and mortality.15  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757443] 9
Protocol [ZIP_CODE] 23 Aug 2023
5A.2. Palliative care (PC) is an evidence-based approach that mitigates patient burden, but 
it is underutilized. PC is an interdisciplinary approach to address the psychological, physical, 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_757446].16In asLC, delivering palliative care 
alongside cancer treatment has improved patient symptom burden, quality of life, mental health, 
as well as key care quality outcomes such as shared decision-making and appropriate end-of-
life care.17-23The evidence behind PC is so strong that national guidelines and accrediting 
agencies now stipulate palliative care should be delivered to all asLC patients within 12 weeks 
of starting treatment.17,24
A.3. Overcoming barriers to PC implementation is a multilevel problem. Unfortunately, 
factors at the patient, provider, and healthcare system level lead to underutilization of PC (Fig. 
1). Less than 15% of patients who could benefit from PC utilize it. Most patients have poor PC knowledge (i.e., do not know what palliative care is or 
what concerns it can address, equate PC with end of 
life, and/or fear using it means stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757447]),25,26will not seek PC without a provider 
recommending it,27and under-report PC concerns to 
their oncology team (see Preliminary Data).[ADDRESS_1037036] poor PC knowledge (i.e., do 
not understand how PC can help manage patient 
concerns during treatment, equate it with end of life), 
are uncertain how to talk about PC with patients, and 
face time constraints during clinic visits to assess and 
address PC needs.28-34Most healthcare systems rely 
on providers to refer patients to PC, yet do not have 
systems in place to help identify appropriate patients 
and facilitate referrals.31,35-47Collectively, barriers to 
PC utilization fall into determinants of knowledge, motivation, and opportunity (Fig. 1).[ADDRESS_1037037] cancer care occurs in the 
community and that asLC disproportionately affects rural residents. A multilevel implementation 
strategy to address all key determinants of PC utilization is clearly needed.  Figure 1. Conceptual Model of PC Implementation Problem

  6 3 OBJECTIVES  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  We hypothesize we will be able to enroll  
mary feasibility outcome), -
month follow-
acceptability, we hypothesize we will be able to achieve mean patient and provider 
ta (n = 30-40 mPal patient 
interviews; n = 6 provider interviews) will further support the ease of use and clinical 
value of mPal. 
 
2. Obtain preliminary data on effectiveness and equity outcomes for a planned trial.  
In line with best practices for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], we are not testing formal hypotheses for 
effectiveness outcomes; however, we will measure patient and provider PC knowledge 
and motivation and PC referrals, which we expect will improve with mPal. For equity 
outcomes, we will explore whether mPal appears similarly effective for patients with 
different characteristics (e.g., rural vs. urban, health literacy, income, race) by [CONTACT_757459]-structured intervention data from mPal patients (n =30-40). 
 
[ADDRESS_1037038] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_757448] 60 advanced stage lung cancer patients (40 mPal; 40 usual care); 6 oncology 
providers will be recruited and receive the provider components of mPal. The primary feasibility 
outcome that will be tested is patient enrollment -
and provider-reported data on effectiveness outcomes (e.g., PC knowledge), PC referrals (from 
the EHR), and will explore ways to improve effectiveness and equity outcomes (i.e., equitable 
reach of intervention) through semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of mPal 
patients (n = 30-40) and providers (n = 6). See Study Schema for assessment timepoints.  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1037039] practices for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], we are testing feasibility, not formal hypotheses 
surrounding effectiveness outcomes. We are not randomizing provider and system-level 
strategies because 1) we do not plan to randomize providers in our next trial (rather, clinics will 
be randomized to start mPal at different times through a stepped-wedge design); and 2) 
intervention contamination would occur within the clinic. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1037040] completed the study if he or she has completed the baseline 
assessment and the follow-up (T2) assessment. A provider is considered to have completed the 
study if they complete the baseline assessment and the follow-up (T3) assessment. The end of 
the study is defined as completion of the follow-up (T2 for patients; T3 for providers) and 
completion of EHR extraction for follow-up outcomes..  
 
[ADDRESS_1037041] meet all of the following 
criteria:  
1. new or recurrent AJCC stage IIIb-IV non-small cell lung cancer or extensive stage small 
cell lung cancer  
2. 18 years of age or older 
3. ECOG performance status 0-3/Karnofsky 40-100; 
4. At least 3 weeks into active oncologic treatment 
5. Receiving treatment at Markey Cancer Center 
 
Rationale: We chose to recruit at least one month after starting treatment to allow patients time to begin treatment and experience treatment-related side effects. 
 
5.2 PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
 
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this 
study: 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] 9 
Protocol [ZIP_CODE]  23 Aug 2023  
  8 1. Unstable brain metastases (i.e., progressive neurological deficits, inadequately 
controlled seizures, or requiring escalating steroid doses);  
2. Cognitive (i.e., dementia) or psychiatric condition (e.g., psychotic disorder) for which 
participating would be inappropriate 
3. Receiving palliative care  
4. Unable to speak and read English. 
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1037042] meet all of the following 
criteria:  
1. Oncologist  
2. Advanced practice providers and nurses who work with enrolled oncologists 
3. Provides care at least a half day a week to advanced stage lung cancer patients at 
Markey Cancer Center  
Note: Fellows will be allowed to participate in this study.  
 
5.4 PROVIDER EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
 
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this 
study: 
1. Unable to speak and read English. 
 
5.5 SCREEN FAILURES 
 
Screen failures will be defined as patients who consent to participate in this study but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention due to ineligibility or are assigned to 
intervention, but do not meet eligibility criteria and are withdrawn by [CONTACT_431]. Patients who 
do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial because of meeting one or more exclusion 
criteria that are likely to change over time may be rescreened. Examples include improvement 
in functional status and a progression of disease or disease recurrence for which a patient will 
begin treatment for advanced stage disease. Rescreened participants will be assigned the same 
participant number as for the initial screening. 
 
5.6 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, PARTICIPANT COMPENSATION 
 
Recruitment and Enrollment.   
As in prior work, we will use two primary recruitment strategies: direct patient referral from 
oncologists and providers at the Markey Cancer Center and review of patient (per report of 
patients coming to clinic with diagnostic codes for advanced stage lung cancer) and provider 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] [ADDRESS_1037043]. Study personnel will identify upcoming oncology appointments of 
patients pre-screened for eligibility. Study personnel will then recruit patients in person at clinic 
appointments, by [CONTACT_756], Zoom, or through MyChart® after confirming with the oncology 
team that it is okay to approach the patient. 
We are requesting a waiver of HIPAA authorization for recruitment purposes. This 
waiver will allow us to review appointment schedules at the MCC to pre-screen potential 
patients for eligibility through the electronic health record. Patients will be pre-screened for 
documentation in their EHR for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities. Men and women of all races and ethnicities who meet 
the above-described eligibility criteria are eligible to participate in this study.  We expect 
approximately 42% of participants to be women. Translating this to our sample size estimate of 
80, we plan to enroll at least [ADDRESS_1037044] our catchment area (87% White, 9% Black or African 
American, <2% Hispanic, <1% Asian, <1% Native American).  
 
Retention.  We will use previous retention strategies, including reminding patients of study 
visits, and offering sessions and assessments when they are in clinic for care. 
 
Participant Compensation. Patients will receive a $[ADDRESS_1037045] for completing the baseline 
assessment (T0), $10 for T1 survey, $10 for the T1 interview (mPal only), $30 for the 8-week 
follow-up (T2), and $10 for the T2 interview (mPal only). Providers will have the option to accept 
$20 gift cards for completing T0 (baseline), $10 for T1 (post mPal viewing), $20 for completing 
T3 (~[ADDRESS_1037046]-mPal implementation) surveys; and $30 for the interview. 
 6 STUDY INTERVENTION 
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION ADMINISTRATION 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION 
 
Theoretical Model and Implementation Strategies Underlying mPal. mPal is based in the 
application of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model of Behavior (COM-B) and the 
Behavior Change Wheel.55,56 The COM-B distills 14 theory-based constructs that explain 
behavior (e.g., knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, environmental resources) into three 
(e.g., knowledge); motivation to the processes energizing and directing behavior; and 
opportunity to factors beyond a person that enable a behavior. The Behavior Change Wheel 
specifies intervention functions (e.g., education) that target the COM-B constructs. The COMB-
B/BCW model has been used to develop interventions and study their implementation in 
healthcare.57,[ADDRESS_1037047] of strategies59 and Preliminary Studies. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] 9 
Protocol [ZIP_CODE]  23 Aug 2023  
  10 mPal Content and Procedures. See attachments for intervention content. Operational details 
of the mPal intervention appear in Table 1.  mPal's patient content can be delivered either 
through MyChart via a "MyChart questionnaire" or a web-based tool (developed with Markey 
Cancer Center in [LOCATION_006] IRB# [ZIP_CODE]). The mPal patient content is comprised of two components: 
(1) a one-time educational video and knowledge check questions that seek to educate patients 
about palliative care; and (2) a palliative care needs screener (e.g., symptom concerns, 
psychological, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]) with questions about whether patients would like to meet with palliative 
care or discuss palliative care and their palliative care needs with their oncology provider. 
Procedures for viewing the mPal patient educational tool will vary based on whether a patient 
has MyChart. Patients with MyChart will be sent a research message requesting they complete 
mPal roughly two days before their next clinic appointment. They can complete this either in 
clinic on a tablet with study staff or from home. Patients who do not have a MyChart account will 
view Markey's web-based tool on a tablet with study staff in clinic or through a personal link 
provided via REDCap. Patients responses to the mPal palliative care needs screener and desire 
for palliative care will be entered in their electronic health record for their oncology provider to 
view. As part of the intervention, study staff will distribute the Markey Cancer Center palliative 
care FAQ document to participants that indicate yes to wanting more palliative care information 
on the mPal tool. The delivery methods for this document include email, mail, in-person 
distribution, or distribution through MyChart or EPIC as part of an after-visit summary.  
After patients complete the initial palliative care screener, it will be re-administered to patients at 
future oncology treatment visits up to [ADDRESS_1037048] to re-review the mPal education, it will be provided to them.  
-based tool that provides education on: 1) Evidence for 
PC, clinical guidelines, and practice standards; 2) Education about common misconceptions of 
provider-facing procedures/content; and 5) case examples showing the use of mPal in PC 
discussions during LC care.

6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING 
 
As described in Table 1, the patient intervention will be delivered during a routine oncology visit 
or at home through MyChart. It is expected to take ~15-20 minutes. Provider intervention 
content will be delivered at an existing lung cancer meeting or online through REDCap. It is 
expected to take ~15-[ADDRESS_1037049]. McLouth (PI) and the 
study team will conduct an in-person training with review of procedures and role plays. Dr. 
McLouth or another study team member will observe the first 2-3 patient intervention sessions in 
clinic and additional sessions as needed. The study coordinator who meets patients in clinic to 
show them the mPal tool will attend weekly team meetings to receive supervision.

This is a randomized controlled trial design (patient-level randomization). Study staff and 
patients will not be blinded to allocation; however, study staff and patients will not know 
allocation until after a patient has completed the baseline questionnaire. The statistician will 
generate the randomization table, which will be implemented through REDCap.

7.1 CONTROL CONDITION DESCRIPTION 
 
Only the patient level component of mPal is randomized.  Patients not randomized to the mPal 
patient implementation strategies will receive usual care. 
 
8 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
 
8.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION 
 
If a patient or provider discontinues the intervention, but not the study, remaining study 
procedures will be completed (e.g., post-assessment). Patients and providers who discontinue 
the intervention will be asked to indicate the reason why they are discontinuing (e.g., 
intervention burden,; see withdrawal form). post-assessment is due to be 
completed within [ADDRESS_1037051] assessment will be administered at the originally 
scheduled assessment.  
 
Patients may be discontinued from the intervention by [CONTACT_757461]. The study will document reasons for discontinuing a patient.

Protocol [ZIP_CODE]  23 Aug 2023  
  13  
 
8.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
 
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons: 
 
 Significant study intervention non-compliance  
 Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130] (see Section 8.3, Lost to Follow-Up) 
 Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of 
follow-up  study data would not be in the best interest of the participant (Note: Patients 
who become hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757449]).   The patient meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed [e.g., change in mental 
status] or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded. 
Patients who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the study intervention may be 
replaced. Patients who sign the informed consent form and receive the study intervention and 
subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study, will not be replaced. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1037052] 3 attempts.  
 
The following actions will be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
 
 Staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299], reschedule the missed intervention within 10 
days, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and determine if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study 
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or staff will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, [ADDRESS_1037053] known mailing address). These contact [CONTACT_757462]. 
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
 
[ADDRESS_1037054] be enrolled by (21 day window), eligibility 
criteria (e.g., performance status, time on cancer treatment, age, etc.), whether the patient is 
being rescreened for eligibility, and, if rescreened, the last date of screening. If deemed 
potentially eligible, additional fields will appear in the eligibility database for tracking dates of 
upcoming appointments and contact [CONTACT_98995]. Patients must be enrolled within 21 days of 
screening or else they will need to be rescreened.  
 
Administration of Questionnaires.  Patient-reported measures related to a future efficacy trial 
and of treatment processes were chosen based on their validity and sensitivity to change in 
cancer patients60 and recommendation for clinical trials. These measures will be completed by 
[CONTACT_379545]-intervention (TP0), ~4 weeks after baseline (T1), and post-intervention (~8-weeks 
after T0; TP2) on paper, online (REDCap), or by [CONTACT_648]. For patients who use MyChart®, a link 
to the REDCap survey will be provided through a study research message delivered in 
MyChart®. Patients will use a participation ID on their questionnaires. If more than 30 days pass 
between baseline and participant viewing the mPal tool, key sections (e.g., palliative care 
knowledge, palliative care use) of the baseline questionnaire will be re-administered prior to 
viewing mPal. See Table [ADDRESS_1037055] built for those patients who enroll. 
 
Interviews. Patients assigned to mPal (n = 20-40) will complete two interviews. The interviews 
will last approximately 10-[ADDRESS_1037056] over the phone, 
Zoom, or in-person, according to patient preference. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_757463]. After each interview, the interviewer will write up observations in the 
form of field notes, which will include information about the setting (e.g., details about room if in-
person vs. on the phone), personal environment (e.g.
responses. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim, the transcripts checked for accuracy and 
deidentified.

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
  
Primary Endpoint: We hypothesize that at least 60% of eligible patients approached will enroll in 
the mPal intervention.  
 
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
 
The sample size of 80 patients is based on the goal of estimating the probabilities and means 
1,63 
feasibility outcomes to inform a future trial. For structured interviews, we anticipate we will be 
able to identify key themes with 20 interviews.64  
 
10.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES 
 
The patient sample (n = 40 mPal; n = 40 usual care) will be used to analyze feasibility and 
acceptability data and describe pre-post changes in patient-reported outcomes. The provider 
sample (n = 6) will be used to demonstrate feasibility of measurement collection.  
 
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
 
10.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH 
 
We will use descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, median, range) to examine the 
distribution of continuous variables. We will calculate 95% CIs for each of the feasibility 
measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with our data.  
 
We will use one-sample negative binomial probabilities and tests of binomial proportions to 
compare to hypothesized values. We will summarize reasons for ineligibility and refusal and 
compare patients who drop out or do not adhere by [CONTACT_604766].  
Ordinal scaled variables such as feasibility and acceptability will be compared between groups 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] 9 
Protocol [ZIP_CODE]  23 Aug 2023  
  17 before and after baseline (as well as change from baseline) using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
statistic.  Within group comparison of the pre versus post baseline measures will be evaluated 
using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank statistic.  
 
We will use qualitative methods to analyze patient and provider feedback from the exit 
appropriateness ratings of the intervention. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim and 
managed in ATLAS.ti or other qualitative software for analysis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_757450] (e.g., perceived impact of mPal on clinical care, barriers, facilitators 
to using mPal, suggested changes to improve equity of mPal). Data will be analyzed using 
thematic content analysis65 to describe perceptions.  
 
Statistical significance will be indicated by p < .05.  
 
10.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) 
 
 A one-sample binomial test will be 
used to compare the observed enrollment percentage to 60%.  
 
Enrollment (primary): Number of patients enrolled divided by [CONTACT_757465]: The percentage of patients and providers who complete baseline and follow-
up questionnaires. 
Acceptability: Mean post-treatment patient and provider 3.5/5 on intervention 
acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness (psychometrically validated measure; 
Table 2), and a brief semi-structured interview to explore factors associated with 
acceptability.  
 
10.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 
 
We will describe pre-post changes in the patient-reported outcome variables related to a future 
trial using univariate and bivariate statistics. Our chief goals will be to estimate the standard 
deviations of our key variables for use in planning future studies. We will examine, through the 
use of t-tests, whether pre-post changes in the mPal differ significantly from pre-post changes in 
the control group. If our intervention is successful, we would expect to see significantly greater 
improvement over time in our effectiveness outcomes (PC knowledge, motivation) in treatment 
vs. control. We will also examine correlations between changes in these measures and PC 
referrals; we expect changes in PC knowledge and motivation variables will be positively 
correlated with changes in PC referrals within both treatment and control groups.

  18 11 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1037059] fall into three 
categories: (a) risks associated with the intervention; (b) risks associated with research 
assessments, and (c) risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality.  We describe each 
below. 
 Risks of the intervention.  The intervention has no known risks. However, it is possible 
that for people who have misperceptions about palliative care (e.g., that it is only for people for 
whom cancer treatment is not working), there may be an initial negative reaction to being 
presented information about palliative care.  It is also possible that some people may 
experience some mild distress when completing the palliative care needs assessment, which 
asks about common lung cancer symptoms and concerns (e.g., worry about family members). 
Both risks are expected to be rare occurrences and mild in severity.   
        Risks associated with research assessments.  The instruments and methodologies are 
well tested and are not known to cause problems or distress on the part of the participants; 
however, there is the possibility that some individuals may find answering the questions 
distressing (e.g., asking about their palliative care knowledge) or boring. This risk is expected to 
be a rare occurrence and mild in severity.  
 Risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality and privacy.  There is a risk 
of loss of confidentiality and privacy as patients may be met in person at Markey Cancer Center 
or receive phone/Zoom calls, emails, or MyChart® messages from the study coordinator. In 
addition, patients will complete research assessments using an online form in REDCap, which 
could possibly result in a loss of confidentiality. However, the research team will take every 
precaution to safeguard participant data. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1037060] a fully powered randomized 
controlled trial of mPal. It is also possible that patients who receive the mPal intervention may 
benefit from receiving education about an evidence-based intervention in cancer care (palliative 
care) which may impact their care and improve health outcomes. These benefits may or may 
not occur for any and all participants. Participants may experience some benefit from feeling 
that they have contributed to a study that can help inform ways to help future lung cancer 
patients.  For society as a whole, the findings will inform future intervention development and 
testing with lung cancer patients. Future patients may benefit from an intervention that is low 
burden in terms of time and cost, potentially widely available due to delivery mode, and aligned 
with personal values and unmet supportive care needs.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1037061] what they learned about palliative care (e.g., that it is not the same as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], that it can be delivered at any time or stage of disease).  
Protection for risks associated with assessment.  Patients will give voluntary 
responses to questions; they are told that they can decline to answer any questions that they 
choose. If patients express distress or frustration with the questions, study staff will remind them 
that these questions are voluntary and that they are meant to apply to a broad range of patients 
and 
study PI, Dr. McLouth or other qualified member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_476]. If concerns 
remain, participants will be directed either to the chair of the IRB to discuss their concerns about 
the assessments and will be referred for psychological services at the Markey Cancer Center. 
Protection for risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality.   Prior to any 
contact [CONTACT_757466], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_757451]. Further, all study staff will complete training in Good Clinical Practice, which is required for 
clinical trial research.  
survey site, REDCap. REDCap requires HTTPS login access. Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
Secure (HTTPS) is a combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the SSL/TLS protocol 
to provide encryption and secure identification of the server. HTTPS connections are used for 
payment transactions on the Internet and for sensitive transactions in corporate information 
systems. Assessments completed on the phone with the study coordinator will be conducted an 
agreed upon time by [CONTACT_757467]. The study 
coordinator will complete the phone assessments from a private office. At the start of the call, 
the study coordinator will query whether it is a good time and whether the participant is 
comfortable answering questions in their current location.  
Data for all participants will be kept strictly confidential, except as mandated by [CONTACT_2371].  All 
electronic data will be kept on [LOCATION_006] OneDrive or REDCap. Any paper documentation will be kept 
in locked file cabinets or a locked file room.  Participants will be assigned a numerical code for 
identification in the files.  Names and other identifiers will be kept in separate password 
protected files.  Audio data

needed or whether emergency services are needed. If the patient is able to continue the study,

judgment based upon the data and any additional information acquired through interview. 
Referrals and assistance will be given in obtaining appropriate treatment for any participant 
terminated from the study for safety issues.  Reports will be filed with all necessary governing 
bodies, including the University of Kentucky IRB. 
 11.2 SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
11.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
This study is considered to carry a low risk to patients. AEs will be reported if they are study 
related. For example, patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757453]. However, if the AE could be related the 
study (i.e., there is a temporal relationship between the study procedures and the event or 
reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study procedures and the AE), it will be reported as an AE. An example of an AE for this 
study would be severe distress during the intervention session that requires additional clinical 
management for safety. Any psychiatric condition that is present at the time the patient is 
screened and enrolled will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if reported as an AE.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or other qualified Co-I will be responsible for reviewing the AE to grade its severity 
(mild, moderate, severe) and relatedness (definitely, probably, potentially) to the study 
intervention.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1037063] with the PI.  
 
There will be ongoing communication among the research team. This will be facilitated by: 1) 
regular (weekly or bi-weekly) meetings with project staff and investigators to discuss study 
progress, reactions to the intervention, and any adverse events; 2) supervision of the study 
coordinator, and data manager. For medical adverse events, patients will contact [CONTACT_757468]. 
  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] [ADDRESS_1037064] learns of the event. 
 
11.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
 
11.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_31279] (OHRP).  OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria: 
 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied; 
 Re
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 
 Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized. 
 
An example of an unanticipated problem would include loss of data or sensitive information due 
to a study laptop being stolen or a complaint from a participant or participant family member. If a 
participant complaint identifies a newly recognized risk, the informed consent document will be 
updated and previously enrolled participants will be informed of the additional potential risk.

12.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT 
 
For patients, written documentation of informed consent will be required prior to completing the 
baseline assessment and randomization. The consent form will describe the intervention, 
randomization, study procedures, including audiorecording of the semi-structured interviews, 
risks, and potential benefits.  
 
For providers, a study cover letter will be required prior to baseline assessment. The cover letter 
will describe the intervention, study procedures, including audiorecording of the semi-structured 
interview, risks, and potential benefits.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION 
 
Patients will provide written informed consent through a combined consent/HIPAA release form. 
The consent will describe the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and provide PI [INVESTIGATOR_715412]. The consent form will describe randomization and the two potential conditions 
(mPal intervention or usual care). It will also describe the possibility of being asked to complete 
an interview and the procedures for recording the interviews. Patients will be consented in 
person or remotely via REDCap or paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_757454]. When consenting patients in 
person, we will ensure we are meeting in a private space with the patient (e.g., physician exam 
room, consult room, infusion room). When consenting patients remotely, we will first ensure the 
patient is in a place where they have privacy and feel comfortable having a conversation. We 
will then review the consent form over the phone or Zoom. The consent form will be reviewed 
with study personnel and patients will have opportunity to ask questions. To check 
understanding, patients will be asked to describe their understanding of key aspects of the study 
(rationale, what is involved, decision not to participate not affecting their medical care) and study 
staff will review any aspects that do not appear to be understood. As part of the consent, all 
patients will be asked to consent to a HIPAA release for permission to use the following 
protected health information, as well as the information collected for eligibility screening: 
age 
gender 
racial/ethnic data 
zip code

A copy of the consent form will be sent with the patient on paper or electronically and retained 
via paper or electronically for study records.  
 
For oncology providers, we will provide a study information sheet (cover letter). The study 
information sheet will be provided online (REDCap), paper, over the phone, or emailed (see 
protocol [ZIP_CODE] for precedent). If reviewed over the phone, the study team will email the 
participant a copy of the study information sheet and review key information verbally. Providers 
will have opportunity to ask questions about the study. Completion of the survey and interview  
will indicate implied consent. Surveys and interviews pose no more than minimal risk to the 
provider and involve no procedures for which consent would normally be required outside a 
research setting. Study information (purpose, study requirements, risks/benefits, who to contact 
[CONTACT_561307], contact [CONTACT_511159]) will be provided and potential participants 
will be invited to contact [CONTACT_757469]. Potential 
participants can refuse to participate in this study.

12.1.3  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
 
Quality control procedures will be implemented as follows: 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_757439] 9 
Protocol [ZIP_CODE]  23 Aug 2023  
  24 Informed consent. Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as 
well as a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice, accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be 
provided to the study team to ensure proper consenting procedures are followed .  
 
Source documents and the electronic data.  Some data will be initially captured on source 
documents (see Section 12.1.4, Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ), but all will ultimately be 
entered into the study database.   
 
The study team will download the REDCap data after the first [ADDRESS_1037067] data entered by [CONTACT_757470]. 
Specifically, the study team will compare the patient-reported packet with entries in REDCap for 
50% of the data. The study team will review medical record data extracted for accuracy and 
consult with [CONTACT_757477] or other member of the thoracic oncology team on the protocol if there 
are questions about clinical data.  
 
Intervention Fidelity. Consistent delivery of the study intervention will be monitored throughout 
the intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are 
described in Section 6.2.1, Interventionist Training and Tracking .  
 
Protocol Deviations . Protocol compliance will be monitored and discussed at weekly team 
meetings. The study team will review protocol deviations and will implement corrective actions 
when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern. 
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_72743], source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by

provides a real-time record of any changes made to data. 
Patient-reported outcome data will be collected via mail, telephone, or in-person. Based on our 
prior studies, we anticipate that most patients will complete the assessments in-person with the 
study coordinator when they are at the Markey Cancer Center for other oncologic appointments.

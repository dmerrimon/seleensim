 4 2 SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
A total of 10 amendments were made to the protocol Table 1 ; of these, Amendment 2 (protocol 
v3.0) was only an internal Genmab document and never distributed to sites or submitted to any 
health authorities.  
Table 1 Protocol Amendments  
Amendm ent Number/  
Protocol Version and Date  Key Changes  
Global Amendment 10  
(Protocol v11.0)  
30 June 2021  • To allow analysis and reporting of the trial, while permitting the 3 remaining subjects to stay on 
treatment and be followed per protocol.  
• At the time of this Amendment, the Dose Escalation part and the enrollment of the Expansion part of trial had been c ompleted; [ADDRESS_680572] 7 months, which was considered sufficient to evaluate efficacy and safety.  
• With this amendment, the 3 subjects still on treatment will continue treatment and be followed with reduced procedures and visits. (Refer to the protocol Appendix VI and Table 31 for 
applicable procedures and assessments as of Amendment 10 .) 
• Sections [ADDRESS_680573] the analysis of efficacy and safety per data cut -off date and clinical trial 
reporting plans. The plan to present QTc analyses in a separate report was removed.
  
Note: Amendment 10 (protocol v11.0) did not have any impact on the current reporting, since this 
amendment was generated after the data cut -off date for this CSR.  
Global Amendment 9 
(Protocol v10.0)  
09 December 2019  • Added Cohort [ADDRESS_680574] population as Cohort 2, the 1.0 mg/kg 
3Q4W schedule adding up to 37  subjects to be treated.  
• Added a rationale for the subgroup of the subjects in Cohort 2 at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, which was not inclu ded in Amendment 8.  
• Excluded s ubjects who experienced hyper -progressive disease during prior checkpoint inhibi tor 
therapy.  
• Reduced number of visits as visits are a burden for subjects.  
• Clarified pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments – Expansion.  
• Added peripheral neuropathy reporting requirements to enhance data collection and facilitate the understanding and characterization of the event.  
• Clarified data summarized for subjects with NSCLC without epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)/ALK mutations.  
• Removed interim analysis for futility for Cohorts 6 and 8.  
Global Amendment 8  
(Protocol v9.0)  
21 October 2019  • Implemented more stringent dose modification guidance for treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) of peripheral neuropathy.  
• Modified PK sampling.  
• In an attempt to improve the observed tolerability profile and expand the possible therapeutic 
window for  enapotamab vedotin, a limited number of subjects could be enrolled in Cohort 2 on a 
starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  
• In order to  obtain 25 fresh biopsies from Cohort  6, up to 15 additional subjects could be 
recruited.  
• Implemented to further explore the potential of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the 3Q4W 
schedule.  
• Clarified that adjuvant or maintenance treatment would be counted as 1 regimen, together with the relevant surgery or primary treatment.  
• Revised inclusion criteria. The reference to adjuvant and maintenance treatment was no longer relevant for the inclusion criterion.  
• Relaxed the restriction criteria, as the restriction of up to 3 lines of prior treatment proved to be challenging for enrolment as many subjects failed more than 3 lines.

 5 Amendm ent Number/  
Protocol Version and Date  Key Changes  
• Clarified ho w long dosing could be delayed for and how the resumption of dosing should be 
handled for the 3Q4W dosing schedule.  
• Spain was included as a country in the trial.  
Global Amendment 7  
(Protocol v8.0)  
18 June 2019  • Excluded subjects with ongoing pneumonitis at Screening or with a history of non- infectious 
pneumonitis that required steroids. The protocol was amended to allow for inclusion of subjects 
who had pneumonitis in the past if more than 6 months prior to enrollment, if subjects were asympto matic, did not require any steroid treatment, and had no radiologic evidence of 
pneumonitis.  
• In order to maximize the clinical benefit for subjects, the treatment interruption window was not limited to 2 weeks but allowed for a longer period of recovery pr ior to re -starting treatment.  
• Figure was deleted as details in dose reduction were clear enough in Table 5 and text.  
• Clarified that every effort should be made to document disease progression by [CONTACT_524704] (RECIST) even though subject was discontinued from trial treatment, eg, due to an adverse event (AE).  
•  
 
• Clarified text around confirmation of response according to RECIST and guidance added around 
scans in case of discontinuation due to an AE, ie, that scans should continue until progression, start of new cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent or death, even though trial treatment was prematurely withdrawn.  
• Clarified timing of scans, ie, that they need to be calendar based, regardless of trial drug administration delay.  
• Clarified that unscheduled scans should be performed if clinically indicated and all additional scans should be submitted to the Independent Review Committee (IRC) for independent review for subjects in the Expansion part.  
• Clarified that both investigator disease assessments as well as IRC assessment would be used for analysis.  
• Added clarification on expectations where bronchoscopy-guided biopsies may be allowed.  
• Noted that the information on investigator assessment of the clinical significance of lab values was not included in the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) dataset and therefore could not be extracted for inclusion in listings.  
• The treatment algorithm was changed from a limited number of cycles to treatment until progression of the underlying disease per RECIST was detected.  
Global Amendment 6  
(Protocol v7.0)  
07 December 2018  • Modified some of the inclusion criteria for the expansion cohorts to further define the exact 
target subject population and to guard subject safety during the trial.  
• Due to emerging safety data, a new subsection on dose modifications for immune -related AE s 
was introduced for optimal management of these events.  
• The possibility to conduct further safety review after 36 and 100 subjects in the Expansion part was added.

 6 Amendm ent Number/  
Protocol Version and Date  Key Changes  
Global Amendment 5  
(Protocol v6.0)  
11 October 2018  • Additional subjects to be enrolled i n Coh ort [ADDRESS_680575] part of inclusion 
criterion #1.  
• Newly i dentified risks, including peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia, were described for 
enapotamab vedotin in Version 4.0 of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Based on this IB update, 
new subsections were added describing the relevant safety findings.  
• Throughout the protocol, changed the INN name [CONTACT_524795]-AXL -ADC to enapotamab vedotin.  
• Expansion part: cohort(s) used throughout the protocol instead of arm(s).  
Global Amendment 4  
(Protocol v5.0)  
12 April 2018  • A 7th arm with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer subjects was added to the Expansion part of the 
trial. By [CONTACT_524705], the planned number of subjects also increased.  
• An interim analysis for futility for all cohorts was introduced. This provided a mechanism to 
reduce the number of subjects exposed to a potentially inefficient experimental therapy.  
• Subjects who benefit from the treatment were offered continued treatment within the scope of the protocol until their disease progressed or until they experienced unacceptable toxicity.  
• A subject diar y was introduced in order to capture information on prophylactic use of stool 
softeners to prevent constipation. The diary also captured changes in stool frequency and consistency.  
Global Amendment 3  
(Protocol v4.0)  
25 September 2017  
  • Introduced the updated mitigation plan for handling of constipation as well as introducing safety 
blood samples to be collected locally [ADDRESS_680576] administration.  
• Clarified the visit window of Cycle 2 Visit 1 i n order to ensure that the DLT evaluation period 
during Cycle 1 completed as planned before initiation of Cycle 2.  
• Updated time windows for some of the assessments of vital signs in order to allow for practical and safe assessments.  
Amendment 2  
(Protocol v3.0)  
[ADDRESS_680577] 2017  Amendment 2 (protocol v3.0) was never distributed; only internal document at Genmab.  
 
Global Amendment 1  
(Protocol v2.0)  
16 December 2016  • Included melanoma cancer as an additional indication in the trial.  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria were updated.  
• Genetic and proteomic analyses were removed.  
• Updated and clarified the sampling, timing, specification, handling and methods of the 
exploratory analyses.  
• Storage of the biological samples in the trial was clarified.

Methodology : 
This is an open -label, multi -center Phase I/IIa safety trial of enapotamab vedotin in a mixed 
population of patients with solid tumors known from the literature to overexpress Axl and 
where the use of systemic tubulin inhibitors is part of Standard of Care (SoC). The tria l consists 
of two parts; a dose escalation part (phase I, first -in-human [FIH]) and an expansion part (phase 
IIa). The dose escalation part has two dose escalation arms: the first one investigates a once 
every 3 weeks (1Q3W) dose schedule and the second on e investigates a three administrations 
over 4 weeks (3Q4W) dose schedule.  
When a minimum of [ADDRESS_680597] been treated and evaluated for Dose Limiting Toxicities 
(DLTs), the 1.5 mg/kg cohort has been declared safe on the 1Q3W arm, and the predicted AUC 
on the starting dose in 3Q4W arm is below pre -defined limits, the 3Q4W arm will be initiated.  
In November 2020, Genmab decided to discontinue development of enapotamab vedotin  
but continue to offer treatment to patients who are deriving clinical benefit in  the present 
trial. With  Amendment 10, procedures and visits are reduced for the 3 remaining patients 
active  on trial t reatment.   
 
Number of Patients : 
In total, approximately  426 patients can be enrolled in this trial. Assuming an anticipated screen 
failure rate of 30%, up to [ADDRESS_680598] 15 patients per cohort, up to 15 patients may 
be additionally recruited per cohort leading to a maximum of 37 patients enrolled per cohort 
except for Cohort 2 , where up to 60 additional patients will be en rolled in order to further 
understand the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and biomarker findings of enapotamab vedotin as 
an efficacy signal has been observed in this population of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients without EGFR/ALK mutations . 
A sub-group of the patients in Cohort 2 (up to 30 patients), may be enrolled on a dose of 
1.8 mg/kg to further understand the tolerability profile and to extend the therapeutic window of 
enapotamab vedotin.  
Furthermore, if considered necessary (as assessed by  [CONTACT_1578] [DMC] 
and the sponsor Safety Committee [SC]) selected arm(s) might be explored on both dosing

Page 16 of 259 schedules from the dose escalation without increasing the total number of patients to be 
included in the trial.  
In Cohort 6, 30 pa tients with solid tumors (except for NSCLC, melanoma, sarcoma, and ovarian 
cancer patients, unless having a known AXL gene amplification) who have failed a PD -1/PD -
L1 inhibitor and are able to provide the required fresh tumor biopsy will be enrolled.  
For further exploration of the safety and efficacy profile of the 3Q4W schedule, patients in 
Cohort 6 will be enrolled on a dose of 1.0 mg/kg administered 3Q4W, which was determined 
to be the MTD for this schedule in the dose escalation part of the trial. Pref erably, no more than 
8 patients should be recruited for one tumor type in this cohort.  
In order to obtain sufficient evaluable fresh tumor biopsies , up to 15 additional patients may be 
recruited in Cohort 6 to ensure that 25 fresh biopsies are acquired. A  maximum of 45  patients 
may therefore be enrolled in Cohort 6. A higher number of biopsies are required in this cohort 
due to the mixture of tumor types being enrolled.  
Cohort 8 will further explore the safety and efficacy of the 1.0 mg/kg 3Q4W schedule in  
NSCLC patients without EGFR/ALK mutations. This is the same patient population as Cohort 
[ADDRESS_680599] already been obtained. The 
benefit/risk balance will be evaluated on an ongoing basis in  this cohort.  
An interim analysis for futility will be performed after 22 patients per cohort (minus Cohort s 6 
and 8 ) if there are <  15 patients with evaluable fresh biopsies in the corresponding cohort. Based 
on the results, further recruitment to the cor responding cohort may be stopped.

Page 25 of 259 Enapotamab vedotin will be supplied in vials containing 40 mg of enapotamab vedotin as 
lyophilized powder. The powder should be reconstituted with 4 mL water for injection leading 
to a 10  mg/mL soluti on.  
The reconstituted enapotamab vedotin should be diluted into 0.9% NaCl 100 mL infusion bag 
according to the dose assigned to the patient.  
Enapotamab vedotin (lyophilized vials) should be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C.  
The infusion must be com pleted within [ADDRESS_680627] be used for the infusion. The entire infusion volume 
from the prepared infusion bag needs to be administered. No dead volume is provided.  
 
Trea tment Administration  
Enapotamab vedotin will be administered as an intravenous infusion. Each patient’s dose will 
be calculated based on the patient’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram, i.e.,  assigned 
cohort dose in mg/kg   body weight in kg. For pati ents whose body mass index (BMI) is greater 
than 30  kg/m2, the investigator should use a weight that, based on the patient’s height, 
corresponds to a maximum BMI of 30.  
The dose is calculated according to the following formula if BMI is greater than 30 kg/ m2: 
Dose (mg) = x (mg/kg) * 30 (kg/m2)* height (m) * height (m) (where x denotes the dose level)  
Enapotamab vedotin will be administered over a minimum of [ADDRESS_680628] and second 
patient in each dose cohort to account for any safety concerns in each new dose.  
 
Data Monitoring Committee : 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will evaluate the data obtained at each dose level and 
will recommend whether the dose should be escalated as per protocol, revised to a lower level 
or intermediate level, halted altogether or include more patients at the same dose level to 
evaluate safety.  
Following each DMC meeting, a sponsor SC meeting will be held to discuss and confirm 
actions recommended by [CONTACT_1363].

Duration of Treatment : 
Dependent on which dose -escalation arm the patient is recruited to, enapotama b vedotin will 
be administered either 1Q3W or 3Q4W. The patients will receive treatment with enapotamab 
vedotin until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has been observed. Patients will be 
followed for 52 weeks after end of treatment. In the expa nsion part of the trial, up to 
349 patients will receive enapotamab vedotin at the MTD/RP2D s found in either 1Q3W or 
3Q4W schedule as recommended by [CONTACT_524709].  
When a patient completes or withdraws from treatment, th ey should come for an end of 
treatment visit as soon as possible.  
 
Criteria for Evaluation : 
Primary Endpoints  
• Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)  
• Adverse events (AEs): incidences of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), infusion -
related AEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, and  AEs related to enapotamab vedotin during the trial.  
Secondary Endpoints  
• Safety laboratory parameters (hematology and biochemistry).  
• PK parameters (clearance, volume of distribution and area -under -the-concentration -
time curve [AUC 0-Clast and AUC 0-∞], maxim um concentration [C max], time of C max 
[Tmax], pre dose values, and half -life of enapotamab vedotin and free toxin monomethyl 
auristatin E [MMAE]).  
• Immunogenicity of enapotamab vedotin (anti -drug antibodies).  
• Anti-tumor activity measured by [CONTACT_54079] (based on computerized tomography 
[CT] -scan evaluations), as well as change in CA  125 in patients with ovarian cancer and 
change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) in patients with castration -resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC).  
• Objective Response, Progressio n-Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DoR) and 
Overall survival (OS).  
• Axl expression in the tumor biopsy.

Statistical Methods : 
The statistical  analyses  will be performed  by a Contract Research Organization (CRO) , 
under the direction of sponsor personnel. Any data analysis carried out independently by [CONTACT_524710].  
All data will be listed. Also, data  will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  (continuous  
data)  and/or  contingency  tables  (categorical  data)  for demographic  and baseline  characteristics,  
efficacy  measurements,  safety  measurements,  and all relevant  pharmacokinetic  measurements.  
The results will be presented by [CONTACT_941] 1Q3W and 3Q4W dose escalation and expansion parts 
separately. Also, the results will be presented by [CONTACT_524711]. In the dose -escalation 1Q3W 
and 3Q4W arms of the trial, groups are def ined by [CONTACT_2715] -levels. In the expansion part, groups are 
defined by [CONTACT_524712]. The results from the patients in the expansion part will be 
presented 2 times: by [CONTACT_524713] . In addition, for NSCLC patients without 
EGFR/ALK mutations,  data will be summarized based on different dosing regimens, e.g., 1.8 
mg/kg 1Q3W, 2.2 mg/kg 1Q3W . The final analysis of trial data will be based on all patient data 
of the escalation and expansion phases.  
For the sake of the statistical analyses and summa ries, baseline is defined as the available data 
from the latest recorded measurement made before the first enapotamab vedotin administration.  
Details  of statistical  analysis  and data reporting  will be provided  in a Statistical  Analysis  Plan 
(SAP)  document  finalized  prior  to database  lock. Additional analyses may be added in the SAP 
and tables, listings and figures shells will also be provided.  
In November 2020, Genmab decided to discontinue development of enapotamab vedotin  
but continue to offer treatment t o patients who are deriving clinical benefit in the present 
trial. With Amendment 10, the dose escalation part and the enrollment of the dose 
expansion part of trial have been completed. Three patients remain on treatment. The [ADDRESS_680629] 7 months, which is considered sufficient to 
evaluate efficacy and safety. An analysis is therefore planned, i.e. data collected up to and 
including the data cutoff date will be included in the CSR. Furthermore, limited AE and 
SAE data fro m data cutoff to the time of database lock for the three active patients will 
be included. Data collected after the data cutoff date until the end of trial will be reported 
in an addendum to the CSR, once the trial is completed.

Page 35 of 259 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
2.1 Introduction  
Axl (also named Ark, Ufo, Tyro 7) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Human Axl 
consists of 894 amino acids and is a single chain glycoprotein. Together with Tyro -3 and Mer, Axl 
forms the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which  is characterized by [CONTACT_524715] -like domains (Ig1 and Ig2) and two fibronectin type III domains (FN1 and FN2) 
in the extracellular domain. Furthermore, these receptors have an intracellular tyrosine kinase 
domain that is activated upon ligand stimu lation. Growth arrest -specific 6 ( Gas6) is the 
physiological ligand of Axl that binds to the Axl Ig1 - and Ig2 -domains, resulting in activation of 
the intracellular kinase domain.  Generally, Axl is expressed in various tumor types. Axl expression 
is thought  to functionally contribute to tumor development. Enhanced tumor cell motility, 
adherence and migration, epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and resistance to 
targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been linked to Axl expression. Gas6, the ph ysiological 
ligand of Axl, is also expressed in some cancers, potentially contributing to Axl activation through 
an Axl -Gas6 autocrine  loop4. 
Enapotamab vedotin  is a human IgG1 antibody th at is generated by [CONTACT_524716] -specific 
antibody with the microtubule disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) through the 
protease cleavable valine -citrulline (vc) linker5-7. Enapotamab vedotin  binds to the Ig1 domain of 
Axl and does not compete with Gas6 for receptor binding.  This is particularly relevant in tumors 
that co -express Axl and Gas6, in which enapotamab vedotin  is still able to bind in the presence of 
Gas68.  
The dominant mechanism of action for enapotamab vedotin  is tumor cell killing by 
[CONTACT_524717] -mediated interference with cell division. Upon binding of enapotamab vedotin  to Axl 
expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells, the complex is rapi [INVESTIGATOR_524656] . Proteolytic cleavage of the vc peptide linker in the lysosomes subsequently releases 
MMAE from the complex. Free MMAE can diffuse within the cell where it directly binds to 
microtubules  and inhibits tubulin p olymerization. T hereby [CONTACT_524718][INVESTIGATOR_524657]. Tubulin inhibitors primarily induce cytotoxicity in proliferating cells and not in 
quiescent c ells. Therefore, proliferating tumor cells are preferentially targeted over normal cells, 
which are generally quiescent. Due to its membrane permeability, MMAE can also cause a 
by[CONTACT_145152], e.g. , cell death of proliferating Axl -negative tumor cells th at surround 
Axl-positive tumor cells5.

2.3 Summary of Known and Potential Risks to Human Patients  
2.3.1 Implications of Non-Clinical Safety Results for Monitoring of Patients /Mitigation 
Plans  
Although there is limited  clinical experience with enapotamab vedotin  as this is a first-in-human 
(FIH) trial, while there is substantial experience with MMAE -based ADCs as described in 
Investigator’s Brochure , the following no table observations in the toxicology studies with 
enapotamab vedotin  pointing to potential risks in human should be kept in mind.  
• During infusion of enapotamab vedotin  in non -clinical toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, infusion -related reaction s with swelling of the eye lids, decreased muscle tone, 
labored breathing, or brief loss of consciousness was observed during t he second treatment in 
2 out of a total of 30 monkeys treated with enapotamab vedotin  (1Q3W x 3). Infusion -related 
clinical signs did not occur or were milder during the third infusion in the monkeys when the 
infusion time was prolonged from [ADDRESS_680641] also been 
observed with related ADC compounds using MMAE as the toxin. Patients should be 
monitored cl osely during infusion of  enapotamab vedotin .  
• Bone marrow suppression has been observed in non -clinical studies of enapotamab vedotin  
and this adverse effect is expected during treatment with MMAE -ADCs and is a common 
adverse finding for other MMAE -ADCs. L ow neutrophil count with increased risk of 
infections as well as anemia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia might occur and 
hematological parameters should be monitored during treatment.  
• Enapotamab vedotin  caused dose -related, reversible changes in the m ale reproductive system 
(reduced sperm motility, lower testes and epi[INVESTIGATOR_524658] s, and degenerative changes in 
the sperm -producing epi[INVESTIGATOR_524659]). A s risk mitigation, it is recommended that fertile 
males consider having semen specimen obtained for storage for potential future conception.

Page 39 of 259 • MMAE is metabolized mainly via the CYP3A4 pathway and is capable of inhibiting human 
CYP3A4/5 enzymatic activity in vitro , although  at concentrations that are substantially 
higher than clinically relevant plasma  concentrations.  MMAE is a substrate for the 
transmembrane transporter protein P-gp. Patients who are receiving strong CYP3A4 or P-
gp inhibitors concomitantly with enapotamab vedotin  should be closely monitored for 
adverse reactions.  
Peripheral neuropathy has been observed frequently in patients receiving MMAE -ADCs . 
2.3.2 Implications of Clinical Safety Results for Monitoring of Patients/Mitigation Plans  
Important newly identified risks for enapotamab vedotin  include constipation , peripheral 
neuropathy and neutro penia .  
In particular, events of constipation (≤ Grade 3), some of them leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], have 
been observed. The use of prophylactic concomitant medication to avoid and manage constipation 
is described in Section 7.4.1 . 
The peripheral neuropathy assessment through physical exam ination  will be performed at the 
baseline and at End of Treatment visit , and the assessment will continue th rough the treatment 
period where indicated . Pausing of dosing or dose adjustment of enapotamab vedotin  in case of 
neutropenia or peripheral neuropathy is  required (please refer to Section 7.3.2 ). Specific  safety 
reporting requirements are in place for  AEs of peripheral neuropathy (please refer to 
Section  9.3.2 ). 
Please refer to the IB for  the benefit -risk of  enapotamab vedotin .

supported by [CONTACT_524719].  
The preferred front line treatment for localized solid tumors is  surgery, which can also be used to 
decrease tumor burden for larger invasive carcinomas. In addition, irradiation is used for local and 
locally advanced carcinomas, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy (CHX). For 
recurrent, advanced and/or met astatic carcinomas, CHX is the main treatment modality. For the 
selected indications, except for thyroid cancer  and melanoma , first line CHX often includes 
platinum -based regimens. Tubulin inhibitors (including vinca alkaloids and taxanes) are often 
added to platinum in the chosen indications, except for iodine -refractory thyroid cancers where 
small molecular kinase inhibitors as well as taxanes, carboplatin and doxorubicin are the  standard 
of care (SoC).  For melanoma , tubulin inhibitors are also a recommen ded alternative as second -line 
or subsequent therapy for metastatic disease.  For sarcoma , tubulin inhibitors are also used for 
several subtypes. Tubulin inhibitors are widely used for relapsed disease and for patients ineligible 
for platinum -based CHX, either as part of multi -agent CHX regimens or as single agent. Thus, the 
rationale for using tubulin inhibition in oncology is evident.  
Based on the criteria described above, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid 
cancer , non-small ce ll lung cancer  (NSCLC) , melanoma , and sarcoma  have been selected to be 
explored in this trial . These tumor types and the treatment modalities are described in  Appendix I . 
For more information , please  also refer to  the IB. 
AXL expression has been associated with innate and acquired resistance to a range of therapeutic 
agents  across multiple  solid tumor types , including kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy and more 
recently immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a cohort of malignant melanoma patients, resistance to 
anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was linked to  concurrent enhanced expression of a  number of genes, 
including AXL .9 Furthermore, preclinical studies in murine breas t cancer models suggested that 
AXL expression in tumor cells is directly associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype,  that 
result s in reduced sensitivity to radiotherapy and/or PD -[ADDRESS_680643] failed PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, it is  the aim to explore the hypothesis 
that this failure is linked to aberrant expression of Axl and that these patients may benefit from 
treatment with  enapotamab vedotin . Therefore, it is intended to  evaluate this hypothesis  across 
multiple solid tumors in t he expansion part of this tri al. 
3.2 Trial Design  Rationale  
In November 2020, Genmab decided to discontinue development of enapotamab vedotin  but 
continue to offer treatment to patients already recruited in the present trial. In March 2021

Template No.: 07 -072 Template version: 0.1              Template Date: [ADDRESS_680644] 7 months, which is considered sufficient time to evaluate efficacy and 
safety. It was therefore agreed to amend  the present protocol  (Amendme nt 10) to reduce data 
collection going forward. Refer to Appendix VI  and Table 31 for applicable procedures and 
assessments as of  Amendment 10.  
The trial consists of a dose -escalation part with two arms (part I) and a dose expansion part 
(part II).  
Part I of this trial  is a FIH , open -label, dose -escalation, safety trial of Axl -specific ADC  
enapotamab vedotin in a mixed patient population with solid tumors to determine the MTD and 
the safety profile of  enapotamab vedotin . 
Part I of this trial includes two arms for identification of the most optimal dosing regimen:  
• 1Q3W: Dosing once every [ADDRESS_680645] exp erience with 1Q3W dosing of ADCs11 and brentuximab vedotin  
has received market authorization using this schedule  (see Investigator’s Brochure ).  
• 3Q4W: Weekly dosing for 3 weeks followed by o ne treatment -free week.   
  
 
The less frequent dosing -arm (1Q3W ) is designed as  a Modified Bayesian Continuous 
Reassessment Method (mCRM) incorporating Escalation  with Overdose  Control  (EWOC) . This 
design is considered appropriate as the Bayesian mCRM in general better estimates the MTD with 
less bias and more precision than a classic 3+ 3 design12. A comprehensive comparison of the 
Continual Reassessment M ethod (CRM) to the standard 3+[ADDRESS_680646] been studied  comprehensively and based on the 
overview provided by [CONTACT_524720]11 (in particular Table 1  of the articl e), an U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) analysis of ADCs , in combination with sponsor ’s own development 
experience with tisotumab vedotin ( HuMax -TF-ADC ) it is assumed that the MTD will be between 
1.8 mg/kg – 2.5 mg/kg for the 1Q3W dose schedule . 
The design provides flexibility in terms of cohort sizes (allowed to vary in CRM but not in classic 
3+3 design ).  
In contrast, the more frequent dosing -arm (3Q4W)  will be conducted as a classic 3+3 design as it 
consists of fewer dose -levels 5-6 and will include fewer patients ( 15-36, 17 expected  as compared 
to 28 in the 1Q3W -arm). The CRM would need at least ~[ADDRESS_680647] exposed patients at higher dose -
levels than the 3Q4W -arm. 
The aim of the expansion part is to provide further data on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and anti -tumor activity of the selected dose(s) /treatment regimen(s) .

In the escalation part PK assessments  are made only on odd -numbered cycles  (please refer to Table 
12 and Table 13): a more frequent sampling scheme every two cycles can be more efficient a nd 
informative than a less frequent sampling scheme performed every cycle. Performing the current 
sampling scheme every cycle would not provide additional significantly valuable information 
compared to the current design.  
In the expansion part PK assessmen ts are collected as outlined in Table 14. Of particular intere st 
are the assessments made on D ays 1 and 4 in order to obtain samples near the expected C max for 
the ADC and MMAE in the 1Q3W arm. In the 3Q4W arm, the corresponding asses sments are 
made on D ays 15 and 17.

and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)  are within the range of 1.8 mg/kg to 2.5  mg/kg across 
the molecules when three -weekly dose schedules were used , for more details please refer to  the

The 1Q3W dose esca lation part of this trial includes 7 main dose levels : 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5 , 2.0, 2.4 
and 2.8 mg/kg, corresponding to the following dose increments: 100%, 67%, 50%,  33%, 20% and 
17%. For the 1Q3W schedule , the MTD and RP2D were determined to be 2.2 mg/kg.  
The 3Q4W dose escalation part of the trial is expected to include 5 to 6 dose levels: (0.45), 0.6, 
0.8, 1.0,  1.2 and 1. 4 mg/kg, corresponding to the following dose increments: (33%), 33%, 25%, 
20%,  and 17%. The d ose level 0.45 mg/kg may be added  as describ ed in Section  5.1. There are at 
least two ADCs containing MMAE as toxin, ASG -5ME13 and brentuximab vedotin14 for which a 
MTD of 1.2 mg/kg has been reported for 3Q4W dosing,  for more details please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure . Therefore, it is considered safe to apply dose increments higher than 20% 
(but no more than 33%) for dose levels below this reported MTD for 3Q4W dosing.  The 
increments of the dose escalation steps in the 3Q4W -arm below 1.2 mg/kg are in the range of 33%-
20% based on  a modified Fibonacci approach and beyond 1.2 mg/kg not higher t han 20% . As an 
additional precaution, the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) can recommend intermediate dose 
levels at any step during dose escalation.  For the 3Q4W schedule , the MTD was determined to be 
1.0 mg/kg.

escalation arm and 3Q4W in the second dose escalation arm ; for further detail s see  Section  3.2. 
The dosing frequency is based on toxicokinetic and toxicology data obtained in cynomolgus 
monkeys, suggesting adequate recovery of neutrophils, thrombocytes and red blood cell 
parameters and otherwise an acceptable safety profile. No relevant accumulation of enapotamab 
vedotin  or MMAE between cycles is anticipated based on the proposed dose intervals and non-
clinical popu lation PK model (see  . 
3.4 Number of Patients and Sites  
In total, approximately  426 patients can be enrolled in this trial. Assuming an anticipated screen 
failure rate of 30% , up to 609 patients can be screened.  
 
Up to 41 patients are planned to be enrolled in the 1Q3W dose escalation.  
 
Between 15 and 36 patients are planned to be enrolled in the 3Q4W dose escalation depending on 
the number of dose levels during the dose escalation.  
 
In the expansion part, approximately  349 patients can be enrolled in 8 cohorts :  
 
In Cohorts  1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 , the aim is to enroll 22 patients per cohort ; however , in order to obtain 
evaluable fresh tumor biopsies from at least 15 patients per cohort , up to 15 patients may be 
additionally recruited per cohort  leading to  a maximum of 37 patients enrolled per cohort .

Page 44 of 259 An efficacy signal has been observed in NSCLC patients without EGFR/ALK mutation s, therefore 
up to 60 additional patients will be enrolled into the NSCLC Cohort 2 (Table 1) to further 
understand the safety, tolerability , efficacy and biomarker findings  of enapotamab vedotin  in this 
population of patients; the aim is therefore to enroll a total of up to 82  patients in Cohort  2.  
 
 
A sub -group of the patients in Cohort 2 (up to 30 patients), may be enrolled on a dose of 1.8  mg/kg 
to further understand the tolerability profile and to extend the therapeutic window of enapotamab 
vedotin . Enapotamab vedotin belongs to valine -citrulline -monomethyl auristatin E (vc -MMAE) 
class of ADC, and peripheral ne uropathy is a known side -effect of MMAE and a potential dose  
limiting toxicity  (DLT) . It has been shown in a pooled time -to-event analysis across eight vc -
MMAE ADCs, that peripheral neuropathy events ( Grade ≥2) were higher in patients with higher 
ADC expos ure15. The MTD /RP2D  in ADC -vc-MMAE ranges from 1.8  mg/kg to 2.4  mg/kg16. 
Given the identical cytotoxic payload of MMAE and the similar safety profile observed for 
enapotamab vedotin as compared to other ADC -vc-MMAEs, 1.8  mg/kg dose is expected to have 
a better tolerability profile.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, if considered necessary (as assessed by [CONTACT_524722]) 
selected cohort (s) might be explored on both dosing schedules from the dose escalation without 
increasing the total number of patients to be included in the trial.  
 
In Cohort 6, 30 patients with solid tumors (except for NSCLC, melanoma, sarcoma, and ovarian 
cancer patients, unless having a known AXL gene amplification) who have fa iled a PD -1/PD -L1 
inhibitor and are able to provide the required  fresh tumor biopsy will be enrolled.  
For further exploration of the safety and efficacy profile of the 3Q4W schedule, patients in Cohort 
6 will be enrolled on a dose of 1.0  mg/kg administered  3Q4W, which was determined to be the 
MTD for this schedule in the dose escalation part of the trial. Preferably, no more than 8  patients 
should be recruited for one tumor type in this cohort  
In order to obtain sufficient evaluable fresh tumor biopsies up to 15 additional patients may be 
recruited to Cohort 6 to ensure that 25 fresh biopsies are acquired. A maximum of 45  patients may 
therefore be enrolled into Cohort 6. A higher number of biopsies are required in this cohort due to 
the mixture of tumor types being enrolled.  
 
Cohort 8 will further explore the safety and efficacy of the  1.0 mg/kg  3Q4W schedule in NSCLC 
patients without EGFR/ALK mutations .  
 Cohort 8 will include up to

evaluated on an ongoing basis  in this cohort . An enapotamab vedotin  dose of 1.0 mg/kg 
administered 3Q4W was well tolerated in the dose escalation part of this trial and was determined 
to be the 3Q4W MTD. Emerging data indicates that more frequent dosing has the potential to be 
efficacious when used for ADCs. For example, enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg 3Q4W 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful response rate (ORR of 44%) with a manageable and tolerable 
safety profile in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were 
previously treated with platinum  and anti –PD-1/L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]17. In addition, a phase I/II study of 
glembatumumab vedotin in patients with advanced melanoma showed a modest improvement in 
ORR with more frequent dosing sch edules compared to the 1Q3W schedule although the number 
of patients treated was small and no improvement in PFS was observed18.  
 
 Overall, the 1.0 mg/kg 3Q4W 
schedule is anticipated to provide a favorable balance of anti -tumor activity with an acceptable 
safety p rofile.  
 
An interim analysis for futility will be performed after 22 patients per cohort  (minus Cohort s 6 and 
8) if there are <  15 patients with evaluable fresh biopsies in the corresponding cohort . If too few 
responders  are observed , further recruitment to the corresponding cohort  may be stopped, refer to  
Section 10.7 for more details. However, if the required number of biopsies as well as responders 
(see Table 1) have been observed before the futi lity analysis in the corresponding cohort, the 
futility analysis can be cancelled.

5.1 Overview of Trial Design  
This is an open -label, multi -center Phase I/II a safety trial of enapotamab vedotin  in a mixed 
population of patients with solid tumors known from the literature to overexpress Axl  and where 
the use of systemic tubulin i nhibitors is part of Standard of Care ( SoC). The trial consists of two 
parts; a dose -escalation part (phase I, FIH) and an expansion part  (phase IIa) . The dose escalation 
part has two dose escalation arms: the first one investigates a 1Q3W dose schedule  and the second 
one investigates  a 3Q4W  dose schedule (see Figure 1).

Although the two arms formally run independently (e.g. reaching the MTD at a dose -level in one 
arm will not automatically disallow patient allocation to correspondingly higher dos e-levels in the 
other), safety signals identified in one arm will be taken into consideration for the other arm during 
ongoing safety surveillance, see  Section  9.7.  
 
The expansion part is planned to consist of  8 parallel cohorts  (Figure 1), mainly to provide 
additional safety and initial efficacy information. Interim analyses for futility may be performed  
(Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7)  and, based on the results of these analys es, further recruitment in an 
individual cohort  may be stopped , see Section 10.7.

Figure 2. Trial flow for the 1Q3W dose escalation . 
 
The 1Q3W dose -escalation will be conducted as a mCRM d esign. The defining  property of a CRM 
is a model relating dose to the probability of a DLT. The mCRM chooses the dose for the next 
cohort by [CONTACT_524725], and then selecting a dose that is 
as close to the MTD as possible while obeying certain modifying constraints (such as not escalating 
too fast).  
After each cohort, patients are assessed for a DLT during the DLT period, the model parameters 
will be up dated and a next dose suggested based on the posterior probability of DLT at each dose. 
The DLT period will include the safety data obtained from patients in the respective cohort during 
their first treatment cycle (21 days) . 
The 1Q3W dose  escalation will potentially (dependent on data collected during the trial) evaluate 
enapotamab vedotin  at 7 main dose levels: 0.3, 0.6, 1.0,  1.5, 2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mg/kg, and 4  optional 
intermediate dose levels 1.25,  1.8, 2.2 and 2.6 mg/kg. Further escalation with steps of 0.4 mg/kg 
and de -escalation by 0.2 mg/kg is allowed, if the MTD has not been declared at a dose level up to 
2.8 mg/kg.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following  provides  a description  of the procedure  for patient  accrual  and provisions  for dose 
escalation/de -escalation  decisions  in the 1Q3W schedule .

logistic regression model (BLRM), the DMC will recommend the dose -level for the next 
cohort of patients.  
2. In order  to limit  patients  being  treated  at a possibly  non-efficacious  dose (i.e. < 1.0 mg/kg, 
1Q3W schedule) , this trial will begin  by [CONTACT_524726].  If patients  in one of these 
cohorts have  experienced  a DLT  or ≥ Grade 3 toxicity  (at least possibly drug -related) , the 
cohort  size will be increased  to at least [ADDRESS_680652] 3 patients should be enrolled to the 1.0 mg/kg or higher dose-levels.  
4. A patient  will be considered  as evaluable  for dose determination  if they experience  a DLT  
during  Cycle [ADDRESS_680653] cycle  (see Section  10.1.4 ). 
5. A two-parameter  BLRM  with overdose  control  principle  will be used to support 
recommendations  on the next dose level,  with the following  three  exceptions:  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
6. Following  the principle  of EWOC , the BLRM model only allows escalation to dose levels 
which are likely to be safe.   
7. For further  understanding  of the safety,  tolerability  and PK of enapotamab vedotin , 
additional  cohorts  of patients  may be enrolled  at preceding  dose levels,  or to intermediate  
dose levels  before or  while  proceeding  with further  dose escalation or even thereafter.  
8.   
 
 
 
 
9. After  repeating  the above  steps,  the MTD  is declared  when  at least [ADDRESS_680654]  been  
evaluated  at a dose level  and the BLRM recommends allocating an additional cohort to the 
same dose level.

enapotamab vedotin  at doses of (0.45), 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,  1.2 and 1. 4 mg/kg. If the 1. 4 mg/kg is reached 
without significant safety concerns and it is considered safe to escalate above 1. 4 mg/kg, the 
escalation may continue to higher dose levels with increments up to 20%  using the standard 3+3 
rules. The starting dose is expected to be 0.6 mg/kg ( a dose level of 0.45 mg/kg may be added , see 
Section  5.1). 
The 3Q4W part is initiated based on the criteria described in Section  5.1. The DLT period will 
include the safety data obtained from patients of the respective cohort during their first treatment 
cycle (28 days).  The DMC can recommend and the sponsor safety committ ee may decide to 
implement intermediate dose levels at any step during dose escalation to ensure patient safety and 
better define the MTD.  
Decisions to escalate the dose of enapotamab vedotin  for the next cohort will be based on the safety 
data obtained fr om the 3 (+3) patients during their first treatment cycle (28 days). Before escalating 
from the first dose level to the second dose level in the 3Q4W -arm, PK data must  be available for 
DMC review.  
Each cohort will include 3 patients. If during the evaluat ion period  insufficient safety  information 
is collected from a patient, the patient will be replaced  (see Section  10.1.4 ). Patients who

Recruitment will be initiated in up to 8 cohort s primarily  encompassing cancer types treated in the 
dose escalation part  (see cohorts in Figure 1 and Section 6.1). Based on a safety review of data

the DMC and the sponsor  SC will evaluate the safety profile with particular emphasis on any safety 
signals. Additional safety review s will be performed after [ADDRESS_680660] one cycle (regardless of indication)  or as needed to ensure the safety of 
patients participating in the  trial. 
Patients will be treated with the dose and dose  schedule from the dose escalation part 
recomme nded by [CONTACT_524727] -risk assessment . If 
deemed appropriate,  based on data available , the expansion part may be initiated before  the MTD  
has been reached in both arms.  However, expansion cohort [ADDRESS_680661] of prior exposure 
to a PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor ha ve become available , i.e. when at least 10 patients with previous 
exposure to a PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor have been exposed to enapotamab vedotin  and from whom 
safety and biologic activity data have been analyzed . Furthermore, different doses and schedules 
might be explored in the expansion cohorts , without increasing the total number of patients to be 
included in the trial . 
The trial flow as illustrated in either  Figure [ADDRESS_680662] meeting before trial start (first patient screened). The 
DMC will include medical experts within the disease to be treated, and at least one with DMC 
experience. At the first meeting, the DMC will decide the future format and the degree of the 
information it needs in order to evaluate the patients at each dose level. The functions and 
responsibilities of the DMC will be described in the DMC Charter, which will be approved by [CONTACT_109393].  
Patients will be enrolled in coh orts of 1 -3 patients per dose level in the dose escalation part (1Q3W 
and 3Q4W  arms as listed above). For each cohort, the DMC will evaluate aggregate safety data 
for the number of patients required in the respective treatment arms in order to recommend wh ether 
it is safe to escalate to the next dose level. Before the DMC review of safety data, [ADDRESS_680663] withdrawn from treatment due to a DLT 
(see Section 10.1.4 ). 
The DMC will evaluate the data obtained at each dose level and will recommend whether the dose 
should be escalated as per protocol, revised to a lower level or intermediate level,  halted altogether 
or more patients are required at the same dose level to evaluate safety. In addition cumulative 
safety data for all cohorts will be evaluated at each DMC meeting.  
The DMC meetings will be divided into an open and a closed session. During the open sessions 
representatives from the sponsor, and if deemed relevant one or more investigators involved in the 
trial, will participate together with the DMC members. During th e closed session, only DMC 
members will participate.  
The conclusion of the DMC meeting will be documented in meeting minutes.

7. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
The dose escalation part of this FIH trial must be run in phase I units with cardiopulmon ary 
resuscitation  equipment available at bedside and fast access to Emergency units. The expansion 
part must be run at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_524670] . Throughout the infusion , 
patients will be under surveillance by [CONTACT_524735]. The physician supervising the enapotamab 
vedotin  infusion must be readily accessible for assistance during the day of the infusion.  
7.[ADDRESS_680703]  - Enapotamab Vedotin  
Enapotamab vedotin  (HuMax -AXL antibody -drug conjugate) is an ADC  composed of an IgG1 
human monoclonal antibody (HuMax -AXL) chemically conjugated via a protease cleavable vc  
linker to the drug MMAE.  
7.1.1 Treatment Administration  
Enapotamab vedotin  will b e administered as an i.v.  infusion. Each patient’s dose will be calculated 
based on the patient’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram, i.e.,  assigned cohort dose in 
mg/kg   body weight in kg. For patients whose body mass index (BMI) is greater than 30  kg/m2, 
the investigator sh ould use a weight that, based on the patient’s height, corresponds to a maximum 
BMI of 30.  
The dose to be administered to the patient is calculated according to the following formula if BMI 
is greater than 30 kg/m2: 
Dose (mg) = x (mg/kg) * 30 (kg/m2)* heig ht (m) * height (m)  (where x denotes the dose level ) 
 
Enapotamab vedotin  will be administered over a minimum of [ADDRESS_680704] be

Page 82 of 259 Dose Delays  
1Q3W and 3Q4W Schedule  
For immune -related AEs, please refer to Section 7.3.3  regarding dose delays.  
For all other AEs/Toxicities, enapotamab vedotin administration can be delayed for up to a 
maximum of 12  weeks. Radiological assessments should be continued during this period, as 
per protocol Section 8.4.7  and as clinically indicated, to monitor for disease progression.  
Patients should be withdrawn from treatment if the treatment delay exceeds 12  weeks or if 
diseas e progression is observed while  treatment is interrupted.  
3Q4W Schedule Only  
If a patient has to delay a dose for more than 14 days and the toxicity has resolved by [CONTACT_14713], 
the patient should start with a new regular cycle upon resuming treatment.  
 
7.4 Limitation in Concomitant  Medication  
7.4.1 Prophylactic Concomitant Medications  
Constipation (≤ Grade 3) has been the most frequently reported clinically significant adverse event. 
The events seem to be treatment -related and dose -dependent.  In order to prevent constipation, oral 
bisacodyl should prim arily be administered as prophylactic treatment. If bisacodyl is not available, 
ducosate sodium for oral administration should be used.  
For each cycle, prophylactic treatment should be initiated on Day 5 following the administration 
of enapotamab vedotin , or earlier if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of constipation 
before Day 5. T reatment should continue until D ay 21 for the 1Q3W dose schedule and until 
Day 28 for the 3Q4W dose schedule, with dose adjustments as required.   
The doses to be used are as follows:  
 Preferred:  
Bisacodyl, 5 mg (orally)  Alternative:  
Ducosate sodium 100 mg 
(orally)  
High dose  2 tablets QD at bedtime  1 capsule TID  
Mid dose (starting dose)  [ADDRESS_680729] the starting dose, taking the patient’s medical history and use of 
concomitant opi[INVESTIGATOR_524675].  
The investigator should  advise patients how to avoid constipation by a diet high in bulk fiber, fruits 
and vegetables, adequate fluid intake, if possible physical activity and adequate time for toilet 
visits.  
The patient will be given a patient diary for recording of their stoo l frequency and consistency and 
use of prophylactic treatment, and be instructed how to complete it and to bring it to every visit.  
The site personnel should record the name [CONTACT_524796] a high dose, mid dose 
(which is the dose to sta rt with on day 5 of a cycle) and a low dose in the patient’s diary.

Page 83 of 259 The diary will contain guidance on how to modify the dosing of the prophylactic treatment as 
needed:  
• In case of signs and symptoms of constipation, the patient should increase the dose o f the 
prophylactic treatment to the next dose level, indicated in the patient diary. In case the 
highest dose level is already in use, the patient should contact [CONTACT_524741]. 
Patients should also be advised to contact [CONTACT_524742] 48 hours without 
bowel movements.  
• In case of signs and symptoms of diarrhea, the administration of the prophylactic treatment 
should be interrupted. When diarrhea has resolved, treatment should be reintroduced at a 
dose level lower than the previ ous dose taken prior to the development of diarrhea. In case 
the previous dose was the lowest dose, then the low dose should be used.   
Additional treatments, such as senna, milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, and lactulose should 
be administered for ≥ Gr ade 2 constipation and may be considered for ≤  Grade 1 constipation. If 
not given as primary prophylactic medication to avoid constipation, docusate sodium or bisacodyl 
may be given in addition.  
Any occurrence of diarrhea or constipation should be recorded  as an adverse event. Investigators 
should assess further patients for any evidence of autonomic neuropathy, e.g. postural hypotension 
in patients with constipation.  
Investigators should assess further patients for any evidence of autonomic neuropathy, e.g . 
postural hypotension in patients with constipation.  
Investigators should pay particular attention to the definition of the NCI CTCAE Grade 3 
constipation and may well consider that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_524676] “limiting self -care ADL”.  
7.4.2 Permitted Concomi tant Medications  
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide 
adequate supportive care except for those medications identified as “excluded” . Administration of 
concomitant medications must be reported in the appropriate section of the eCRF along with dates 
of administration and reasons for use.   
• Palliative radiotherapy during the trial will be allowed for local pain control provided that:  
(i) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient does not have known progressive disease  
(PD)  and (ii) no more than 10% of the patient’s bone marrow is irradiated and (iii) the 
radiation field does not encompass a target lesion.  
• G-CSF and other hematopoieti c growth factors may be used in the management of acute 
toxicity  (see Section  7.3.2 ), such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the 
investigator’s discretion . Patients are permitted to be taking chronic erythropoietin provided 
that no dose adjustment was m ade within two  months before the first dose of enapotamab 
vedotin . 
• Blood -cell transfusion is allowed if  clinically indicated .  
• Chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose was stable for at least [ADDRESS_680730] 
been ≥ 150 mg prednisone (or equivalent doses of corticosteroids) . Short -term steroid 
treatment is permitted a t the discretion of the investigator.

8.4.1 Demographics  
Date of birth, race, ethnic origin , gender and smoking and drinking habits  will be recorded  at 
screening  in the  eCRF.  
8.4.2 Disease Status  
Primary site of cancer and initial and current disease stage [Tumor Nodes Metastasis (TNM) 
staging system]21 will be recorded at screening in the eCRF.  
For patients with NSCLC, the patients’ mutational tumor status with respect to EGFR mutations 
and ALK rearrangement and for patients with melanoma with respect to B RAF and NRAS 
mutations will be also recorded (incl. date of the assessment). In addition, for patients with NSCLC 
who have previously been treated with PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitors, the PD -L1 expression level at 
the time of initiation of prior PD -1/PD -L1 inhib itor treatment will be recorded.  As of Amendment 10:  
• Height, weight , and physical examination outcome are no longer to be recorded in the 
eCRF.   
• ECGs will be taken locally .  
o Any irregularity observed or occurring during the ECGs should either induce 
a repeat of the ECG or be annotated in the medical journal.  
o New or worsened clinically significant abnormal ities should be recorded as 
AEs on the AE form.  
• Post-baseline CT -scans are to be performed every 12 weeks (±7 days) and are not to 
be sent for central reading.  
• Vital signs should be measured if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], but are not 
to be recor ded in the eCRF.  
• Any medication or therapy other than enapotamab vedotin  that is related to an AE 
or is considered prophylactic treatment is considered concomitant medication.  
• Patient diary data are not to be recorded in the eCRF.

symptoms and diagnosis) occurring between visit 0 (Screening) and C1V1 should be recorded as 
medical history .  
8.4.4 Height and Weight  
Height (without shoes) must be measured at Visit 0 (Screening) and recorded in the eCRF rounded 
to nearest centimeter.  
Body weight (without overcoat and shoes) will be measured at visit 0 (Screening), at visit 1 of 
each cycle, as part of the dose calculation, and at end of treatment visit , and will be recorded in the 
eCRF. If body weight is assessed 7 days or less (on the site weight) before the day of the planned 
dosing, this weight can be used and is the weight recorded in the eCRF.   
8.4.5 Physical Examination  
A complete general physical examination will be done at the screening and C1D1 visit including 
peripheral neuropathy assessment, such as checking of tendon reflexes, muscle strength and tone, 
sensitivity, co -ordination and balance. A b aseline visual acuity assessment will be performed at 
the screening visit using the Snellen chart.  
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited symptom -directed physical examinations 
should be performed and the outcome of the physical examin ation must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Changes f rom baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient’s notes. New or worsened 
clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the AE form. The peripheral 
neuropathy assessment should also b e performed at the End of Treatment visit.  
An unscheduled general physical examination should always be considered, if a significant clinical 
finding is observed.

ECGs). Any irregularity observed or occurring during the ECGs (e.g., vomiting, cough) should 
either induce a repeat of the ECG or be annotated on the eCRF with the description and time of 
the occurrence.  
Date of the ECG and the overall interpretation of the ECGs will be recorded in the eCRF.

8.4.7 Imaging/ Computed Tomography  
All patients will have a CT -scan with contrast of thorax, abdomen and pelvis performed during 
screening. If there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_451383]/tumors, a CT -scan of the head will be performed 
before inclusion. For patients with stable brain metastases enrolled in the expansion part, the CT -
scan must include the head and neck.  
For patients with superficial cutaneous lesions that are not measurable by a CT -scan, measurement 
using calipers can be performed, using photographs as documentation.  
All sites of metastatic disease should be reported at baseline and followed throughout the trial. Up 
to 5 target lesions (maximum two per organ) will  be defined at screening. A lesion from which a 
fresh biopsy has been taken during the trial cannot be a target lesion.  
Baseline imaging assessments will be performed during the screening period. Any imaging 
assessments already completed for regular radio graphic evaluation of the patient’s cancer can be 
considered as the baseline images for this trial, as long as they are of sufficient diagnostic quality 
and have been obtained ≤ [ADDRESS_680762]-baseline scans will be performed every 6 weeks (1 Q3W and Cohort 8 3Q4W) or 8 weeks 
(Cohort 6 3Q4W) (±7  days) from C1D1 until investigator assessed disease progression according 
to RECIST v1.1. Time points for radiographic evaluation should be calendar based and do not 
depend on cycle visits i.e. radiolog ical evaluation should be performed regardless of IMP 
administration delays . For patients who permanently discontinue IMP for other reasons than 
disease progression (e.g., adverse events), every effort should be made to continue on -trial 
radiological evalu ation according to protocol until disease progression, start of a new anti -cancer 
treatment, withdrawal of consent or death (see Table 11).

If reduction of target lesions ≥ 30% in size is observed a repeat CT -scan will be performed after 
4 (in particular for the 3Q4W -arm) to 6 weeks (in particular for the 1Q3W -arm) to confirm t he 
response.  
Unscheduled imaging may be performed at the investigators discretion to confirm response 
(intervals should not be shorter than 4 weeks). In case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_524678], imaging shou ld be performed as soon as possible before 
the next scheduled evaluation.  In this case the investigator must choose the imaging technology 
based on the clinical indication. For patients in the expansion part, all supplemental images must 
be submitted for c entral reading.  
 
MRI can be performed instead of CT -scan if the patient is allergic to iodine contrast or at the 
discretion of the investigator, after approval of the sponsor.  
Localized CT with contrast or MRI (with or without contrast; for sarcomas with  contrast) must be 
acquired for assessment of lesions of the skeleton/extremities and head and neck if not visible on 
other images. At the discretion of the investigators, combined PET/CT (e.g., FDG -PET) may be 
performed for tumor assessments as per RECIST  1.1, but only if the CT portion is of similar 
diagnostic quality to CT alone. Chest x -rays and ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor 
lesions.  
The same imaging modality and ideally the same scanner should be used throughout the trial to 
optimize t he reproducibility of the assessment and preserve the accuracy of the assessment of 
response or progression.  
In the dose escalation part the reading of the scans will be done by a local radiologist. Sites should 
attempt to maintain the same radiologist th roughout the trial. The overall interpretation of the 
evaluation shall be recorded in the eCRF and a copy of the evaluation reports should be kept in the

Axl expression in tumor tissue is one of the major determinants of response to enapotamab vedotin  
in pre -clinical models and will accordingly be evaluated as patient selection biomarker. Axl 
expression is however known to be dynamic and heterogeneous. IHC methods may therefore be 
suboptimal to measure Axl expression, and additional methods may be utilized to assess molecular 
Axl expression. In addition, the exploratory biomarker analyses will also investigate 
pharmacodynamic markers and explore the relationship to efficacy and/or mechanism of action. 
In later cycles, assessments will be performed on visits wit h a planned CT scan in order to enable 
correlation analyses with response to treatment or disease progression.

9.1 Recording Instructions  
Instructions for reporting changes in an ongoing AE during a patient's participation in the trial are 
provided in the instructions that accompany the AE eCRFs.  
All AEs, regardless of relatedness or cause, should be reported as an AE in the eCRF. When an 
AE becomes Grade 3 or results in an SAE, it should be reported both in the eCRF and on the Safety 
Reporting form, as applicable. Events of neuropathy Grade 2 and neuropathy leading to 
discontinuation should also be reported both in the eCRF and on the Safet y Reporting form, as 
applicable; see also Section 9.3.2 . 
All AEs with an outcome of death (including  disease progression) should be reported as an AE (in 
the eCRF) and as an SAE from the time patients sign the ICF until [ADDRESS_680773] enapotamab 
vedotin  dosing.  
All AEs in the 30 day safety follow -up visit including laboratory findings considered to be 
clinically significant should be reported a ccordingly. After the 30 days safety follow -up visit, 
should the investigator become aware of an SAE possibly related to  enapotamab vedotin , this 
should be reported accordingly.  
Laboratory assessments  
If a central laboratory value indicates dose modificati on/delay, but the local laboratory value does 
not, the sponsor medical officer and/or CRO Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_524752]. Any 
local or central la boratory values leading to a dose modification/delay or are assessed by [CONTACT_524753] (Section 8.5). 
Pre-existing Conditions  
In this trial, a pre -existing conditions (i.e., a disorder present before the AE reporting period started As of Amendment 10:  
• Non-serious Grade 3 AEs , peripheral neuropathy AEs ≥ Grade 2 , and peripheral 
neuropathy AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are no longer to 
be reported on the Safety Reporting form.   
• All laboratory samples will be analysed locally.   
Refer to Section 17 for applicable safety reporting as of Amendment 10.

a pre -existing condition worsens during the treatment period the event should be reported as an 
AE. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_680774] (AESI)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are defined as events (serious or non -serious) which are 
of scientific an d medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_81516]. Such 
events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understan d them.  
AESIs  are defined on the basis of an ongoing review of the safety data. AESIs are discussed further 
in Section 9.1.9  and in the IB. 
9.1.2 Diagno sis 
The diagnosis of an AE should be recorded , if available. If no diagnosis is available , each sign and 
symptom should be recorded as individual AEs.  
9.1.3 Intensity  
The investigator will use the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03 to describe the severity of the AE (NCI -
CTCAE v4.03, 2010).  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously between patient evaluation timepoints without 
resolution. Such events should only be recorded once on the AE eCRF. Changes in intensity of an 
ongoing AE should be assessed at each visit or more frequent if deemed necessary . In case of a 
change in NCI -CTCAE grading, the new grading  and date of change should be reported on the 
relevant Adverse Event  eCRF (please refer to the instructions that accompany the AE eCRF for

[IP_ADDRESS]  Peripheral Neuropathy  
Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in >  20% of patients at any dose/cohort. Although 
considered as treatment -related, onset latency and a deducible pattern b ased on dose -strength of 
enapotamab vedotin  are unclear.  The peripheral neuropathy will be assessed at the baseline and 
throughout the trial, when clinically indicated , to better understand its clinical course  
(Section  8.4.5 ).

Indicate  whether or  not the AE  is determined to be “serious” based o n what is defined in  
Section  9.2. 
9.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
The classification of the seriousness  of the event determines the reporting procedures to be 
followed.  
 
An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious:  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal li fe functions  
• Is a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
 
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of " serious" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Elective surgery, overnight for convenience or other schedul ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_524681]. However, the 
event must be reported on the AE page in the eCRF and commented upon.  
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to be 
“medically important”. Medical important events may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_524682] .

minimum  exposure  criterion  and have  completed the DLT observation period , or have  
experienced  a DLT  during cycle 1.  This constitutes  an evaluable  patient  for the determination  of 
MTD.  
A patient is considered to have met the minimum exposure criterion at a dose level if enapotamab 
vedotin  has been administered for at least 90% of the planned dose in e ach of the infusion s. Patients 
who do not experience DLT during the first cycle are considered to have sufficient safety 
evaluations if they have been observed for a minimum length following the first dose defined in

Page 125 of 259 be based upon observed DLTs in Cycle 1 in patien ts in the DDS . 
After the expansion phase of the trial, the final recommended dose for future development  will be 
based on  conside rations  of the MTDs  estimated in the two  dose-escalation arms,  and on  an overall  
clinical  assessment  of all available  safety,  tolerability , anti -tumor activity , and PK data from  all 
cycles  at all different  dose levels  tested,  in both the dose escalation and expansion parts  of the 
trial. This final recommended dose will be referred  to as the Recommended  Dose for Further 
Development (RDFD).  If it is determined  that treatment  at a dose of  enapotamab vedotin  lower 
than the MTDs established during  the dose escalation parts of the trial is  better  tolerated,  or has 
a better  efficacy  profile  based  on clinical  considerations,  then that dose may be  the RDFD.  
The FAS will be used for the corresponding summaries and listings. The dose -escalation/de -
escalation decisions described below will be based on DDS. Patients excluded from the DDS and 
reasons therefore will be listed . 
10.2.1  Dose Escalation , 1Q3W  
The primary anal ysis for the determination of the MTD is based on a modified Continuous 
Reassessment Method using BLRM  guided by [CONTACT_524763]. The MTD will be further 
evaluated for preliminary efficacy and overall tolerability during the expansion phase of the trial .  
An adaptive  BLRM (with  2 parameters)  guided  by [CONTACT_524764]. 
For each available dose level, including intermediate doses ( d = 1…. 11), the DLT rate is model led 
(πd) on the log odds scale:  
  qd=logpd
1-pdæ 
è ç ö 
ø ÷ 
. 
A two parameter  model is used relating the log odds to standardized doses xd, 
d d x1 0  + =
, 
where the standardized dose is computed by [CONTACT_524765]. 
Prior distributions are place d on each of the  terms and after each cohort is treated and assessed 
for DLT, the distributions of these parameters are updated, resulting in a posterior distribution used 
to estimate the MTD and select the dose for the next cohort.  
For this trial a bivariate normal prior distribution is placed on (
0 ,log(
1 )), with 
0  marg inally 
N(-1,1.5) , log(
1 ) marginally N(0,0.5) , and a correlation of 0. The prior distribution is selected to 
achieve good operating characteristics while also maintaining a similar dose -toxicity relationship 
to that shown for a similar antibody -MMAE. Generally, the prior anticipates the lower doses have 
a good chance of being safe while the higher doses are a priori likely to be unsafe.

level during the first cycle is less than 22%. That is,  
Pr(πd < 22%) > 40%.  
As fairly common in Bayesian statistics, the above is a probability of a probability and should be 
interpreted with due caution. E.g. it does not mean that there is 60% probability of having a DLT 
rate of ≥22% on a dose level.  
The target toxicity level (h ere 22%) in the CRM -design has no corresponding equivalent measure 
in the 3+3 design. In a 3+3 design, the observable DLT -rates in a 3 -patients cohort are 0%, 33%, 
67% and 100%. The “≥2/6 patients with DLT triggers a de -escalation” -rule implies that the ta rget 
toxicity level is <33% in the 3+3 design. Hence, even if the 3+3 design targets a DLT -rate <33%, 
during the trial it is possible to observe higher DLT -rates on a dose -level.  
In the same way, in a CRM -design during the trial it is possible to observe higher DLT -rates on a 
dose-level than the target toxicity level (here 22%).  
For detailed illustrations of the effect of this and the other design features, cf . . These 
sample realizations demonstrate that the mCRM -mode l is expected to be well -behaved in terms of 
safe-guarding the patients’ safety by [CONTACT_524766] -levels

At any time during the trial, the method can recommend patient allocation to a dose that is not safe  
by [CONTACT_13748] . If all dose levels are considered unsafe, the trial will stop early, with the MTD 
estimated to be below the experimental dose range.

Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response 
(PR)  ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD . 
Stable Disease  
(SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum of LDs since the treatment started . 
Progressive 
Disease (PD)  ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the LDs of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum of  the LDs recorded 
since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more 
new lesions . 
Based on non -
target lesions  CR Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
SD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
PD Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions . 
 
 
Evaluation of best overall response  (RECIST Criteria v1.1)  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the  
treatment started).  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of PD at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. 
Every effort should be made to docum ent the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.

10.7 Interim Analyses  
Protocol Amendment  9 (v 10.0) allowed for  exploratory analysis of subsets of data .  
In November 2020 , Genmab  decided to discontinue development of enapotamab vedotin  but 
continue to offer treatment to patients  who are deriving clinical benefit  in the present trial. At the 
time of this amendment (Amendment 10), the dose escalation part and the enrollment  of the do se 
expansion part of the trial have been completed with only [ADDRESS_680813] anned, i.e. data collected up to and 
including the data cutoff date will be included in the CSR. Furthermore, limited AE and SAE data 
from data cutoff to the time of database lock for the three active patients will be included. Data 
collected after the dat a cutoff date until the end of trial will be reported in an addendum to the 
CSR, once the trial is completed.   
From time of approval of this protocol amendment to end of trial no further information is being 
collected for patients in patient follow -up.  
The reporting of the trial will be based on a locked database with clean data up to the cutoff point.  
Final lock will be done at end of trial.  
10.8 Clinical Trial Reporting  
Data collected up to and including the data cutoff date  will be  included in the CSR . Data collected 
after the data cutoff date until the end of trial will be reported in an addendum to the CSR, once 
the trial is completed.

Disease and Treatments  
Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and also the most common cause of cancer 
mortality. Lung cancer is classified according to the World Health Organization depending o n its 
origin. The majority of lung cancers arise from the bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_524690] -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small -cell lung cancer and account for approximately 90% of all 
lung cancers, whereas the remaining are of different origin, e .g., mesotheliomas, lymphomas and 
stromal tumors1. 
NSCLC  
NSCLC represents approximately 80% of lung cancer and includes adenocarcinomas  which 
account for approximately 50% of lung cancers, squamous cell carcinomas  (SCC)  which  account 
for approximately 20% and large cell carcinomas which account for approximately 10% of lung 
cancers1.   
In the US, 133,703 new cases of NSCLC were diagnosed in [ZIP_CODE] and 211,401 patients were 
diagnosed in the EU in [ZIP_CODE]. Sixty -six percent of the patients had advanced or metastatic disease 
(stage IIIA, IIIB or IV) at the time of diagnosis and the 5 -years overall survival was 17% in [ZIP_CODE]. 
Several drugs are approved for treatment of NSCLC including alkylators, antimetabolites, tubulin 
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Bevacizumab (anti -Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
(VEGF) ), ramucirumab (anti -VEGFR -2) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are reserved for patients 
who are EGFR or ALK positive. Recently the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab (a human and humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibodies, respectively) that target 
PD-[ADDRESS_680832] of care (SoC) treatment. Tubulin inhibitors in combination with 
non-platinum agents is an option, when data on activity or toxicity are available e.g. docetaxel in 
combination with gemcitabine4.

(gefitinib and afatin ib are also indicated in this patient population); and for patients with an ALK 
mutation crizotinib is 1st line therapy4. 
Initiation of docetaxel as maintenance therapy after 1st line platinum -doublet chemotherapy is 
recommended in patie nts with SCC s and pemetrexed is indicated as maintenance therapy in non -
squamous cell carcinomas. However, systemic immune checkpoint inhibitors are preferred, and 
docetaxel may be used subsequentl y4. 
The tubulin inhibitor docetaxel is recommended as monotherapy in 2nd and subsequent lines of 
therapy due to its superiority to vinorelbine or ifosfamide. However, the combination of docetaxel 
and ramucirumab is recommende d due to improved survival compared to docetaxel as single agent 
treatment4. 
Gynecological cancers  
Axl expression has been shown in the literature as well as in sponsor IHC staining studies in 
ovarian, endometrial and cervica l cancers.  
Ovarian cancer  
The incidence of ovarian cancer was 20,651 in the US2 and 44,149 in the EU3 in 2014 and 2012, 
respectively. Approximately 69% of the patients had advanced disease at the time of diagnosis2. 
The 5 -year overall survival was 42% in [ADDRESS_680834] survival observed in the advanced 
stages; stage I: 85%, II: 67%, III: 37% and IV:16%2.  
The risk factors for ova rian cancer are nulli - or low parity, family history and heritable mutations. 
There are three different types of primary ovarian cancer; epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (65 -70%), germ cell (15 -20%) 
and sex cord -stroma (5 -10%). Metastasis to the ovaries account for 5% of ovaria n tumor masses. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_524691] 90% of the malignant 
cases.  
The most prominent genetic risk factors are BRCA1  and BRCA2  mutations. Bearing one of those 
mutations increases the risk of ovarian cancer  by 20% to 60% by 70 years of age. The majority of 
these malignancies are cystadenomas whereas appr oximately 30% of ACs  express Human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 /neu oncogenes, while p53 is found in more than 50% of ovarian 
carcinomas5.

paclitaxel and carboplatin6. In the US, paclitaxel is recommen ded in combination with carboplatin

liposomal doxorubicin or topo tecan is recommended7.  
Olaparib is approved for maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum -sensitive BRCA -
mutated ovarian cancer achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to platinum -
based chemotherapy6 and it is approved in the US for treatment of patients with a BRCA mutation 
who have failed 3 or more prior treatment lines7.  
Endometrial cancer  
The number of new cases of endome trial cancer was 50,182 in US in [ZIP_CODE] and 98,919 new cases 
in EU in [ZIP_CODE]. Twenty -two percent of the patients had advanced or metastatic disease at 
diagnosis2; the 5-year overall survival was 75% in [ZIP_CODE] however, it varies widely between the 
stages of the disease; 98%, 76%, 59% and 17% in stage I, II, III and IV, respectively2.  
Risk factors of endometr ial cancer are prolonged estrogen stimulation and endometrial 
hyperplasia. The disease is more frequently seen in women treated with estrogen replacement 
therapy. Also, synthesis of estrogens in body fat from adrenal and ovarian androgens may explain 
that endometrial cancer is frequently seen in elderly obese patients. Also women with diabetes 
(abnormal glucose intolerance in the majority), hypertension, and infertility have a higher 
incidence of endometrial cancer5. 
For newly  diagnosed late stage diseases including metastatic or recurrent disease, hormone therapy 
is the preferred first line systemic therapy for patients with receptor positive tumor in the absence 
of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574]. Multi -agent treatment is used fo r patients not suitable for hormonal 
therapy, with anthracyclines, platins and taxanes being preferred.  Based on a response rate of >  
60% for paclitaxel combined with carboplatin or cisplatin, this regimen is preferred as 1st line 
treatment for advanced en dometrial cancer or recurrent disease. If multi -agent chemotherapy is 
not tolerated single agent treatment is an option and paclitaxel is the recommended 1st choice as 
single agent and docetaxel is used if paclitaxel is contraindicated. There is no SoC for  second -line 
chemotherapy8.  
Cervical cancer  
The incidence of cervical cancer was 11,669 in US2 in 2014 and 33,354 in EU3 in 2012. Thirty -

survival was 66% in 2014 varying from 98% in stage I, 64% in stage II, 50% in stage III to 16% 
in stage IV2. 
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_524694] a 
high viral load increases the risk. Other risk factors of cervical cancer are human leukocyte antigen  
and viral subtypes, oral contraception, genital chlamydia infe ction and nicotine5.  
Chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer is a combination regimen in the 1st line 
setting. Paclitaxel is the main chemotherapy of different combination treatment options combined 
with either cisplatin or topotecan as the 2nd drug and bevacizumab added as the 3rd drug. If 
multiple -agent treatment is not an option cisplatin is prefe rred as single -agent but also paclitaxel 
is recommended. Several agents are recommended for 2nd line treatment and include docetaxel and 
vinorelbine9.  
Radiation therapy is a part of treatment in all stages of the disease exc ept for stage IA9.  
Thyroid cancer  
The highest Axl expression has been shown in the literature as well as in sponsor’s IHC staining 
studies in thyroid cancers.  
In the US, 62,450 new cases of thyroid carcinoma were expected t o be diagnosed by 2015 and the 
peak incidence is around age 50 years. The histopathological breakdown (based on data from 2008 -
2012) is approximately: 89% papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], 5% follicular, 2% medullary, 2% Hürthle cell and 1% 
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.  Anaplast ic thyroid carcinoma is almost uniformly lethal while 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_524695] (stages I -III) display 5 -year relative survival rates in the range 
of 90 -98%.  However, most thyroid carcinoma deaths are from papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], follicular and Hürthle cell 
carcinomas, which account for nearly 95% of all thyroid carcinoma cases. Approximately 1.950 
deaths are estimated each year among patients with thyroid carcinoma in the US.  
No effective therapy exists for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. The median survival fro m diagnosis 
is about 5 months and the 1 -year survival rate is about 20%. Single -agent doxorubicin is the only 
agent that is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) for this patient 
population. Single -agent paclitaxel may benefit some newly diagnosed patients; increased survival 
has been reported in patients with stage IVB disease10-12. The National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network  (NCCN) guideline recommends that given the poor outcome all patients should be  
consid ered for clinical trials13. 
The 5 -year survival rate for stage IV medullary thyroid carcinoma is about 28%14. The kinase 
inhibitors vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved by [CONTACT_524787]. Clinical 
trials can be considered as an alternative.

Melanoma  
In malignant melanoma, Axl expression has been associated with drug -resistance in mutant BRAF  
as well as NRAS  melanoma cell lines22. In addition, Axl expression was enhanced in patients with 
metastatic melanoma that did no t respond to anti -PD-1 therapy23, suggesting that Axl expression 
also relates to innate anti -PD-1 resistance. In house studies showed no or little expression of Axl 
in tumor tissues from malignant melanoma patients with pred ominantly early stage disease 
(GMB1021 -105). More recent investigations indicated that Axl is expressed in malignant 
melanoma tissue in patients with advanced/metastatic disease. In a cohort of malignant melanoma 
patients that relapsed from or became refra ctory to treatment with BRAF inhibitors ( GMB1021 -
121), Axl expression was observed in the majority of tumor tissues. Of note, Axl expression was 
variable between patients, regarding both staining intensity and percentage of Axl positive tumor 
cells.  
Cytot oxicity studies in vitro  showed that BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines that had become 
resistant to BRAF inhibitors, as well as NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, expressed Axl at levels 
sufficient to induce cytotoxicity with  enapotamab vedotin . Moreover, enap otamab vedotin  was 
able to induce tumor regression in both BRAF mutant, BRAF -inhibitor -resistant melanoma models

In conclusion, Axl expression was observed in malignant melanoma patients with advanced 
disease, and preclinical efficacy studies suggest that Axl expression levels are sufficient to induce 
anti-tumor activity with  enapotamab vedotin . This supports the exploration of enapotamab vedotin  
in such patient population. For more details please also refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.

high as 1.1% for women and 1.9% for men. The median age at presentation is [ADDRESS_680836] a better 
prognosis. The estimated an nual incidence for 2016 in the US is 162,981 cases and 63,549 cases 
in Western Europe2,15. 
In general the prognosis is excellent in patients who present with localized disease and primary 
tumors 1.0 mm or less in thickness, w ith 5-year survival achieved in more than 90% of patients.

Page 154 of 259 However, with stage III, 5 -year survival rates range from 20% to 70%, depending primarily on the 
nodal tumor burden. Historically, long -term survival in patients with distant metastatic melanoma, 
taken as a whole, has been less than 10%. However, the impact of emerging effective systemic

for patients that do not experience such long -term remission.  
The therapeutic landscape for metastatic melanoma is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_524700], which have demonstra ted better efficacy than chemotherapy. For 
first-line therapy of unresectable or metastatic disease, recommended treatment options include 
checkpoint immunotherapy, BRAF -targeted therapy for patients with BRAF -mutated disease, or 
clinical trial. For patien ts with documented BRAF V600 mutations, selection between first -line 
checkpoint immunotherapy and BRAF -targeted therapy can be difficult given the lack of 
comparative phase III clinical trials. BRAF -targeted therapy seems to be preferred in cases where 
disease is symptomatic or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36635], given that responses to checkpoint immunotherapy 
can take longer to develop15. 
For patients who progress on first -line therapy or achieve maximum clinical benefit from BRAF -
targeted therapy (if BRAF mutated), options for second -line therapy depend on ECOG 
performance status. Patients with poor performance (PS 3 -4) should be offered b est supportive 
care. Patients with PS [ADDRESS_680837] a variety of options depending on their BRAF status and treatment 
history: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_524701], or BRAF inhibitor / MEK 
inhibitor combination. In addition to the checkpoint  immunotherapy regimens recommended for 
first-line, second -line, and subsequent treatment of metastatic disease, single -agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_524702]15. 
For patients who progressed on checkpoint immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (and BRAF -targeted therapy if 
BRAF -mutated) additional options to consider for second -line or subsequent therapy include 
among others cytotoxic agents and clinical trials15. Common cytotoxic agents being used in 
patients with metastatic melanoma include dacarbazine, temozolomide, and paclitaxel with or 
without carboplatin15. These have demonstrated modest response rates less than 20% in first line 
and second -line settings. Nab -paclitaxel has yielded response rates of 22% to 26% in phase II trials 
among chemotherapy -naïve patients with metastatic melanoma16,17.

In the US, 12,390 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) were expected to be diagnosed by [ADDRESS_680840] common subtypes of STS are undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) liposa rcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and

are osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma.  
Except for GISTs, the approved armamentarium for systemic therapy of sarcomas is currently 
limited primarily to conventional chemotherapy also including vinca alkaloids and taxanes . A few 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_524703], sorafenib and olaratumab are registered. The National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN) guideline  recommend s that given the unsatisfactory 
outcome all patients should be  considered for clinical trials20, 21.

for use of treatment decision (with the exception of evaluation of patient eligibility which must be 
evaluated based on the central ECG reading).  The investigator ECG interpretation must be done 
using the paper ECG reading from the ECG machine by [CONTACT_524744]. For the 
ECG recordings, the patients must be resting and in a horizontal or half laid -back position for at 
least 10  minutes (the position should not change for following ECG s). Any irregularity observed 
or occurring during the ECGs (e.g.,  vomiting, cough) should either induce a repeat of the ECG or 
be annotated in the medical journal  with the description and time of the occurrence.   
Date and overall interpretation of the ECGs  is no  longer to be recorded in the eCRF . 
ECGs will be taken as single or triplicate ECGs according to Table 19 using local equipment. New 
or worsened cli nically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the AE form.  
16.2.7  Imaging/Computed Tomography  
All patients will have a CT -scan with contrast of thorax, abdomen and pelvis performed during 
screening. If there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_451383]/tumors, a CT -scan of the head will be performed 
before inclusion. For patients with stable brain metastases enrolled in the expansion part, the CT -
scan must include the head and neck.  
For patients with superficial cutaneous lesions that are not measurable by a CT -scan, measurement 
using calipers can be performed, using photographs as documentation.  
All sites of metastatic disease should be reported at baseline and followed throughout the trial. Up 
to 5 target lesions (maximum two per organ) will  be defined at screening. A lesion from which a 
fresh biopsy has been taken during the trial cannot be a target lesion.  
Baseline imaging assessments will be performed during the screening period. Any imaging 
assessments already completed for regular radiographic evaluation of the patient’s cancer can be 
considered as the baseline images for this trial, as long as they are o f sufficient diagnostic quality 
and have been obtained ≤ [ADDRESS_680853]-baseline scans will be performed every 12 weeks (±7 days) (1Q3W and Cohort 8 3Q4W) or 
8 weeks (±7  days) (Cohort 6 3Q4W) from C1D1 until investigator assessed disease prog ression 
according to RECIST v1.1. Time points for radiographic evaluation should be calendar based 
and do not depend on cycle visits i.e. radiological evaluation should be performed regardless of 
IMP administration delays . 
 
If reduction of target lesions ≥  30% in size is observed a repeat CT -scan will be performed after 
4 (in particular for the 3Q4W -arm) to 6 weeks (in particular for the 1Q3W -arm) (±7  days) to 
confirm the response.

Page 251 of 259 Unscheduled imaging may be performed at the investigators discretion to confirm response 
(intervals should not be shorter than 4 weeks). In case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_524678], imaging should be performed as soon as possible before 
the next scheduled evaluation.  In this case th e investigator must choose the imaging technology 
based on the clinical indication.  
 
MRI can be performed instead of CT -scan if the patient is allergic to iodine contrast or at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Localized CT with contrast or MRI (with o r without contrast; for sarcomas with contrast) must be 
acquired for assessment of lesions of the skeleton/extremities and head and neck if not visible on 
other images. At the discretion of the investigators, combined PET/CT (e.g., FDG -PET) may be 
performe d for tumor assessments as per RECIST 1.1, but only if the CT portion is of similar 
diagnostic quality to CT alone. Chest x -rays and ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor 
lesions.  
The same imaging modality and ideally the same scanner should be us ed throughout the trial to 
optimize the reproducibility of the assessment and preserve the accuracy of the assessment of 
response or progression.  
In the dose escalation part the reading of the scans will be done by a local radiologist. Sites should 
attemp t to maintain the same radiologist throughout the trial. The overall interpretation of the 
evaluation shall be recorded in the eCRF and a copy of the evaluation reports should be kept in the 
patient’s file.  
In the expansion part the scans will be read by t he local radiologist .  
16.2.8  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure and heart rate, should be measured if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093], but are not to be recorded in the eCRF as of Amendment 10. New 
or worsened clinically signific ant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the AE form.

The reporting period for non -serious AEs begins from the day of first treatment administration 
until the 30 day safety follow -up visit. Any non -serious AEs (signs, symptoms and diagnosis) 
occurring between screening and the day of first treatme nt administration should be recorded as 
medical history.  
SAEs should be reported from the time the patient signs the ICF (both on the eCRF AE form and 
the SAE reporting form) and until the [ADDRESS_680855] be reported to the investigator.

the day of C1D1 to confirm patient eligibility.  
Furthermore, local laboratory values may be obtained at the discretion of the investigator and used  
for other clinical treatment decisions of the patient.  
Local laboratory values must be recorded in the eCRF if they are assessed by [CONTACT_524791]/delays of enapotamab vedotin. In case local 
laboratory values are assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], a corresponding adverse 
event must be reported on an AE form (Section 9.1). Furthermore local labs will be assessed for 
the evaluation of DLT.  
16.3.1  Biochemistry  
Blood samples will be drawn in accordance with  Table 31.  
The following Biochemistry parameters will be analyzed locally the day before or on the day of 
each enapotamab vedotin  administration:  
Sodium, potassium, magnesium, creatinine, calcium, bloo d urea nitrogen, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, albumin, glucose, total bilirubin, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, lipase, amylase, 
and gamma -glutamyl transferase.  
16.3.2  Hematology  
Blood samples will be drawn as according to Table 31. 
The following hematology parameters will be analyzed locally at site (the day before or on the day 
of each enapotamab vedotin  administration):  
Red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count, reticulocyte count and coagulation factors (prothrombin  time, international

17. REPORTING OF A DVERSE  EVENTS AS OF AMENDMEN T 10 
17.1 Recording Instructions  
Instructions for reporting changes in an ongoing AE during a patient's participation in the trial are 
provided in the instructions that accompany the AE eCRFs.  
All AEs, regardless of relatedness or cause, s hould be reported as an AE in the eCRF.  
All AEs with an outcome of death (including  disease progression) should be reported as an AE (in 
the eCRF) and as an SAE from the time patients sign the ICF until [ADDRESS_680858] enapotamab 
vedotin  dosing.  
All AEs in the 30 day safety follow -up visit including laboratory findings considered to be 
clinically significant should be reported accordingly. After the 30 -day safety follow -up visit, 
should the investigator become aware of an SAE possibly related to  enapotamab vedotin , this 
should be reported accordingly.  
Laboratory assessments  
If a local laboratory value indicates dose modification/delay, the site will be asked to record the 
local laboratory value in the eCRF. Any local laboratory values leading to a dose 
modification/delay or are assessed by [CONTACT_524792] (Section 8.5). 
Pre-existing Co nditions  
In this trial, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before the AE reporting period started 
and noted on the medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as an AE. If 
a pre -existing condition worsens during the tr eatment period the event should be reported as an 
AE.

17.7 Safety Management Plan  
In order to secure full transparency regarding patient safety -related questions to sites participating 
in the trial, frequent communication of observations at the different sites will be required. The 
communication set -up will include the following co mponents:  
• SAEs must be reported from the investigational site to the sponsor via the Safety CRO within 
[ADDRESS_680866] biweekly safety/medical meetings to discuss AE s and laboratory data will be held 
with the participation of at least Drug Safety, sponsor medical officer and CRO Medical 
Monitor; and the safety data will be evaluated for individual treatment arms as well as across 
treatment arms. If safety signals warr anting actions are identified in one treatment arm, actions 
will be implemented in the other treatment arm if deemed relevant for the specific signal in 
question.   
• Monthly telephone conferences between all participating Investigators, CRO Medical 
Monitor a nd sponsor will be arranged  when deemed neces sary. Pending severity of observed 
safety signals, ad hoc meetings will be held.  
• A contact [CONTACT_524758].  
• 24 hours/7 days a week availability of  Medical Monitor.  
• Direct telephone link from investigator to sponsor medical officer.  
• DMC meetings following each cohort and ad hoc as needed. Ad-hoc DMC meetings may be 
called for by [CONTACT_524793] r any time during the escalation and expansion phases 
of the trial if new safety data warrants immediate action to the conduct of the trial. The 
outcome of the DMC meeting will be discussed and confirmed by [CONTACT_524794].  
• Investigators or their representative(s) may participate in the open part of the DMC meetings 
if deemed relevant.

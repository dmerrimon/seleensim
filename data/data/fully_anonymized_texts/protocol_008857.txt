 Introduction and Purpose: Th is study will assess the safety and efficacy of fractional CO2 
laser  treatment for Poikiloderma of Civatte (POC). POC is a chronic vascular and pi[INVESTIGATOR_697980] , as well as the chest area. 
Clinically, poikiloderma appears as a combination of telangiectasia, irregular pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and 
atrophic c hanges

Carbon dioxide laser was introduced for skin resurfacing in the mid -1990s . It has a wavelength 
of 10,600 nm, has an absorbing chromophore of water, and is used to vaporize tissue. It was initially used as a full- field laser resurfacing device which removes the entire skin surface in the 
area being tr eated. In 2004, Manstein et al. introduced the concept of fractional photothermolysis 
in which only small fraction of the skin would be treated at each session, leaving skip areas in 
between.
25 For the traditional full field laser resurfacing, healing occu rs from deeper structures 
alone; however, fractionated  laser resurfacing  has the advantage of healing from deeper

 The study subjects’ neck and décolletage area will be divided into two equal halves. The line of 
division will be from the mid mental protuberance to manubriosternal junction. One half of the 
neck and upper chest area will be treated with ablative fractional CO2 laser while the  other half 
will be untreated and used as a control. If desired after the study endpoint, patients may have the other side of their neck treated at no additional charge. Primary Outcome Measures:  
Physician's Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale  at 12- and 24- weeks post treatment. 
Photographs will be presented to a panel of independent dermatologists. The panel will be blinded to treatment parameters and the treatment laterality at each photograph time point. Each

4. Study procedures  
 
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of POC defined by a skin change with atrophy, 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], dilation of the fine blood vessels (telangiectasia) will be 
recruited. T en patients will be consented. Before the initial visit, all patients will complete a one-
month preoperative daily use of SPF 50+ sunscreen.  The sun protection is to reduce further sun damage and protect skin from increased photosensi tivity that may occur after laser resurfacing. 
At the initial visit, high resolution photographs of the affected area on the neck and décolletage area will be taken.  All patients will fill out a form with demographic information. Patients will be 
instructe d to come to their appointment with clean skin and without any lotions or moisturizers 
on the neck or décolletage area. Laser -specific eyewear will be provided to practitioners, 
patients, and all other people in the treatment room. A blue skin marking pen will be used to draw a line from mid mental protuberance to manubriosternal junction to divide tested area into two equal halves. Compounded benzocaine, lidocaine, and tetracaine (BLT) cream  in a 20:8:4% 
concentration  will be applied to the treatment area for 40 minutes prior to the procedure. Before

The side that undergoes treatment will be selected randomly. Forced cold air (Zimmer cooler) will also be used in conjunction with the laser device for better patient comfort.  
Cold compress es with refrigerated distilled water  can be used to reduce swelling and to soothe 
the skin with frequent reapplication of white petrolatum to keep the skin coated for days [ADDRESS_947467]-
spectrum sunscreen with SPF50+ will be required  after the first week .  
Give n the current pandemic, l imited in -person follow- ups will be scheduled (once at baseline 
before treatment, then at [ADDRESS_947468] procedural complications in a timely fashion. 
There will also be no costs to the patients for the laser  procedures as funding will be supplied by 
[CONTACT_697995] .  Patients desiring 
treatment of the control side after the study end -point (24 weeks) will be provided at no cost for 
the participants.

8. Sources of Research Material  
 Sources of materials used during this study will include data collected from patient surveys, data 
collected from blinded dermatologists’ assessment, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_697988]. These 
materials and data will be obtained at each patient visit. Given the current pandemic, only limited in-person follow- ups will be scheduled (once at baseline before treatment, then at 12 weeks, 24 
weeks). Participants will communicate immediate pos t-treatment issues or concerns along with 
selfies through MyChart on day 2, 3, 7, 10, [ADDRESS_947470] procedural complications in a timely fashion. Materials and data gathered will be obtained specifically for research purposes, and no existing records or specimens will be used.  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process  Subjects will be identified from patients presenting to the dermatology department at UT 
Southwestern. When a patient with POC  is identified, they will be offered inclusion in the study. 
Informed consent will be obtained. Both English and non-English speaking patients will be included. If the patient is non-English speaking, a certified translator will be used to obtain consent. Each patient will be informed that he or she has the right to withdraw consent and terminate participation in the study at any point if he or she so desires. No vulnerable populations (cognitively impaired, institutionalized, children) will be included in the study to minimize the risk of undue influence or coercion.  
10. Potential Risks:  
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  • Ocular – severe ocular complications such as corneal ulceration and cataract could 
happen with any laser devices. Therefore, CO2 laser specific eyewear will be provided to everyone in the treatment room. Ocular complication for this study should be low since we are mainly  targeting the neck and upper chest area instead of the facial area.   
• Pain – Topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459], and a forced- air cooling device will be used to help patients 
tolerate the procedure . Prolonged severe pain postoperatively may indicate other 
complications s uch as infection  infection and patient should contact [CONTACT_697996] -person to determine the cause.  
• Infection – patients will be counseled on signs of infection such as increased erythema, 
purulence, oozing and crusting. Patients will submit electronic selfies of the treatment 
area electronically to investigators on day 2, 3, 5, [ADDRESS_947471] 6 months, topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l mupi[INVESTIGATOR_697989].  
• Post-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]: This usually happen less frequently in lighter skin 
types which are the groups most commonly affected by [CONTACT_406416].  However, should this occur, hydroquinone and topi[INVESTIGATOR_697990]-point to alleviate the dyschromia.  
• Prolonged erythema: if erythema lasts more than 3 weeks postoperatively, a mid -potency 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_697991].  
• Scarring: patients with personal and family history of keloid disease and hypertrophic scar formation will be excluded from the study. If hypertrophic or keloidal scars happen, intralesional steroids will be used to flatten the scars.  
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring   
 All treatments will be completed at the Dermatology clinics at UT Southwestern where there are 
adequate resources for medical intervention in case of an adverse event such as increased bleeding, pain, or infection. The risk of severe bleeding is minimal and does not warrant the need for spare blood products or type and screening.  
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  
The study materials will not be disclosed to any outside persons or entities. Patient surveys collected will be stored securely in files in the dermatology offices and will not be removed from campus.  
13. Potential Benefits  
• Improved overall dyschromia and telangiectasia of the chest and neck area 
• Overall increased patient satisfaction and quality of life 
• Provide patients safe and effective alternative for treatment of discoloration and atroph y 
of neck and chest area which hopefully can be generalized to similar patient populations.  
 
14. Biostatistics 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient demographics. Count (%) will be used 
for categorical variables; and mean, standard deviation (SD), and range (min/max) will be used 
to summarize continuous variables with approximately normal distrib utions. Skewed continuous 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_211073] (IQR). Outcome data will be collected on patient  satisfaction assessment scores and physician’s global aesthetic improvement 
scores, a s well as assessment of adverse events. The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to 
compare the magnitude of change between the baseline scores and post -intervention scores. The 
Wilcoxon signed rank test will also be used to compare the magnitude of change of the  treated 
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  area and the co ntrol area .   A p -score of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The 
target sample size is 10 people.

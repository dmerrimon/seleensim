2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Current imaging of prostate cancer  
Per NCCN guidelines ,
[ADDRESS_101672] techniques at this time -point:  
• Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease to 
select treatment or guide change in management  
• Anatomic imaging techniques include plain film radiographs, ultrasound, 
CT, and MRI.  
• Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PET, and advanced MRI techniques such as spe ctroscopy and di ffusion -weighted 
imaging (DWI).  
2.2. Prostate Cancer, Biochemical Recurrence  
Biochemical recurrence will be defined using the AUA and ASTRO -Phoenix 
definitions. Specifically:  
2.2.1. Post radical prostatectomy (RP) – AUA recommendation
1 is PSA greater 
than 0.2 ng/mL measured 6–13 weeks after RP and Confirmatory persistent 
PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL.  
2.2.2. Post-radiation therapy –  ASTRO- Phoenix consensus definition2 nadir + 
greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA

Current evidence regarding detection rate of  biochemical recurrence (BCR ) 
with 68Ga-HBED -CC PSMA (68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC) PET/CT from two recent 
papers : 
• Morigi, 2015: Detection rate was 50% when PSA was below 0.5 ng/mL, 
69% for PSA 0.5–2.0 ng/mL, and 86% when PSA was above 2.0 4. 
• Eiber, 2015: Detection rate was 57.9% for PSA 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL, 72.7% 
for PSA 0.5 to <1, 93.0% for 1 to <2.0, and 96.8% for ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_101673] been 11 studies6,7,10 -12,14,15,26 -29 describing use of 68Ga

Maurer et al.  (2014) [[LOCATION_013]].[ADDRESS_101674] radical prostatectomy and templated lymph 
node dissection as well as conventional imaging (CT, MRI). The primary inclusion criterion was  intermediate -to-high risk prostate cancer scheduled to 
undergo radical prostatectomy. The only exclusion criterion was presence, or 
history, of a secondary malignancy. A total of [ADDRESS_101675] -operative histopathological results 
analyzed all the imaging data sets (
68Ga PSMA -PET/CT and PET/MR). 
Conventional imaging was read prior to the  68Ga PSMA -PET data. Results 
yielded a patient -based ROC AUC of 0.835 (95% CI 0.763 –  0.908) for  68Ga 
PSMA -PET and an AUC of 0.691 (95% CI 0.592- 0.789) for conventional 
imaging. For  68Ga PSMA -PET, patient -based sensitivity was 65.9 %, 
specificity was 98.9%, and an overall accuracy of 88.5%. In contrast, 
conventional imaging had a patient -based sensitivity of 43.9%, specificity of 
85.4%, and an overall accuracy of 72.3%. On a template -based analysis 
driven by [CONTACT_92122], the  68Ga PSMA- PET sensitivity was 
calculated as 78.2%, specificity as 99.1%, and accuracy as 95.7%. Conventional imaging resulted in a sensitivity of 29.1%, specificity of 97.2%, 
and accuracy of 86.1%.

13 The purpose of this prospective trial 
was to assess accuracy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC -PET/CT for lymph node 
page 9 of 33 staging in intermediate - and high- risk prostate cancer. Criteria for selection 
included planned radical prostatectomy, treatment naïve, negative bone scan, 
no concurrent (or history of) a secondary malignancy, and at >5%  risk of 
metastatic lymph nodes. Patients with suspected extra -nodal disease on prior 
contrast -enhanced CT were excluded. 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT was 
performed <[ADDRESS_101676] was performed at the same imaging session of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC -PET. Images were analyzed by [CONTACT_92123]; 
it is not stated if the physicians were blinded to the pathologic results or i f the 
scan interpretations were completed prior to surgery. Results yielded a 
patient -based specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 64%, positive predictive value 
of 88%, and negative predictive value of 82%. Lymph node analysis yielded 
specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 58%, PPV of 94% and NPV of 98%. The 
mean size of true- positive metastatic lymph nodes was 4.7 mm (± 1.4mm) 
and false- negative size was 2.7mm (± 1.3mm).  
Eiber et al.  (2015)  [[LOCATION_013]].10 The purpose of this retrospectiv e study was 
to investigate the detection rate of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT in men 
with biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL). Only men who had 
undergone a radical prostatectomy, had not received chemotherapy, and had a 
diagnostic CT done with the PSMA im aging study were included. Men 
undergoing antiandrogen therapy (n=70) were included. A total of [ADDRESS_101677] was observed with antiandrogen use (p=0.0783).  PSMA was able to 
identify additional areas of disease involvement in 61 subjects (24.6%) 
whereas CT showed additional regions in 17 subjects (6.9%). A significant 
limitation of the study was a lack of histopathology for outcome comparisons. 
Sensitivity, sp ecificity, positive and negative predictive values are not 
provided.  
Afshar -Oromieh et al.  (2015)  [[LOCATION_013]].7 The purpose of this retrospective 
study was to analyze the diagnostic value of  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT 
in a large cohort with multiple variables. The cohort was designed to align with a generalized population; men were included if they had suspected 
progressive disease following conventional therapy (radiation therapy and/o r 
radical prostatectomy, n=292) or to determine metastatic disease burden prior 
to initial therapy (n=27). Of those with suspected recurrence, [ADDRESS_101678] scan was 
performed at the same imaging ses sion as the PET scan; additionally, a low -
dose attenuation scan was performed for the 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET. 
Scans were interpreted by [CONTACT_92124] -certified nuclear medicine physicians. 
No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacological effects were noted 
in any of the subjects following injection of the PSMA -HBED -CC 
page 10 of 33 radiotracer. A total of 901 tumor lesions were observed in 319 subjects. 
Lesion -based analysis yielded sensitivity of 76.6%, specificity of 100%, 
negative predictive value of 91.4%, and positive predictive value of 100%. Because all patients were assumed to have tumor and therefore could not be considered ‘true negative,’ the authors did not provide a per -patient 
calculation.

8. The purpose of 
this small study was to estimate human radiation dosimetry for  68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC under approval of an RDRC research protocol. Both 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in subjects (n = 9). Administered dose of 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC was 3.[ADDRESS_101679],23 B-cell follicular

Summary. To date, a prospective, well -controlled clinica l trial evaluating the 
efficacy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT has not been performed for prostate 
cancer. Robust trials for both initial diagnosis as well as those men with suspected recurrence needs to be designed and performed. Current retrospective review  of 
68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT done in foreign nations suggests strong efficacy of 
the 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC radiotracer. Currently, three clinical trials are underway –  
two foreign, one domestic.30-32 Additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trials should be completed 
in the U.S. to determine effectiveness in the generalized population a nd determine 
requirements for implementation if found effective.  
2.5. Rationale  
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  
We aim to image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium- 68 
labeled HBED -CC PSMA (68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC) in order to demonstrate its 
utility.  We plan to utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED -CC compound, so that this agent will become widely available for clinical 
imaging in prostate cancer patien ts.  
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC has become of particular interest due to [ADDRESS_101680] article demonstrate d that 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT ha d a higher 
sensitivity for the detection of disease than F -18 choline in a head -to-head intra -
patient comparison that included 37 patients7. The second paper looked at the 
sensitivity of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC in the detection of metastatic lesions in patients 
with recurrent prostate cancer8. Their results show ed a detection rate of 50% for 
patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are significantly higher than that 
reported by [CONTACT_40605]

• Enter subject into the OnCore database of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.  
page 12 of 33 • Scan the record of consent int o the subject’s medical record.  
5. PROCEDURES  
Protocol should not supersede standard of care procedures for patient safety.  
5.1. Imaging preparation  
5.1.1. Oral hydration. Participants will be encouraged to maximize hydration the 
day before and day of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC imaging.  
5.1.2. Furosemide . 20 mg furosemide (IV push) will be administered concurrently 
or immediately after radiotracer administration to minimize PET scatter 
artifacts from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder.  
5.1.3. Contrast . Imaging contrast will not be ordered as part of this study.  
5.1.4. Voiding . Participants will be asked to void prior to radiotracer injection.  
5.2. 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC administration  
5.2.1. Dose . 3-7 mCi ( 111 – 259 MBq) . Target 5 mCi.  
5.2.2. Route of administration . Intravenous.  
5.2.3. Frequency . Once per PET scan.  
5.2.4. Uptake time . 75 minutes ±  25 minutes. Target 75 minutes  
5.3. Prohibited Medications  
None.  
5.4. PET/CT scan  
5.4.1. Scan coverage . Scan coverage will extend from mid -thigh to the base of the 
skull, starting from the mid -thighs to minimize urinary bladder radiotracer 
accumulation at the start of PET imaging. Subject to void immediately prior to imaging.  
5.4.2. Bed position . Scan time will be dependent on scanner capabilities. At a 
minimum, [ADDRESS_101683]’s 
page [ADDRESS_101684]’s medical record.  
5.5. Visual I nterpretation of PET data  (internal blind reads ) 
Regions of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by [CONTACT_30783] 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive . Regions are defined in Table 12.[ADDRESS_101685] of care consistent with the 
institution/physician. Reports and copi[INVESTIGATOR_92107] 12 month window following the PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scan will be 
obtained. Clini cal notes will also be reviewed to identify metastatic lesions.  
Interpretation of follow -up imaging is performed by [CONTACT_92126]. Preferable comparison imaging would be the same imaging 
device as the initial re -staging work -up as per RECIST guidelines .  
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive findings will be validated as true positive or 
false positive as outlined in more detail below. False  negative 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET findings will only be determined when positive  biopsies of 68Ga PSMA -HBED-
CC PET negative lesions that are present on conventional imaging are performed as 
part of standard clinical care. This scenario is uncommon. 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET validation based on follow -up imaging  (CT, MRI, bone 
scan) : 
5.6.1. Lymph nodes  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC positive nodes will be assessed for 
change in size using standard of care follow -up imaging.  
5.6.2. PSMA -positive osseous or metastatic lesions.  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
positive osseous or distant metastatic lesions will be followed by [CONTACT_92127] (bone scan, NaF PET, CT or MRI) at the treating phy sician’s 
discretion and local standard of care.  
5.6.3. Biopsy. Biopsies to determine metastas es or provide information for re -
staging should be performed at treating physician’s discretion and per local 
standard of care.  
5.7. General Concomitant Medication and Suppor tive Care Guidelines  
In general, subjects may receive full concomitant and supportive care throughout this 
trial.   
5.8. Follow -Up  
5.8.1. Active follow -up. Subjects will be actively followed for acute adverse 
events for 10 radioactive half -lives rounded up to the cal endar day ( as per 
the established standard ). With a half -life of 67.[ADDRESS_101686]’s outcome will be 
followed through passive chart review. Contact [CONTACT_92128]/or subject’s 
treating physicians may occur to better define treatment outcomes.  
page 14 of 33 5.9. Criteria for remo val from study 
• Consent . Subjects must be able to continue to provide consent for this 
study. If a treating physician or study team member believes a subject can 
no longer provide prospective consent, the investigator will be contact[CONTACT_92129].  
• Refusal to continue in the study . In this event, the reasons for  withdrawal 
will be documented.  
6. PATIENT ASSESSMENTS  
6.1. Post-consent Baseline Data Collection  
Post-consent, the following data should be collected  
6.1.1. Serial PSA.  Most recent serial PSA values defining biochemical recurrence 
(i.e., two PSA values meeting  AUA or ASTRO recurrence criteria).  
6.1.2. PSA.  Baseline PSA  levels  within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET/CT should be obtained.  
6.1.3. Pathology. Cop y of original pathology report documenting Gleason score 
and date sample obtained. Also, obtain a copy of any pathology reports 3 
months prior to the 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT . 
6.1.4. Bone scan.  If a bone scan was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -
HBED -CC PET/CT, obtain a copy of the images and the report.  
6.1.5. MRI . If an MRI was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET/CT, obtain a copy of the images and the report. 
6.1.6. CT scan . If a CT was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET/CT, obtain a c opy of the images and the report.  
6.1.7. Change in management. A pre -imaging survey of planned clinical 
management will be performed ≤ 10 days prior to 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET/CT imaging.  
6.2. Pre-Imaging Assessments (Baselines)  
6.2.1. Constitutional adverse events. A baseline evaluation will be obtained prior 
to injection and  will be graded against CTCAE. 
6.2.2. Vital signs . Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature will be obtained 
immediately before and after injection of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC, in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
6.3. Post-Imaging Assessments 
6.3.1. Vital signs . Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature will be obtained 
when subject is supi[INVESTIGATOR_92108].  
6.3.2. Constitutional adverse events.  Prior to discharge from the PET Imaging 
Center, the subject will be assessed for untoward medical event(s) that have 
occurred since injection of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC.  These will be graded 
with CTCAE.  
6.3.3. Symptom review . Subject will be contact[CONTACT_92130] [ADDRESS_101687] -imaging survey of clinical management 
using PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT information will be performed ≤ 30 days 
of PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging for assessment o f change in clinical 
management.  
6.4.2. Change in management [ADDRESS_101688] imaging. A survey of clinical 
management will be performed approximately 6 month after the PSMA -
HBED -CC PET/CT imaging for assessment of change in clinical 
management.  
6.4.3. Follow -up imaging . Conventional imaging ordered per standard of care up 
to [ADDRESS_101689] 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for 
study analysis.   If imaging is NOT obtained per standard of care the research 
study will obtain a CT (abdomen and p elvis w/ contrast if contrast not 
contraindicated).   Readers will be unbli nded to all results and will be 
specifically informed of the location of the 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET 
positive  lesions so follow -up measurements may be performed on the same 
lesions. 
6.4.4. Pathology. Results from pathology ordered per standard of care up to [ADDRESS_101690] 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for study 
analysis.  
6.4.5. Laboratory. Results from  laboratory reports related to prostate cancer 
monitoring (e.g. PSA levels) ordered per standard of care up to [ADDRESS_101691] 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for study analysis.  
6.4.6. Second 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT (if medically indicated) . If the 
1st 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scan shows lymph nodes  or visceral 
(soft tissue) lesions  positive for prostate cancer disease, but surgery or 
biopsy results in negative pathology; the subject  may be asked to return  to 
complete  a 2nd Ga-68 PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imag ing visit.

Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET:  
Local Interpretations:   PET images will initially be interpreted by a board certified 
nuclear medicine physician or a board- certified radiologist experienced in reading 
PET at the time of the imaging study at the institution that the study is being 
performed. These interpretati ons will not be used for evaluation of the primary 
endpoint.  
Blinded  Read Logistics:  Imaging data will be de -identified. PET data will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_92138] a random order at separate reading sessions. 
Cross sectional imaging (CT or M RI) from the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET will be 
available for anatomic correlate. The blinded readers will be blinded to all other 
imaging results and all other clinical data.  
Reader Positivity and Negativity Definition:  Sub-regions defined in Table 12.2 will 
be graded for the presence of suspected disease on a two -point scale by [CONTACT_30783] 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive.. 
12.1.1. Criteria for visual interpretation:  
Sub-regions  of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by [CONTACT_92139] (0=Negative or 1=  Positive). A region will be judged as 
positive if at least one lesion in this region is visually positive.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than blood pool (adjacent 
or mediastinal blood pool).  
- Lymph nodes will be classified further by [CONTACT_11338]: pelvic, 
retroperitoneal, thoracic and other.  Additionally, pelvic lymph 
nodes will be sub- classified accord ing to their localization as 
follows: R/L obturator, R/L external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups).  These pelvic sub-regions will 
be correlated with reference standard results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region data wi ll not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for exploratory analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 
68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic 
background activity of the involvement organ or anatomic site. 
- Visceral lesions will be classified further by [CONTACT_92140]: lung, 
liver, pancreas... as defined in Table [ADDRESS_101696] results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region data will not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for 
exploratory analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
page 22 of 33 HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic bone 
marrow.  
- Bone lesions will be classified by [CONTACT_92141]: spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ribs, 
pelvis, extremities, skull, sternum, and clavicle , as Defined in 
Table 12.2.  These sub- regions will be correlated with 
reference standard results in these sub- regions, however this 
sub-region data will not be directly used for evaluation of the 
primary or secondary endpoint s, but for exploratory analysis .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered positive if 
the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than 
physiologic background activi ty of the involvement organ or 
anatomic site.  
12.2. Reference standard definition:  
12.2.1. Histopathology/Biopsy will be the primary determinate of tissue positivity 
and negativity for prostate cancer disease. Pathology date, organ, and 
location as well as any notes rel ated to the pathology will be obtained from 
the subject  chart.  The anatomical r egion/sub- region the pathology occurred 
in will be assigned by [CONTACT_92142]:  
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC positive findings are aimed to be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_26745]/biopsy if clinically feasible.  Pathology performed 60 days 
before or after the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET will be available for 
correlation.  
Histopathological procedures and biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated and as per institutional protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lymph Node s, Visceral Lesions, and Bone Lesions positive for 
disease by [CONTACT_56618].  
− Lesions with positive pathologic confirmation will be regarded as 
positive for disease. The regionality of the resected tissue will be 
assigned into respective regions and sub- regions  as described abov e in 
Table 12.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lymph Nodes and Visceral Lesions negative for disease by [CONTACT_56618].  
− Tissue removed and negative for pathology are considered negative for 
prostate cancer disease, unless subsequent conventional imaging 
or 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET imaging demonstrates that targeted 
tissue were not resected. In this case:  
i. Subjects can be rescanned with dedicated CT, MRI, or 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT to determine if the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC tissue was removed. If the tissue is 
confirmed as removed, this is considered negative for disease.  
page 23 of 33 ii. If 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue is still 
present, a needle biopsy can be pursued at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Images of the procedure will be reviewed to determine i f the correct tissue was biopsied.  
- If the 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a negative pathologic finding of the biopsied tissue is considered negative for disease.  
- If the 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a positi ve pathologic finding of the biopsied 
tissue is considered positive for disease.  
- If biopsy or re -biopsy is not performed, or the wrong tissue 
was biopsied, change in node size as measured by [CONTACT_92143].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bone lesions:  Given the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous metastases in subject s with prostate cancer, subject s with 
negative bone biopsies of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive 
lesions will be further eva luated:  
- If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnoses that is known to be 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC positive (eg Renal Cell 
Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), then this will be considered negative for disease.  
- If pathology is indeterminate, then follow -up imaging as 
described below will be performed as per clinical standards at the site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Although not routinely performed during standard practice, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and lymph node metastases) may be performed, although not required.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. All regions not sampled for biopsy/histopathology will be designated as indeterminate for disease by [CONTACT_56618]. Conventional imaging follow -up may be used in these cases to 
determine tissue status.  
12.2.2. Follow -up Imaging will be used as a  secondary assessment for prostate 
cancer in the event pathology information is not available:  
All subject s will be tracked for follow -up conventional imaging between 3- [ADDRESS_101697] 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC (dedicated CT, MRI and/or bone scan) 
as per site standard of care.  If no follow -up imaging has been performed 
within the [ADDRESS_101698] positive 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED- CC findings because conventional imaging assessment for disease is 
primarily targeting suspi[INVESTIGATOR_92115] 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -
CC PET/CT. Interpretation of follow -up imaging will be performed by [CONTACT_92144]. Preferably, the follow -up conventional imaging should be the same 
modality/modalities as the initial staging work -up to allow for reproducible 
and accurate co mparisons.  Conventional imaging standards as described 
below will be used to determine tissue positive for prostate cancer disease. 
Conventional imaging will not be used to determine negative prostate cancer disease regions due to its inherently low negative predictive value.  
Tissue positive for
 prostate cancer disease based on follow -up imaging:  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lymph nodes  will be assessed by [CONTACT_92145].  
i. Positive for disease:  
a. -For subject s undergoing systemic treatment (alone or in

follow -up imaging within [ADDRESS_101699] or MRI decrease by [CONTACT_726] 30% in 
short axis diameter and PSA declines by [CONTACT_726] 50%. 
- If PSA increases by [CONTACT_726] 25% (PCWG3 definition of 
recurrence)  on systemic therapy, then an increase in the 
size of lesion by [CONTACT_726] 20% in the short axis diameter 
will be considered a positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lymph node(s) receiving targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment there are two ways to achieve positive for disease designation:  
- If the subject shows a decrease of PSA by [CONTACT_7809] 50% after targeted treatment and the lymph node does not enlarge (change in size less than 20% in the short axis diame ter or less than 3 mm increase in short axis diameter) 
[OR]

follow -up imaging within [ADDRESS_101702] or MRI decrease by [CONTACT_726] 30% in long 
axis diameter and PSA declines by [CONTACT_726] 50%.  
- If PSA increases by [CONTACT_726] 25% (PCWG3 definition of recurrence) on systemic therapy, then an increase in the size of lesion by [CONTACT_726] 20% in the long axis  diameter 
will be considered positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lesions(s) receiving targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment there are two ways to meet positive disease criteria: 
- If the subject demonstrates a decre ase of PSA by [CONTACT_92149] 50% after targeted treatment [ OR] 
- If on post -treatment follow -up imaging within [ADDRESS_101703] or MRI decrease by [CONTACT_726] 30% in long axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size)  
c. For untreated subje cts: If on follow -up imaging within [ADDRESS_101704] or MRI increase by [CONTACT_726] 20%

i. Positive for disease on baseline assessment:  
- Any positiv e sclerotic lesion on the CT portion of the 
68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC PET or on a separate CT obtained ≤  30 days 
before or after the PET/CT.  
- Focal uptake on the baseline bone scan performed within one month of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.  
- Any MRI lesion in bone read as positive on the initial MRI 
performed within one month of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Statistical Justification  
This study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_92116] r 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
for the detection of metastatic prostate cancer in the biochemical recurrent population. 
Based upon literature , we anticipate sensitivities of > 80% in this patient population, 
but there are uncertainties, particularly related to the pr oposed reference standard. We 
plan to use the results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], potentially combined with reported results 
from other sites across the US performing similar  studies (same patient population, 
same methods, same reference standard definitions…) to determine most- appropriate 
primary endpoint sensitivities for a larger University of Iowa study to follow this one, so as to appropriately statistically power the larger study.  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_92117] -[ADDRESS_101705] -prostatectomy biochemical 
recurrence; physicians’ ability to correctly identify biochemical recurrence via Ga- 68 
PSMA relative to our pathology/conventional imaging reference standard. Due to the 
lack of clinical experience with this radiopharmaceutical, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_92118].  
To evaluate sensitivity, patients must undergo both Ga -68 PSMA imaging and 
evaluation for biochemical recurrence by [CONTACT_56618], follow -up conventional imaging, 
or both. Sensitivity is defined as:

Primary:  Sensitivity on a per -subject basis of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using 
the Wilson score method.   
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_92119].  
Secondary:  PPVs on a per -subject and per -region -basis of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
for detection of tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using 
the Wilson score method. 
The following definitions will define accuracy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up 
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_92119].

 TRIAL DESIGN 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_55505] ( alloSCT). Pembrolizumab 
will be administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg IV every 3 weeks . Approximately 12-26 
patients with relapsed MDS, AML, or mature B cell (B-NHL, cHL) malignancies that 
                                                                                                                                 
[ADDRESS_60458] will be enrolled on this trial.  Pembrolizumab treatment 
will be administered for up to 24 months, provided that neither  disease progression, nor 
development of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), has occurred. Ad verse events will be 
monitored every three weeks th roughout the trial and graded in severity according to the 
guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0. This trial will be conducted in accordance  with Good Clinical 
Practices. 
Briefly, patients will undergo baseline eligibility screening w ithin 2 weeks prior to 
enrollment, including a medical history, physical examination, and assessment of 
performance status and hematology and chemistry parameters. Bas eline assessment of 
disease status will be based on results of a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_55506] 
w i t h  A M L  a n d  M D S ,  a n d  a  C T / P E T  s c a n  ( w i t h  a  b o n e  m a r r o w  e x a m  f o r history of 
disease involvement) for patients with lymphoma. Baseline and s ubsequent bone marrow 
and peripheral blood samples will be obtained for correlative a ssays. Disease response 
assessment (bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_55507]/or CT/PET) will  be performed at 
baseline, and then every 3 months for 2 years, as well as any t ime if relapse is suspected. 
Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well a s their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the trial flow chart – Section 7.0.  Details of 
each procedure are provided in Section 8.0 – trial procedures. After 24 months, ongoing 
disease re-assessments will be performed at the discretion of t he treating physician. Any 
patient who experiences biopsy-pr oven disease progression at an y time will be removed 
from study, and alternative treat ment can be recommended at the  treating physician’s 
discretion. Subjects are not eligib le for re-treatment on with pembrolizumab in the setting 
of this protocol should they expe rience a disease relapse after  completing [ADDRESS_60459] will be follo wed for 30 days for adverse 
event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of 
treatment). Subjects who discont inue treatment for reasons othe r than disease progression 
will have post-treatment follow- up for disease status until dis ease progression, initiating a 
non-study cancer treatment, withdr awal of consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All 
subjects will be followed by [CONTACT_55540] f or overall surv ival until death, withdrawal 
of consent or the end of the s tudy, whichever comes first. 
The primary objective of this tria l is to determine whether adm inistration of 
pembrolizumab is tolerable in patients who have experienced dis ease relapse following 
alloSCT. Secondary objectives include analysis of efficacy para meters (ORR, DOR, OS).  
Correlative studies to examine the effect of PD-1 blockade ther apy on T cell parameters 
and clonality, as well as on donor chimerism are planned as exp loratory analyses. 
A DLT is defined as the development of grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD (defined by [CONTACT_55541]), graft reje ction, the development of any une xpected grade > 2 toxicity 
felt to be related to pembrolizumab, or the development of > gr ade 2 dysfunction of a 
vital organ felt to be secondary to an immune-related adverse e vent within 90 days 
following the initiation of pembrolizumab treatment.  For immun e-related adverse events 
that do not meet criteria for a DLT, but do meet criteria for a  treatment-limiting toxicity 
(TLT), for example grade 2 acute GVHD, pembrolizumab will held until the toxicity has

 TRIAL OVERVIEW 
The trial overview is depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] 1 . 
Table 1. Trial overview  
Initial treatment  Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 of each 21 day 
cycle 
Treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT) (for example, grade 2 acute GVHD) Hold treatment for up to 12 weeks.. For immune-
related adverse events that do not meet criteria for a DLT, but do meet criteria for a treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT), for example grade 2 acute GVHD,  pembrolizumab can be restarted provided that the toxicity has decreased to < g rade 2. For patients who 
develop GVHD or an immune-related adverse event while on pembrolizumab, corticosteroid therapy and potentially other immunomodulatory agents will be initiated. Re-start treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 of each 21 day cycle, provided that the TLT has resolved to ≤ grade 1. Permanently discontinue if no improvement in toxicity to ≤ grade 1 in 12 weeks. 
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) Discontinue treatment. Remove patient from study 
 
3.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHESES 
 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE & HYPOTHESIS 
Objective: T o  d e t e r m i n e  t h e  t o l e r a b i l i t y  o f  p e m b r o l i z u m a b  t r e a t m e n t  i n  t h e  s e t t i n g  o f  
relapsed myeloid malignancies and mature B cell lymphomas follo wing alloSCT. 
Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab administered for disease relapse following alloSC T will be

 tolerable with an acceptable inci dence of immune-related advers e events, including 
GVHD. 
 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHESES 
Objective 1:  To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of patients treat ed with 
pembrolizumab in the setting of relapsed myeloid malignancies a nd mature B cell 
lymphomas following alloSCT, stratified by [CONTACT_55542]. ORR is  defined as the first 
documentation of CR or PR (by [CONTACT_55543]) to the first documentation o f disease progression or 
death by [CONTACT_55544]. 
Objective 2:  To determine the duration of response (DOR) of patients treate d with 
pembrolizumab in the setting of relapsed myeloid malignancies a nd mature B cell 
lymphomas following alloSCT. DOR is defined as the time between  the initial response 
to therapy and subsequent dis ease progression or relapse. 
Objective 3:  To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients treated wit h 
pembrolizumab in the setting of relapsed myeloid malignancies a nd mature B cell 
lymphomas following alloSCT. OS is defined as the interval from  the start of the study 
treatment to death from any cause. 
Hypothesis 1:  Pembrolizumab will have anti-tumor activity in the defined pat ient 
population as measured by [CONTACT_3168].  
 EXPLORATORY OBJECT IVES & HYPOTHESES 
Objective 1: To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on restoring donor chi merism in 
patients with relapsed myeloid malignancies and mature B cell l ymphomas following 
alloSCT.     
Objective 2: To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the numbers and act ivations 
status of peripheral blood T cells. 
Objective 3:  To compare PD-L1 expression on malignant cells at initial diag nosis and at 
disease relapse following alloSCT. 
Objective 4:  To examine the effect of pembrolizumab on the T cell receptor (TCR) 
repertoire in the peripheral blood, and where available, tumor environment, following 
alloSCT. 
Hypothesis 1: Pembrolizumab treatment will restore donor chimerism when 
administered to patients with relapsed myeloid malignancies and  mature B cell 
lymphomas following alloSCT. 
Hypothesis 2: Pembrolizumab treatment will be associated with enhanced expres sion of 
activation markers on peripheral blood T cells in patients with  relapsed myeloid 
malignancies and mature B cell lymphomas following alloSCT.

 Hypothesis 3: PD-L1 expression will be increas ed on malignant cells following  disease 
relapse after alloSCT compared to diagnosis. 
Hypothesis 4: Pembrolizumab treatment will be associated with clonal expansio n of 
conventional and regulatory T cell subsets in peripheral blood as measured by [CONTACT_55545]-β 
deep sequencing and Simpson’s index of diversity analysis. 
4.[ADDRESS_60461] remains the only curative treatment modality for many h igh-risk and relapsed 
hematological malignancies. The widespread use of reduced-inten sity conditioning (RIC) 
regimens has expanded patient eligibility for alloSCT due to re duced rates of transplant-
related mortality (TRM).  However, disease relapse remains the major cause of mortality 
following alloSCT 1.  The infusion of T cell-depleted allografts, a common practic e at 
some institutions to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disea se (GVHD), has also been 
associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence following a lloSCT 2, 3, 4.  Prognosis of 
patients with aggressive hematological cancers that relapse fol lowing alloSCT is aby[CONTACT_55546] 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Treatment options for this patient population are extremely l imited, and new 
therapeutic approaches are needed. 
 IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE IN HEMATOLOGICAL 
MALIGNANCIES.  
PD-L1 expression on malignant and non-malignant cells in the tu mor environment 
potently down-regulates the func tion of PD-1-expressing tumor a ntigen-specific T cells 
10, 11, 12. Interference with PD-1/PD-L1 interactions can “re-awaken” pre viously 
generated, but ineffective anti-t umor T cell responses. PD-1 bl ockade has demonstrated 
remarkable clinical efficacy in a number of solid tumors 13, 14, and has created a new 
paradigm for cancer treatment.  
PD-1 blockade has also been effective in some hematological can cers, particularly 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 15, in which the genetic loci that encode the PD-1 ligands are 
commonly amplified 16. In patients with relapsed/refractory HL, treatment with the P D-1 
blocking antibody, nivolumab, led to an objective response rate  ( O R R )  o f  8 7 %  ( 7 0 %  
partial responses – PR, and 17% complete responses – CR).  At 2 4 weeks, 86% of 
responding patients were progression-free 15. Pembrolizumab, a similar PD-1 blocking 
antibody, induced ORR and CR rates of 53% and 20%, respectively , in a heavily pre-
treated group of HL patients 17. An updated abstract presented at ASCO 2016 showed 
that in patients refractory to brentuximab vedotin, pembrolizum a b  t r e a t m e n t  w a s  
associated with a 65% ORR. Many of the responses observed were durable 18. 
With regard to NHL, a phase II study of a third PD-[ADDRESS_60462] ed in patients with 
relapsed follicular lymphoma. ORR and CR rates were impressive at 66% and 52 % 19. 
Preliminary results of a phase I study of nivolumab in patients  with refractory 
                                                                                                                                 
11 
 hematological malignancies demonstrated a 36% and 40% ORR in di ffuse large B cell 
lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, respectively. There were also  responses in patients 
with peripheral and cutaneous T cell lymphomas 20.  Therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies 
has been generally safe, and only a few grade 3 or 4 toxicities  were reported.  Immune-
related adverse events can occur following PD-1 blockade, but a re less common and 
severe than what has been observed with the CTLA-4 blocking ant ibody, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 21.  
Clinical studies of PD-1 blockade are currently ongoing in othe r hematological cancers, 
such as AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  (MK3475 KEYNOTE 013; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and the results are eagerly awaited.  Our group has 
demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions promote immune evasio n  i n  a  p r e - c l i n i c a l  
AML model 22, and our preliminary data indicates that human AML blasts from  a  
fraction of patients express PD-L1 when analyzed by [CONTACT_28866], arguing that 
interfering with PD-1/PD-L1 interactions may be therapeutically  efficacious in human 
myeloid malignancies as well. 
 PD-1/PD-L1 INTERACTIONS, GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) 
AND THE GRAFT-VERSUS-TUMOR EFFECT (GVT).  
Acute GVHD is influenced by [CONTACT_55547] n egatively modulate donor 
T cell activation, and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has been previous ly implicated in 
exacerbating acute GVHD in pre-clinical models. For example, in  a MHC-mismatched 
murine alloSCT model, acute GVHD was enhanced in transplant rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_55508] a 
PD-L1 blocking antibody 23. Additional studies in animals have found elevated 
expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in GVHD target organs following a lloSCT. 
Interestingly, PD-1/PD-L1, but not PD-1/PD-L2 blockade markedly  accelerated GVHD-
related lethality 24. Although PD-[ADDRESS_60463]. Of 
8 evaluable patients, acute GVHD occurred in 2 (grades 3 and 4 acute GVHD of the 
skin). Both patients had a history of acute GVHD in the 3 month s prior to receiving 
nivolumab.  Seven of 8 nivolumab-treated patients derived clini cal benefit, with 4 
achieving a partial response (PR), and 3 a complete response (C R).  Furthermore, both 
patients who developed GVHD improved with treatment 25. 
 POST-ALLOSCT IMMUNOTHERAPY.  
Unfortunately, patients who relapse after alloSCT have few trea tment options and dismal 
outcomes. Withdrawal of immunosuppression to unleash a GVT effe ct has been effective 
i n  C M L ,  b u t  r a r e l y  i n  o t h e r  d i s e a s e s  26. Chemotherapy may be an option, although 
responses are not often durable 27, and most patients do not have sufficient performance 
status or hematological reserve t o tolerate cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Cellular-based 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), as well as adoptive T and 
NK cell therapy, have been employed to treat disease relapse fo llowing allo-SCT with

 variable efficacies 28, 29, 30, including a 2-year survival of only 21% following DLI in an 
EBMT study 31. In addition, acute GVHD develops in up to 40–60% of patients who 
receive DLI, and pancytopenia, infections, current GVHD, and do nor availability at the 
time of relapse are major impediments to its use 30, 31.

more than 1 year 33. 
 PEMBROLIZUMAB (MK-3475).  
Please refer to the IB / approved labeling for detailed backgro und information on 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
 PHARMACEUTICAL AND THE RAPEUTIC BACKGROUND OF 
PEMBROLIZUMAB (MK-3475).  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling out growth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades. Accumulating evidenc e shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphoc ytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis 
in various malignancies.  In part icular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to corr elate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_60466] hijacke d by [CONTACT_55548] 34, 35. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of  
activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate  unwanted or excessive 
immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encode d by [CONTACT_13228]1) 
is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which ha s been shown to 
negatively regulate an tigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 
and/or PD-L2). The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved.  PD-1 and family 
members are type I transmembrane  glycoproteins containing an Ig  Variable-type (V-type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail wh ich is responsible for the 
binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 co ntains 2 tyrosine-based

as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) 
are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-
hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors. Both ligand s are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extr acellular region and 
contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motif s. Binding of either PD-

endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed  on antigen-presenting 
cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environm ents. PD-L2 is thought 
to control immune T-cell activat ion in lymphoid organs, whereas  P D - L 1  s e r v e s  t o

express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demons trated to express abundant 
levels of this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 has been suggested to reg ulate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monocl onal antibody (mAb) 
of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the intera ction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of patients with unresectab le or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a 
BRAF inhibitor. It has also been FDA approved for patients with  metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on standard chemot herapy and whose 
tumor expresses PD-L1. It has also been FDA approved for patien t s  w i t h  r e c u r r e n t  o r

 appears to be greater in neo-antigen rich and “inflamed” tumors . However, in the post-
alloSCT setting, immune-mediated elimination of malignant cells  is driven by a 
mismatch in minor histocompatibility antigens (miHA) between do nor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. It is 
not known whether donor T cells recognize neo-antigens displaye d on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]-derived

Examining the safety of anti-PD-[ADDRESS_60470], the “off-protocol” use of anti-PD-[ADDRESS_60471] will be high. 
 RATIONALE FOR PEMBROLIZUMAB DOSE AND SCHEDULE.   
An open-label Phase I trial (P rotocol 001) was conducted to eva luate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK-3475. The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, ad ministered every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) in subjects with advanced s olid tumors. All three dose le vels were well tolerated 
and no DLTs were observed. This first in human study of MK-3475  showed evidence of 
target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reductio n at all dose levels (1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No maximum-tolerated dose (MT D) has been 
identified to date; however, recent data from other clinical st udies within the MK-3475 
program has shown that a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequ ent schedule may be 
sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity. 
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slo w systemic 
clearance, limited volume of dis tribution, and a long half-life  (refer to IB). 
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that periph eral target engagement 
is durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharmacodynamic data h as provided scientific 
rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
A population pharmacokinetic analys is has been performed using serum concentration 
time data from [ADDRESS_60472] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  T h e  d i f f e r e n c e s  i n  
exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established e xposure margins of 0.5 – 
5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margin s are based on the 
notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q 3W vs. the proposed 
dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposu re). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there wa s no significant impact of tum or burden on exposure. In 
                                                                                                                                 
15 
 addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma i ndications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between  different indication 
settings. 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable  doses of pembrolizumab 
in solid tumors was based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of  pembrolizumab when 
dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2 ) the flat exposure-
response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and s afety in the dose ranges 
of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on 
distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_55549]) and 4) 
the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engage ment will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the swi tch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of  pembrolizumab 
showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provid e exposures that 1) are 
optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will 
maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range est ablished in melanoma as 
associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients 
exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are  well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be mor e convenient for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors. A fixed d osing scheme will also 
reduce complexity in the logist ical chain at treatment faciliti es and reduce wastage. 
Therefore 200mg pembrolizumab Q3W will be used in the current s tudy.  
 RATIONALE FOR TOLERABILITY ENDPOINTS.  
The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine whether pemb rolizumab administration 
is safe and tolerable in patients with relapsed AML, MDS, and m ature B cell lymphomas 
following alloSCT.  The safety analysis will be based on subjec ts who experience 
toxicities following treatment with pembrolizumab as defined by  [CONTACT_55550]. Safety 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_55551], including serious adverse events ( SAEs) and events of 
clinical interest (ECIs). Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_55552] a dverse events using CTCAE, 
version 4.0. The attribution to d rug, timing of onset, event du ration, event resolution, and 
any concomitant medications administered will be recorded. AEs will be analyzed, 
including but not limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and labo ratory changes. Further, 
the occurrence of a grade [ADDRESS_60473] (irAE) as well as veno-occlusive disease 
(VOD) and steroid-requiring febr ile syndrome. Special attention  w i l l  b e  p a i d  i n  t h i s  
patient population, to the development and severity of acute GV HD, which will be 
appropriately staged and graded according to accepted criteria (see Appendix, Section 
13.6). 
Given that a standard, phase I dose-escalation approach is not warranted given the 
discussion in Section 5.2, the investigators feel it is reasona ble to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_55510]

 explore if the chosen pembrolizumab dose and schedule (i.e. 200  mg Q3W) is safe in this 
patient population.   
 RATIONALE FOR EFFICACY ENDPOINTS.  
The secondary objective of this study (primary efficacy endpoin ts) is to determine the 
anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab treatment in subjects with  relapsed AML, MDS or 
mature B cell lymphomas following alloSCT. The overall response  rate (ORR) will be 
the most valuable and primary efficacy endpoint. ORR for B cell  lymphoma patients will 
be assessed according to the International Working Group criter ia 39.  ORR for AML and 
MDS patients will be assessed according to the European Leukemi a Net and International 
Working Group response criteria, respectively 40, 41.  ORR is defined as the proportion of 
subjects who achieve an objective disease response, as defined in Section 3.2. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include duration of response (DOR)  and overall survival 
(OS). DOR is defined as the interval from the first documentati on of an objective disease 
response, as defined in Section3.2, to the documentation of dis ease progression, as 
defined in Section 3.2.  OS is defined as the interval from the  date of study enrollment to 
death from any cause. 
 RATIONALE FOR BIOMARKER RESEARCH. 
Effect of pembrolizumab treatment on restoring donor chimerism.  Disease relapse 
following alloSCT is commonly associated with a decline in dono r chimerism. By 
[CONTACT_55553]-derived T cells, it is hypothesized that pemb rolizumab will improve or 
even completely restore full donor chimerism in patients will r elapsed disease after 
alloSCT (where loss or decline in donor chimerism has been docu mented to occur).  
Donor chimerism in both the entire WBC population and in the CD 3+ cell compartment 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_55554] 10 pre-defi ned loci by [CONTACT_4480] a 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_55511].  Analyses o n peripheral blood (all patient s) and bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (in AML and MDS patient s only) will be performed at b aseline (pre-treatment) 
and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, [ADDRESS_60474] of pembrolizumab on T cell number and activation status.   Pembrolizumab, by 
[CONTACT_55555]-1/PD-L1 interacti ons, may affect not only numbe rs of T cells present in 
peripheral blood (and bone marrow), but may also lead to upregu lation of activation 
markers on peripheral blood T cells . To explore this hypothesis , the frequencies and 
absolute numbers of T cell subsets (conventional CD4+ and CD8+ and 
CD4+CD25+CD127- regulatory T cells  (Tregs)) will be enumerated i n  t h e  p e r i p h e r a l  
blood (all patients) and bone marrow (AML and MDS patients only ) at several defined 
time points prior to and following pembrolizumab treatment (pre -treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, 
12, 15, 18, and 24 months of treatment). Peripheral blood monon uclear cells (PBMC) or 
bone marrow cells will be stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD8, anti -CD4, anti-CD25, and

Conventional CD4+ T cells will be defined as CD3+CD4+CD25-/low cells, while 
conventional CD8+ T cells will be defined as CD3+CD8+ cells.  T regs will be defined as 
CD3+CD4+CD25hiCD127- cells. Frequencies will be calculated by s ub-gating on the 
lymphocyte population as appropriate. Absolute numbers of T cel ls in each subset will be 
enumerated by [CONTACT_55557] T cell subset b y the total white blood 
count from each sample.  T cell activation status will be analy zed by [CONTACT_3252]-staining cells 
with antibodies directed against the following markers: HLA-DR,  CD69, ICOS and 
CD25 (others may be added).  Descriptive statistics will be uti lized to compare pre- and 
post-treatment frequencies, absolute numbers and activation sta tus of T cells in enrolled 
patients.  The goal would be to define potential biomarkers ass ociated with 
responsiveness to pembrolizumab treatment that could be verifie d in larger studies in a 
similar patient population.

6.2.4 TRIAL BLINDING/MASKING 
This is an open-label trial. The investigator and subject will be aware of the study 
treatment administered. 
 RANDOMIZATION OR TR EATMENT ALLOCATION 
Subjects participating in this trial will be allocated by [CONTACT_105]-r andom assignment. 
 STRATIFICATION 
No stratification based on age, s ex or other characteristics wi ll be used in this trial. 
 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND VACCINES. 
Medications or vaccina tions specifically prohibited in the excl usion criteria are not 
allowed.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically 
prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy  or vaccination may be 
required.  The treating investig ator should discuss any questio ns regarding this with the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_55512], [COMPANY_006] (as appropr iate).  The final decision 
on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investi gator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subje ct on trial therapy or

 RESCUE MEDICATIONS AND SUPPORTIVE CARE 
6.6.1 SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_47806], inc luding but not limited to the items outl ined below: 
 Diarrhea: Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus  in stool, with or 
without fever) and bowel perfora tion (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). Diarrhea 
in this particular patient popul ation may be due either to acut e GVHD or to 
classical pembrolizumab-induced enterocolitis, and the differen tiation between 
the two may be difficult or impossible. In symptomatic subjects , infectious 
etiologies should be evaluated, an d if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, 
endoscopic evaluation should be performed. 
 In subjects with severe enterocolitis (grade 3 or 4) caused by [CONTACT_55560]-associated enterocolitis, pembrolizumab  will be 
permanently discontinued, and treatment with systemic corticost eroids should be 
initiated at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalen t. When symptoms 
improve to ≤ grade 1, a corticosteroid taper should be started and continued for > 
1 month. 
 In subjects with moderate enterocolitis (grade 2) caused by [CONTACT_55561]-associated enterocolitis, pembrolizumab  will be 
withheld and corticosteroids s hould be initiated at a dose of 1  mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent. When symptoms improve to ≤ grade 1, a  corticosteroid 
taper should be started and continued for > 1 month.  Pembroliz umab may be re-
started at 200 mg IV every 21 days, as outlined in Section 6.2. 1.2. 
 All subjects who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink  liberal quantities 
of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasibl e, fluid and electrolyte 
repletion (IV) is appropriate.  O ther treatments, including lop eramide, oral non-
absorbable corticosteroids and octreotide may be administered a ccording to 
institutional guidelines for the treatment of acute GVHD. 
 GVHD: Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symp toms of 
GVHD (including diarrhea, transaminitis, rash). These symptoms will be treated 
aggressively with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic steroids and addition al 
immunosuppressants per institutional guidelines. 
 Nausea/vomiting: These symptoms should be treated aggressively,  a n d  
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the admin istration of 
prophylactic anti-emetics accordi ng to institutional practice. 
                                                                                                                                 
29 
  Antibiotics:  Antibiotics, eith er prophylactic or therapeutic, are allowed as 
considered appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]. Appropriate antibiotics (i.e. 
PCP prophylaxis) should be initiated for patients who are on lo nger courses 
of corticosteroids.  
 Immune-related adverse events: Please see Table 5 above and sep arate guidance 
document regarding diagnosis and treatment of adverse events of  a potential 
immunologic etiology. 
 Infusion reactions: Acute infusion reactions (which include cyt okine release 
syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are unique from allergic/ hypersensitive 
reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to bo th.  Signs and 
symptoms usually develop during or shortly after pembrolizumab infusion and 
generally resolve completely with in 24 hours of completion of i nfusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including fever), 
arthralgia, bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, h eadache, 
hypertension, hypotension, tachycar dia, rigors or chills, myalg ia, nausea, 
vomiting, pruritus, rash or urti caria, and tumor pain.  See Table 6  below for 
management guidelines for pembrolizumab-associated infusion rea ctions. 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/Pulmonary adverse ev ents: Investigators should main tain a high index 
of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55513] a timely 
manner.  Additional supportive care guidance for pneumonitis ca n be found in

[IP_ADDRESS]  SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINE S FOR ADVERSE EVENTS OF 
CLINICAL INTEREST WITH AN IMMUNE ETIOLOGY (IRAES) 
AND EVENTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST (ECI) 
Immune-related advers e events (irAE)  
irAEs are defined as an adverse event associated with pembroliz umab exposure and 
mediated through an immune mechanism.  irAEs may be predicted b ased on the nature of 
the known mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, as well as expe rience with other 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a similar mechanism of action. Special att ention should be paid to 
AEs that are suggestive of potenti al irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose, 
or several months after the final dose of pembrolizumab.  If an  irAE is suspected, effort 
should be made to rule out other  potential etiologic causes pri or to labeling an AE as an 
irAE.  Information on how to iden tify and evaluate irAEs is inc luded in the event of 
clinical interest and immune-related adverse event guidance doc ument located in the 
administrative binder.

[IP_ADDRESS]  SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES FOR PNEUMONITIS 
Pembrolizumab treatment should be immediately held in subjects with symptomatic 
pneumonitis, and a clinical evaluation should be performed. The  evaluation may include 
bronchoscopy and pulmonary function tests to rule out other cau ses. If the subject is 
determined to have pembrolizumab-associated pneumonitis, a trea tment plan is outlined 
in Table 7.

6.7.[ADDRESS_60512] adverse effects on a fetus. It is not kn own if pembrolizumab 
has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  For  this trial, male subjects 
will be considered to be of no reproductive potential if they a re azospermic (whether due 
to having a vasectomy or an underlying medical condition). 
Female subjects will be consider ed of non-reprod uctive potentia l if they are either: 
1. postmenopausal (defined by [CONTACT_2669] 12 months with no menses wi thout an 
alternative medical cause; in women <45 years of age a high fol licle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-
menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or h ormonal 
replacement therapy. In the absence if 12 months of amenorrhea,  a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient); 
OR 2. have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oppherectomy, bilatera l salpi[INVESTIGATOR_38197]/occlus ions, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; 
OR 3. have a congentially-acquired cond ition that prevents childbeari ng. 
 Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree t o avoid becoming 
pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receivi ng study drug and for [ADDRESS_60513] dose of drug by [CONTACT_55562] f ollowing: 
1. practice abstinence from heterosexual activity;

  O R  
2. 2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception dur ing heterosexual 
activity 
Acceptable methods of contraception are: 
 Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
o intrauterine device (IUD) 
o vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner 
o contraceptive rod impla nted into the skin 
 Combination method (requires us e of two of the following): 
o diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with c ervical 
cap/spermicide) 
o cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only) 
o contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) 
o male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
o hormonal contraceptive: oral c ontracceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/prog estin pi[INVESTIGATOR_55518]-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contracepti ve skin patch,  vaginal contrac eptive 
ring, or subcutaneous contr aceptive injection. 
Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as t he sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subjected p referred and usual lifestyle 
and is considered acceptable by [CONTACT_55563] E RCs/IRBs. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulat ion, symptom-thermal, post-ov ulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_5737] r egulations/guidelines, then it 
does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for s ubjects participating at 
sites in this country/region. 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication ma y involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during th e study. In order to 
participate in the study, they must adhere to the contraception  requirement (described 
above) from the day of study medi cation initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of a 
study medication for oral contra ception) throughout the study p eriod up to [ADDRESS_60514]’ s status until the pregnancy h as been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to t he sponsor without delay 
and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experie nce (e.g., death, abortion, 
congenital anomaly, or other disa bling or life-threatening comp lication to the mother or 
newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to obt ain permission to follow 
the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fe tus or newborn to the 
sponsor. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_60515] WITHDRAWAL/DISC ONTINUATION CRITERIA    
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be removed from the trial at

The total volume of trial treatment infused will be compared to  the total volume prepared 
to determine compliance with each dose administered. The instru ctions for preparing and 
administering pembrolizumab will be provided in the Pharmacy Ma nual. 
8.1.2 CLINICAL PROCEDURES/ASSESSMENTS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ADVERSE EVENT (AE) MONITORING 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject  to evaluate for potential 
new or worsening AEs as specified  in the trial flow chart, and more frequently if 
clinically indicated.  Adverse events will be graded and record ed throughout the study 
and during the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. All AEs of 
unknown etiology associated with pembrolizumab exposure should b e  e v a l u a t e d  t o  
determine if they are possibly events of clinical interest (ECI ) of a potentially 
immunologic etiology (irAE).  S ee Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the separ ate guidance document in 
the administrative binder regardi ng the identification, evaluat ion, and management of 
AEs of a potential immunological etiology. Please refer to Sect ion 8.2 for detailed 
information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
The investigator or qualified de signee will perform a complete physical examination 
during the screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal f indings should be recorded 
as medical history.  A complete physical examination should be performed during 
screening and repeated as per th e frequency defined in the Stud y Flow Chart.  After the 
first dose of trial treatment, new clinically significant abnor mal findings should be 
recorded as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  VITAL SIGNS 
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at  screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment  discontinuation as 
specified in the trial flow chart (Section 7.0).  Vital signs s hould include temperature, 
pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight and blood pressure.  Height wil l be measured at screening 
only. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed using local standard p rocedures at screening.  
Clinically significant abnorma l findings should be recorded as medical history.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  EASTERN COOPERATIVE ON COLOGY GROUP (ECOG) 
PERFORMANCE STATUS 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (Appendix) at screening, 
prior to the administration of each dose of pembrolizumab, and at discontinuation of trial 
treatment as specified in the trial flow chart. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE 
The efficacy of pembrolizumab will be evaluated using the follo wing disease-specific 
criteria 
 B cell lymphomas  - The International Working Group response criteria will be 
utilized as the primary means to  assess disease response to pem brolizumab in B 
cell lymphoma patients 39, and is the basis for all protocol guidelines related to 
disease status. 
 MDS - The International Working Group response criteria in myelodyspl asia will 
be utilized as the primary means to assess disease response to pembrolizumab in 
MDS patients 40, and is the basis for all protocol guidelines related to disea se 
status.  
 AML - The European LeukemiaNet guidelines will be utilized as the pri mary 
means to assess disease response to pembrolizumab in AML patien ts 41, and is the 
basis for all protocol guidelin es related to disease status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_60525] DISEASE RESPONSE 
ASSESSMENT 
Response in B cell lymphoma patients using bone marrow analysis  (where applicable), as 
well as PET/CT (aggressive B cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphom a )  o r  C T  ( l o w -
grade B cell lymphomas) is based on the International Working G roup criteria 39. Local 
reading (investigator assessmen t with site radiology reading) w ill be used to determine 
subject eligibility and for subj ect management. No central radi ology review will be 
performed. Assessment of lymphoma -related B symptoms should occ ur with each disease 
response assessment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_60526] assessment shows PD, study drug may be continued until next disease response 
assessment provided that the sub jects’ clinical condition is st able. Repeat scans after 
suspected "pseudoprogression" should be obtained in 4-6 weeks; if scans confirm 
progression, pembrolizumab will be discontinued. If progression  is not confirmed on 
repeat imaging, the patient may continue on therapy.  However, imaging should occur at 
any time where there is clin ical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519].

 [IP_ADDRESS].8  DISEASE ASSESSMENT DURING THE TRIAL 
Disease assessments should be performed as outlined in Table 8.  There is a +/- 7 day 
window for assessments performed after Day 1. For MDS and AML p atients, bone 
marrow biopsy will be the method of assessing disease response (along with peripheral 
blood counts).  For subjects with lymphoma, PET and diagnostic C T  s c a n s  w i l l  b e  
performed for aggressive B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma s ubjects, while CT 
scans alone will be performed for subjects with low-grade lymph omas. Disease 
assessments and imaging should continue to be performed on prot ocol for [ADDRESS_60532].   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_60533] with B cell lymphoma ONLY with evidence of progressiv e disease 
documented at the week 12 assessment may continue trial treatme nt until next response 
assessment provided the subjects’ clinical condition is stable.  However, imaging should 
occur at any time where there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55520]. Repeat scans after 
suspected "pseudoprogression" should be obtained in 4-6 weeks; if scans confirm 
progression, pembrolizumab will be discontinued. If progression  is not confirmed on 
repeat imaging, the patient may continue on therapy.   Subjects may only receive 
treatment if the following criteria are met: 
 Absence of signs and symptoms (i ncluding worsening of laborator y values) 
indicating diseas e progression 
 No decline in ECOG performance status 
 Absence of rapid progression of disease  
 Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g.  cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative  medical intervention 
After the first disease response assessment, it is at the discr etion of the investigator to 
keep a clinically stable subject on trial treatment or to stop trial treatment until a repeat 
assessment is performed.  Subjects that are deemed clinically u nstable after first disease 
response assessment at week [ADDRESS_60534] disease response assessment (at week 13), disease ass essments and imaging 
should continue per the regular frequency every [ADDRESS_60535] on trial treatment or to stop trial t reatment until a repeat

[IP_ADDRESS]  WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTINUATION 
Subjects who discontinue/withdraw  from treatment prior to compl etion of the treatment 
regimen should be encouraged to co ntinue to be followed for all  remaining study visits. 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws from participation in the  trial, all applicable 
activities scheduled for the final trial visit should be perfor med at the time of 
discontinuation. Any adverse events which are present at the ti me of 
discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance wit h the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8.2 - Assessing and recording adverse events.  Subjects 
who attain a CR may discontinue treatment without the option of  restarting treatment. 
After discontinuing treatment fo llowing assessment of CR, these  subjects should return to 
the site for a safety follow-up visit (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and th en proceed to the follow-up

observed closely for signs of t oxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided if clini cally indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, ev en if no other seriousness 
criteria are met. 
If a dose of pembrolizumab acco rding to the definition of overd ose is administered 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory  results, the overdose is 
reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), usi ng the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within [ADDRESS_60549] (spontaneously reported t o them) that occurs during the  trial or within [ADDRESS_60550] be 
followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregn ancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole , blighted ovum, fetal 
death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be r eported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term , the outcome (health of 
infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the principal i nvestigator and [COMPANY_006] 
either by [CONTACT_26365].

 8.2.3 IMMEDIATE REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A serious adverse event is any a dverse event occu rring at any d ose or during any use of 
pembrolizumab that: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life threatening; 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 Results in or prolongs an existi ng inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
 Is associated with an overdose; 
 Is another important medical event  
Refer to Table 11  for additional details regardi ng each of the above criteria. 
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adve rse event unless it results 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]. 
Any serious adverse event, or fo llow up to a serious adverse ev ent, including death due to 
any cause other than progression  of the cancer under study (ref erence Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
additional details)  that occurs to any subject from the time the consent is signed through 
[ADDRESS_60551] be followed up fo r outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EVENTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST  
Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECI) and must be recorded as such on the adverse even t case report 
forms/worksheets and reported within [ADDRESS_60552] for this trial include: 
1. an overdose of pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 8.2.1, that  is not associated 
with clinical symptoms or a bnormal laboratory results.  
2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated to tal bilirubin la b value that is greater than or equal 
to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkal ine phosphatase lab 
value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determ ined by [CONTACT_44917]-specified laboratory t esting or unscheduled laboratory  testing.* 
*Note:  These criteria are base d upon available regulatory guid ance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to sp ecify a threshold of abnormal h epatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an  underlying etiology.  The trial  site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent). 
3. Early transplant-related events s uch as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and steroid-
requiring febrile syndrome. 
A separate guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical Interest 
Guidance Document.”  This document can be found in the administ rative binder and 
provides guidance regarding iden tification, evaluation and mana gement of ECIs and 
irAEs.   
ECIs identified in this guidance document from the date of firs t dose through [ADDRESS_60553] additional testing to rule out other etiologic caus es.  If lab results or 
symptoms indicate a possible immune-related ECI, then additiona l testing should be 
performed to rule out other etio logic causes.  If no other caus e is found, then it is 
assumed to be immune-related. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PROTOCOL-SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS TO SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING 
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be repo rted as described in Section 
8.2.3, unless there is evidence s uggesting a causal relationshi p between the drug and the 
event.  Any such event will be submitted to the principal inves tigator and [COMPANY_006].

regardless of time to diagnosis);or 
 Is a new  cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study)  or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associ ated 
with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An over dose that is not 
associated with an adverse event is considered a non-serious ev ent of clinical 
interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_60554] and may require medi cal or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the 
outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †). 
Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the 
appropriate length of time and units 
Action taken  Did the adverse event cause pembrolizumab to be d iscontinued? 
Relationship to 
test drug  Did pembrolizumab product cause the adverse event? The determin ation of the 
likelihood that pembrolizumab caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_1275]. The criteria below are intended as reference guid elines to assist the 
investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship betw een the test drug and 
the adverse event based upon the available information. 
The following components are to be used to assess the relations hip between 
pembrolizumab  and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in num ber and/or intensity), the mor e likely 
pembrolizumab caused the adverse event (AE): 
 Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually expos ed to 
pembrolizumab such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, e tc.), expected pharmacologic 
effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
 T i m e  
Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of pembrolizumab? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced 
effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal produc t)? 
 L i k e l y  
Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_19511], other drug( s)/vaccine(s), or other host or 
environmental factors 
Relationship The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test 
drug and the AE: (continued) 
pembrolizumab (continued)  Dechallenge Was pembrolizumab discontinued or dose/exposure/fre quency 
reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
                                                                                                                                 
67 
 If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negati ve 
dechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted  in 
death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_55530]’s product; or (3) the trial  is 
a single-dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are o nly 
used one time.) 
 Rechallenge Was the subject re-exposed to pembrolizumab in thi s study? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negati ve 
rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE 
resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a 
single-dose drug trial); or (3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are use d 
only one time). 
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN 
ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_26370]'S 
PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO PEMBROLIZUMAB 
POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE 
APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_55573] [INVESTIGATOR_55531] T HE PROTOCOL. 
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment Profile Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent 
with previous knowledge regarding pembrolizumab or drug 
class pharmacology or toxicology? 
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case rep ort forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_55574]/h er best clinical judgme nt, including consider ation of the above elements. 
Record one of the following Use the following scale of criteria  as guidance (not all criteria 
must be present to be indicative of pembrolizumab 
relationship). 
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of pembrolizumab relationship. There is evidence of exposure to pembrolizumab.  The 
temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of pembrolizumab is reasonable.  The AE is 
more likely explained by [CONTACT_55575].  
No, there is not a reasonable 
possibility of pembrolizumab 
relationship Subject did not receive pembrolizumab OR temporal sequence

9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN SUMMARY 
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analys is for this trial. Full details 
can be found in the statistical ana lysis plan (SAP) in Section 8.2. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_60557] stage of the two-stage trial design. 
The accrual rate will be 1 patient/month in relapsed/refractory  myeloid and B cell 
malignancies following allogeneic stem cell transplant to asses s the safety and feasibility 
of pembrolizumab. If at least [ADDRESS_60558] sufficient evidence to warrant f urther study of 
pembrolizumab in a future trial.  Furthermore, if severe GVHD ( grade 3-4) develops 
within the first [ADDRESS_60559] 5 patients treated 
on the study (i.e. develop a DLT), it will be permanently close d to accrual as a measure to 
ensure safety. 
Toxicity will be graded per the CTCAE guidelines and the maxima lly tolerated dose will 
be defined a less or equal than [ADDRESS_60560] one dose of 
pembrolizumab, will serve as the primary analysis population in  this study. The primary 
efficacy endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR), defined a s those patients who 
achieve a PR or CR (lymphoma), PR or CR (MDS), or a CR, CRp, CR i or PR (AML).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include duration of response (DOR)  and overall survival 
(OS).

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
9.2.1 HYPOTHESES 
The objectives and hypotheses of t he study are stated in Sectio n 3.

 9.2.2 ANALYSIS ENDPOINTS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Safety measurements are described in Section 8. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
Efficacy endpoints that will be evaluated for are listed below.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR ), defined as the 
proportion of subjects in the ana lysis population who achieve a t least a partial response to 
pembrolizumab. Specifically, for B cell lymphoma patients, part ial and complete 
responses will be defined according to the International Workin g Group criteria 39 
(Appendix). For MDS patients, par tial and complete responses (i ncluding cytogenetic 
responses) will be defined accord ing to the International Worki ng Group criteria 40. 
Lastly, for AML patients, complete (including CR, CRp, CRi), an d partial responses will 
be defined according to the Europ ean Leukemia Net response crit eria (Appendix) 41. 
9.2.3 ANALYSIS POPULATION 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAFETY ANALYSIS POPULATION 
The All Patients as Treated (APaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data 
in this study. The APaT populati on consists of all enrolled sub jects who received at least 
[ADDRESS_60565] one dose of trial treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis 
of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a b aseline measurement is 
also required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EFFICACY ANALYSIS POPULATION 
The analysis of primary efficacy endpoints are based on the int ention-to-treat (ITT) 
population, i.e., subjects will be included if they receive at least one dose of study 
medication.  
9.2.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STATISTICAL METHODS FOR TOLERABILITY ANALYSES 
The trial will featur e a two-stage minima x trial design (Simon 1989, A’hern, 2001) which 
tests for futility in a smaller sample of patients before proce eding with treatment of the 
full cohort. The accrual rate will be 1 patient/month in relaps ed/refractory myeloid and B 
cell malignancies following allogeneic stem cell transplant to assess the safety and 
feasibility of pembrolizumab. The primary outcome is whether th e patient remains DLT-
free at the end of treatment.  A priori , we expect 40% or fewer patients on an unsafe 
treatment would finish without experiencing a DLT, and at least  65% of patients would 
be DLT-free on a safe treatment. For α = 0.05 and 80% power, we  would need to observe 
                                                                                                                                 
[ADDRESS_60566] sufficient e vidence to warrant 
further study of pembrolizumab in a future trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  STATISTICAL METHODS FOR EFFICACY ANALYSES 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  OVERALL RESPONSE RATE (ORR) 
ORR will be summarized as a proportion. ORR will depend on the tumor type, and we 
will analyze for HL NHL, MDS, and AML individually, acknowledgi ng that the numbers 
will be small. Descriptive statistics will be used to test the hypothesis that the ORR 
exceeds 10%. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  DURATION OF RESPONSE (DOR) 
DOR will be summarized using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) 
OS will be summarized using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

Bone marrow evaluation: Bone marro w showing < 5% myeloblasts wi th normal maturation 
of all cell lines, with no eviden ce for dysplasia (see dysplasi a qualifier under peripheral blood 
evaluation). When erythroid precu rsors constitute < 50% of bone  marrow nucleated cells, the 
percent of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there a re ≥ 50% erythroid cells, the 
percent blasts should be based on the non-erythroid cells.  
 Peripheral Blood Counts (Absolute values must last ≥ 8 weeks). 
 Hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dL.

 IDENTIFICATION AND FOLLOW -UP OF LESIONS IN AML  
12.6.1  COMPLETE REMISSION (CR) 
For subjects to be classified as being in CR, they must have bo ne marrow regenerating 
normal hematopoietic cells and achieve a morphologic leukemia-f ree state (<5% bone 
marrow blasts in bone marrow, no blasts with Auer rods and no p ersistence of 
extramedullary disease) and must have an ANC ≥1 × 109/L and pla telet count >100 × 109/L 
 
     
80 
 and they will be RBC and platel et transfusion independent (defi ned as 4 weeks without RBC 
transfusions and 1 week without  platelet transfusion). 
12.6.2  COMPLETE REMISSION WITH I NCOMPLETE PLATELET RECOVERY 
(CRP) 
For subjects to be classified as being in CRp, they must achiev e CR except for incomplete 
platelet recovery (<100 × 10
9/L). 
12.6.3  COMPLETE REMISSION WITH I NCOMPLETE HEMATOLOGICAL 
RECOVERY (CRI) 
For subjects to be classified as being in CRi, they must fulfil l all the criteria for CR except 
for incomplete hematological recov ery with residual neutropenia  <1 × 109/L and/or platelet 
count >100 × 109/L. RBC and platelet transfusio n independence is not required. 
12.6.4  PARTIAL REMISSION (PR) 
For subjects to be classified as being in PR, they must meet th e criteria for CRi but only 
require a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow with the 
total marrow blasts betw een 5% and 25% inclusive. 
12.6.5  RELAPSE 
Relapse after CR, CRp, or CRi is defined as a reappearance of l eukemic blasts in the 
peripheral blood or ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_55536] b iopsy not attributable to any 
other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary  leukemia. Relapse after PR 
is similarly defined with reappearance of significant numbers o f peripheral blasts and an 
increase in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_20325] e to >25% not attributable to 
any other cause or reappearance  or new appearance of extramedul lary leukemia.

 I. SPECIFIC AIMS  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if the use of a dental mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870638], sleep, or quality of life for people with Parkinson’s disease 
(PD).  We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_870639]. For this study, participants will have one in -person study visit 
where they will be fitted with a  dental mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870640]. Participants will also complete sleep 
questionnaires and quality of life ques tionnaires. Participants will then be asked to take the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870641], except while eating , 
for one month . At the end of th e month, they will complete the same sleep and quality of life 
questionnai res a dministered remotely by [CONTACT_870676][INVESTIGATOR_13959].   
 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the immediate effect of a dental mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870642]. A 4.8m GAITRite (CIR Systems, Inc. , Franklin, NJ) will be utilized to 
quantify gait mechanics with and without mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870643]. Gait and balance tasks will be 
assessed.   
Hypotheses:  
a. People with PD will show improvements in gait speed with the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870644].  
b. People  with PD will show improvements in balance with the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870644].  
 
Specific Aim 2:  To determine the longer -term feasibility of use and effect of dental  mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870645] (QOL) for people with PD.  
Hypotheses:  
a. People with PD will show improvements in sleep quality and duration after one 
month of wearing the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870646].   
b. People with PD will show improvements in health -related quality of life after one 
month of wearing the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870646].   
 
II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
For people with Parkinson’s disease  (PD) advances in medical treatments have 
increased lifespans but have not effectively mitigated the decline in function and the 
characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease.1, [ADDRESS_1215576] quality of life in this patient population and are considered risk factors 
for falls.3 Walking ability appears to be particularly important in this population, a s impairments 
in ambulation tend to precede impairments with other gait -dependent activities.4   
Dental Appliance for Parkinson Disease (DAPD)  
 
[ADDRESS_1215577] and grip strength in the non -dominant hand showed significant improvements with the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870647]’s baseline condition without the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] . Additionally , 
this participant reported significant increases in quality of life while using the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] , as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_870677] P arkinson Disease Questionnarie -39 (PDQ39) and 
Global Rate of Change Scale. The researchers reported the participan t’s gait mechanics 
differed with use of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] , with the participant holding his arms closer to midline.7 
The mechanism underlying the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]’s effect  on gait and motor function is not well 
understood. It is possible that because afferent inputs from the trigeminal nerve project to the 
nucleus raphe of the reticular formation, abnormal input from the mandibular branch of the 
trigeminal nerve may affect rhythmic motor function and balance.[ADDRESS_1215578]:  
(1) have a diagnosis of idiopathic, typi[INVESTIGATOR_870648], Hoehn & Yahr stages 1 -3;

(3) be able to walk at least 10 m eters  at baseline with or without an assistive device;  
(4) have their own teeth and/or dentures;  
(5) be willing to try to wear a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870649];  
(6) are over the age of 30; and 
(7) provide written or verbal informed consent.   
Exclusion criteria include:  
(1) pre-existing medical conditions that wou ld inhibit full participation in the study’s tasks ;  
(2) absence of any dentition ;  
(3) cognitive impairments indicated by [CONTACT_870678] (MMSE) score of <24 ;  
(4) freezing of gait which moderately or severely impacts walking ; or 
(5) current  use of an oral appliance (e.g., a dental mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], retainer, or braces ). 
 
Measures and Materials  
The MMSE will be administered to ensure absence of cognitive impairment.  The New Freezing 
of Gait Questionnaire ( nFOG ) includes participants watching a short video about freezing of gait 
and a questionnaire about whether they experience freezing of gait and if so, questions that 
help describe the types of freezing of gait they experience.  
Mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870650] a maxillary orthotic (mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]) fabricated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Moeller.  
The process for fabrication of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870651]:  
1) The participant  is seated in a normal straight -backe d chair with feet on the floor.  
2) A dental impression tray is size d appropriately for the participant’s  lower jaw to e nsure 
that no impi[INVESTIGATOR_20804] o f soft tissue structures occurs . 
3) A quick setting dental alginate impression m aterial is mixed for one minute and then 
placed i nto the dental impression tray.  
4) The dental impression tray is fi lled with the alginate material, and the  tray and material 
are placed into the participant’s mouth.  
5) The tray will remain in the mouth approximately 1  to 2 minutes and will then be 
removed.  
6) A fast se tting dental stone is placed in the tra y. 
7) The dental stone is allowed to set for one -half h our in the alginate impression.  
8) The dental s tone model is removed from the alginate impression.  
9) The lower jaw model is trimmed and then taken to the dental  vacuum f ormer machi ne 
where a poly -vinyl-acetate ( medical-dental grade) thermoplastic  sheet of material is 
heated to a temperature to all ow deformation of the material.

 10) The vacuum is turned on and the thermoplastic material is sucked down over the 
dental stone model. A small [ADDRESS_1215579] as a reinforcement.  
11) The thermoplastic material is cooled to below room temperature  with cold water until 
stiff. 
12) All thermoplastic material which approximates any structu re but the dental hard 
tissue (teeth ) is removed from a height ju st above the attached gingival tissue so that the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870652].  
13) The occlusal material is adj usted at chairside so that an even continuous contact 
[CONTACT_870679] t eeth is created on all teeth from the rear -most molar teeth including 
anterior teeth. The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870653]  a "horse shoe" 
in shape.  
14) All areas w hich contact [CONTACT_870680]’ s mouth.  
15) The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870654]’s mouth for a period of about ten 
minutes to ensure there is no interference  with any normal jaw and biting movements . 
The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870655] -toxic to humans.  
There are similar mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870656] a 
physician /dentist’s prescription.   
Participants will be instructed to return the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870657].  
Motor assessments  
Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS -UPDRS -III) 
Motor subsection will be used to assess disease severity.   
The GAITRite system will be used to assess gait performance. The GAITRite is a portable 
electronic walkway mat (600 cm long and 64 cm wide). All participants will walk alo ng the mat 
so that imbedded sensors are activated by [CONTACT_870681]. A computer will process the footsteps for gait velocity (cm/s) . The mat is located in a 
well-lit room, with starting and ending limits marked one meter from the mat to prevent recording 
acceleration and deceleration phases.    
Balance will be assessed using the Mini -BESTest. The Mini -BESTest is a 14 -item evaluation 
designed to assess a variety of balance components.   
Quality -of-life questionnaires  
Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire -39 (PDQ -39) contains 39 self -report items designed 
specifically for people with PD. There are eight subscores that are calculated along with a total 
score.  
Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS)  contains 15 self -report items designed specifically to 
assess various indicators of sleep quality in people with PD.

 Participant information  
Participants will fill out a demographic form, a medication form, and medical comorbidity form at 
the in -person visit, and note any changes in their health or medications after wearing the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870649] .   
Journal  
Participants will keep a journal documenting how long they wore the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870658], reasons for taking it out, and can make comments about the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  
Exit questionnaires  
Participants will complete  an open -ended exi t questionnaire regarding their experience with the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870659] (GRC) after wearing  the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870660].  
 
Proto col 
A phone screen will be used to screen for preliminary study suitability. If the potential participant 
passes the phone screen and would like to enroll in the study, we will then schedule them for 
their in -person visit.  
The first visit will be  in-person on the ground floor of the Movement Science Research Center at 
[ADDRESS_1215580]. Louis, MO, [ZIP_CODE]. The study visit will follow the following schedule:  
Informed consent, MMSE, nFOG  (15 minutes):  A trained researcher will review the infor med 
consent document with the participant, outlining the study objectives and ensuring the 
participants have the opportunity to ask the researcher any questions they may have regarding 
the study and procedure s. If the participant wants to continue, they wi ll sign the consent form. 
The MMSE will be performed to screen for cognitive impairments which would affect study 
participation.  The nFOG will provide us with information about freezing of gait if applicable.  
Motor Assessment #1 without mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]  (45 mi nutes) : MDS -UPDRS -III, GAITRite, Mini -
Bestest (order will be randomized)  
Dental Measurements  (15 minutes) : [CONTACT_870682] will take dental measurements for the purpose 
of creating a custom -fitted mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870661].  
Questionnaires, Medical History, Medications  (30 minutes) : The participants will complete 
demographic, medical history/medications forms, sleep and quality of life questionnaires while 
their mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870662].   
Mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_842568]  (25 minutes) : After their mouthpi [INVESTIGATOR_870663] (smoothed 
as needed), participants will sit with the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870664] 25 minutes.  
Motor Assessment #2 with mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (45 minutes):  MDS -UPDRS -III, GAITRite, Mini -Bestest, 
(order will be randomized)  
Participants  who take  medication for Parkinson symptoms, will be asked to take their medication 
30 minutes before arrival to ensure participants are in the “on” phase for the motor tasks.

 At completion of the in -person visit, participants will be instructed to use th e mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870665]. Participants will be informed they can take the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870666].  
Follow -up will occur one month later . 
Questionnaires, Medical History, Medications (30 minutes):  The participants will complete sleep 
and quality of life questionnaires, record any changes in their medical history or medications, 
and complete an open -ended questionnaire regarding their thoughts on the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870667].   
Randomization Method  
 
The order in which the motor assessments are given in regards to wearing the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870668]. The motor tasks ( disease severity, gait, balance) will 
be randomized within each participant.   
 
Safety and Adverse Events  
 
The research team will do everything possible to ensure safety of all participants over the 
course of this study. The adverse event most likely to occur in this study is risk of falling  while 
walking . Participants will be fitted with a gait belt. Members of the research team are trained in 
fall prevention and will closely monitor all participants throughout all aspects of the study in case 
of a need to assist with balance to prevent a fall. In the case of an adverse event, emergency 
medical care will be sought immediately if needed. Any  serious  adverse events will be reported 
to the local IRB immediately.  Occurrence of an adverse event will be noted in a participant’s file.  
 
Potential  risks will be addressed in the following ways:  
 
a) Discomfort in answering questionnaires: Participants may refuse to answer any questions 
they prefer not to answer.  
 
b) Loss of confidentiality: Loss of confidentiality is highly unlikely. To safe guard against this, we 
will comply with all HIPAA regulations. Data will not be identified by [CONTACT_61954]. All data 
will be coded, and code sheets will be stored in locked files.  
 
c) Stumbling during locomotion : Participants will be closely attended by a trained research staff 
member during walking  and fitted with a gait  belt. Walking will be performed in a large, open 
space and the staff member will be prepared to assist participants who may stumble.  
 
d) Falling : Participants will be closely attende d by a trained assistant who will ensure the safest 
of conditions. It is unlikely that participants will experience falls during testing or will be injured 
as the result of a fall. If a participant appears unsteady, breaks will be encouraged or testing wil l 
be terminated.  
 
e) Fatigue from walking : Rest breaks will be provided as needed.

 f) Discomfort or irritation while being fitted for the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870669] : 
the participants may remove the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870670].  
 
Benefits  
 
We do not yet know the full extent to which the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870671]. This study may help inform future treatment techniques to improve 
motor and non -motor function in people with PD.  
 
Interi m Monitoring and Earl y Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_870672], should any issues arise, we will adjust our 
protocol and submit any changes to the IRB project for review. We will not conduct interim data 
analyses.  
 
Statistical Analyses  Plan  
We will use paired t-tests to determine if there are differences between conditions  (with 
mout hpi[INVESTIGATOR_870673]). We will also use paired t-tests to compare sleep and quality 
of life questionnaire s from baseline (prior to study) to follow up (aft er one month of mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_870674]). 
R will be used for data analysis across all aims.  
Power  
Because of the exploratory nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_870675], no formal power analysis was conducted.

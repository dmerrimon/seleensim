 EFFICACY OF EXPAREL ® ON POST -OPERATIVE PAIN AFTER RYGB USING EEA 
CIRCULAR STAPLER TECHNIQUE  
 
Summary  
This will be a head to head study that includes two cohorts of patients undergoing roux-en-y 
gastric by[CONTACT_424481] (EEA)  stapler to create the 
gastro -jejunal anastomosis . One cohort ( 50 patient s) will receive Ex parel® (liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424457])  injections intra -operatively  at time of incision closure. The control 
cohort ( 50 patients) will receive standard  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424458], 
the current standard of care . Post-operative analgesia will be standardized and identical for both 
cohorts.  The primary outcome will be pain scores  and [ADDRESS_536588] operatively, 
measure using the visual analog scale (VAS) . Secondary outcomes will include the parameters 
included in the American Pain Society Post -Operative Questionnaire (APS -POQ -R), a validate d 
measurement tool to assess how patients experience pain and how it may impact their ability to 
complete daily activity.  Readmission, ED visits, and phone calls to clinic related to pain control 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_424482] [ADDRESS_536589] surgeons in selecting type of injected medication at the incision site, in an effort to 
achieve better short -term results.

however, effective post-operative  analgesia following laparoscopy still often requires 
intravenous or oral narcotics . Several factors may contribute to the development of pain post -
laparoscopic surgery, including the stretching of the intra -abdominal cavity, peritoneal 
inflammation and ne uro-vascular irritation [1–3]. Lower intensity and duration of pain associated 
with laparoscopic surgery has been well documented when compared to lapa rotomy. 
Nevertheless safe peri -operative analgesic regimen that effectively achieves pain relief with 
minimal side effects is required , and it likely best achieved by a multimodality approach  
Reduction of pain may be achieved by [CONTACT_424483], typi[INVESTIGATOR_424459] [1, 4–7]. Preventive analgesia includes any intraoperative 
analgesic agents/techniques that provides the ability to control pain -induced sensitization of the 
central nervous system and decrease the development of ongoing pain [1, 8, 9] .  
 
Commonly used non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_424460] (paracetamol) have 
been shown to reduce pain after various surgical procedures [1, 10, 11] . Local analgesia has 
also been shown to be effective  adjunct  in relieving pain related to laparoscopic surgery . [1, 9, 
12, 13] . Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424461] -based local anesthetic . The use of multiple analgesics  
medications  when compared to a single analgesic  medication  for reduction  in pain  post-
operatively, allow s more rapid  post-operative recovery therefore allowing patients to resume 
normal activities of daily living sooner. [1, 11]  Most enhanced recovery protocols as a result now 
include provisions for multimodal analgesia, in many cases beginning intraoperatively.  
 
Exparel ® is a formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego), offering 
extended -release bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424462], and thus prolonged analgesia . In the Exparel® 
formulation, multi -vesicular liposomes (MVL) encapsulate the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424463] . The 
tightly packed multi -lamellar vesicles that comprise an Exparel® unit have proven to provide 
longer term drug release compared to other technologies using uni-lamellar vesicles . This 
arrangement of vesicles within the Exparel® , spans tens of micrometer s in diameter and slows 
degradation in vivo, allowing  for greater sustainability of medication release lasting days as 
opposed to hours. Several randomized clinical trials have been completed with this novel 
medication  leading to is approval by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA). The outcome 
measures included verbal pain scores , amount s and duratio n of use of post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_424464] . In post market studies, r esearchers have conducte d a wide 
range of surgical studies assessing the use of Exparel® for a variety of surgical procedures. 
Currently th ere are no prospective studies evaluating post -operative pain after  roux-en-y gastric 
by[CONTACT_6476] . Of particular interest is the use of  the circular  EEA, which requires a larger incision site  
in the left upper quadrant, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_424465].  
 
A study conducted by [CONTACT_424484]. assessing the use of Expare l® in ileostomy reversals 
indicates there was a s tatistically significant in reduction of post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_105849], 
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and maximal pain scores. A majority of the current studies support these 
findings, bu t the evaluation of Ex parel® for post -bariatric pain is limited.

 only a very effective  procedure for weight  loss, but is also associated with a reduction of 
significant co -morbid conditions. Roux -en-y gastric by[CONTACT_8049] s involves the creation 
of  two new anastomoses, the gastrojejunal anastomosis linking the gastric pouch to the 
roux limb , and the jejuno -jejunal anastomosis connecting the by[CONTACT_424485]. [14] Nationally the circular EEA stapler is the most common technique 
to form the gastrojejunal anastomosis . This stapler is ~40mm in diameter, and is introduced 
through an incision in the left upper quadrant incision . This is the largest incision created  
and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_424466]. [14] Given the location next 
to the costal margin, pain at this location can also lead to patien ts self -splinting, limiting 
lung expansion and putting them at risk for post -operative atelectasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_424467].

 Methods  
Phase I: Preoperative Procedures  
All patients undergoing laparoscopic roux en Y gastric by[CONTACT_424490] -operative 
assessments. This includes appointments with internal medicine physicians specialized in care 
of the bariatric surgical population, nutrition counseling, psychological  screening, demonstrated 
weight loss during a preoperative trial period, and additional evaluation and clearance by 
[CONTACT_424491] -morbid conditions. In addition patients have a complete history and 
physical examinations performed by [CONTACT_424492]. Matthew Kroh MD, and [CONTACT_424498], Staff Bariatric Surgeons that utilize the circular EEA technique. Consent for this 
study will occur during a preoperative visit.  
 
Phase II: Operative procedure  
The bariatric surgical procedure, (laparosc opic RYGB), will be performed at the Cleveland Clinic 
Main Campus Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence. The gastro -jejunal anastomosis will be 
created through the use of a circular end to end anastomotic (circular EEA) stapler with a 
3.5mm staple height (Covidien , Dublin, Ireland ). Patients will be randomized to receive either 
Exparel (R) (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_424457]), or standard  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , ~0.25% . 
Standardized injection volumes and technique will be performed. The study coordinator an d/or 
the co -investigators on this study will notify the operative team prior to incision time to remind 
them of participation in this study. Those administering the study medication will not be blinded 
to the administration, since the appearance between the med ication s is significantly different.  
 
Phase Ill: Postoperative Procedures  
Patients have an initial stay in the Post Anesthesia Recovery Area, and then are typi[INVESTIGATOR_424476] a nursing unit specializing in post -operative bariatric care. Patients will be  followed 
by [CONTACT_424493][INVESTIGATOR_307], and all will receive the same multimodal anesthetic

post-operative day 1.  
 
At [ADDRESS_536594] -Operative Questionnaire (APS -POQ -R).[16]  
The latter is validated for assessment of the patient's experience of pai n and it hindrance to 
daily activity in the post -operative period.   The VAS and APS -POQ -R assessment will be 
administered at [ADDRESS_536595] follow up appointments are scheduled at 7 -10 
days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Patients are monitored for adverse events 
from bariatric surgery, enumerated and standardized by [CONTACT_424494]. [15] 
 
.  ED visits and readmissions, as well as phone calls to clinic for issues related to pain will be 
evaluated at 30 days postop via a retrospective chart review to assess patie nt healthcare usage 
after discharge.  Assessors will be blinded to the medication that was administered in the 
operating room.

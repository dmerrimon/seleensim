2. INTRODUCTION  
Cassava Sciences  Inc. (CSI) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_183412]-125, a novel drug candid ate des igned to 
treat and  slow the progression of Alzheimer’s  disease (AD). PTI -125 binds with 
femto molar affinity to an altered conformation of filamin A ( FLNA)  that is induced by 
[CONTACT_148986] 1-42 (A42), prese nt in AD brain  and critical to the toxicity o f A42.1-3 PTI-
125 b inding re verses th e altered FLNA confor mation  and restores FLNA’s native shape, 
preventing two toxic signaling cascades of A 42. A42, in m onomer or s mall oligomer 
form,  hijack s the 7-nicotinic acetylc holine receptor ( 7nAC hR) and signal s via this 
recepto r to hyperphosphorylate tau , and this s ignali ng requires the recruitment of altered 
FLNA to thi s receptor . Second, altered FLNA associates with toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
to allow A 42 to persis tently activate this rece ptor. Normal FLNA does not associate w ith 
either 7nAChR or TLR4. In additi on to disrupting the normal functions of 7nAChR 
and tau  protein, A42’s toxic signaling to hyperpho sphorylate tau leads to the signature 
[CONTACT_670445] s found  in brains of AD p atients. In two AD mouse  models and in  
postmortem human AD brain tissue, PT I-125 restored function of three receptors that are 
impa ired in AD: the 7nAChR , the N-methyl -D-aspartate recep tor (NMDA R), and the 
insulin receptor (IR).2,[ADDRESS_905695] PTI -125 to im prove memory and to slow or halt AD progression.  Both mo use 
models used a dose of 20 mg/kg/day  (equi valent to 6 0 mg/m2/day) .  
A robust nonclinical ADME, saf ety pha rmacology,  and gen eral and genetic toxicology 
program ha s been carried out with PTI -125. In vitro m etabolic profiling showed minimal 
metabolism acros s several species including  humans. PTI -125 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_670423] i n rat and dog wit h nearly  100% oral bioavailability, a 2.[ADDRESS_905696]. A full b attery of genotoxicity studies was 
conducted (i n vitr o bacterial Ames, in vitro chromosomal aberration,  and in vivo rat 
micronucleus test) and were  all negati ve. An in vitro specificity screen showed no 
signifi cant activ ation or  inhibition of a panel of 6 8 receptors , channels and transporters.   
PTI-125 was t ested in single dose and repeat dose oral toxicity  studies in rats and dogs . In 
a 28-day repeat d ose oral toxicity study followed by a  28-day drug-free recovery period in 
rats (PTI-125-NC-040) with PTI -125 dose le vels up to and including 1000 mg/kg/d ay 
(equivalent to 6,000 mg/m2), toxicity was mainly char acterized at 1000  mg/kg/day by a 
decrease in  mean body weight , which continued during the recovery p eriod. A diffuse 
cellular  hypertrophy of the liver wa s seen at 1000  mg/kg/day in males and females a nd 
was interpreted as an adaptive response to the test a rticle. A no-observed -effect -level

A 28-day rep eat dose oral to xicity study in dogs  that included  a 28-day drug-free recovery 
period used PTI-125 dose level s up to and including 200 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 4,000

A subsequent 13-week repea t dose oral toxicity study with a 28-day reco very in  dogs used 
doses  of 25, 75 and 150 mg /kg/day. The toxico logical response was charac terized 
primarily by [CONTACT_670431] e of emesis and s alivation (somet imes extreme), and

Page 11 of 33     CONFIDENTIA L A 9-month toxicity study i n dog h as been completed a nd is awaiting pathology. This 
study started with 200  mg/k g/day as the high dose, which was redu ced after 1 month to 
150 mg/kg/d ay due to a decrease in b ody weight that was considered unsustainable for 9 
months. Based on clinical signs, clinical chem istry, body w eights and food consu mption , 
the 150 mg/kg/day  dose is estimated  to be the NOAEL  for this  study until pathology is 
complete . 
A first -in-human (FIH ) double-blind, Single Ascending Dose clinical t rial was conducted 
in healthy norm al volunteers , age  18-45 with oral  dosing solution . Doses were placebo, 
50, 100  and 200 mg (e quivalent to 31, 62, and  123 m g/m2, respectively)  administered to 
three different  groups of volu nteers . The study showed dose proportional  PK, and there 
were no dr ug-related adverse events  (AEs). 
A 28-day study was conducted with mil d-to-moderate AD patients, receiving  PTI-125 
100 mg b.i.d. as oral tablets. Key inclusion criteria we re MMSE ≥ 16 and ≤ 24, age 50 -
85, and a CSF total tau/ Aβ42 ratio ≥ 0.30. CSF samples we re collected at screening an d 
Day 28. Nine  CSF biomarkers  were analyzed  using  commercia lly available ELISA kits . 
PTI-125 was safe  and well tolerated in a ll patients. All 8 bioma rkers that are elevated in 
AD were significantly redu ced (Table 5  and Figure 1 ). Aβ42, which is low in AD, was 
increased slig htly but non -significantly.  Reduced neuroinflammation was indicated b y 
reduction s in inflammatory  cytokines and YKL -40. A redu ced n eurodegenerat ive driv e 
was suggested by [CONTACT_533292] n eurogranin , neurofila ment l ight cha in, and total tau . 
Finally, the robus t reduction in phospho -tau (pT181)  confirms  the mechanism of action  of 
PTI-125.

3. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The objective s of this study are to investigate the  safety a nd eff ect on biomarkers and 
cogn ition of PTI -125 following  1-month, repeat -dose oral administration  in mild -to-
moderate AD patients, 5 0-85 years of age , wit h MMSE   ≥ 16 and ≤ 26. A second 
objective is to  replicate the effects on biomarker s shown in the pre vious open -label 1 -
month study (PTI-125-03). A third ob jective is to  investiga te a dose -response of PTI -125. 
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DES IGN  
This is a Phase  2b, multi -cente r, randomized , double -blind, plac ebo-controlled , study 
of PTI-125 in mild-to-moderate AD pat ients , 50-85 years of age . Approximately  sixty  
(60) patients  will be enrolled  into the st udy and randomized to one of three  cohorts . 
Cohorts will rec eive placebo or PTI-125 at 50 or 100 mg b.i.d.  (n=20 per group ). 
Plac e b o  o r  PTI-125 will be admin istere d as coated tablets . 
There will b e two scre ening visits within 30 days of start of the study. Patients meeting  
initial screenin g criteria , includ ing a Mini -Ment al State  Examination  (MMSE ) score  ≥ 16 
and ≤ 26 will return for  a CSF draw at a second screening visit to confirm that the  Aβ/tau 
Index  is indicative of AD  (final inclusion criterion). This CSF sample  will also serve as 
baseline measurement for the YKL40  neuroinfl amm ation and other potenti al CSF 
biomarker assay s. Cambridge Cognition testing  will be conducted  at the second  screening 
visit, Day 1, and at the e nd of the study . Patients will be asses sed for suicidality via the  
Columbia Su icide Se verity Scale (C -SSRS) during the first and last visits .

Page 13 of 33     CONFIDENTIA L Patients will repor t to clinic the mo rning of Day 1. The following will be conducted 
prior to dosin g: Cambridge Cognition  testing, a full physical exam , an ECG and a blood 
draw f or clinical labs and bio mark ers (PTI -125Dx an d mTOR) . After dosing, patient s 
will be m onitored for adverse e vents and vital si gns will be taken through [ADDRESS_905702] dose, and a n additional PK blood sample 
will be ob tained after this CSF draw for calculation o f CSF/plasm a ratio .  
Blood draws for clinical laboratory testing  will be perfo rmed  at screening and  on Days 1, 
7, 14 and 28. Safety asse ssmen ts of vital signs and  listening to  heart and lungs  will be 
conducted at  all visits . ECGs  will be conducted on Days  7, 14 and 28.  
Blood samples for testing in PTI -125D x, the com panion diagnostic/bio marker, mTOR 
activation and  other potential blood -based bioma rkers will be drawn  on Day 1 and Day 
28. The Day 28 blood sample wil l also be used for APOE geno typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A CSF s ample 
collection will be performed on Day 28 for neurogranin, ne urofilament light chain, total 
tau, p Tau (T181), Aβ42, Aβ40, YKL40 , IL-6, IL -1β, TNF α and other potential CSF 
biomarker assays as well a s bioanalysis of PTI -125. 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board/Data Monitoring Committee 
(DSMB/DMC)  has been  established and will meet perio dically to review pati ent safety 
assessm ents and determine if dosing may continue.

9. ADVERSE  EVE NTS/SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS   
9.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS  - DEFINITION  
An adverse  event  (AE)  is any undesirable  event that occurs  to a subject  during  a 
study,  whether  or not that event is conside red study  drug-related . Moni toring for AEs 
will start at dos ing. Examples  include:  
• Any treatment -emergent  signs  and symptoms  (events  that are marked  by a change  
from  the subjec t's baseline/entry  status  [e.g.,  an increase  in severity  or frequen cy 
of pre-existing abnormality  or disorde r]) 
• All reaction s from  study  drug, an overdose,  abuse of drug,  withdrawal  
phenomena,  sensit ivity or toxicity  to study drug 
• Apparently  unrelated  illnesses  
• Injury  or accidents  (Note:  if a medical  condition  is known  to have caused  the 
injury  or accident , the medical  conditio n and the accide nt should  be reported as 
two separate  medical events  [e.g.,  for a fall secondary  to dizziness,  both 
"dizziness"  and "fall"  should  be recorded  separately])  
• Extensions  or exacerb ations  of symptoms,  subjective  subject -reported  events,  
new clinically  significa nt abnormalities  in clinical  laboratory,  physiological  
testing or physical  examina tion 
 
All AEs,  whether  or not related to the study  drug,  must  be fully and completely  
document ed on the AE page of the CRF  and in the subject's  clinical  chart.  
In the event  that a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study because  of an AE, it must  be 
recorded  on the CRF  as such. The subject  should  be followed  and treated  by [CONTACT_106078] r until the abnormal  parameter  or symptom  has resolved  or stabi lized.  
The Inves tigator  must  report  all directly  observed  AEs and all spontaneousl y reported  
AEs.  The Investigator  will ask the subject  a non-specific  question  (e.g.,  "Have  you 
notice d anything  different since your dose of the study medicat ion?")  to assess  
whether  any AEs have  been  experienced  since  the last assessment.  AEs will be 
identified  and documented  on the AE CRF in appropri ate medical  terminology.  The 
severity  and the relation ship to the study drug will be determined  and reported  on the 
CRF  (see be low).  
Cassava  Sciences , Inc. Clinical Protoc ol PTI -125-02 
PTI-125, a small molecule to treat  AD June 28, 2019  
Page 25 of 33     CONFIDENTIA L 9.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING  
The severity  of each AE should  be character ized and then classified  into one of three  
clearly defined  categories  as follows:  
• Mild  - the AE does not interf ere in a signif icant  manner with the subject's  
normal functioni ng level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate  - the AE produces  some  impai rment  of functioning  but is not 
hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable  or an embarrassment.  
• Severe  - the AE produces  significant impair ment  of function ing or 
incapacit ation  and is a definite  hazard  to the subject's  health.  
These  three  categories  are based on the Investigator's  clinical  judgment,  which in turn 
depends  on consideration  of various  factors  such as the subject's  report, and the 
physici an's observations.  The severity  of the AE should  be recorded in the appropriate  
section  of the Adverse  Event  CRF. 
9.3. ADVERS E  EVENTS   -  RELATIONSHIP  TO  STUD Y   DRUG 
The relationship  of each AE to the study  drug will be classified  into one of three  
defined  categori es as follows:  
• Unlikely  - a causal relationship  between  the AE and the study  drug  is unlikely.  
• Possible  - a causal  relationship  between  the AE and the study  drug is possible.  
• Probable  - a causal  relationship  between  the AE and the study drug is probable. 
For example,  the AE is a common  adverse  event  known to occur  with the 
pharmacological  class  the study  drug belongs  to; or the AE abated  on study  
drug discontinua tion and reappeared  upon  rechallenge  with the study  drug. 
These  three categories  are based on the Investigator's  clinical  judgme nt, which  in turn 
depends  on consideration  of various  factors  such as the subject' s report,  the timing  of 
the AE in relationship  to study  drug administration/discontinuation,  the physician's  
observations and the physi cian's prior exper ience . The relationsh ip of the AE to the 
study  drug will be recorded  in the appropriate  section of the Adverse  Event  eCRF.  
9.4. SERIOUS ADVERS E EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) includes  (but is not limited to) an exper ience  
occurring  at any dose that results  in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatenin g event  (i.e., the subject  is at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
reaction  as it occurs).  "Life -threa tening"  does not include  an event  that, had it 
Cassava  Sciences , Inc. Clinical Protoc ol PTI -125-[ADDRESS_905722] caused  death.  For example,  drug­  
induced  hepatitis  that resolved  without  evidence  of hepatic  failure would  not be 
considered  life-threatening  even  though  drug-induce d hepatiti s can be fatal.  
• In-patie nt hosp italization  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063],  not an emergenc y room  visit)  or 
prolongation of  existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n. 
• A persi stent  or significant  disability/in capacity  (i.e., a substantial  disruption  of 
the subject's  ability  to carry  out norma l life functions) . 
• A congenital anomaly/ birth  defect . 
 
In addition,  medi cal and scientific  judgment should  be exercised  in decid ing whethe r 
other  situations  should  be consi dered  an SAE  (i.e., important  medical  events  that may 
not be immedi ately  life-threatening  or result  in death  but may jeopard ize the subject  
or may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the other outcom es 
listed  in the definition  above) . Examples  of such medical  events  include  (but are not 
limited  to): allergic  broncho spasm  requiring  intensiv e treatment  in an emergency  
room  or at home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in in-patient 
hosp italization,  or the development  of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.  
An unexpected  AE is one for which  the specifi city or severit y is not consist ent with 
the current Investigato r's Brochure.  For example,  hepatic  necrosis  would  be 
unexpected  (by [CONTACT_14213])  if the Investigator' s Brochure  only listed  
elevated  hepatic  enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Simil arly, cerebral thromboemb olism and  cerebr al vasculitis  would be unexpecte d (by 
[CONTACT_149030])  if the Investigator's  Brochure  only listed  cerebral  
vascular  accidents.  
9.5. SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVEN TS REPORTING  
The reporting  of SAEs  by [CONTACT_183433] (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory require ment.  Each  Regu latory  Agency  has established  a timetable  for 
reporting  SAEs  based  upon  establishe d criteria.  Likewise,  it is the responsibility  of 
the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_183416]/IRB.  
 
All SAEs must be reported  immedi ately  (within  24 h of learning  of the event)  by

following  the report  of an SAE.  
10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. RANDOM IZATION  
Randomized treatments will be assign ed by [CONTACT_670437] a randomly generated 
numeric sequence.  
The randomi zation code will not be reveal ed to  study patients, investigat ors, clinical 
staff or study monitors until all patients  have completed the rapy and t he database has 
been finalized and  locked .  
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be br oken. The b lind ma y be broken 
only if spe cific emergency treatment is ind icated . The date, t ime and reason for the 
unblinding must be documented on the case r eport form, and the medical monito r must 
be inf ormed as soon as possible.  
10.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
All patients  who receive study  medicat ion will be included  in analyses for safety, 
biomarkers  and cognition .  
10.3. PHARMACOKINET IC PARAMETERS  
The only plasma PK parameters to b e collected from this study are the  Cmin values from 
blood samples tak en prior to dosin g on Day s [ADDRESS_905725] ICAL ANALYSIS  
CSF b iomarker endpoints to be analyzed include: 1) neurogranin , 2) neurofi lament light 
chain, 3) total tau, 4) pTau (T18 1), 5) Aβ42, 6) YKL40 , 7) IL-6, 8) TNFα , and 9) IL-1β. 
Plasma and lymphoc yte assays include 1) PTI-125D x lymphocyte assay , 2) PTI -125D x 
plasma assay  and 3) mTOR assay . CSF biomarkers  may also be measured in plasma. 
All biomarker  data will be analy zed by a two-tailed paired t test or other appro priate 
statistic s. 
 
Although no t powered for e fficacy, the Cambridge Cognition  tests will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_670438] . 
 
10.5. SAFETY  ANALYSIS  
Adverse  events  reported  on case report forms  will be mapped  to preferred  terms  and 
organ  systems  using  the MedDRA  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169231].  Vital  signs  and clinical  
laboratory  results will be descr iptively  summarized  in terms  of change  from  
screening  values.  
10.6. SAMPLE SIZE 
Sixty (60) patients  will be enrolled  in this study. Sample  size was determined  by 
[CONTACT_670439]-transformed  data from  previous  studies  
of new c hemical entities ( NCEs ). 
11. STUDY TERMINATION  
The study  will be terminated  following  completion  of the study  or at any time at the 
discretion  of the Sponsor.  
12. DATA  COLLECTION,  RETENTION  AND  MONITORING  
12.1. CASE  REPORT  FORMS  
Electronic c ase report  forms (eCRFs)  will be used for each  subject.  The patients  in 
the study  will not be identified  by [CONTACT_670440]  (or CRO  designee)  but will be identified  by a unique patient number.  
Cassava  Sciences , Inc. Clinical Protoc ol PTI -125-[ADDRESS_905726] be completed with in 48 hours of a patient ’s 
visit. In case of  error , the correction will be noted , initialed  and dated.  
eCRFs  must  be reviewed  and verified  for accuracy  and signed -off by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_670429]  (or CRO  designee).  Paper  source 
documents , if used,  will remain at the Investigator's  site at the completion  of the 
study.  
12.2. AVAILABILITY AND RETENTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL RECORDS  
The Investigator  must  make  study  data accessible  to the monitor,  other  authorized  
representative s of the Sponso r (or designee) and Regulatory Agency  (e.g.,  FDA)  
inspectors  upon  request.  To assure  accuracy  of data collected  in the eCRFs,  it is 
mandato ry that Sponsor  representatives  have access  to original  source  documents  
(e.g., subject  records,  subjec t charts, and laborator y reports).  Durin g review  of these  
documents,  the subject's  anonymity  will be maintaine d with adherence  to 
professional  standards  of confidentiality  and applicable  laws.  A file for each subject  
must  be mainta ined that includes  the signed  Informed  Consent  Form and all sourc e 
documentat ion related  to that subject.  The Investigator  must  ensure  the reliability  and 
availability  of source  documents  for the eCRF.  
Investigators  are required  to maintain  all study  docum entation  until notificatio n by 
[CONTACT_670441]. 
The Investigator  is responsible  for maintaining  adequate  case histories  in each  
subject's  source  records.   
12.3. SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
All reports  and subject  samples  will be identified  only by [CONTACT_670442] n umber  
and initi als to maintain  subject confidential ity. Additional  subject  confidentiality  
issues  (if applicab le) are covered  in the Clinical  Trial  Agre ement.  
12.4. LIABILITY  
In the event  of a side effect  or injury,  appropriate  medical  care as determined  by [CONTACT_670443]/he r designated  alternate will be provided.  
If a bodily  injury  is sustained, resulting  directly from  the use of the study  drug,  the 
Sponsor  will reimburse  for reasonable  physician  fees and medical  expenses  
neces sary for treatment  of only the bodily injury which is not covered  by [CONTACT_1560]'s medical  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183419],  provided  that the injury is not due to a 
negligent  or wrongful  act or omission  by [CONTACT_183440]/her  staff.  No other

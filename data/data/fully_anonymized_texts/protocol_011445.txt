[INVESTIGATOR_23207](s) Multi -centre trial conducted in multiple countries
Clinical phase II
Trial rationale The main rationale of this extension trial is to collect additional long -term 
safet y and efficacy data of spesolimab in HS patients .
Trial objective(s) The primary  objective of this trial is to assess the long -term safety  of 
spesolimab in patients with HS who have completed the 1368- 0052 PoCC 
trial and are qualified for entry  into this trial. The secondary  objectives are 
to evaluate efficacy  at a lower do se than tested in PoCC trial.
Trial e ndpoints The primary  endpoint is the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) up to the end of the maintenance treatment period 
including REP (i.e., [ADDRESS_851861] stud y treatment).
Secondary  Endpoints:
•Percentage change in total abscess and inflammatory  nodule (AN) 
count from baseline up to Week 
•Percentage change in total draining fistula (DF) count from baseline up 
to Week 
•Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) up to Week 
•Change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa 
Severity  Score S ystem (IHS4) value up to Week 
•Hidradenitis Suppurativa Phy sician Global Assessment (HS- PGA) 
score of 0 or 1 up to Week 
•Absolute change from baseline in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Area and 
Severity  Index (HASI) score up to Week 
•Occurrence of at least one flare (defined as at least  in 
AN count with a minimum increase of 2 relative to baseline) up to 
Week 
•Achievement of at  from bas eline in Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS30) in Patient’s Global Assessment of HS Pain up to 
Week 
Trial design Open label, single -arm, multi- regimen, 2- year extension study  in adult 
patients with HS who have completed their treatment in the 1368-0052 
PoCC trial.

*V1 of this extension trial should preferably  be performed during the EoT visit of the parent 
PoCC trial(1368 -0052) . When the visits are performed on the same day  duplicate procedures 
across studies are performed once during the EoT/V1. If these visits ar e not performed on the 
same day , then either all V1 procedures need to be performed at that visit or a modification of 
procedures will be considered after discussion with the sponsor (e.g., if V1 is within 2 day sof 
the EoT visit of the PoCC trial, then certain visit procedures need not be repeated; however, if 
the gap is between 3 -14 day s, then align with the sponsor accordingl y).If a patient is unable 
to roll over on the day  of the EoT Visit of the 1368 -0052 PoCC trial because of medical 
reasons, then they  can be permitted to rollover within 2 weeks of the EoT Visit of the PoCC 
trial. During this gap, if required, patients can take sy stemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_637411] (see S ection 4.2 ) . However, biologics,

**Patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely  should undergo the EoT visit as soon 
as possible, the Follow -up (FUP 1) visit two weeks after last dose , and the EoS visit 16weeks 
after the last dose. If a patient discontinues the study  during a scheduled treatment visit then 
the visit is considered an EoT visit.
***Week  Patients identified as a Non -responder AND up -titrated to  at Week  
must undergo a re -assessment of their HS -PGA. If there is no change or no improvement in 
their HS -PGA grade at Week  compared to Week  then the patient MUST be 
discontinued from the trial ( Table 3.1: 1). The HS- PGA page and Abscess and Inflammatory  
Nodule count page are added as “unscheduled visits” at Week  to document th e re-
assessment. This assessment is recommended to be performed at the start of the visit. I f the 
patient is discontinued at the Week  visit, then this visit can be considered the EoT visit.
Every  second visit = every  other visit starting from W14.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory  skin disease characterised by  [CONTACT_73280], 
painful abscesses and fistulous tracts. Patients with HS objectively  have one of the lowest 
quality  of life measures of an y dermatologic disease. Lesions characteristically occur in the 
axillary , groin, infra -mammary , and/or anogenital regions of the body . HS lesions may  
progress to form sinus tracts an d expansive abscesses. Sequelae include significant pain, 
scarring, and psy chological distress. The average age of onset is during the earl y 20s [ R20-
3184 ]. The global prevalence of HS is reported between 0.0003% and 4.1%. Underdiagnosis 
or improper diagnosis is common. Overall, HS prevalence varies significantly  based on stud y 
methodology ; however, the disease appears to be more common than was previously  
considered [ R20-3176].
Treatment often begins with topi[INVESTIGATOR_282915] .When topi[INVESTIGATOR_637413], or the disease has progressed, biologics are recommended [ R20-3177]. 
Adalimumab is the only  approved biologic, with the response rate of 42%- 59% versus 
placebo response of 26% –28%, with a schedule of weekl y subcutaneous (s.c.) dosing.
When the medical management is ineffective, surgery is the option. Some of the most 
burdensome HS s ymptoms from patient perspective are pain, drainage and expl osive 
openings, itch, skin tightness (scarring), odour, fatigue and flu -like s ymptoms. Patients 
reported to be unsatisfied with the level of control offered by  [CONTACT_107072] y available treatment 
options and unmet needs from the patient perspective include the n eed for new medical 
treatments with favourable efficacy  and tolerability  profiles. In qualitative evidence, the most 
important treatment goals from the patient perspective were pain, drainage (including 
explosive openings) and fatigue.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
1.2.1 Mode of action
Spesolimab is a humanized antagonistic monoclonal IgG1 antibod y that blocks human IL36R 
signaling. Binding of spesolimab to IL36R is anticipated to prevent the subsequent activation 
of IL36R by  [CONTACT_190216] (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream activation of pro-
inflammatory  and pro- fibrotic pathway s with the aim to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]/ fibroblast/ 
immune cell -mediated inflammation and interrupt the inflammatory  response that drives 
pathogenic cy tokine production in inflammatory  diseases including generalized pustular 
psoriasis (GPP), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and inflammatory  bowel disease .
Spesolimab binds to human IL36R with a binding avidity  of less than 1 pM. Spesolimab 
inhibits IL36 ligand -stimulated NF -kB activation in HT29 and tran sformed epi[INVESTIGATOR_637414]90 values in a 
consistent range of 0.7 to 3.7 nM. Spesolimab also inhibits IL8 release in primary  human 
intestinal my ofibroblasts and IFNγ secretion in hum anPeripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
PBMC stimulated with IL36α, IL36β, or IL36γ combined with IL12.

-02 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 16of 86
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_851885] -03(18.0) / Savedon:10Jul2019Mutations of two key  residues (L 234 and L235) to alanine were made to spesolimab to
abrogate FcR binding activity  and function. Direct assessment of the impact of the mutations 
in the IgG1 FcR binding sites on both antibody -dependent cellular cy totoxicity (ADCC) and 
complement -dependent cy totoxicity  (CDC )effector functions revealed that the mutations 
abrogate both ADCC and CDC effector funct ions and indic ate that spesolimab will be a non -
depleting therapy in vivo.
Spesolimab does not bind to IL 36R from common toxicology  species. Therefore, meaningful 
toxicity  studies of the molecule cannot be performed in any  animal species with spesolimab . 
However, hazar d identification studies of the mode -of-action (MoA) of IL 36R inhibition 
were performed in mice using a mouse specific anti -IL36R monoclonal antibody  (Boehringer 
Ingelheim (B I)674304), which is a mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody with rat variable 
regions. In a 13 -week intravenous (i.v.) toxicity  study  of BI 674304 in mice, no adverse 
effects of IL36R antagonism were seen at a dose (50 mg/kg, twice weekl y) thatwas 5 -fold 
higher than the dose that was protective in an experimental mouse colonic inflammation 
model. I n the 26 -week toxicity  study , male and female mice (20- 30/sex/group at 0, 10 and 50 
mg/kg/day ) were administered BI 674304 twice weekl y for 26 weeks b yi.v.injection via the 
caudal vein. There were no BI 674304 -related changes in clinical observat ions, body  weights, 
food consumption, ophthalmology , clinical pathology parameters ( haematology , clinical 
chemistry ), organ weights, macroscopic or microscopic examinations. The no- obser ved-
adverse -effect level was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day .
The in vitro cy tokine release and tissue cross -reactivity  assay s demonstrate that the risk of
transient cy tokine release in humans is low and that, as expected, spesolimab stains 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_258674] a variet y of tissues. There were no signs of local irritation after si ngle, 1mL 
injections of the s.c.formulation in rabbits. These preclinical toxicology  data support chronic 
spesolimab dosing in humans.
Spesolimab or placebo was administered to 78 healthy  volunteers at single ascending i.v. 
doses from 0.001 mg/kg to 10 m g/kg bod y weight. Safety  and
tolerability  of all tested i.v. 
doses was good. There were no drug -related serious adverse events ( SAEs ). AEs categorized 
as related to treatment were observed in 3/19 (15.8%) subjects in the placebo group and in 
7/59 (11.9%) s ubjects treated with spesolimab. The most frequent treatment- emergent AEs 
were nasopha ryngitis (spesolimab : 21%; placebo : 15%) ,head ache (spesolimab: 9%; placebo: 
15%), i nfluenza like illness (spesolimab: 7%; placebo: 10%), and diarrhoea (spesolimab: 3%; 
placebo : 10%). There were two AEs of moderate intensity  (injection site haematoma, 
headache) ;allremaining AEs were of mild intensity . There was no apparent relationship 
between the frequency  of AEs and the dose.
There were no relevant changes compared to placebo for laboratory  safet y, including clinical 
chemistry , haematology , coagulation parameters, and urinal ysis. No clinically relevant 
changes were observed in 12
-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) , vital signs, and cardio -
monitoring. Pharmacokinetics ( PK) analysis showed that exposure (AUC0 -tz and Cmax) to 
spesolimab increased with increasing dose in an approximately  dose -proportional manner 
from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_851886] -03(18.0) / Savedon:10Jul2019The ef fective half -life of spesolimab is approximately  4 weeks in the linear dose range. 
Overall, PK data so far suggests target -mediated drug disposition kinetics for spesolimab. 
Anti- drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in 8 patients, 3 of those had pre -existing levels. 
Pharmacod ynamic (PD) effects in this First in Human Single Rising Dose (SRD) trial 
[c03361085] were assessed by  [CONTACT_637440]36R by [CONTACT_637441]-vivo whole blood stimulation assay . Preliminary analyses indicate that ≥94% peripheral 
IL36R receptor occupancy is achieved with doses ≥0.05mg/kg from [ADDRESS_851887] infusion 
to 10 weeks.
In a multiple rising dose (MRD) trial, spesolimab or placebo have been administered to
healthy  volunteers at multiple ascending i.v. doses of 3, 6,10 and 20 mg/kg given qw for 4
weeks (i.e. 4 administrations) or a single dose of 20 mg/kg (8 subjects each, 3:1 on active or
placebo). Overall, spesolimab was well tolerated. There were no dose dependent AEs, AEs 
considered to be dose limiting and no SAEs. In all cases the AEs were of mild or mode rate 
intensity . Furthermore, there were no clinically  relevant abnormalities on treatm ent with 
spesolimab with respect to safet y laboratory , vital signs, or ECGs as assessed by  a central 
reader. For further details and most recent results refer to the current Investigator`s Brochure 
(IB) [ c03320877

1.2.2 Studies in Patients
Safety  and e fficacy  data are available from a proof of concept (PoC) study  in patients with 
GPP. I n trial 1368-0011, seven patients received a single i .v.dose of 10 mg/kg spesolimab

by [CONTACT_5875] 1 in five patients and by  [CONTACT_5875] 2 in six of seven patients. A major improvement in 
GPP Area and Severity Index was observed in all patients with a mean (SD) percent change 
from baseline of 73.2% (16.2) at week 2; by  [CONTACT_5875] 4, this was further reduced to 82.0% and 
was maintained to week 20 (83.6%).
Further trials are ongoing in patients with GPP, PPP, AD, UC, or CD. An independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) is involved in the monitoring of these trials. As of September 
2020, an estimated [ADDRESS_851890] P eriod (REP) ofspesolimab is [ADDRESS_851891] 
dose with measurable drug levels and/ or PD effects still likely  to be present .
1.2.4 Summary
Spesolimab is an anti IL36R antibody  with a high clinical activity  toblock IL36R signaling, 
as demonstrated in patients with GPP, a severe inflammatory  skin disease driven by  
[CONTACT_637442]36 activity . Spesolimab has been tested in healthy  volunteers with multiple 
dosing up to four weeks of 20 mg/kg i.v. q.w. which were a ll safe and well tolerated. In

spesolimab might be a promising drug to treat patients suffering from HS .

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
Adalimumab is the only  approved biologic for HS, with the response rate of 42% -59% versus 
placebo response of 26% –28%, with a schedule of weekl y s.c. dosing. Long -term safety  
concerns are pertinent in the treatment of HS, where the dosing regimen of biologics is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y more intensive compared to other inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis. 
Considering the above, a more efficacious and safer molecule with better dosing regimens is 
a substantial need in HS patients.
Spesolimab is an IL36R antagonist currentl y in development for the treatment of GPP. HS 
and GPP may have similarity considering the presence of pustules ,neutrophil infiltration ,and 
psoriasiform h yperplasia . 
IL36 alpha, beta and gamma mRNA expression are upregulated in 
lesional skin in HS patients with a decrease in IL36RN expression [ R20-3047 ]. Internal in 
situ hy bridization staining of HS lesions also confirms the increased expression of ligands. 
IL36 is thought to be a central upstream mediator of an inflammatory  loop which further 
activates the keratinocy tes, amplify ing the secretion of chemokines that lead to infiltration of 
immune cells to the skin. I nfiltrated dendritic cells ( DCs)and monocy tes can be activated b y 
IL36 (internal data a nd published) to potentiate the antigen presenting cell function of DCs 
and also lead to secretion of chemokines and cy tokines that can recruit more immune cells 
including neutrophils. IL36 is a potent activator of neutrophil infiltration and in the context of 
HS, neut rophils are shown to undergo NET osis leading to secretion of auxiliary  medicinal 
products and t ype I Interferons [ R20-3155]. Based on the role of IL36 driving TH17 and TH1 
responses in GPP (published and our internal data) the hy pothesis is that IL36 is also a key 
driver of TH17 responses in skin of HS patients. To that end, we are conducting the 1368-
0052 proof -
of-clinical concept (PoCC) study  in moderate to severe HS patients .
The main rationale of this extension trial is to collect additional long-term safet y and efficacy 
data of spesolimab in eligible HS patients from the [ADDRESS_851893] that spesolimab is safe, tolerable and may  addre ss an unmet medical need in patients 
with HS 
by [CONTACT_2017] -inflammatory  mechanism of action. Efficacy  in HS has not been 
established. The data from the completed 1368- 0011 PoC trial, in patients with an acute flare 
of GPP, demonstrate that spesolimab treatmen t rapi[INVESTIGATOR_637415], the

IL36R antagonist. (see: spesolimab IB, document number c03320877-10 ) 
No relev ant animal species is available for toxicology  testing of the highl y human specific 
antibody  spesolimab. However, preclinical toxicology  studies with a mouse surrogate 
antibody  have demonstrated the safet y of chronic IL36R inhibition in mice (spesolimab IB , 
document number c03320877 -10, Section 5.1.2). A recent publication has assessed the 
clinical phenot ype and immune function in [ADDRESS_851895] studies to 
single or multiple doses of spesolimab up to dose levels of 20 mg/kg given once weekl y for 4 
weeks. Spesolimab was safe and well tolerated in three healthy  volunteers' trials at all dose 
groups up to th e highest tested dose of 20 mg/kg body  weight given once a week for up to 4 
weeks (for details see spesolimab IB, document number c03320877-10 ). Moreover, several 
clinical studies are ongoing as of May  2020, exploring efficacy  and safet y of spesolimab in 
different indications such as: Atopic Dermatitis, Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, GPP, 
and PPP. Spesolimab has been tested in single dose (10 mg/kg i.v.) in GPP and in multiple 
doses up to [ADDRESS_851896] the possibility  to receive 
rescue treatment. Patients who fail to rescue treatment or cannot receive further trial 
medication (i.e., unbearable adverse events (AEs)) will be discontinued and swit ched to 
available 
standard of care ( SoC)at the investigator`s discretion. This will limit the duration of 
spesolimab exposure in patients no longer benefitting from treatment.

Blood Sampling As with all blood sampling, 
there is a risk of mild pain, 
local irritation, or bruising 
(a black or blue mark) at the 
puncture site. Furthermore, 
there is a small risk of light-
headedness and/or fainting. 
In rare cases, the puncture 
site can also become 
infected or nerves may  be 
damaged, inducing long -
lasting abnormal sensations 
(paraesthesia ), impaired 
sensation of touch and

[IP_ADDRESS] Wome n of Child Bearing Potential
Based on the findings in the nonclinical studies conducted to date and in accordance with 
international regulatory guidelines, the inclusion of Women of Child Bearing Potential 
(WOCBP) in this study  is justified. To minimize the risk of unintentional exposure of an 
embry o or foetus to the investigational drug, WOCBP must agree to the requirements for the 
pregnancy  testing and contraceptive methods. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].

population included in the clinical trials, the spectrum of patient characteristics in the 
spesolimab program across all invest igated indications does not suggest an undue risk of 
more severe COVID -19 infections.
Similar to other immune modulating biological treatments, spesolimab may potentially  
increase the risk of infections. Therefore, risk mitigation measures, such as exclusion of

handling of acute infections occurring during the trial have been included in the clinical trial 
protocols (CTP) . As an y other acute infection a suspected or diagnosed COVID- 19 infection 
should be treated according to the SoC and interruption o f study  medication should be 
considered. Considering the current knowledge of COVID -19 and the implemented risk 
mitigation measures addressing the potential risk of infections, patients studied in trials with 
spesolimab are not believed to be at higher ris k of COVID -19 due to their background or 
concomitant diseases. Protocol- defined procedures do not impose undue risk to study  
participants.
To address potential risks associated with operational aspects related to the participation in 
clinical trials in co ntext of COVID -
19 pandemic, different risk mitigation measures are 
considered in ongoing and planned spesolimab clinical trials based on local requirements and 
development of pandemic. The benefit- risk assessment of spesolimab remains favourable in 
the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic.
The investigators will take the totality  of information related to each single patient and the 
local COVID -19 situation into consideration when performing the individual benefit-risk 
assessment on a case -by-case basis. Consi dering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon 
each patient’s (continued) participation in the planned trials. BI as the sponsor, where 
required, will support the investigator in their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the 
investigator may  decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safet y, 
wellbeing, and/or is in the best interest of the patient.
1.4.3 Discussion
Due to the lack of mechanism- or compound -related safet y signals of spesolimab, it is 
expected that patients with mo derate or severe HS will not be exposed to unacceptable, undue 
risks and AEs .
Considering the medical need for development of an effective and well tolerated drug for the 
therap y of HS, the benefit of this trial is considered to outweigh the potential risks.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This trial will be conducted as a prospective, open -label design. The aim of the trial is to 
allow treatment continuation to individual patients who completed the 1368 -0052 PoCC 
trial and evaluate the susta inability  of response. Additionally , this trial provides opportunity  
for the patients who were on the placebo arm in the 1368 -0052 PoCC trial to get access to 
the trial treatment. It is also designed to generate additional safety  information.
Patients who prematurel y discontinued the 1368 -0052 PoCC trial are not eligible to 
participate in this study . For patients who terminate study  drug prematurely  in this 
extension study  the subsequent visit will be replaced by  [CONTACT_637445] y EoT visit followed by [CONTACT_637446]  (EoS) visit [ADDRESS_851918] sch eduled visit. The end of 
whole study  is defined as “last patient out”; i.e., last scheduled visit completed by  [CONTACT_637447] . All the parameters will be assessed in a descriptive manner, since the 
trial is open -label.
An independent DMC wi ll evaluate safety  and efficacy  data on a continuous basis.

Patients in this long -term open label extension (OLE) trial will be rolled over from the 1368 -
0052 PoCC trial . The total number of patients to be rolled over depends on how many  
eligible patients roll over from the 1368- 0052 PoCC trial. The maximum number of patients 
eligible to rollover is approximately  45from multiple countries and multiple sites . This OLE 
study  aims to offer active long -term treatment to patients having completed treatment with 
spesolimab in the 1368- 0052 PoCC trial, and an opportunity  for patients on the placebo arm 
to get active treatment. This study  will also help to characterize the saf ety and clinical 
outcome of spesolimab long -term treatment.
A log of all patient s enrolled into the 
trial(i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF irrespective of whether they  have been treated with investigational drug 
or not .If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or 
more exclusion criteria on the day  of enrolment), the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_35857] .

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial anddose modifications
In the 1368- 0052 PoCC trial, a fixed rather than weight -based dose regimen was selected. 
Early trials of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies often investigate bod ywei ght–based 
regimens to reduce the inter
-subject variability  in drug exposure. However, there is generall y 
only a modest contribution of body  weight to the overall PKand PDvariability  of 
monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies are highl y target specific and 
offer a relatively  large therapeutic window compared to new chemical entities. Therefore, 
most monoclonal antibodies are approved at fixed doses in ant ibody /target excess in order to 
cover target turnover and maximize efficacy  [R10-6267 ; R13-4749; R13- 4753; R13- 4750;

4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
An Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) s ystem will b e used in this trial in order to 
dispense medication kits as well as manage initial/re- suppl y ordering of medication kits. The 
study  site will be required to complete the appropriate module within the IRT sy stem. The 
investigator will receive all necessary instructions to access the IRT system from the sponsor 
or chosen provider. Detailed I RT transactions and procedures will be documented in the user 
requirement specifications mutually  agreed to by  [CONTACT_637448]. All 
medication kit assign ments will occur in an open label fashion except for medications 
provided for Visit 1. 
Note that the medication number is dif ferent from the patient number.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Patients will be treated with spesolim ab as indicated in the Flow Chartand Section 3.1.1. The 
medication will be assigned via IRT.
At Visit 1 patients who were in the placebo arm of the 1368 -0052 PoCC trial will be given an 
initial  dose of spesolimab plus placebo . Patients from the active arm 
of the 1368- 0052 PoC C trial will be given  placebo plus  spesolimab 
Detailed instructions for the preparation of the solution for infusion, the volume to be 
administered and the infusion rate as well as detailed instructions for use and handling of 
spesolimab sy ringes are provided in the I SF.
At all other visits all patients will receive  spesolimab  for the remainder of the 
trial unless an increase in dose to  is required at Week Refer to Table 3.1: 1.
Patients have to be closely  monitored for local or sy stemic hy persensitivity  reactions for one
hour following or  study  drug administration. Patients should be closely  monitored for 
signs and s ymptoms of injection site or sy stemic hy persensitivity  reactions following study  
drug administration. Injection site should not be close to a vein and it should avoid sites 
where the skin is tender, bruised, ery thematous, or indurated, and should be alternated to 
other areas for subsequent doses. Study  personnel should observe the injection site for signs

shortness of breath. Patients should be advised that if they experience redness, swelling or 
other changes at the injection site, they  should notify  site personnel. They  should further be 
advised that if they  experience itching all over or a feeling of being swollen, dizzy  or short of 
breath, they  should seek emergency medical attention immediately  and notify  site personnel.
The administration of the trial medication on all applicable study  days will be done un der 
supervision of the investigating ph ysician or a designee at the site. If available, a pharmacist 
should prepare the study  medication. The so -called four ey e principle (two- person rule) 
should be applied for preparation (e.g. choosing the correct vials with the correct medication 
number) and administration of trial medication.
In case of safety  concerns, e.g., due to infusion reactions, it is in the discretion of the 
investigator or his/her designee to adapt the infusion scheme, including but not limite d to 
slowing down the infusion rate, interrupting the infusion and - provided no further safet y 
concern exist -restarting at a slower rate. Further, based on his /hermedical judgment he/she 
will provide medications such as steroids, etc., as needed ( see Section 4.2.1 for handling of 
infusion reactions). Detailed instructions for handling of infusion reactions are also provided 
in the “Instructions for Pharmacist” document in the I SF.
Dose modifications or adjustments are not pe rmitted. In exceptional cases of missed or 
delay ed visits, if any  of these visits has to be rescheduled, the date of subsequent visit should 
be calculated from Visit 1. After V isit 3, in case of delay ed visits, IMP can be administered 
with a minimum interval of 7 day s from the next dose, only  after discussion and approval 
from the sponsor.
Trial treatment may  be restarted after a temporary  reason for treatment discontinuation on a 
case b y case basis and after consu ltation with the sponsor. ( SeeSection [IP_ADDRESS] .)
During the COVID -19 pandemic, physical visits to the sites may  need to be restricted to 
ensure patient safet y. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the

automatically  by [CONTACT_637439].
5.1.2 International Hidradenitis Sup purativa Severity Score System -IHS4
IHS4 is a valid, clinical scoring s ystem for dy namic assessment of HS severity . Determining 
IHS4 requires counting nodules, abscesses and draining fistulae/sinus tracts making it 
straightforward to apply  in clinical trials [ R20-3045].
A nodule (inflammatory  nodule) is a raised, three dimensional , round, infiltrated lesion with a 
diameter of >10 mm. An abscess is a tender but fluctuating mass with a diameter of >10 mm, 
surrounded b y an erythematous area; the middle of an abscess contains pus. A draining tunnel 
is a raised, tender but fluctuating longitudinal mass of variable length a nd depth, ending at the 
skin surface, and sometimes oozing a fluid. Fistulae and sinuses are examples of tunnels.
5.1.3 H idradenitis Suppurativa P hysician Global Assessment -HS-PGA
This documents the phy sician’s assessment of the patient’s HS at a given time po int. It scores 
patient disease severit y as either clear or minimal or mild or moderate or severe or very 
severe, based on abscesses, draining fistulae, inflammatory  nodule and non -inflammatory  
nodule .
5.1.4 H idradenitis Suppurativa Area and Severity Index -HASI
HASI  is modelled after the Psoriasis Activity  and Severity  Index (PASI ). Four classic signs 
of HS -related inflammation (ery thema, thickness, drainage, tenderness) are included. Each 
variable in HASI is scored on a L ikert scale (0 –3) for each predetermined body  region. For 
BSA assessment, the number of palms (one palm indicated 1% of the patient’s BSA) 
involved for each bod y region (head, right axilla, left axilla, anterior chest, back, anterior 
bathing trunk, posterior bathing trunk, other) is assessed. Th
is is converted to a percentage of 
that region. An area score was assigned to each region using the PASI  approach (0 = none, 1 
= 1–9%, 2 = 10–29%, 3 = 30–49%, 4 = 50–69%, 5 = 70–89%, 6 = 90– 100%). To calculate 
the regional HASI score, the sum of the four clinical variable scores is multiplied by  [CONTACT_637450]. This value is then multiplied by  [CONTACT_637451], to give a regional HASI score. Regional HASI scores are added together to give 
the cumulative total HASI score (range 0 –72).

The Pain NRS is an endpoint for the assessment of HS -related pain severit y for clinical t rials 
with patients with HS. I t is a unidimensional measure of pain intensit y and can be 
administered monthly  at the site. Response is given by  [CONTACT_1629] [ADDRESS_851953] HS pain. Ratings will range from 0 (no HS pain) to 10 (HS pain as bad as onecan

5.1.6 Derma tology Life Quality Index 
The DLQI is a patient -administered, ten -question, quality  of life questionnaire that covers six 
domains including s ymptoms and feelings, dail y activities, leisure, work and school, personal 
relationships and treatment 
[R05-2548 ]. The DL QI has a one - week recall period. Response 
categories include “not relevant” (score of 0), “not at all” (score of 0), “a little” (score of 1), 
“a lot” (score of 2) and “very  much” (score of 3). Question 7 is a “y es”/ “no” question where 
“yes” is scored as 3.
The DLQI will be anal yzed under six headings as follows [ R05-2548]:
Domain Question Number Score
Symptoms and feelings Questions 1 and 2 Score maximum 6
Daily  activities Questions 3 and 4 Score maximum 6
Leisure Questions 5 and 6 Score maximum 6
Work and school Question 7 Score maximum 3
Personal Relationships Questions 8 and 9 Score maximum 6
Treatment Question 10 Score maximum 3
DLQI total score is calculated by  [CONTACT_417833] a range of 
0 to 30 where 0- 1 = no effect on patient’s life, 2 -5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-
20 = very  large effect, and 21 -30 = extremel y large effect on patient’s life. The higher the 
score, the more the quality  of life is impaired. If o ne question is left unanswered this is scored 
0 and the total score is summed and expressed as usual out of a maximum of 30; for anal ysis 
by [CONTACT_637452] y, the corresponding subscore is considered to be missing. If 2 or more 
questions are left unanswered ( missing), DLQI total score is treated as missing. A 4- point 
change from baseline is considered a clinically  important difference.

The FACIT -Fatigue Scale is a 13- item questionnaire ([ R10-6433 ], [R07-4311], [ R16- 0029]) 
that assesses self -reported fatigue and its impact upon daily  activities and function. Answers 
are based on a 5 -point L ikert scale. Responses of “not at all,” “a little,” “somewhat”, “quite a 
bit,” and “very  much” are available for each question, and correspond to scores of 0, 1, 2, 3,

[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancies
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the trial will be reported as SAEs. Patients 
with a documented active or suspected malignancy (except for specific cancers) will be 
excluded from this trial per the exclusion criteria ( Section 3.3.3 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
Considering the characteristics of spesolimab, no penetration of blood -brain -barrier is 
anticipated, and a central effect triggering suicidal events is considered unlikely . The 
available pre -clinical and clinical data do not indicate effects of spesolimab on the central 
nervous s ystem.
Pro-active screening for SIB in the HS clinical development program will be implemented 
with the following objectives:
•As a safety  measure to exclude subjects at risk of suicidality  and monitor for sign s of 
suicidality .
•Structured data collection that may  help in future assessment of potential signals around 
suicidality .
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, investigator -rated interview, developed by  [CONTACT_342349], assessing bo th suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation. I t does 
not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity  information 
specificall y for behaviour and ideation.
The C -SSRS interview may  be administered by  [CONTACT_342350], psy cholog ist, clinical 
social worker, mental health counsellor, nurse, or coordinator with C- SSRS training. It has a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_417801], and causes only a low burden on subjects. At a minimum, 
the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 related to 
suicidal behaviour, and may  be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive responses. The 
investigator has to directly  evaluate the scale and confirm that they evaluated and reviewed 
the scale .The investigator docume nts their evaluation and review of the scale by  [CONTACT_5640], 
•writing at statement in the source notes , or
•writing “reviewed” on questionnaire, signs, and dates the questionnaire.
The C -SSRS has been widely  used in large multinational clinical trials. The C -SSRS will be 
administered at Visit 1 (using the ‘ since last visit ’ version) with the aim to exclude subjects 
with active moderate or severe s ymptomatology  within a specified time prior to the baseline 
visit. The life time history  of SIB will also be recorded.
After the baseline visit the assessment ‘since last visit’ will be performed at each clinic or 
phone visit (‘since last visit’ version). The investigator is to review positive and negative 
reports for plausibility  and clinical relevance. Doubtful report s may  be repeated or reports 
may be validated by  a consulting psy chiatrist. If there is a confirmed positive report of 
suicidal behaviour or suicidal ideation ty pe [ADDRESS_851966] during the clinic visit, and/or is to consult a psy chiatrist. If

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_851967] -03(18.0) / Savedon:10Jul2019the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the subject’s safet y have to be 
initiated.
All C -SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_851968] 
be reported as SAEs b y the investigator. For ‘Self -injurious behaviour, no suicidal intent’ 
(Type 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied. For each negative report 
(suicidal ideation ty pe 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the investigator is to decide based on 
clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the CTP, and if it is considered an 
AE then it must be reported accordingly .
[IP_ADDRESS] Local Tolerability
Local tolerability  at the administration site of spesolimab will be assessed by [CONTACT_637455] y since the last visit. Any  observed local tolerability  reaction, e.g. “swelling”, 
“induration”, “heat”, “redne ss”, “pain”, and an y other findings should be reported as AEs 
(see Section 6.2.2 ).
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_851969] a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  findin g), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF andBI SAE form (if applicable):
•Worsening of the unde rlying disease or of other pre -existing conditions
•Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  are 
judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_1275] .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the electronic case report form (eCRF )only.However, 
if these abnormalities are AEs of the parent PoCC trial and still ongoing after the first dose in 
this extension trial, then th ey should not be recorded as baseline conditions. I n such situations 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] should be followed.

room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, bl ood dy scrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
BI has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be considered to be “serious” 
even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection ”and“AE r eporting to sponsor and
timelines ”.

Potential Severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) that requires follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_637456]: 
•An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and / or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥[ADDRESS_851974] combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold 
ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples dra wn within 30 day s of each 
other; or
•ALT and / or AST elevations ≥10- fold ULN.
These lab findings constitute a hepat ic injury  alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF. 
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary , in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepati c injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed. 
For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between >1 and <[ADDRESS_851975] at baseline: 
1.An elevation of AST and / or AL T ≥3-fold the baseline value combined with an eleva tion 
of bilirubin ≥2-fold UL N or ≥2-fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is elevated at baseline), 
measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn w ithin 30 day s of each other, or,
2.Aminotransferase elevations ≥
5-fold the baseline value.
For patie nts with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between ≥[ADDRESS_851976] and <5 x UL N at 
baseline: 
1.An elevation of AST and / or AL T ≥2-fold the baseline value combined with an elevation 
of bilirubin 
≥2-fold ULN or ≥2-fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is elevated a t 
baseline); measured in the same blood sample or in samples drawn w ithin 30 day s of each 
other, or,

The intensity  (severi ty) grading of AEs will be performed according to RCTC Version 2.0 
developed b y the Outcome Me asures in Rheumatology organization [ R13-3515]. Refer to the 
ISF for intensit y/severit y classification.
Intensit y options are:
Grade 1 mild
Grade 2 moderate
Grade 3 severe
Grade 4 life-threatening.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_851978] tha t there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
•The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
•The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
•A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
• Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
•No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -existing
or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
•The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
•An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
• No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
•Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives ).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged

explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
• Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_851980] be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) b y theInvestigator
(special notes on SAE form reporting where needed):
•From the time of the signing of the consent form in the extension trial until the end of 
the EoS visit all AEs (serious and non- serious) and all AESI s.
•All AEs that started in the 1368- 0052 PoCC (parent) trial (onset date in parent trial) 
and are still ongoing after 1stIMPadministration in the extension trial:
•Re-record the AE in the extension trial eCRF with the same information as it was 
recorded in the parent tria l.
•Should the AE end during the course of the extension trial,
update both -the extension trial eCRF and t he parent trial eCRF. If the parent trial 
is alread y locked, update only  the extension trial eCRF. I n this case the update for 
the parent trial will be handled outside of the eCRF of the parent trial.
•However, concerning reporting on the SAE form (if appli cable), the follow -up report 
will still be sent on the parent trial SAE form, no new SAE form is to be completed 
for the extension trial.
•If the intensity  of an ongoing AE changes after 1stIMP administration in the extension 
trial:
update both -the exten sion trial eCRF and the parent trial eCRF - with the end date 
for the initial/previous intensity . If the parent trial is alread y locked, update only 
the extension trial eCRF. I n this case the update for the parent trial will be handled 
outside of the eCRF o f the parent trial.
The AE with the new intensity will be handled as new event; this means it is only  
recorded in the extension trial eCRF.
Example: I f the intensity  increased then the new AE name/term should 
contain “Worsening of ….” or “ Exacerbation of….”.
Considerations for reporting on the SAE form, when intensity  change 
qualifies as worsening/exacerbation of an event that had alread y been 
reported on the SAE form:
-corresponding follow up report to be sent on the parent trial SAE form 
with date of worsening as event end date. 
- extension trial SAE form to be sent as initial report for the extension trial 
for new event “worsening/exacerbation of….” with date of worsening as 
onset date.

monitor the patient for new AEs but should only  report new malignancies or the exacerbation 
of existing malignancies, trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of 
which the investigator may  become aware of by  [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. 
Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2) for the extension 
trial, but not on the CRF (neither on CRF for extension trialnor for parent trial).
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_851982] report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AE SI immediately to the sponsor’s unique entry  point (within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event) (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions ,
the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trial must 
be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no 
further information can be obtained.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . Each visit date 
(with its window) up to the EoS Visit is to be counted from Visit 1 (visit with first I MP 
administration). If any of these visits has to be rescheduled, the date of the subsequent visit 
should be calculated again from Visit 1 . Additional visits (unscheduled visits) for the purpose 
of re-testing of laboratory  parameters or AE monitoring may  be included as deemed 
necessary  by [CONTACT_093] . If a visit was missed due to an y reason, the Clinical Trial 
Leader (CT Leader) must be contact[CONTACT_637458].
For detailed description of the visit schedule and the trial procedures, please refer to the Flow 
Chart and its footnotes.
Details relating to study  drug administration and treatment interruptions are provided in 
Section 4.1.4.
Study  measurements and assessments are scheduled to occur ‘before’ trial medication 
administration. For planned individual plasma concentration sampling times refer to the Flow 
Chart . Sampling times will be recorded and used for PK anal ysis.
In exceptional cases, if standard visits at the trial sites are impossible because of COVID -[ADDRESS_851991] interests of the patient and if 
agreed with the sponsor. All COVI D-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits 
and procedures will be documented and the implications considered for the anal ysis of the 
trial data.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this CTP may not be feasible at a site. With the consent of the 
patient, sponsor and investigator may agree on alternative, back -up or resc ue methodology  
which may  include but will not be limited to virtual patient visits and assessments, home 
healthcare nurse visits, and direct -to-patient shipments of trial treatment. Such alternative 
measures may  be described in a specific Crisis Management Manual as part of the initial 
submission package, and will also be mentioned in the patient information leaflet. The 
implementation of these measures will depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility , 
local law and regulations. If alternative meth odology  is implemented, the deviations from the

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_851992] -03(18.0) / Savedon:10Jul2019Patient Reported outcomes (PROs) should be completed by  [CONTACT_199085]/her own in a 
quiet area/room before any other visit asses sments or treatments and, as much as possible, 
before an y interaction with the investigator or other members of the study team.
Separate from the PROs above, the evaluation of efficacy  assessments are to be conducted 
preferabl y by [CONTACT_637459] , whenever possible, throughout the study .
PROs and assessments should preferabl y be done prior to an y study drug administration.
6.2.1 Visit 1 – Start of Treatment
For the comprehensive list of the trial procedures required at Visit 1 please refer to the Flow 
Chart .Study  drug will start at Visit 1.
Visit 1 should preferabl y be performed in one visit combined with the EoT visit of the 
preceding 1368 -0052 PoCC trial. Any duplicate procedures across the two studies are 
performed onl y once when the visit is combined. When these two visits across both studies 
donot occur on the same day  then a modification of p rocedures will need to be considered. 
Refer to the Flow Chart for procedures that are identical across the two visits and for further 
information on an y modification of procedures.
If a patient performs the EoT visit in the 1368- 0052 PoCC study  and a newly  observed 
medical finding ,for example , prohibits the patient to immediately  enrol into this study , then 
the patient can come back for Visit 1 at a later date per the opi[INVESTIGATOR_637432]. The maximum gap for enrolling into this trial is 2 weeks 
after the EoT in the 1368 -0052 PoCC trial. During this gap, patients can take sy stemic and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_637433] (see Section 4.2). 
However, biologics, immunomodulators and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] a nalgesics are not allowed for HS and 
non-HS indications .
Refer to 
Section 4.1.4 for study  drug assignment and administration. Administration of the 
study  drug is blinded at Visit 1 only .
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent
The patient must be given sufficient time to consider participation in this extension trial. 
Therefore, to facilitate the logistics of Visit 1 and the consenting process, information about 
this extension trial should be discussed with potentially  eligible patients in advance of Visit 1 
of this trial. A copy  of the patient information and consent form of the extension trial should 
be provided to potentially eligible patients preferably  no later than Visit 8 of the previous 
1368- 0052 PoCC trial. This will pro vide potential patients with sufficient time to consider 
their possible participation in this extension trial. At Visit 1, t he investigator or delegate 
obtains written consent of the patient’s own free will with the
 informed consent form after 
confirming t hat the patient understands the contents. Also refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_851993] be fully  explained to the patient and written informed con sent obtained prior to

unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial.
Once consented, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial. Once informed consent is 
obtained, the IRT contact [CONTACT_637460] b y the site. I RT will assign a patient number at 
the time I RT registration. Collection of SAEs and AEs begi ns immediately  after the patient 
has signed the consent form (please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). The patient should be 
recorded on the enrolment log .
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection Testing
Infection test ing will include TB, Hepatitis B, H epatitis C, and HI V assessments (see Table 
5.2.3:1). The results of the Infection Testing will not be available until after the patient 
receives their first dose at Visit 1 . See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for Discontinuation Rules.
Interferon Gamma Release Assay
Patients with indeterminate / suspected false- positive QuantiFERON TB or invalid/borderline 
T-spot test result may  have the test repeated once. If after repeat testing the QuantiFERON 
TB result i s “indeterminate” , a[COMPANY_003] skin test may  be performed locall y. A tuberculin skin test 
reaction ≥10mm (≥5mm if receiving ≥15mg/d prednisone or its equiva lent) is considered 
positive.
In patients with a previously  (i.e., in the previous PoCC trial or in this ongoing extension 
trial) negative IGRA for TB the test should be repeated ev ery 52 weeks, as long as the results 
are negative. Refer to Table 5.2.3: 1.
If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed during the trial, then patients can receive anti- tuberculosis 
treatment as per investigator discretion and continue receiving stud y medication as per 
investigator .
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
The treatment period is from Visit [ADDRESS_851995] of the trial procedures required at the EoT, FUP 1, and the EoS 
visits please refer to Flow Chart and its footnotes.
The FUP 1 Visit occurs 2 weeks after the EoT Visit; this is [ADDRESS_851996] dose of trialmedication.

SAMPLE SIZE
The primary  objective of this trial is to assess the long -term safety  of spesolimab in patients 
with HS who have completed the [ADDRESS_852001] ed in PoCC 
trial.
For primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint, all adverse events with an onset between start 
of treatment and end of the REP (i.e., [ADDRESS_852002] study  treatment) will be included.

completed the planned treatment period in spesolimab 1368-0052 PoCC trial.
The following patient population set will be defined in this trial for anal yses:
Safety  Anal ysis Set (SAF)
This patient set includes all patients who received at least one stud y treatment in this trial.
Further anal ysis sets will be defined in the trial statistical plan ( TSAP )if necessary .
Important deviations of the protocol will include deviations of the key  inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, concomitant use of restricted medications, and an y other deviations of the 
protocol deemed important by  [CONTACT_2362]. All decisions concerning important proto col 
deviations will be made prior to final database lock (DBL) for this extension trial.
Standard statistical parameters (number of non -missing value s, mean, standard deviation , 
median, quartiles, minimum and maximum) or frequency  tables (including patient 
frequencies and percentages) will be calculated where appropriate.
A Clinical Trial Report (CTR) will be prepa red once the final DBL for this extension trial has 
been performed.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
Refer to Section 7.2.5 for the description of safet y analyses for the primary  endpoint. The 
primary  endpoint will be summarized based on SAF.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_852004] -03(18.0) / Savedon:10Jul20197.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
For binary  endpoints, the efficacy  data will be presented over time based on SAF where an y 
data collected after the use of rescue therap y will be censored and then imputed using the 
Non Response Imputation (NRI)method as described in Section 7.3.
For continuous endpoints, the efficacy  data will be presented over time based on SAF where 
any data collected after the use of rescue therapy  will be censored and then may be handled 
by a mixed effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).
Further, it is also of interest to explore week 12 efficacy  performance of patients who were 
responders , partial responders and non- responders in the 1368- 0052 trial respectivel y as 
defined in Table 3.1: 1 .
Further details will be provided in the TSAP.
7.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded us ing the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events 
with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, (i.e., [ADDRESS_852005] stud y 
treatment) willbe assigned to the on-t reatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. 
Statistic al analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of the first treatment and end of 
the REP of the last treatment. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate 
under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’. Safet y assessments 
including treatment emergent adverse events, laboratories, vital signs etc. based on SAF.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of treatment emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated b y system organ class (SOC) and preferred term after coding according to the 
current versio
n of the MedDRA at DBL. Exposure adjusted incidence rate of all treatment 
emergent adverse events will also be presented.

emergent adverse event is defined as the number of subjects experiencing the adverse event 
per treatment group during time at risk divided by  [CONTACT_577105]  100 (per [ADDRESS_852008] 
year), where:
Time at risk [subject y ears] = (date of onset of TEAE –study  drug start date + 1) / 365.[ADDRESS_852009], the selected treatment emergent adverse event didn’t occur then the time at 
risk will be censored at min (date of death, last contact [CONTACT_577106], drug stop date + 
112 day s, cut -off date if interim anal ysis performed ). For each selected treatment emergent 
AE, the exposure adjusted incidence rate will be calculated as:
Incidence rate [1/[ADDRESS_852010] y ears (pt -yrs)] = 100 * number of subjects with TEAE / 
Total TEAE -specific time at risk [subject y ears].
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitat ively. The lat ter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at baseline, during 
the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to 
possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
Immunogenicit y data will be anal ysed in a desc riptive way .
7.2.6 Other Analyses
Pharmacokinetics
Please refer to Section 5.3.1 and further information available in the TSAP.
Biomarker Anal ysis
The statistical anal ysis for biomarker assessments (cf. Section 5.4) is mainly  descriptive. 
Summary  statistics and summary  plots are produced for each assessment at each time point, 
and for changes from baseline when appropriate. Correlations between biomarkers and 
clinical endpoints may  also be examined descri ptively .For a visual assessment of this 
analysis scatter plots may  be produced.
Changes in the gene expression profile from baseline to post- baseline will be summarized 
and described for selected genes. Significantly  up-or down -regulated genes are repor ted. 
Thresholds for defining significantl y up-and down- regulations will be given in the TSAP .
Further details will be discussed in the TSAP .

In order to ensure the patient’s safet y during the trial, an external DMC, independent of the 
trial and project teams, will be set -up to review all available un -blinded safety  data as well as 
selected efficacy  data at regular intervals following first- patient-in. A DMC Statistical 
Analy sis Plan ,which describes the anal yses required for assessment by  [CONTACT_1363], will be 
produced. Further details will be provided in a DMC charter.
As the primary  aim of this study  is to collect long -term safet y and efficacy dat a on the use of 
spesolimab in this population, multiple interim analy ses may  be done over the two -year 
conduct phase of this trial to support, for example, regulatory  interactions , Clinical Trial 
Application and Marketing Authorisation Application/Biologic s Licencing Application
submissions, but also to provide important safet y and efficacy information to the sponsor to 
guide further development of the compound, and to the investigators via IB updates and 
publications. 
Since patients will be enrolled into this study  over a time period of several weeks and in line 
with the exploratory  nature and open label design of the study , such anal yses will be 
performed on demand and are not feasible to be pre -defined. 
7.[ADDRESS_852012] complete data at all visits. However, missing data will 
still occur and approaches to handle this are proposed below.
For the safet y data, including the primary endpoint, no missing data imputations are planned.
For secondary  binary  effic acy endpoints, a NRI approach will be applied to the missing 
visits; that is, imputing as a failure to achieve a response in the visits with missing endpoint 
score, however:
- If there are visits with available data both before and after the visit with a missing 
outcome, then impute as a success onl y if both the preceding and the following 
measurement indicate success and no rescue medication has been given during this 
period.
- Otherwise, impute as a failure to achieve a respons e (i.e. no response imputa tion).
For secondary  continuous efficacy  endpoints, MMRM method may be applied to handle the 
missing data.
Further anal yses to assess the robustness of the results on efficacy  endpoint will be described 
in the TSAP if necessary .

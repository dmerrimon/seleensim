Background
Mahana™ Tinnitus (MHNA-003) is a Digital Therapeutic (DT x) in development at Mahana
Therapeutics. MHNA-[ADDRESS_530531] on an individual’s life, the
context in which these occur , and the relationship among these factors. Within CBT , data driven
strategies are then employed to systematically target these factors. CBT programs strive to build
adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_420473] (e.g., inactivity, negative self-referential cognitions, ruminations that maintain the
depressive cycle, etc.). Decades of rigorous scientiﬁc evidence demonstrate the e ﬀectiveness of
CBT for treating mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and insomnia, as well as
improving QoL and disease management among patients with chronic medical illnesses1,2.
The e ﬃcacy of internet-based CBT programs for tinnitus is well documented. In a recent
meta-analysis conducted by [CONTACT_420476].,3It was found that internet-based CBT programs
demonstrated a moderate e ﬀect size in reducing tinnitus distress. This e ﬀect was observed in
comparison to both active and inactive control conditions across nine Randomized Controlled
T rials (RCT) involving 1, [ADDRESS_530532]-speci ﬁc feedback and usage data will be collected in order to inform further
development of MHNA-003.
Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]’s open-label, single arm design, study ﬁndings should be interpreted as
signals to explore in future randomized-controlled trials rather than identifying de ﬁnitive clinical
signi ﬁcance.
Study Design
This is a prospective, open-label study of the mobile app MHNA-003.
Between 125 and 250 participants will be enrolled. All enrolled participants will receive
MHNA-003 in addition to their routine care.
Safety and clinical outcomes assessments will be collected bi-weekly for a total of four data
collection timepoints.
A study design schematic is provided in Figure 1 below.

Measures
Primary outcomes are a change from baseline in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and TFI
responder rate at [ADDRESS_530534] satisfy the following criteria before entering the study:
1. Participant scores ≥ [ADDRESS_530535] 18 years of age at the time of consent.
4. Participant resides in the [LOCATION_002].

Intervention
MHNA-003 is an investigational software as a medical device (SaMD) built for mobile usage.
MHNA-003 comprises ﬁve total sessions. Each session includes several lessons which provide
components of cognitive behavioral therapy.
We recommend that participants complete one lesson of MHNA-003 per day. One lesson takes
approximately 10-15 minutes. At the recommended pace the study sessions will take participants
approximately 30 days to complete all lessons. This study protocol includes twelve additional
days (42 total study days) to accommodate unanticipated interruptions to therapy progress.
MHNA-003 is available via a downloadable application for iOS and Android smartphones. Access
to MHNA-003 and technical assistance will be provided to participants at no charge.
MHNA-003 is considered a non-signi ﬁcant risk (NSR) device. The risks associated with using
MHNA-[ADDRESS_530537] deviations (SD), and ranges are assessed for continuous
variables and assessment scores typi[INVESTIGATOR_420475]. Data are presented as mean ±
SD. For categorical data, n’s and percentages are calculated.
Statistical analysis techniques are employed to evaluate changes in patient-reported outcomes
over time. Magnitude and statistical signi ﬁcance for change from baseline are tested using single
factor mixed e ﬀects linear GLS regression modeling. This type of model is able to handle missing
data due to attrition and can also be utilized for complete datasets. The need for random e ﬀects
is tested in all cases using the Hausman comparison5and Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian
multiplier test.6The Breusch-Pagan and Cook-Weisberg test for heteroscedasticity7is also
utilized. Mean, standard error of the mean, and 95% con ﬁdence intervals are calculated for
changes from baseline. Wald chi-square tests assess the signi ﬁcance of changes from baseline
over time.
Six-week responder rates are evaluated utilizing multiple imputation modeling to account for
missing data. Responder rates are imputed in the ITT population utilizing logistic models. Four
baseline factors are included in the imputation model: age, sex, baseline GAD-[ADDRESS_530538] & Weisberg S. Biometrika. 1983;70(1):1-10.6Breusch TS & Pagan AR. Econometrica. 1979;47(5):1287-1294.5Hausman JA. Econometrica. 1978;46:1251-1271.
hypothesized to be related to program adherence. Sensitivity analysis is performed by [CONTACT_420478]. Standard error of the mean and 95% CI are
calculated for the responder rates.

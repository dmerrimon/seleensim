CLINICALTRIALS.GOV INFORMATION  21 
This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] for English -speakers, registered on [ADDRESS_1139743] are unprepared.3,4 Lack of preparation can lead to uninformed choices, receipt of care 27 
inconsistent with personal goals, and lack of patient empowerment during clini cal encounters,5-9 28 
especially for individuals with limited health literacy.10 Conventional preparation, called advance 29 
care planning (ACP), has typi[INVESTIGATOR_822105] -specify preferences for life 30 
prolonging procedures, such as mechanical ventilation, and to document these choices in an 31 
advance direc tive (AD).[ADDRESS_1139744] important component of ACP – ongoing conversations between 35 
patients, their loved ones (surrogates), and clinicians.5,14-[ADDRESS_1139745] experience conducting RCTs among diverse, older adults at the San Francisco 45 
Health Netw ork (SFHN).18 [CONTACT_822151] designed and tested an AD written at a 5th grade 46 
reading level among 205 chronically ill, diverse, older adults from San Francisco General 47 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SFGH) with a 6 -month follow -up of 85%. The AD was preferred over a standard AD, 48 
with significant interactions for limited literacy (e.g., higher preference rates in patients with 49 
limited literacy). It also resulted in greater 6 -month AD completion rates (15% vs. 7%, p =.03), 50 
doubling the rates from baseline. This AD has been adopted as the official AD for SFGH and is 51 
being disseminated in [LOCATION_004]. It will serve as the active control.  52 
We designed and tested an informed consent process for diverse, older adults with 53 
limited literacy .19 We found t hat many patients do not understand simplified consent 54 
information and were unsure how to ask questions. But, informed decisions can be improved by 55 
providing both easy -to-read materials and a teach -back method. We will use this interactive 56 
consent method f or this study.  57 
Multiple steps of the ACP process :[ADDRESS_1139746] patients go through a series of ACP 58 
behavior al steps. Six months after exposure to the easy -to-read AD, 61% of older adults 59 
contemplated ACP, 56% discussed ACP with family or friends and 22% with clinicians, and 13% 60 
completed an AD. This work shows that measuring a full range of ACP outcomes, in add ition to 61 
ADs, and associated behavior change steps (contemplation to action) is important and informs 62 
our study outcomes. Previously described barriers to ACP, such as not wanting to burden 63 
family,21 are addressed in PREPARE.  64 
Evidence supporting the new ACP paradigm and content of PREPARE :22 We completed 13 65 
focus groups with 69 diverse, English - and Spanish -speaking older patients (mean age 78 +/ - 8, 66 
 
 7 61% non - White) and surrogates (mean age 57 +/ - 10, 91% non -White) from safety -net settings [ADDRESS_1139747] prepared them for decision making. Qualitative analysis identified 5  overarching 69 
themes, beyond ADs, that prepared patients and surrogates for decision making: (1) choose 70 
surrogates wisely and verify they know their role, (2) identify goals based on past experiences 71 
and personal values, (3) decide whether to grant leeway i n surrogate decision making, (4) 72 
inform other family and friends of one’s wishes to prevent conflict, and (5) ask clinicians [ADDRESS_1139748] been incorporated as educational domains of PREPARE.  74 
Validity and reliability of the survey to measure  ACP engagement:  Surveys were designed 75 
with input from Co -Is and extensive cognitive interviews to measure discrete ACP actions (i.e., 76 
main outcomes: ACP discussions, AD completion,) and ACP behavior change (e.g., 77 
contemplation, self -efficacy, readiness). We recruited 50 older adults, aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 78 
illnesses (32% female, 42% non -White). Internal consistency [ADDRESS_1139749] reliability, and 79 
discriminant validity (scores compared to healthy young adults – 50% female, 75% non -White) 80 
was high. Scor es did not differ by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity or literacy, p>.05. We will also use validated 81 
surveys on ACP attitudes and methods to classify patients into behavior change categories.23,24 82 
Preliminary evidence that PREPARE is beneficial . In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],25 we recruited 43 diverse, 83 
older adults from low -income senior cen ters. All subjects rated PREPARE easy to use (mean 84 
9/10-point scale). Pre to post ACP behavior change scores from our validated surveys (0 -124 85 
points) increased from 72 ± 33 SD to 87 ± 22, a [ADDRESS_1139750] PREPARE within safety -net settings.   93

OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL DESIGN  95 
Study overview:  [ADDRESS_1139751] waiver to identify individuals who meet our 100  
inclusion/exclusion criteria and have upcoming primary care appointments.  Administrative data 101  
and chart review are used to determine potenti ally eligible patients.  102  
 103  
Then primary care clinicians’ permission is obtained to allow the study team to inform their 104  
patients about the study. Patients are then recruited, screened for eligibility, and scheduled for a 105  
baseline interview before an upcoming  primary care appointment. To standardize the timing of 106  
exposure to the intervention and primary care follow -up, study participants are scheduled for 107  
baseline procedures 1 -3 weeks prior to an upcoming primary care appointment.26 108  
 109  
Next, informed consent is obtained, and those patients who provide consent are randomized to 110  
the PREPARE intervention arm (i.e., the PREPARE website with action plan exercises plus an 111  
easy -to-read advance directive plus PREPARE materials to take home, which include a website 112  
login, and a PREPARE pamphlet, booklet, and DVD) or the control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read 113  
advance directive alone). See a full description of the intervention below.  [ADDRESS_1139752] blinded outcome 117  
ascertainment using patient surveys at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the primary care 118  
appointment. We are choosing an active control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read advance directive) [ADDRESS_1139753] of care, even if it is not often “usual” care in clinical practice.8 In 121  
addition, the easy -to-read advance directive used in this study has been adopted by [CONTACT_822115] 122  
Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and San Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SFGH) and is available 123  
in the primary care clinics.  124  
 125  
Research Aims and Study Hypotheses:  126  
The aims of this study are to (1) To determine the efficacy of PREPARE to engage diverse, 127  
English - and Spanish -speaking older adults with chronic ill ness in advance care planning (ACP) 128  
compared to controls (AD only) and (2) To determine whether PREPARE efficacy varies by 129  
race/ethnicity, literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patient’s desired role in [ADDRESS_1139754], than an easy -to-read advance 135  
directive alone in elderly populations with chronic illness.  136  
 137  
Our secondary hypotheses are t hat, compared to an advance directive alone, PREPARE will 138  
result in more engagement in behavior change processes concerning ACP, including increased 139  
self-efficacy and readiness, as well as greater engagement in a full range of ACP actions, 140  
including discus sions with surrogate decision makers and other trusted family and friends. 141  
 
 10 Secondary outcomes will be ascertained using validated surveys.23,27,28 We also hypothesize 142  
that PREPARE will result in improved satisfaction with patient -doctor communication and 143  
informed medical decision making and that PREPARE efficacy may vary across moderator 144  
variables such as  patient health literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patients’ 145  
desired role in decision making.  146  
 147  
 148  
STUDY SETTING  149  
Recruitment for this randomized trial is occurring in 4 separate primary care clinics associated 150  
with the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and the San Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 151  
(SFGH) in San Francisco, [LOCATION_004]. These 4 clinics are housed in 3 separate physical 152  
locations in San Francisco. SFGH is an urban, public hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329697], with the SFHN, serves 153  
racially and ethnically d iverse, low -income and indigent patients; 30% of patients are Spanish - 154  
speaking.18  155  
 156  
PARTICIPANTS AND ELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  157  
There  are no inclusion  or exclusion  criteria  based  on gender,  race or ethnicity . We assess 158  
eligibility in person. Older adults are included in this study if they self -report speaking English or 159  
Spanish “well” or “very well”; are 55 years of age or older; have ≥ 2 chronic illnesses determined 160  
by [CONTACT_14716]; have seen a primary care clinician (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician 161  
assistant) at SFHN/SFGH -affiliated primary care clinics ≥ [ADDRESS_1139755] year (an indication 162  
of established primary care); and have had ≥ [ADDRESS_1139756] 163  
year (an indication of severity of illness). Their primary care clinician must also give us [ADDRESS_1139757] them to tell them about the study.  165  
 166  
 
 11 We are recruiting patients ≥ 55 years of age (rather than ≥ 65) because adults in safety net 167  
settings exper ience accelerated aging, functional decline, and sequelae of chronic disease, 168  
necessitating decision making and ACP at a younger age than patients with higher 169  
socioeconomic status.29,30 The goal is to start ACP early to change the trajectory of decision 170  
making and care over the course of ill ness. Our inclusion criteria of ≥ 2 primary care visits and ≥ [ADDRESS_1139758] documentation of being deaf, blind, having dementia, or being psychotic or are deemed  177  
by [CONTACT_822116]. Through in -person or phone 178  
screening by [CONTACT_464], patients are also excluded if they self -report vision too poor to read a 179  
newspaper, lack of a phone (needed for follow -up intervie ws and scheduling), or plans to be out 180  
of the country for ≥ 3 months; if they screen positive for moderate -to-severe cognitive 181  
impairment using the validated Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire followed by [CONTACT_11605] - 182  
Cog,31-33 or self -report or are determined by [CONTACT_822117], deaf, intoxicated or actively 183  
psychotic. Because ACP is an iterative process and people may change their preferences over 184  
time,11,34 subjects with prior ACP experiences (e.g., an advance directive) are not excluded.  185  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

 13 RECRUITMENT METHODS  187  
Data Extraction:  [ADDRESS_1139759] 189  
waiver to access patients’ names, age, primary language, phone numbers, addresses, medical [ADDRESS_1139760] year, and the name [CONTACT_822149]’ outpatient primary care providers. From these [ADDRESS_1139761] Patients:  200  
Upon completion of the administrative data pulls, providers from all recruitment sites are sent a 201  
letter/e -mail informing them about the research study and asking them to review a list of their 202  
patients, to  refer patient(s) on their patient list who would be appropriate for the study, and to [ADDRESS_1139762] their patients to tell them more about the study. Clinicians are also 204  
informed that if the study team receives their approval, their eligibl e participants will receive a 205  
letter describing the research study and offering them the opportunity to decline to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 206  
by [CONTACT_822119]/or will be contact[CONTACT_822120]. Additionally, clinicians are informed that [ADDRESS_1139763] them by [CONTACT_3476] 208  
(including by [CONTACT_6968], phone, and/or in -person), we will assume assent to contact [CONTACT_75054] 209  
and a letter describing the study will be sent to patients on behalf of the study team. We obtain 210  
permission from all of the Service Chiefs before their clinicians are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  211  
 212  
 
 14 Recruitment Methods and Materials:  213  
Study -related fliers written at a 5th-grade reading level in English and Spanish are posted in 214  
approved areas in SFHN/SFGH -affiliated primary  care clinics. Because many patients may be [ADDRESS_1139764] identify patients with upcoming primary care appointments and are used 229  
to target patient recruitment efforts. Potential participants are then contact[CONTACT_822121].  230  
 231  
Patients who consent and enroll are paid $25 for a screening inte rview and $25 for a baseline 232  
interview as well as given a $10 taxi voucher to come back to follow -up interviews in person if 233  
they desire.  Participants are also reimbursed $[ADDRESS_1139765] 238  
 
 15 experience with diverse populations and individuals who are bilingu al (native Spanish -speaking) [ADDRESS_1139766] extensive sensitivity training with all research staff and 240  
require staff to use approved study scripts when speaking to patients. These study scripts and 241  
all study materials used for recr uitment are vetted, updated and approved by [CONTACT_822122] 242  
advisory and clinical advisory boards. All materials and study scripts are written at a 5th grade 243  
reading level and are provided to patients in their preferred language (i.e., English or Spanish) . 244  
 245  
CONSENT PROCEDURES  246  
We use a modified consent process that several co -authors designed for vulnerable 247  
populations.19,26 Consent forms written at the 5th grade reading level are provided and read to 248  
participants in English or Spanish. This review is then followed by [CONTACT_233901] “teach -to-goal” 249  
questions to ensure understanding. If potential participants cannot correctly complete the teach - 250  
back process aft er 3 attempts, the patient is deemed ineligible.  251  
 252  
The consent form has been approved by [CONTACT_822123], the 253  
patient/clinical advisory board, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The consent 254  
form states the follow ing for the purpose of the study: “Why is this study being done? [ADDRESS_1139767] important to them in their life. It will also help prepare patients to make 258  
medical decisions.” We use the word “handout” because, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], both groups are given 259  
handout materials and written advance directives. For randomiz ation we explain, “We will ask [ADDRESS_1139768] a 262  
50/50 chance of being in either group.”  263  
 264  
 
 16 INTERVENTION AND COMPARISON CONDITIONS  265  
PREPARE arm  266  
As previously described, PREPARE is an easy -to-use, patient -centered, interactive website that 267  
is available in English or Spanish, is written at a 5th grade reading level, includes voice -overs of 268  
all tex t for the reading -impaired and closed -captioning of all videos for the hearing impaired 269  
(www.prepareforyourcare.org ).25,26 The conceptual framework for PREPARE has been 270  
previously published and is based based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory, 38,39 with 271  
elements from the Health Belief Model,40 the Theory of Planned Behavior,41 and Behavior 272  
Change Theory.39,42 In these theories and in behavioral studies, modeling of behaviors helps 273  
people change their behavior. Successful behavi oral change interventions model skills, enhance 274  
self-efficacy, and address perceived barriers,43,44 especially literacy -appropriate interventions.18 275  
Modeling behaviors (as in PREPARE) can also improve patients’ ability to communicate with [ADDRESS_1139769] and functional status.43,48 -50  PREPARE incorporates these successful 279  
teaching methods through the modeling of behaviors in videos. Video and interactive websites 280  
are more powerful mediums to teach information and change behavior than written mat erials, 281  
especially for those with language/literacy barriers.51-57 PREPARE includes a training and goal 282  
setting component which has been shown to be effective in changing outpatient behaviors, such 283  
as exercise.58  284  
 285  
In the  design of the PREPARE website, we included essential, theory -based health education 286  
strategies, such as the use of video modeling of ACP behaviors and tailored and interactive 287  
content based on patients’ values and decision preferences. To ensure PREPARE i s easy to 288  
read and understand, we use clear health communication principles (e.g., targeting text to the 289  
5th grade reading level) informed by [CONTACT_822124] 290  
 
 17 with the target population (i.e., racially and ethnically diverse older adults with limited health 291  
literacy and English proficiency) to ensure PREPARE content is acceptable to individuals from [ADDRESS_1139770] been shown to help patients engage in 297  
other preventative and disease management activities in the outpatient setting.59  298  
 299  
After the baseline interview, participants in the PREPARE arm review all 5 steps of the 300  
PREPARE website in English or Spanish in our research offices. Participants are asked to 301  
review PREPARE on their own and in its ent irety. Research assistants are available to answer 302  
questions only if needed, but do not go through the website with the participants. At the end of 303  
the program, a summary of the patient’s medical wishes and action plan are automatically 304  
generated from the PREPARE website in written format. This information along with the 305  
participant’s PREPARE website login information is included in a take -home folder that also [ADDRESS_1139771] 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes in research offices, and then to take 311  
the form home to discuss with their potential surrogates and/or their c linicians. The time frame [ADDRESS_1139772] 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes, and to take t he form home to discuss with 320  
their potential surrogates and clinicians.  321  
 322  
Both arms: Reminder of primary care appointments  323  
One to 3 days before the patient’s next scheduled primary care appointment, research staff call 324  
the PREPARE arm participants to remin d them to bring in their study materials (i.e., action plan 325  
and advance directive) and to talk to their clinician about ACP. For the control arm, research 326  
staff members only remind patients about their upcoming appointment and do not provide 327  
additional enc ouragement about ACP.  328  
RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  329  
A statistician not involved in recruitment or data collection uses a computer -based random 330  
number generator to create a randomization scheme using block randomization by [CONTACT_132544] 331  
literacy (adequate health literacy versus limited health literacy, as determined  by a validated 332  
question concerning confidence with medical forms) and race/ethnicity (non -white versus 333  
white).61 Random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 are used to ensure an equal number of patients with 334  
limited health literacy in each group. Randomization information is associated with a unique 335  
patient identification number and is kept separate from other patient data. Due to the need to 336  
secure interview rooms for the duration of the baseline questionnaire and intervention (i.e., 337  
approximately 2 hours for the AD -only arm and 3 hours for the PREPARE arm), randomization 338  
occurred prior to scheduling a baseline interview.  339  
 340  
BLINDING  341  
 
 19 Clinicians are bl inded to patient group assignment. Although we obtain clinicians’ permission to 342  
recruit their patients, the interventions are not described, and no clinician education is provided. 343  
Participants could not be blinded to the intervention; however, they are to ld during consent there 344  
is a “50/50 chance” of getting one of two different ACP guides, and the non -assigned [ADDRESS_1139773] items. In addition, a 10% ra ndom sample of all interviews is observed by [CONTACT_822125] [ADDRESS_1139774] protected 365  
firewalls on UCSF servers, not on individual laptops or desktops. All patients are given a unique, 366  
non-identifying patient identification number that is removed from any personally identifying 367  
 
 20 information (PII) or personal he alth information (PHI). All PII and PHI are stored in a Microsoft [ADDRESS_1139775] protected firewalls on UCSF and SFGH 369  
servers. All paper files are stored in secure, locked research offices in secure, locked file 370  
cabinets.  371  
 372  
FOLLOW -UP AND RETENTION:  [ADDRESS_1139776] follow -up interviews one week and 3, 6, and 12 -months after the primary care visit 374  
in the clinic, by [CONTACT_648]. We utilize several measures to help ensure follow -up. Each follow -up 375  
interview takes between 30 to 45 minutes and participants are reimbursed $25.  [ADDRESS_1139777] for follow -up surveys:  378  
Upon enrollment, we ask participants to provide alternative phone numbers (e.g., cell or work 379  
numbers) and one to three additional phone numbers of close contacts who may know how to [ADDRESS_1139778] patients during scheduled clinic visits.  386  
 387  
Reminders for the primary care visit:  388  
Participan ts receive a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their next primary care visit. 389  
Participants in the AD -only arm are reminded to come to their scheduled appointment while 390  
participants in the PREPARE arm are reminded of their appointment and to bring th e PREPARE 391  
materials to the visit.  392  
 393  
 
 21 Reminders for study interviews:  394  
For all follow -up interviews, participants in both arms receive reminders of their upcoming study 395  
interview by [CONTACT_48052].  396  
 397  
Ascertaining reasons for loss of follow -up or withdrawal: For participants who want to [ADDRESS_1139779] of reasons we obtained from prior advance care planning t rials, such as 400  
the study is too long, they are too busy, the study topic is too upsetting, they are too ill, etc.62  401  
 402  
 403  
MEASURES  404  
Overview  405  
Because ACP ideally is a process that occurs over time, we felt it important to measure a full 406  
range of ACP measures including ACP documentation (primary outcome) over time, and 407  
several behavior change constructs and several additional ACP actions over a 1 2-month period 408  
(secondary outcomes). The main outcome measures are described in detail below.  409  
 410  
Primary Outcome  411  
The primary outcome is documentation of ACP wishes in the SFHN/SFGH medical record. ACP 412  
documentation for the purposes of this study includes the  easy -to-read advance directive or 413  
other valid advance directives or living wills, a durable power of attorney for health care 414  
document (DPOAHC), a Physicians Orders of Life Sustaining Treatment form, or other 415  
documentation of discussions concerning patien ts’ wishes for medical care (i.e., documentation 416  
of oral directives by a physician or notes describing patients’ goals for medical care by 417  
clinicians).  [ADDRESS_1139780] engaged in ACP prior to seeing their primary care provider. The patient - 424  
reported outcomes in the follow -up surveys (1 week, 3, 6, and 12 -months), however, are timed 425  
to the primary care visit because those questions concern engage ment in discussions with 426  
clinicians (see secondary outcomes below).  [ADDRESS_1139781] medical care, we  429  
created a composite variable of any ACP documentation (forms  and/or discussions); we also 430  
plan to re port the percentage of forms and discussions separately. All medical review data is 431  
double coded by 2 independent, blinded  research assistants. Discrepancies are adjudicated by 432  
the principal investigator (R.L.S.).  433  
 434  
Secondary Outcomes  435  
Main Patient -Reported Outcome  436  
The main patient -reported secondary outcome, the validated Advance Care Planning 437  
Engagement Survey,25-27 was chosen to measure the full process of ACP. The Advance Care 438  
Planning Engagement Survey measures both ACP Behavior Change Processes,  such as 439  
knowledge, contemplation, self -efficacy, and readiness on a validated 57 -item scale. The ACP 440  
Behavior Change Process scale is measured on a 5 -point Likert scale and average 5 -point 441  
scores will be calculated. We will also measure ACP actions on the  validated 25 -item Action 442  
scale,  which assesses ACP activities (yes or no) such as identifying a surrogate decision maker, [ADDRESS_1139782] in surrogate decision 444  
making, discussing one’s wishes wit h clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one’s wishes  445  
 
 23 in an advance directive.  Validity and reliability of the ACP Engagement Survey, as well as the 446  
questionnaire’s ability to detect change in response to an ACP intervention, have been 447

Feasibility and Satisfaction  450  
To evaluate whether and how PREPARE will be used in clinical practice and in the community, 451  
we also assess accep tability of the PREPARE website compared to an advance directive alone 452  
using validated scales of ease -of-use (10 -point scale, “ On a scale of [ADDRESS_1139783] and 10 being very easy, how easy was it to use this guide?” ) and satisfaction (comf ort: 454  
“How comfortable were you viewing this guide?”, helpfulness: “How helpful was this guide?”, 455  
and recommendations: “How likely are you to recommend this guide to others?” assessed on a 456  
5-point Likert scale (not -at-all to extremely) from our prior work.18 For the PREPARE arm only, 457  
and at the end of the 12 -month interview and after unblinding, we also ask how likely patients 458  
are to recommend the PR EPARE intervention to others.63 459  
 460  
Adverse Event Outcomes  461  
In addition, to ensure that the PREPARE program does not cause undue harm, we also assess 462  
both depression64,65 and anxiety.66,67  We administer the Patient  Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -4 463  
at baseline and at each follow -up interview.68 The PHQ -4 includes the PHQ -2 for depression 464  
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) -2 anxiety screening tool. A score of 3 or greater on 465  
a 0 to 6 scale suggests possible depre ssion or anxiety.  466  
 467  
Potential Mediating or Moderating Variables & Participant Characteristics  468  
Based on the previously published conceptual framework of PREPARE,25 we also hypothesize 469  
that PREPARE eff icacy may vary across several moderator or mediator variables (e.g., health [ADDRESS_1139784] of Functional Health Literacy in Adults s -TOFHLA, 471  
 
 24 scores 0 -3669 and dichotomized to limited = 0 -22 & adequate = 23 -36, and patient’s desired role 472  
in decision making with the medical provider using the validated Decision Control Preferences 473  
Scale (i.e., wants to make their own decision versus wants doctors/family to make decisions for 474  
them).70 We also hypothesize that PREPARE efficacy may be affected by [CONTACT_822126] 475  
variables (e.g., self -rated health, “How would you rate your health?” (5 -point Likert)71,[ADDRESS_1139785] pat ient-clinician 479  
communication,73,74 such as age (“What is your date of birth?”), self -reported gender (“What 480  
gender do you consider yourself to be? male, female transgender, other”), finances (able to 481  
make ends meet versus not make ends meet), having a potential surrogate decision maker or 482  
not, education (“What is the highest educational level you have completed? ” less than or equal 483  
to high school or greater than high school), internet access in the home (yes or no), and 484  
religiosity and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824] (i.e., “How religious/spi[INVESTIGATOR_822106]?” on 5 - 485  
point Likert scale from not -at-all to extremel y).  [ADDRESS_1139786] to 5 490  
ACP Actions (yes/no and a 0 -25-point scale) and Be havior Change Process scores (average 5 - 491  
point Likert scores) from baseline to [ADDRESS_1139787] summary statistics. Baseline 493  
comparability will be assessed betwe en groups using unpaired t -tests, Chi -square tests or 494  
Fisher’s exact tests. We will use intention -to-treat analysis using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 495  
Inc.) and STATA 15.0 (College Station, TX). All p -values will be 2 -tailed and set at .05 for the 496  
primar y outcome. To compare outcomes between the two arms longitudinally, we will use mixed 497  
 
 25 effects linear, Poisson, or negative binomial regression for continuous measures and mixed 498  
effects logistic regression for dichotomous measures. The mixed effects models will include 499  
fixed effects for the primary modeling terms of time (baseline and 12 months for ACP 500  
documentation and baseline and 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for ACP 501  
Engagement with time modeled using dummy variables to allow for non -linearity ); arm (AD-only 502  
versus PREPARE); an interaction term of study arm and time; and a random effect for subjects. [ADDRESS_1139788] for interactions by [CONTACT_822127] 508  
time variable for health literacy (limited versus ad equate) controlling for prior ACP 509  
documentation and clustering effects by [CONTACT_30223]. All other interaction terms are adjusted for 510  
health literacy (randomization blocking variable) prior ACP documentation and clustering effects 511  
by [CONTACT_30223]. Additional inte raction terms to be added to the group by [CONTACT_822128] 512  
decision control preferences for making decisions (i.e., makes own decisions versus doctor 513  
makes decisions), age (i.e., < 65 years versus 65 years of age), sex/gender (i.e., self -reported 514  
man versus woman), race/ethnicity (i.e., white versus non -white), health status (i.e., good -to- 515  
excellent versus fair -to-poor), presence of a potential surrogate (i.e., yes versus no), and 516  
internet access at home (i.e., yes versus no). For Spanish -speakers, we  will also asses patient - 517  
clinician language (concordance vs. discordance). A p -value for interaction <0.05 is considered 518  
significant.    519  
 520  
Missing data for the primary outcome will be assessed. If there is 10% or more of missing data, [ADDRESS_1139789] -intervention time point (e.g., 12 months ). A recent meta - [ADDRESS_1139790] size 531  
of 0.50 (95% CI; 0.17 -0.83),[ADDRESS_1139791] of an easy -to-read AD at SFGH 533  
which showed an increased AD completion rate from 7% to 15%.[ADDRESS_1139792] an advance directive completion rate of ≤ 15%. Based on prior studies, we [ADDRESS_1139793] size of 0.5 (two -fold increase) above 15%. A sample of 350, (175 per arm), will [ADDRESS_1139794] us 92% power (2 -tailed alpha of 0.05) to detect a difference of advance directive 539  
completion rates of 15% in control s vs. 30% in the PREPARE arm and 80% power to detect a 540  
difference of 15% vs. 27%. Power is also expected to be strong for the ACP behavioral change 541  
scale outcomes (preliminary data demonstrated a pre -to-post improvement of 0.5 SD).[ADDRESS_1139795] 85% to 98% [ADDRESS_1139796] a 15% drop out rate at 12 months based on our prior randomized, controlled trial at 545  
SFGH,18 and will therefore attempt to recruit 402 patients, or 201 in each arm for each language 546  
(English and Spanish) for a total recruitment of [ADDRESS_1139797] clinically important interactions based 549  
on potential moderators (literacy, control preferences, language concordance) for our outcomes. 550  
In a prior trial of an easy -to-read advance dir ective in the same patient population with only 200 551  
patients, we found significant interactions for literacy.8 Thus, if we consider the power scenario 552  
of the control group ACP documentation rate of 15% and the PREPARE group of 28%, and 553  
suppose the control group rate is the same (15%) for both levels of the moderating factor, then 554  
for a moderating factor split of 1:1, we would have 80% power to detect an interaction. If the 555  
PREPARE arm ACP documentation rate is 18% for one level of the factor and 40% for the  556  
other, this corresponds to a relative rate of ACP documentation of 2.2 times as high for one 557  
level of the factor compared to the other. A 2:[ADDRESS_1139798] 559  
interactions will likely be stronger for continuous outcomes (e.g. engagement/behavioral scales).  560

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  1051  
Background  1052  
The population is aging,1,2 and the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing, especially 1053  
among underserved and vulnerable populations (i.e., econom ically disadvantaged, racial and 1054  
ethnic minorities, the uninsured, etc.).[ADDRESS_1139844] of chronic and serious disease 1055  
management is advance care planning (ACP), a process whereby [CONTACT_822131] [ADDRESS_1139845] are written with complex, legal  language.4 This lack of attention to limited 1058  
health literacy and limited English proficiency may e xplain why advance directives are often not 1059  
completed and may explain, in part, why less than 20% of racially and ethnically diverse, older 1060  
adults engage in advance care planning (ACP) by [CONTACT_5014] -of-life.5-[ADDRESS_1139846] non -autonomous 1065  
views on decision making (i.e., prefer that family and doctors make me dical decisions for 1066  
 
 49 them).9,12-16 Hispanics/Latinos a ccount  for 15% of the U.S. population, a proportion projected to 1067  
grow to 30% by 2050.1,2 Spanish -speaking patients face significant communication barriers, and 1068  
literacy - and language -appropriate ACP tools that address unique aspects of Latino culture 1069  
(e.g., familismo or a strong commitment and orientation to the family) are  lacking.[ADDRESS_1139847] and can understand.8,23 1076  
 1077  
To address these gaps in advance care planning and shortcomings of advance directives, we 1078  
developed a novel, comprehensive paradigm of ACP focused on preparing patients to identify 1079  
their wishes, co mmunicate with surrogate decision makers and clinicians, and make complex, 1080  
decisions over the course of chronic and serious illness.24 This approach recognizes patients’ 1081  
wishes change based on chang ing clinical contexts and that advance directives are but one tool 1082  
to be used to inform in -the-moment decision making.25,26 To address the gaps in advance care 1083  
planning for racially and ethnically diverse older adults, and based on the new comprehensive 1084  
ACP paradigm, we creat ed the interactive, patient -centered PREPARE website 1085  
(prepareforyourcare.org) in English and Spanish that is culturally, linguistically, and literacy - [ADDRESS_1139848] experience conducting RCTs among diverse, older adults at the San Francisco 1094  
Health Network ( SFHN ) primary care clinics .8 [CONTACT_822151] designed and tested an AD written 1095  
at a 5th grade reading level among 205 chronically ill, diverse, older adults from Zuckerberg San 1096  
Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ZSFG)  with a 6 -month follow -up of 85%. The AD was preferred [ADDRESS_1139849] AD, with significant interactions  for limited literacy  (e.g., higher preference rates 1098  
in patients with limited literacy) . It also resulted in greater 6 -month AD completion rates (15% vs . 1099  
7%, p =.03), doubling the rates from baseline. This AD has been adopted as the official AD for 1100  
ZSFG  and is being disseminated in [LOCATION_004]. It will serve as the active control.  1101  
We designed and tested an informed consent process for diverse, older adults  with 1102  
limited literacy .29 We found that many patients do not understan d simplified consent 1103  
information and were unsure how to ask questions. But, informed decisions can be improved by 1104  
providing both easy -to-read materials and a teach -back method. We will use this interactive 1105  
consent method for this study.  1106  
Multiple steps of t he ACP process :[ADDRESS_1139850] patients go through a series of ACP 1107  
behavioral steps. Six months after exposure to the easy -to-read AD, 61% of older adults 1108  
contemplated ACP, 56% discussed ACP with family or friends and  22% with clinicians, and 13% 1109  
completed an AD. This work shows that measuring a full range of ACP outcomes, in addition to 1110  
ADs, and associated behavior change steps (contemplation to action) is important and informs 1111  
our study outcomes. Previously described  barriers to ACP, such as not wanting to burden 1112  
family,31 are addressed in PREPARE.  1113  
Evidenc e supporting the new ACP paradigm and content of PREPARE :32 We com pleted 13 1114  
focus groups with 69 diverse, English - and Spanish -speaking older patients (mean age 78 +/ - 8, 1115  
61% non - White) and surrogates (mean age 57 +/ - 10, 91% non -White) from safety -net settings [ADDRESS_1139851] prepared them for decision making. Qualitative analysis identified 5 overarching 1118  
themes, beyond ADs, that prepared patients and surrogates for decision making: (1) choose 1119  
surrogates wisely and verify they know their role, (2) identify goals based on past experiences 1120  
and personal values, (3) decide whether to grant leeway in surrogate decision making, (4) 1121  
inform other family and friends of one’s wishes to prevent conflict, and (5) ask clinicians [ADDRESS_1139852] been incorporated as educational domains of PREPARE.  1123  
Validity and reliability of the survey to measure ACP engagement:  Surveys were designed 1124  
with input from Co -Is and extensive cognitive interviews to measure discrete ACP actions (i.e., 1125  
main ou tcomes: ACP discussions, AD completion,) and ACP behavior change (e.g., 1126  
contemplation, self -efficacy, readiness). We recruited 50 older adults, aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 1127  
illnesses (32% female, 42% non -White). Internal consistency [ADDRESS_1139853] reliabili ty, and 1128  
discriminant validity (scores compared to healthy young adults – 50% female, 75% non -White) 1129  
was high . Scores did not differ by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity or literacy, p>.05. We will also use validated 1130  
surveys on ACP attitudes and methods to classify patients i nto behavior change categories.33,34 1131  
Preliminary evidence that PREPARE is beneficial . In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],27 we recruited 4 3 diverse, 1132  
older adults from low -income senior centers. All subjects rated PREPARE easy to use (mean 1133  
9/10-point scale). Pre to post ACP behavior change scores from our validated surveys (0 -124 1134  
points) increased from 72 ± 33 SD to 87 ± 22, a [ADDRESS_1139854] PREPARE within safety -net settings.   1142  
PREPARE has been shown to increase ACP Documentation and Engagement among 1143  
Veterans.  A prior trial of PREPARE was conducted among 414 Veterans.35 The mean age of 1144  
the cohort was 71.1 (7.8) years, 91% were men, 57% were white, 20% had limited literacy, 29% 1145  
reported fair -to-poor health status, and 51% had evidence of prior ACP documentation. The 1146  
follow -up time point was 6 months and there wa s a 90% retention rate. There were no 1147  
differences in demographic characteristics between study arms. In this VA population, advance 1148  
care planning documentation 6 months after enrollment was higher in the PREPARE  arm vs the 1149  
AD-alone arm (adjusted 35%vs 25%;  odds ratio, 1.61 [95%CI, 1.03 -2.51]; P = .04).  PREPARE 1150  
also resulted in higher self -reported ACP engagement at each follow -up, including  higher 1151  
process and action scores; P <.001 at each follow -up). These findings add further evidence of 1152  
the validity of P REPARE. However, PREPARE has never been tested among diverse, English - 1153  
and Spanish -speaking older adults in a safety -net setting.  1154  
 1155  
OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL DESIGN  1156  
Study overview:  [ADDRESS_1139855] waiver to identify individuals who me et our 1161  
inclusion/exclusion criteria and ha ve upcoming primary care appointments.  Administrative data 1162  
and chart review are used to determine potentially eligible patients (Figure, Study Flow Chart).  1163  
 1164  
 
 53 Then primary care clinicians’ permission is obtained to allow the study team to inform their 1165  
patient s about the study. Patients are then recruited, screened for eligibility and scheduled for a 1166  
baseline interview before an upcoming primary care appointment. To standardize the timing of 1167  
exposure to the intervention and primary care follow -up, study partici pants are scheduled for 1168  
baseline procedures 1 -3 weeks prior to an upcoming primary care appointment.28 1169  
 1170  
Next, informed consent is obtained, and those patients who provide consent are randomized to 1171  
the PREPARE intervention arm (i.e., the PREPARE website with action plan exercises plus an 1172  
easy -to-read advance directive plus PREPARE materials to take home, whi ch include a website 1173  
login, and a PREPARE pamphlet, booklet, and DVD) or the control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read 1174  
advanc e directive alone). See Study Flow Figure and a full description of the intervention below.  [ADDRESS_1139856] blinded outcome 1178  
ascertainment using patient surveys at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the primary care 1179  
appointment. We are choosing an active control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read advance directive) [ADDRESS_1139857] of care, even if it is not often “usual” care in clinical practice .8 In 1182  
addition, the easy -to-read advance directive used in this study has been adopted by  [CONTACT_822115] 1183  
Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ZSFG) and 1184  
is available in the primary care clinics.  1185  
 1186  
Research Aims and Study Hy potheses:  1187  
The aims of this study are to (1) To determine the efficacy of PREPARE to engage diverse, 1188  
English - and Spanish -speaking older adults with chronic illness in advance care planning (ACP) 1189  
compared to controls (AD only) and (2) To determine whether P REPARE efficacy varies by 1190  
 
 54 race/ethnicity, literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patient’s desired role in [ADDRESS_1139858], than an easy -to-read advance 1196  
directive alone in elderly populations with chronic illness.  1197  
 1198  
Our secondary hypotheses are t hat, compared to an advance directive alone, PREPARE will 1199  
result in more engagement in behavior change processes concerning ACP, including increased 1200  
self-efficacy and readiness, as well as greater engagement in a full range of ACP actions, 1201  
including discus sions with surrogate decision makers and other trusted family and friends. 1202  
Secondary outcomes will be ascertained using validated surveys.33,37,38 We also hypothesize 1203  
that PREPARE will result in improved satisfaction with patient -doctor communication and 1204  
informed medical decision making and that PREPARE efficacy may vary across moderator 1205  
variables such as patient health literacy, clinician -patient l anguage concordance, and patients’ 1206  
desired role in decision making.  1207

 56 STUDY SETTING  1216  
Recruitment for this randomized trial is occurring in 4 separate primary care clinics associated 1217  
with the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and the Zuckerberg San Francisco General 1218  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Z SFG) in San Francisco, [LOCATION_004]. These 4 clinics are housed in 3 separate physical 1219  
locations in San Francisco. ZSFG is an urban, public hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329697], with the SFHN, serves 1220  
racially and ethnically diver se, low -income and indigent patients; 30% of patients are Spanish - 1221  
speaking.8  1222  
 1223  
PARTICIPANTS AND ELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  1224  
There  are no inclusion  or exclusion  criteria  based  on gender,  race or ethnicity . We assess 1225  
eligibility in person or over the phone. Older adults are incl uded in this study if they self -report 1226  
speaking English or Spanish “well” or “very well”; are 55 years of age or older; have ≥ 2 chronic 1227  
illnesses determined by [CONTACT_14716]; have seen a primary care clinician (physician, nurse 1228  
practitioner, or physician assistant) at ZSFG/SFHN -affiliated primary care clinics ≥ [ADDRESS_1139860] year (an indication of established p rimary care); and have had ≥ [ADDRESS_1139861] year (an indication of severity of illness). Their primary care clinician [ADDRESS_1139862] them to tel l them about the study .  1232  
 1233  
We are recruit ing patients ≥ 55 years of age (rather than ≥ 65) because adults in safety net 1234  
settings experience accelerated aging, functional decline, and sequelae of chronic disease, 1235  
necessitating decision making and ACP at a younger age than patients with higher 1236  
socioecono mic status.39,40 The goal is to start ACP early to change the trajectory of decision 1237  
making and care over the course of illness. Our inclusion criteria of ≥ 2 primary care visits and ≥ [ADDRESS_1139863] 3 months determined by [CONTACT_347782], self -report, chart review or 1247  
research staff assessment. Throu gh in -person or phone screening by [CONTACT_464], patients are 1248  
also excluded if they self -report vision too poor to read a newspaper, lack of a phone (needed 1249  
for follow -up interviews and scheduling), or plans to be out of the country for ≥ 3 months; if they 1250  
screen positive for moderate -to-severe cognitive impairment using the validated Short Portable 1251  
Mental Status Questionnaire followed by [CONTACT_11605] -Cog,41-43 or self -report or are determined by 1252  
study staff to be blind, deaf, intoxicated or actively psychotic. Because ACP is an iterative 1253  
process  and people may change their preferences over time ,24,44 subjects with prior ACP 1254  
experiences (e.g., an advance directive) are not excluded.  1255  
 1256  
To minimize the risk of unblinding  by [CONTACT_822134] , any spouse/partner of a 1257  
currently enrolled patient who  is also a patient at SFHN/ZSFG , meets the eligib ility criteria, and 1258  
therefore, is also a potential patient participant, will be excluded from being a patient participant. 1259  
This will avoid a situation where 2 closely related people living in the same home could be 1260  
randomized to different study arms and re sult in unblinding. In addition, an individual who is 1261  
named as an enrolled patient’s potential surrogate decision maker (regardless of cohabitation or 1262  
spousal status), who  is also a patient at SFHN/ZSFG , meets the eligibility criteria, and therefore, [ADDRESS_1139864] 1266

 59 RECRUITMENT METHODS  1277  
Data Extraction:  [ADDRESS_1139866] 1279  
waiver to access patients’ names, age, primary lan guage, phone numbers, addresses , medical [ADDRESS_1139867] year, and the name [CONTACT_822150]’ outpa tient primary care providers. From these [ADDRESS_1139868] Patients : 1290  
Upon completion of the administrative data pulls, providers from all recruitment sites are sent a 1291  
letter/e -mail informing them about the research study  and asking them to review a list of their 1292  
patients, to refer p atient(s) on their patient list who would be appropriate for the study, and to [ADDRESS_1139869] their patients to tell them more about the study. Clinicians are also 1294  
informed that if the study team receives their approval, their eligible partic ipants will receive a 1295  
letter describing the research study and offering them the opportunity to decline to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 1296  
by [CONTACT_822119]/or will be contact[CONTACT_822120]. Additionally, clinicians are informed that [ADDRESS_1139870] them by [CONTACT_3476] 1298  
(including by [CONTACT_6968], phone, and/or in -person), we will assume assent to contact [CONTACT_75054] 1299  
and a letter describing the study will be sent to patients on behalf of the study team. We obtain 1300  
permission  from all of the Service Chiefs before their clinicians are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  1301  
 1302  
 
 60 Recruitment Methods  and Materials : 1303  
Study -related fliers written at a 5th-grade reading level in English and Spanish are p osted in 1304  
approved areas in SFHN /ZSFG -affiliated primary care cl inics. Because many patients may be [ADDRESS_1139871] identify patients with upcoming primary care appointments and are 1316  
used to target patient recruitment efforts.  Potential participants are then contact[CONTACT_174877] 1317  
in the clinic.  1318  
 1319  
Patients who consent and enroll are paid $50 for the baseline interview  and given $10 in MUNI 1320  
(municipal transportation vouchers)  to help participants come back to follow -up interviews in 1321  
person if they desire. Participants are also reimbursed  $[ADDRESS_1139872]  1326  
experience with diverse popu lations and individuals who are  bilingual (native Spanish -speaking) [ADDRESS_1139873] extensive sensitivity training with all research staff and 1328  
 
 61 require staff to use approved study scripts when speaking to patients. These study scripts and 1329  
all study materials used for recruitment are vetted, updated and approved by [CONTACT_822122] 1330  
advisory and clinical advisory boards. All materials and study scripts are written at a 5th grade 1331  
reading level and are provided to patients in their preferred language (i.e., English or Spanish).  1332  
 1333  
CONSENT PROCEDURES  1334  
We use a modified consent process that several co -authors designed for vulnerable 1335  
populations.28,29 Consent forms written at the 5th grade reading level are provided and read to 1336  
participants in English or Spanish. This review is then followed by [CONTACT_233901] “teach -to-goal” 1337  
questions to ensure understanding. If potential participants cannot correctly co mplete the teach - 1338  
back process after 3 attempts, the patient is deemed ineligible.  1339  
 1340  
The consent form is approved by [CONTACT_822136], the 1341  
patient/clinical advisory board, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ). The con sent 1342  
form states the following for the purpose of the study: “Why is this study being done? [ADDRESS_1139874] important to them in their life. It will also help prepare patients to make 1346  
medical decisions.” We use  the word “handout” because, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], both groups are given 1347  
handout materials and written advan ce directives. For randomization we explain, “We will ask [ADDRESS_1139875] a 1350  
50/50 chance  of being in either group.”  1351  
 1352  
Due to exclusions based on  several missed baseline appointments and for staff safety and the 1353  
need to exclude or withdraw participants who were intoxicated, psychotic, or threatening, the 1354  
 
 62 consent also explains , “We also may ask you to stop taking part in this study if we feel it is in [ADDRESS_1139876] or if you do not follow the study rules.”   [ADDRESS_1139877] that clinicians of pat ients should be 1358  
contact[CONTACT_822137] s severe depression or anxiety. Our DS MB agreed 1359  
and our consent forms explain : 1360  
“We would need to contact [CONTACT_822138] a medical provider for the following reasons:  1361  
 You report or we observe that you  are having a medical emergency,  1362  
 Such as  a serious medical illness  1363  
 Or, a serious mental illness, such as major depression  1364  
 You report that you may harm yourself, you may harm someone else, or someone is 1365  
harming you .” 1366  
 1367  
INTERVENTION AND COMPARISON CONDITIONS  1368  
PREPARE  arm 1369  
As previously described, PRE PARE is an easy -to-use, patient -centered, interactive website that 1370  
is available in English or Spanish, is written at a 5th grade reading level, includes voice -overs of 1371  
all text for the reading -impaired and closed -captioning of all videos for the hearing impaired 1372  
(www.prepareforyourcare.org ).27,28 The conceptual framework for PREPARE has been 1373  
previously published and is based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory, 48,49 with elements from 1374  
the Health Belief Model,50 the Theory of Planned Behavior,51 and Behavior Change Theory.49,52 1375  
In these theories and in behavioral studies, modeling of behaviors helps people change their 1376  
behavior. Successful behavioral change interventions model skills, enhanc e self -efficacy, and 1377  
address perceived barriers,53,54 especially literacy -appropriate interventions.8 Modeling 1378  
behaviors (as in PREPARE) can also improve patients’ ability to communicate with clinicians [ADDRESS_1139878] and functional status.53,58 -60  PREPARE incorporates these successful teaching 1382  
methods through the modeling of behaviors in videos. Video and interactive websites are more 1383  
powerful mediums to teach information and change behavior than written mat erials, especially 1384  
for those with language/literacy barriers.61-67 PREPARE includes a training and goal setting 1385  
component which has been shown to be effective in changing outpatient behaviors, such as 1386  
exercise.68  1387  
 1388  
In the  design of the PREPARE website, we included essential, theory -based health education 1389  
strategies, such as the use of video modeling of ACP behaviors and tailored and interactive 1390  
content based on patients’ values and decision preferences. To ensure PREPARE i s easy to 1391  
read and understand, we use clear health communication principles (e.g., targeting text to the 1392  
5th grade reading level) informed by [CONTACT_822124] 1393  
with the target population (i.e., racially and ethnically diverse older adults with limited health 1394  
literacy and English proficiency) to ensure PREPARE content is acceptable to individuals from [ADDRESS_1139879] been shown to help patients engage in 1400  
other preventative and disease management activities in the outpatient setting.69  1401  
 1402  
After the baseline interview, participants in the PREPARE arm review all 5 steps of the 1403  
PREPARE website in English or Spanish in our research offices. Participants are asked to 1404  
review PREPARE on their own and in its entirety. Research assistants are availa ble to answer 1405  
questions only if needed, but do not go through the website with the participants. At the end of 1406  
the program, a summary of the patient’s medical wishes and action plan are automatically 1407  
 
 64 generated from the PREPARE website in written format. Th is information along with the 1408  
participant’s PREPARE website login information is included in a take -home folder that also [ADDRESS_1139880] 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes in research offices, and then to take 1414  
the form home to discuss with their potential surrogates and/or their clinicians. The time frame [ADDRESS_1139881] 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes, and to take the form home to discuss with 1423  
their p otential surrogates and clinicians.  1424  
 1425  
Both arms: Reminder  of primary care appointments  1426  
One to 3 days before the patient’s next scheduled primary care appointment, research staff call 1427  
the PREPARE arm participants to remind them to bring in their study mater ials (i.e., action plan 1428  
and advance directive) and to talk to their clinician about ACP. For the control arm, research 1429  
staff members only remind patients about their upcoming appointment and do not provide 1430  
additional encouragement about ACP.  1431  
 1432  
RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  1433  
 
 65 A statistician not involved in recruitment or data collection uses a computer -based random 1434  
number generator to create a randomization scheme usin g block randomization by [CONTACT_132544] 1435  
literacy (adequate health literacy versus limited health literacy , as determined by a validated 1436  
question concerning confidence with medical forms).71 Random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 are 1437  
used to ensure an equal number of patients with limited health literacy in each group. 1438  
Randomization information is assoc iated with a unique patient identification number and is kept 1439  
separate from other patient data. Due to the need to secure interview rooms for the duration of 1440  
the baseline questionnaire and intervention (i.e., approximately 2 hours for the AD -only arm and 1441  
3 hours for the PREPARE arm), randomization occurred prior to scheduling a baseline 1442  
interview.   1443  
 1444  
 1445  
BLINDING  1446  
Clinicians are blinded to patient group assignment. Although we obtain clinicians’ permission to 1447  
recruit their patients, the interventions are not described, and no clinician education is provided. 1448  
Participants could not be blinded to the intervention; however, they are told during consent there 1449  
is a “50/50 chance” of getting one of two different ACP guides, and the non -assigned [ADDRESS_1139882] items. In addition, a 10% ra ndom sample of all interviews is observed by [CONTACT_822125] 1465  
research staff to ensure study fidelity.  1466  
 1467  
DATA COLLECTION METH ODS  1468  
Live capture of research data are collected through Research Electronic Data Capture 1469  
(REDCap) software. REDCap  is managed by [CONTACT_822139] [ADDRESS_1139883] protected firewalls on UCSF servers, not on 1471  
individual laptops or desktops. All patients are given a unique, non -identifying patient 1472  
identification number th at is removed from any personally identifying information (PII) or 1473  
personal health information (PHI). All PII and PHI are stored in a Microsoft ACCESS database [ADDRESS_1139884] protected firewalls on UCSF and ZSFG servers. To reduce 1475  
missing da ta, REDCap has been programmed to not allow study staff to progress if data fields 1476  
are left blank. We retain  the use of paper surveys in  the event the RedCap system is  down. All 1477  
paper fil es continue  to be stored in secure, locked research offices in secure , locked file 1478  
cabinets.  1479  
 1480  
FOLLOW -UP AND RETENTION:  [ADDRESS_1139885] follow -up interviews one week and 3, 6, and 12 -mont hs after the primary care visit 1482  
in the clinic, by [CONTACT_648], or in the home if needed due to patient functional limitations. We utilize  1483  
several measures to help ensure follow -up. Each follow -up interview takes between 30 to 45 1484  
minutes and participants are reimbursed $25.  [ADDRESS_1139886] for follow -up surveys:  1487  
Upon enrollment, we ask participants to provide alternative phone numbers (e.g., cell or work 1488  
numbers)  and one to three additional phone numbers of  close contacts who may know how to [ADDRESS_1139887] with 1499  
us. 1500  
 1501  
Reminders for the primary care visit:  1502  
Participants receive a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their next primary c are visit. 1503  
Partici pants in the AD -only arm are reminded to come to their scheduled appointment while 1504  
participan ts in the PREPARE  arm are  reminded of their appointment and to bring the PREPARE 1505  
materials to the visit.  1506  
 1507  
Reminders for study interviews:  1508  
For all  follow -up interviews,  participants in both arms receive reminders of their upcoming study 1509  
interview by [CONTACT_48052]. To help participants follow along during the interview, the 1510  
participant can receive a Participant Version of the survey via mail or email, as  1511  
 
 68 preferred. No survey responses or information are  collected by [CONTACT_65056]. We use  14-point 1512  
font and color -coded, standardized, large font response options to help with understanding.  1513  
 1514  
Participants who miss their primary care appointment : [ADDRESS_1139888] been  enrolled 1519  
and randomized:  1520  
 If they have rescheduled and attend their primary care appointment within [ADDRESS_1139889] follow up assessments at 1 week, and at 3, 6, 1523  
and 12 months from this  primary care appointment date,  1524  
 If they do not reschedule or attend their primary care appoin tment within [ADDRESS_1139890] follow up assessments at 6 and 12 months 1527  
from the  originally scheduled primary care appointm ent date.  1528  
 1529  
Ascertaining reasons for loss of follow -up or withdrawal: For participants who want to [ADDRESS_1139891] of reasons we obtained from prior advance care planning trials, such as 1532  
the study is too long, they are too busy, the study topic is too upsetting, they are too ill, etc.35  1533  
 1534  
MEASURES  1535  
Overview  1536  
 
 69 Because ACP ideally is a process that occurs over time, we felt it important to measure a full 1537  
range of ACP measures including ACP documentation (primary outcome)  over time , and 1538  
several behavior change constructs and several additional ACP actions over a 12 -month period 1539  
(secondary outcomes). All study measures  used in this analysis , including validity and reliability 1540  
information in English and Spanish and t he schedule of administration (i.e., baseline, 1 -week or 1541  
3, 6, or 12 -months), are included in the O utcome Measures table below . All outcomes, includ ing 1542  
secondary outcomes not used in our main analysis , are included in our published protocol.36 1543  
The main outcome measures are described in detail below.  1544  
 1545  
Primary Outcome  1546  
The primary outcome is new documentation of ACP wishes in the Z SFG/SFHN medical record 1547  
(Table of Outcome Measures below ). ACP documentation for the purposes of this study 1548  
includes the easy -to-read advance directive or other valid advance directives or living wills, a 1549  
durable power  of attorney for health care document (DPOAHC), a Physicians Orders of Life 1550  
Sustaining Treatment form, or other documentation of discussions concerning patients ’ wishes 1551  
for medical care (i.e., documentation of oral directives by a physician  or notes describing 1552  
patients ’ goals for medical care by [CONTACT_15098] ).  [ADDRESS_1139892] engaged in ACP prior to seeing their primary care 1559  
provider. T he patient -reported outcomes in the follow -up surveys (1 week, 3, 6, and 12 -months), 1560  
however, are  timed to the primary care visit b ecause those questions concern  engagement in 1561  
discussions with clinicians (see secondary outcomes below) . This same  timeframe for ACP [ADDRESS_1139893] medical care, we 1567  
created a composite variable of any ACP documentation (forms  and/or discussions) ; we also 1568  
plan to report the percentage of forms and discussions separately . All medical review data is 1569  
double  coded  by 2 independent , blinded  research  assistants. Discrepancies  are adjudicated by 1570  
the principal investigator (R.L.S.).  1571  
 1572  
Secondary  Outcomes  1573  
Main Patient -Reported Outcome  1574  
The main pati ent-reported secondary outcome, the validated Advance Care Planning 1575  
Engagement Survey,27,28,37 was chosen to meas ure the full process of ACP. The Advance Care 1576  
Planning Engagement Survey  measures both  ACP Behavior Change P rocesses, such as 1577  
knowledge, contemplation, self -efficacy, and readiness  on a validated 57 -item scale . The ACP 1578  
Behavior Change Process scale is meas ured on a 5 -point Likert scale and average 5 -point 1579  
scores will be calculated. We will also measure ACP actions  on the validated 25-item Action 1580  
scale , which assesses  ACP activities (yes or no) such as identifying a surrogate decision maker, [ADDRESS_1139894] in surrogate decision 1582  
making, discussing one’s wishes with clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one’s wishes  1583  
in an advance directive .  Validity and reliability of the ACP Engagement Survey, as well as the 1584  
questionnaire’s ability to detect change in response to an ACP intervention, have been 1585  
previously described.27,28,37  1586  
 1587  
Feasibility and Satisfaction  1588  
 
 71 To evaluate whether and how PREPARE will be used in clinical practice and in the community, 1589  
we also assess acceptability of the PREPARE website compared to an advance directive alone 1590  
using validated scales of ease -of-use (10 -point scale , “On a scale of [ADDRESS_1139895] and 10 being very easy, how easy was it to use this guide?” ) and satisfaction (comfort: 1592  
“How comfortable were you viewing this guide?”, helpfulness: “How helpful was this guide? ”, 1593  
and recommendations: “How likely are you to rec ommend this guide to others?” assessed on a 1594  
5-point Likert scale (not -at-all to extremely)  from our prior work.[ADDRESS_1139896] Requested Outcome  1599  
Our Patient -Advisory Stakeholders requested we quantify the number and percentage of 1600  
patients who increased their ACP activities overtime. Our stakeholders perceive any increase in 1601  
an ACP activity over time as clinically meaningful. Thus, in addition to mean change in ACP 1602  
Engagement scores, they wanted to know the percent of patients who improved (i.e., had an 1603  
estimated slope > 0) over time for both Behavior Change scores , Actions scores, and both [ADDRESS_1139897] -hoc. 1605  
 1606  
Adverse Event  Outcomes  1607  
In addition, to ensure that the PREPARE program doe s not cause undue harm, we also assess 1608  
both depression73,74 and anxiety .75,76 We measure depression using the validated Patient Health 1609  
Questionnaire (PHQ) -8 (scores 0 -24) and anxiety Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) -7 1610  
(scores 0 -21) at baseline and each follow -up.74,75 Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, 1611  
moderate, moderately severe and severe depression or anxiety.   1612  
 1613  
Potential Mediating or Moderating Variables & Participant Characteristics  1614  
 
 72 Based on the previously published conceptual framework of PREPARE,27 we also hypothesize 1615  
that PREPARE efficacy may vary across several moderator or mediator variables (e.g., health [ADDRESS_1139898] of Functional Health Literacy in Adults s -TOFHLA, 1617  
scores 0 -3677 and dichotomized to limited = 0 -22 & adequate = 23 -36; clinician -patient language 1618  
concordance (concordant versus discordant); and patient’s desired role in decision making with 1619  
the medical provider using the validated Decision Control Preferences Scale(wants to make 1620  
their own decision versus  wants doctors/family to make decisions for them).78 We also 1621  
hypothesize that PREPARE effic acy may be affected by [CONTACT_822140] (e.g., 1622  
self-rated health, “ How would you rate your health?” [5 -point Likert]79,[ADDRESS_1139899] patient -clinician communication,20,81 such as age 1626  
(“What is your date of birth?”), self -reported gender (“What gender do you consider yourself to 1627  
be? male, female transgender, other”), finances (able to make ends meet versus not make ends 1628  
meet), having a potential surrogate de cision maker or not, education (“What is the highest [ADDRESS_1139900] completed?” less than or equal to high school or greater than high 1630  
school), internet access in the home (yes or no), and religiosity and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824] (i.e., “How 1631  
religious/spir itual do you consider yourself to be?” on 5 -point Likert scale from not -at-all to 1632  
extremely).  [ADDRESS_1139901]  Measure

who withdrew versus those who did not.  We will use intention -to-treat analysis using SAS 1657

tailed and set at .05 for the primary outcome and Bonferroni adjusted for se condary patient - 1659  
reported outcomes. In addition, because of differences in ACP engagement among English and 1660  
Spanish speakers,8 and based on prefe rences of our stakeholders and granting agencies, we 1661  
decided, a priori , to analyze our results overall and stratified by [CONTACT_822142]. 1662  
To compare outcomes between the two arms longitudinally, we will use mixed effects linear, 1663  
Poisson, or ne gative binomial regression for continuous measures and mixed effects logistic 1664

(English and Spanish) for  a total recruitment of [ADDRESS_1139920] clinically important interactions based 1720  
on potential moderators (literacy, control preferences, language concordance) for our outcomes. 1721  
In a prior trial of an easy -to-read advance directive in the same patient population with only 200 1722  
patients, we found significant interactions for literacy.8 Thus, if we consider the power scenario 1723  
of the control group ACP documentation rate of 15% and the PREPARE group of 28%, and 1724  
suppose the control group rate is the same (15%) for both levels of the moderating factor, then 1725  
 
 80 for a moderating factor split of 1:1, we would have 80% power to detect an interaction. If the 1726  
PREPARE arm ACP documentation rate is  18% for one level of th e factor and 40% for the 1727  
other, this corresponds to a relative rate of ACP documentation of 2.2 times as high for one 1728  
level of the factor compared to the other. A 2:[ADDRESS_1139921] 1730  
interactions will likely be stronger for continuous outcomes (e.g. engagement/behavioral scales).  1731

 91 Summary of Changes  to the Protocol : The listed topi[INVESTIGATOR_822112]  1999  
Topic  Date  Summary of Changes  
Funding  Feb 3 , 2014  We obtained funding from the  National Institute on Aging  (R01AG045043) to start 
recruitment of English -speakers. We then also obtained Patient -Centered Outcomes 
Research Institute ( PCORI) funding (R -1306 -[ZIP_CODE] ) to add Spanish -speakers to our 
established t rial infrastructure and protocol.  
Funding  Mar 8, [ADDRESS_1139941]. Sudore became funded, in part, by a NIA K24 (K24AG054415).  
ClinicalTrials.gov 
registration  Feb 27, [ADDRESS_1139942], 2015 from SFGH to Zuckerberg San 
Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ZSFG). This change was made throughout the protocol.  
Overview of Trial  Jan 4, [ADDRESS_1139943] 3 months determined by 
[CONTACT_347782], self -report, chart review or research staff assessment.  
Exclu sion criteria  Jan 16, 2014  To minimize the risk of unblinding by [CONTACT_822134], any spouse/partner of 
a currently enrolled patient or an individual who is named as an enrolled patient’s 
potential surrogate decision maker (regardless of cohab itation or spousal status), who is 
also a patient at SFHN /ZFG  will be excluded from being a patient participant. This will 
avoid a situation where [ADDRESS_1139944] research staff considerable time and effort, potential participants who initially 
scheduled but then missed the baseline interview (i.e. no show) more than 2 times 
without prior notification and reschedu ling with study staff will be considered ineligible, 
unless there were significant extenuating circumstances.  
Spanish Translation  Nov 13, 2014  All translated and back -translated study materials were approved by [CONTACT_82972].  
Recruitment methods  Nov 13, 2013  We initially sent opt -out letters to potential participants. However, many SFHN /ZSFG  
patients are marginally housed, had incorrect mailing addresses, or have limited literacy. 
We also discovered that many patients were confusing the opt -out letters fo r bills from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. With input from our Patient -Advisory Board and DSMB, we switched to 
more engaging recruitment letters and postcards that allowed patients to call and hear 
more about the study or to opt -out. They could also opt -out at any time.  
Recruitment methods  Jan [ADDRESS_1139945] research staff always in the clinic. Therefore, we expanded our recruitment 
options, after receiving permission from the clinician and sending recruitment letters, to 
both approach potential participants in clinic as well as recruit by [CONTACT_648].  
Recruitment -
reimbursement  Jan 16, 20 14 We initially reimbursed $25 separately for the screening interview and $[ADDRESS_1139946], that it made more sense to reimburse participants for $50 for the 
baseline interview since these interviews were longer and in our study offices. We also 
changed from taxi vouchers to municipal transportation tokens because of the increased 
surcharge associated with taxi vouchers and participant preference.  
Consent forms  Jan 27, 2014  For staff safety and the need to exclude or withdraw participants  who were intoxicated, 
psychotic, or threatening, the consent also explains, “We also may ask you to stop 
taking part in this study if we feel it is in your best interest or if you do not follow the 
study rules.”  
Consent forms  Jan 27, 2014  Clinicians nee ded to be contact[CONTACT_822145]. 
We updated our consent forms to fully explain this to participants:  
 
 93 “We would need to contact [CONTACT_822138] a medical provider for the following 
reasons: -You report or we  observe that you are having :  
 A medical emergency such as a serious medical illness  
 Or, a serious mental illness, such as major depression  
 You report that you may harm yourself, you may harm someone else, or 
someone is harming you  
Randomization  Jan 16, [ADDRESS_1139947] -in-time submission for an NIH proposal. We 
initially planned to block randomize, as we did for a recent VA trial,35 by [CONTACT_822146]/ethnicity. However, given the diversity of patients at SFHN /ZSFG  (over 
50% non -white), in comparison to the VA, we decided to only block randomize by [CONTACT_822147].  
Data Collection 
Methods  Jan 16, 2014  To be more environmentally -conscious, we switched from paper surveys to use the 
LiveCapture function of RedCap. We  retained the use of paper surveys in the event the 
RedCap system was down. All paper files continued to be stored in secure, locked 
research offices in secure, locked file cabinets.  
Follow -up & Retention  May 28, 2014  We created an appointment reminder sh eet to show the dates and times for upcoming 
primary care appointments as well as upcoming study appointments to help with 
retention.  
Follow -up & Retention  Jan 16, 2014  We expanded the options for follow -up interviews to be not only in the clinic or by 
[CONTACT_648], but also in the home if needed as many of our patients had functional limitations.  
Follow -up & Retention  
 Jul 15, 2014  For all participants who missed their primar y care appointment and did not reschedule, 
we provided a courtesy phone call to remind participants to reschedule the primary care 
appointment.  
Follow -up & Retention

follow up assessments at 6 and 12 months from the primary care appointment date.  
 
 94 Follow -up and Retention  Jan 16, 2014  All data capture was by [CONTACT_822148] -up 
interviews occurred over the phone. T o help par ticipants follow along during the 
interview, we mailed out a Participant Version of the survey to be used during the phone 
call if desired. No data were collected by [CONTACT_2319].  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Jan 4, 2016  We created a table displaying all study  oucome  measures, including validity and 
reliability information in both English and Spanish, number of survey items, references 
and the schedule of administration for our records and protocol.  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Mar 12, 2013  Correction : A priori , we planned to collect ACP documentation  data at 15 -months (not 
12 months  as stated in our original and published protocol ) to mirror the methods used 
in our previously published trial of PREPARE in the VA setting.[ADDRESS_1139949] the 
final patient interview  would be 3 months. Therefore, we s tandardize d this window for all 
participants  in this and our prior published trial .35    
Measures & Data 
Collection  Jan 16, 2014  We initially proposed to screen for depression and anxiety using the -Patient Health 
Questionnaire -2 item (PHQ -2) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder -2 item (GAD -2). 
Our DSMB felt more precise versions of this survey should be used. Therefore, we 
updated o ur methods to reflect assessment of depression and anxiety using the Patient 
Health Questionnaire -8 item (PHQ -8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 item (GAD -7).  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Sept 20 , 2017  Our Patient -Advisory Stakeholders requested we quan tify the number and percentage of 
patients who increased their ACP activities overtime. Our stakeholders perceive any 
increase in an ACP activity over time as clinically meaningful. Thus, in addition to mean 
change in ACP Engagement scores, they wanted to know the percent of patients who 
improved over time for Behavior Change scores, Actions scores, and both combined. 
We defined improvement as an estimated overall slope > 0. Therefore, we created this 
exploratory variable post -hoc and used Bonferroni corrections to set the p -value of 
significance at 0.017.  
Human Subjects 
Protections  May 28, [ADDRESS_1139950] helped  us create a 
flow diagram with detailed instructions,  scripts , and telephone numbe rs for how  staff 
could refer participants who report  severe depression/anxiety if that were to occur. As 
above, this potential disclosure of participant information was provid ed on the informed 
consent form.

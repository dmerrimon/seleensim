Version 5  
Original Date: Aug 16,  [ADDRESS_566480] in 
maladaptive ways 1-3.  We are evaluating a program being conducted at multiple sites, called the 
Mindfulness Based Dementia -Care (MBDC) in caregivers (CG) for dementia, which combines the 
traditional mindfulness training approaches with dementia specific education. MBDC is ho used 
by [CONTACT_445315] -profit, which offers training to certify MDBC Facilitators.   
The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Mindfulness -Based Dementia 
Care Program by [CONTACT_14664] a prospective, pre -post, observational study with members 
participating in the MBDC program across multiple sites. Results will be included in a future 
grant submission for a larger scale research project that will include a control group, as well as 
objective measures, such as cortisol levels, and blood pressure.  
 
Study aims  
Aim 1:  Evaluate change in self -reported measures in caregivers par�cipa�ng in Mindfulness 
Based Demen�a -Care (MBDC) program.  
Primary Outcome: Change in pre -post stress scores.  
Secondary Outcome:  Change in pre -post self -reported depressions scores  
Exploratory Outcomes : 
• Change in pre -post self -reported measures of confidence, self- compassion, sleep, 
resilience and well- being  
• Change in Pre -Follow -up of self -reported measures of stress, depression , confidence, 
self- compassion, sleep, resilience, well -being  
Aim 2: Describe the MBDC program based on par�cipa�on, instructor and program sa�sfac�on 
using a post -program survey  
 
Approach  
a. Study design  
We are conducting a prospective pre- post observational study with members of the 
Mindfulness -Based Dementia Care (MBDC) program.  
 
The MBDC program is an 8 -week program designed for family caregivers for those living 
with dementia. The program is offered typi[INVESTIGATOR_445309] a year at the HealthPartners 
Neuroscience center (program brochure attached) and other presence care project sites. Additional sites currently include the University of Michigan, the Ray Dolby [CONTACT_445316], and through a community offering in Grand Marais, MN.  
Participants attend a [ADDRESS_566481] 
learned from the course into their every -day life. Through surveys, the participant’s 
mindfulness and well -being is also evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months 
following the 8 -week session. The following chart illustrates the timeline for this 
program, and the table indicates the study measures and at what point on the timeline 
they are evaluated. 
The Program  
Mindfulness -Based Demen�a Care (MBDC) is an eight -week, group -based program designed for 
people who care for cogni�vely impaired individuals.  
While not all stress is inherently bad, there are unique stressors experienced in the demen�a care exchange that can become mentally, physically, and emo�onally overwhelming. A 
mindfulness prac�ce speciﬁcally geared to the care exchange oﬀers invaluab le resources and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_445310]�ces for responding to these stressors. The Mindfulness -Based Demen�a Care 
program oﬀers a way to establish a prac�ce of mindfulness that is integrated with the day -to-day 
reali�es of caring for a loved one with demen�a. S uch a prac�ce, especially if sustained over 
�me, can help improve the quality of life for both the care partner and the person living with 
demen�a.   
MBDC groups typi[INVESTIGATOR_151165] ﬁve to twelve par�cipants. The program consists of seven two -
hour sessions and one six -hour Day of Mindfulness. The sessions include formal medita�ons and 
informal mindfulness prac�ces, role play, and lectures on demen� a-related topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Par�cipants 
receive a workbook with literature related to the session topi[INVESTIGATOR_445311]. The 
program also involves prac�ce between classes.  
Teaching and prac�ces include formal medita�on prac�ces, as well as interven�ons borrowed from therapeu�c modali�es, such as Cogni�ve Behavioral Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The goal is to reward par�cipants with a transforma�ve experience that 
may help sustain their wellbeing over the care journey. Though MBDC is not a therapy program, per se, it is quite therapeu�c. It is also not a support group, but par�cipants share that they feel very supported by [CONTACT_219960], the in�macy of the program, and the new network of fellow demen�a caregivers.   

V5 18-306 4 b. Population  
i. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Must be ages ≥ 18 years  
• Must be able to read and understand English   
• Participant of the MBDC Program at any site  
 
ii. Sample size  
The MBDC program at a time has only [ADDRESS_566482] ~ 60 
participants, and enroll ~ 50 in the study. Plan is to enroll through 5 sessions. 
Depending on the r ecruitment we may extend beyond the 5 sessions up to a 
maximum of 7 consecutive sessions.  With multiple sites, we will be able to 
reach this number more quickly and prepare for a grant application to study the 
MBDC class as an intervention and include a c ontrol group.  
c. Intervention , treatment  
N/A. This is a prospective observational study of the MBDC program.  
  
d. Outcomes/endpoint and other variable definitions, and i nstruments used  
Pleas e see all the surveys and the variables spreadsheet attached . The 
measures/instruments are defined below.  
Primary Outcome:  The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): The Perceived Stress Scale is a 
widely used measure for stress perception. It measures how often and to what degree 
situations are characterized as stressful. This measures as been used to evaluate stress 
associated with chronic disease 9.  
 
Secondary Outcome: Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D): The 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_445312]- reported symptoms 
associated with depression. It has been validated for dementia and multiple other 
diagnoses, and it is sensiti ve to differences between caregivers and non -caregivers 10. 
 
Exploratory Outcomes:  
Self- Compassion:  To evaluate self -compassion, participants indicated how often they 
acted in the manner stated in each of the items on a scare of 1 (almost never) to 5 
(almost always). The survey evaluates self- kindness verses self -judgement, common 
humanity verses isolat ion, and mindfulness versus over -identification 11.  
 
Zarit Burden Inventory:  The Zarit Burden Inventory is an interview that evaluates 
caregiver burden through a self -report measure. The survey scores are positively 
correlated with behavior problems in older adults and depression scores of caregivers 12. 
 The Resilience Scale:  The Resilience Scale has been used with people of different ages, 
education, and socioeconomic backgrounds. It evaluates the individual’s stress, anxiety, 
forgiveness, and health promoting activities 
13.  
V5 18-306 5  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI): This is a validated self- report questionnaire that 
evaluates sleep quality over a 1 -month time interval  15. The measure takes about 5 min 
to complete.  
 Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) Mindfulness:  This scale evaluates five 
components, which includes observing, describing, acting with awareness, non -judging 
of inner experience, and non -reactivity to inner experience. This measure was 
developed by [CONTACT_445317] 
16.  
 Likert Scale Stress Rating : Attitudes are measured by [CONTACT_445318] a 
series of statements, indicating the extent to which they agree with them.  
 
Confidence Survey: A set of questionnaires developed by [CONTACT_445319] (questionnaire # 1, survey).  
 
MBDC Program Evaluation Survey:  
Program Evaluation: This survey demonstrates how the participant evaluates the quality 
and usefulness of the program.  
 
Instructor Rating:  The participant evaluates the instructor’s ability to give clear 
expectations, knowledge of the subject matter, and attitude.  
 
Participation in Practice: The  participant reports the level of effort that they invested in 
formal meditation between classes.  
 
e. Statistical analysis plan 
Aim 1:  
We will describe the patient characteristics using means and standard deviations (for continuous variables) and frequencies (for binary and categorical variables). Mean and 
standard deviations of scores for each of these validated scales will be calculated.  
1. Pre-Post  
2. Pre-Follow up  
The mean and standard deviation of pre -post and pre -follow -up change in scores within 
participants will also be calculated.  The 3 scores (pre, post and follow up) for each of the 
scales will be plotted on a histogram and we will describe any trends that we might see over time.  
 
As the primary analysis, we will do paired t -test for change in scores of the PSS. As an 
exploratory analysis we will do a linear regression model with age and number of classes 
as covariates.  
 Aim 2:  
V5 18-[ADDRESS_566483] -survey measures (evaluation of the program) using  means and 
standard deviations (for continuous variables) and frequencies (for binary and 
categorical variables)  and report qualitatively the themes of the open ended questions.  
 
 
f. Power analysis or statement of precision 
With a sample size of 50, the primary analysis is powered at 80% to detect a mean 
paired different of -1.[ADDRESS_566484] deviation of differences of 4.5, based 
on previous data from mindfulness program. This change is clinically meaningful and  
seems reasonable given previous research in this area.  
 
g. Strengths and l imitations  
Strength: Pragmatic way of assessing the mindfulness program  
Limitations:  
1. Lack of control group in the study.  
2. Limited sample size.  
3. Observational study.  
4. Multiple confounders  
Risks and Beneﬁts  
There are almost no risks associated with being in this study. The standardized testing may make 
you uncomfortable because some parts may be too easy and you may feel self -conscious, while 
some parts of it may be difficult or tiring. The health history survey probes for personal health 
history information that may be sensitive information.  
 
By [CONTACT_445320]. You may feel better and 
more connected with the community.  
Data Conﬁden�ality and Privacy  
Only research staﬀ on the study will have access to the data. In addi�on , we also assign study ID 
for the par�cipants. All the paper based assessment will be kept in a secure loca�on in a locked 
oﬃce. For the web based survey, we will use a secure portal to collect data and the data will be 
stored on a secure server with pa ssword access to the research staﬀ only.

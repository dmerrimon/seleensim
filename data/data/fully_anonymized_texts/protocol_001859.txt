Confidential    1. INTRODUCTION 
Amphetamine has been a well-established therapeutic ag ent for the treatment of Attention Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD) for decades.  Since the original amphetamine approval, various dosage forms have 
been approved for use: 
 immediate release (IR) dosage forms, oral solution and tablets.  
 extended release (ER) dosage forms, capsules, and tablets with various release technologies 
Dyanavel XR is an extended-release oral suspension (EROS) that contains 2.5m g/mL amphetamine base.  
Drug-resin complexation is formed with the amphetami ne and Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate USP, an ion 
exchange resin. The extended release feature of the product is achieved by [CONTACT_456578]/resin 
complexes with an extended-release coating. Dyanav el XR contains approximately a 3:1 ratio of d-
amphetamine compared to l-amphetamine. 
The efficacy of Dyanavel XR in the treatment of ADHD in children ages 6-12 h as been established in a 
Phase 3 placebo-controlled laboratory classroom study: TRI102-ADD-001. ADHD symptoms in children 
on an individually optimized dose of amphetamine (range 10-20 mg/day) were significantly lower compared to symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_633780]. Symptom control was demonstrated 
[ADDRESS_846325] for type 
of adverse event, frequency and severity. 
Study TRI102-PPK-200 was conducted in children ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD to 
evaluate the single-dose (10 mg) pharmacokineti cs of orally administered Dyanavel XR. 
Following a single 10 mg oral dose of Dyanavel  XR in 12 pediatric subjects under fasting 
conditions, d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine peak plasma concentrations occurred at a median 
time of 3.9 and 4.5 hours after dosing, respectively. The mean plasma terminal elimination half-
life of d-amphetamine was 10.43 (± 2.01 h) hours a nd the mean plasma terminal half-life for l-
amphetamine was 12.14 (± 3.15 h) hours.  Study 2014-3401 was conducted in 29 healthy adult subjects in a crossover study under fasting 
conditions, following a single, 18.8 mg oral dose of DYANAVEL XR. d-amphetamine and l-
amphetamine, the median (range) time to peak plasma concentrations (T
max) were 4.0 (2 – 7) 
hours after dosing and peak concentration (C max) were 102% and 106%, respectively of the C max 
of immediate-release (IR) mixe d amphetamine salts tablets. The relative bioavailability of 
DYANAVEL XR compared to  an equal dose of mixed amphetam ine salts IR tablets is 106% of 
d-amphetamine and 111% for l-amphetamine.  
See the Dyanavel XR Package Insert for further information1. 
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.[ADDRESS_846326]-dose during the laboratory 
school days (Visits 3 & 4), relative to placebo.  
 Safety Objective 
To assess the safety and tolerab ility of Dyanavel XR in pediatric subjects with ADHD.   
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.[ADDRESS_846327]-dose. Up to 
18 pediatric subjects with ADHD are planned to be en rolled at one investigational site in the United 
States.   
After Screening and Baseline evaluations are complete, eligible subjects will enroll in the study to take 
open-label Dyanavel XR orally once daily in the mo rning beginning the day after the baseline visit.  
Subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 to sequence to  take double-blind study drug (Dyanavel XR 15 mg, 
17.5 mg or 20 mg or placebo) orally once during visits 3 and 4 (Double Blind Classroom Visits).  
During visits 3 and 4, subjects  will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms in a laboratory classroom setting 
utilizing the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP) and Permanent 
Product Measure of Performance (PER MP) assessments.  An abbreviated practice laboratory session to 
acclimate site staff and subjects to the timing and procedures of the analog classroom specific to this protocol will occur during Visit 2. Subjects will rece ived open label Dyanavel XR (15 mg, 17.5 mg or 20 
mg) at the study site during the practice laboratory session at Visit 2. 
Safety parameters will be evalua ted throughout the study.   
A schematic of the overall study design is included be low.  The full schedule of events is found in 
Appendix A .

 Efficacy and Safety Assessments 
5.2.1.  Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP) 
The SKAMP scale will be administered pre-dose, at [ADDRESS_846336]-dose during classroom 
sessions (visits 2, 3 and 4).  Training on the SKAMP scale will be required for those who have not 
received training in the [ADDRESS_846337] Measuremen t of Performance (PERMP) 
The PERMP scales will be administered pre-dose, at 30.minutes and [ADDRESS_846338]-dose during classroom 
sessions (visits 2, 3 and 4). Training on the PERMP will be required for tho se who have not received 
training in the [ADDRESS_846339] will be administered at Baseline (Visit 1), or at Screening to determine the 
appropriate level of math test difficulty. 
5.2.3.  ADHD-Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) 
The ADHD-RS-5 will be used to dete rmine study eligibility.  An ADHD- RS-5 assessment will be done at 
Screening and/or Baseline (Visit1). The Investigator  or other designated, qualified individual from the 
study research team will perform the assessment.  
 Study Visits and Procedures 
All study visit assessments will be coll ected on paper case report forms (CRFs).  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_633782]-dose visit.  
Subjects may experience AEs that necessitate an unsche duled visit. Situations may also arise wherein the 
Investigator asks a subject to report for an unschedul ed visit following the report of an AE or SAE.  
Additional examinations may be conducted at these vis its as necessary to ensure the safety and well-being 
of subjects during the study.  CRFs should be complete d for each unscheduled visit. Refer to Section 9.4 
for information on AE collection, recording, and reporting.   
In addition, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scal e (C-SSRS) will be administered at Screening, and 
all subsequent visits to assess emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The C-SSRS is a brief, 
Investigator-administered questi onnaire that provides for the identification, quantification, and 
standardized assessment of the occu rrences and severity of suicidal id eation and behavior.  The baseline 
version of the C-SSRS will be administered to all s ubjects at Screening. The “Since Last Visit” version 
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.0

Confidential    will be used at all subsequent stud y visits (and Early Termination, if applicable).  The Investigator or 
other designated, qualified individuals from the st udy research team will pe rform the assessment.   
Medical history will capture all medical conditions at Sc reening.  Physical examinations, height and body 
weight assessments, 12-lead ECG, and clinical labor atory tests will be conducted at Screening.  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be assessed at all study vis its and will be taken using automated machines 
programmed to take 3 consecutive readings (at l east 2 minutes apart); manual blood pressure readings

Sponsor prior to unblinding. 
A subsequent written report, including all pertinent de tails, must be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of the unblinding. Whenever possible, the b lind of the parent/guardia n and subject should be 
maintained. 
If an Investigator, site personnel pe rforming assessments, or subject/parent is unblinded, the subject must 
be withdrawn from the study, and procedures accomp anying withdrawal are to be performed.

Confidential    9. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
This section defines AEs and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and 
reporting them.  Information in this section compli es with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312, 
ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data M anagement: Definitions and St andards for Expedited 
Reporting , and ICH Guideline E-6: Guide lines for Good Clinical Practice. 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of AEs regardless of treatment group 
or suspected causal relationship to the investigational drug.  For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and 
obtain information adequate to determine the out come of the AE and to assess whether it meets the 
criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative.  
 Definitions of Adverse Events 
9.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s 
participation in the research, whether or not consider ed related to the subject’s participation in the 
research (ICH E6 Guidelines for GCP).  Any medical c ondition that is present at the time that the subject 
is screened will be considered as medical history an d not recorded as an AE; however, if the condition 
worsens at any time during the study, it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
9.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either  the Investigator or the Sp onsor, it results in any of 
the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32[a]): 
 Death:  A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the Investigator 
during the protocol-defined follow-up period mu st be reported to the Sponsor whether it is 
considered treatment related or not. 
 A life-threatening event:  An AE or suspected  adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “life 
threatening” if, in the view of either the I nvestigator or the Sponsor, its occurrence places the 
participant at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38101]. 
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
 An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475] , based on appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medi cal events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency r oom or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.[ADDRESS_846353] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
If an event meets any of the above definitions, regardl ess of the severity or relationship of the event to the 
study drug, the event must be reported to the Sponsor  as described in Section 9.5.1 . 
Adverse events reported from clinical studies asso ciated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633766].  Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633767].  Admission also includes transfer  within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit 
(e.g., from the medical floor to the intensive care unit). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
 Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], or  respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief) 
 Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities 
 Emergency room visits 
 Same-day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures) 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_633768].  Examples include: 
 Admission for treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
 Protocol-specified admission (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_4690]) 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_559720], social, and/or convenience admissions 
 Pre-planned treatments or procedures should be  noted in the baseline documentation for the 
individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surg ery, should not be reported as AEs; however, the 
medical condition for which the procedure was perfo rmed should be reported if it occurs during the 
reporting period and meets the definition of an AE.  Fo r example, an acute appendicitis that begins during 
the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded 
as treatment of the AE.   
9.1.3.  Adverse Reaction (AR) and Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
An adverse reaction (AR) means any AE caused by a drug.   
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which th ere is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the AE.  For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonabl e possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  Su spected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than an AR (21 CFR 312.32[a]).  
9.1.4.  Unanticipated Adverse Reaction (UAR) 
The Sponsor is responsible for assessing AEs for expect edness.  With regards to reporting to the Health 
Authority, an AE is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, or rate of occurrence 
is not consistent with applicable  product information as described in the safety information provided in 
the protocol/package insert/Investigator’s Broc hure/prescribing information for Dyanavel XR.  
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.0 
TRI102-ADD-300  02 February 2017  
Page 35 of 53 
Confidential    "Unexpected," as used in this defi nition, also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the 
Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically me ntioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation (21 CFR 312.32[a]).  
 Severity of AEs/SAEs 
The study site will grade the severity of AEs experien ced by [CONTACT_633793]: 
 Mild; awareness of signs or symptoms but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of 
time from normal activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms may be transient. 
 Moderate; discomfort enough to interfe re with usual daily activities. 
 Severe; incapacitating with an inability to perform  usual daily activities; signs and symptoms may 
be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation. 
Note:   The terms serious and severe are not synonym ous.  Serious criteria as defined in Section 9.1.2  
serve as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obliga tions.  The term severe is often used to describe 
the intensity (severity) of a specifi c event (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache); the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as serious, which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associ ated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or functioning.  Therefore, an AE of severe head ache might not be consider ed serious, but a moderate 
infection for which a subject is hosp italized should be reported as an SAE. 
 Relationship to Investigational Drug Treatment 
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whethe r a reasonable possibility exists that 
the investigational drug  caused or contributed to an AE.  This  assessment must be provided for all AEs 
(serious and non-serious).  
The Sponsor’s determination of attrib ution will be used for reporting to the appropriate health authorities.  
The relation of an AE to study pa rticipation will be determined usi ng the descriptors and definitions 
provided in Table 4 .

Confidential    Table 4:  Attribution of Adverse Events 
Not Related The AE is clearly/most probably cau sed by [CONTACT_541591]’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic interventi on or concomitant therapy, or the delay 
between administration and the onset of the AE  is incompatible with a causal relation, 
or the AE started before administration (screening phase).  Therefore, there is not a 
reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_280607]. 
Possible 
Related An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/study procedure, follo ws no known pattern of response, but a 
potential alternative cause does not exist. 
Probably Related An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/study procedure and follo ws a known pattern of response, but for 
which a potential alternative cause may be present. 
Definitely Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug and follows a known patte rn of response for which no alternative 
cause is present. 
 Collecting and Recording Adverse Events 
9.4.1.  Period of Collection 
All AEs will be collected from the completion of info rmed consent through Visit 4. All AEs and SAEs 
should be treated as medically appropriate. AEs that o ccur after at least one dose of study medication has 
been administered will be cons idered treatment-emergent AEs. 
9.4.2.  Methods of Collection 
Adverse events may be collected as follows: 
 Observing the subject 
 Questioning the subject in an unbiased and non-leading manner 
 Receiving an unsolicited complaint fro m the subject or parent/guardian 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation  (e.g., physical examination, 
laboratory assessment, or ECG) can also indicate an AE if it is determined by [CONTACT_313417].  If this is the case, it must be recorded in the source document and as an AE on the 
appropriate AE form(s).  The evaluation that produ ced the value or result should be repeated until that 
value or result returns to normal or is stabilized  and the participant’s safety is not at risk.

All AEs occurring during this clinical study will be re corded by [CONTACT_633794], along with the date and time of  onset and the date and time of resolution.  To 
avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, th e AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology rather than the subject’s own words.  Whenever possible, the Investigator should combine 
signs and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a single diagnosis.  Each AE is to be evaluated for 
duration, severity, seriousness, and relatedness to the study medication.  The severity of the AE and its 
relationship to the study medication w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_737].   
The Investigator will treat participants experienci ng AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable 
intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status  stabilizes.  If any medication is administered in 
response to the AE, this medication should be noted  on the concomitant medication CRF as a concomitant 
medication administered.  The action taken and the outc ome must also be recorded.  Adverse events will 
be followed until resolution or stabilization or until [ADDRESS_846354].  The terms of AE resolution (i .e., not recovered/not resolved, recovering/resolving,

9.5.2.  Reporting SAEs to Health Authorities 
The Sponsor or Sponsor designee will report Investig ational New Drug (IND) Safety Reports to the FDA 
and Investigators in accordance with the FDA regulations detailed in  the 21 CFR 312.32.  
9.5.3.  Reporting SAEs to the Central IRB(s) 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or Sponsor d esignee to promptly notify their respective IRB(s) of 
IND Safety reports or other matters involving risk to subjects as mandated by [CONTACT_1201](s). 
9.5.4.  Reporting Pregnancy 
During the study, all subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_633797] (e.g., missed  or late menstrual period).  If pre gnancy is confirmed, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and followed until the pregnancy comes to term.   
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all av ailable pregnancy information on the pregnancy CRF 
within [ADDRESS_846356] should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  Monitoring of the 
participant should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy.  Follow-up information detailing the 
outcome of the pregnancy should be reported as it becomes available.   
Any pregnancy complication or premature terminations  including miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical re asons will be reported as an SAE, as described in 
Section 9.5.[ADDRESS_846357]-dose as measured during the laborator y school days (Visits 3 and 4).  Assuming an 
effect size of 1.[ADDRESS_846358] 90% power at  the level of alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) to detect a 
treatment effect.  To allow for an estimated 15% potential drop-out rate, this study plans to enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_846359] measured timepoint and 
reducing that by 20%.   
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be wr itten and finalized prior to unblinding of the data. 
 Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations are defined as follows:   
 The enrolled safety population is defined as all en rolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
open-label study drug treatment.   
 The randomized safety population is defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least 
1 dose of double-blind study drug treatment.   
 The ITT population is defined as randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_846360]-dose assessment of the primary efficacy variable at 
both Visits 3 and 4.   
 The clinically evaluable population is defined as all ITT subjects who have no major protocol 
deviations.  This includes any subject who: 
o Received the morning dose of double-bli nd study medication at Visits 3 and 4 
o Completed all laboratory classroom assessments 
o Did not use prohibited medication during the double-blind Treatment Period. 
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population.  Secondary efficacy analyses on 
the ITT and clinically evaluable populations will be supportive of the primary analysis.  
The safety analyses will be performed on the enrolled and randomized safety populations. 
Deviations from the original statistical plan as planned in this protocol will be re ported and justified in the 
SAP and clinical study report (CSR) as appropriate.

 Other Statistical Considerations 
10.5.1.  Significance Levels 
The type I error significance level for each set of stud y analyses as applicable will be set at alpha = 0.05. 
10.5.2.  Missing Data 
Although the rate of missing data is expected to be  low, missing data could occur under either or both of 
the following scenarios:  missing or invalid data for individual questions in the SKAMP and missing 
SKAMP-Combined scores at individual time points.   
In general, missing or invalid data  for individual questions will be handled by [CONTACT_633799].  No additional imputation for missing 
or invalid SKAMP responses will be performed.   
No imputation of missing SKAMP-Combined scores will be done for the primary efficacy analysis.  The 
mixed-model repeated-mea sures method used to analyze the prim ary endpoint has been designed to

completely at random or missing at random.  To evaluate the sensitivity of the primary analysis results to the use or non-use of imputation, analyses using si ngle imputation (last observation carried forward) and 
multiple imputation methods may be conducted.  This decision will be made prior to database unblinding, 
and the methods will be described in the SAP.   
 
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.[ADDRESS_846362] to protocol adherence and valid ity of data recorded on the CRFs.  The Sponsor is 
responsible for assigning the study monitor(s) to this study.  The study monitors’ duties are to aid the 
Investigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance of co mplete, accurate, legible, well-organized, and easily 
retrievable data.  The study monitor will advise the Investigator of the regulatory necessity for 
trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and inspection by [CONTACT_46379]/documents.  In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator all 
regulations applicable to the clinical evaluati on of an investigational drug as documented in ICH 
guidelines. 
It is the study monitors’ responsibility to inspect the CRFs throughout the study to protect the rights of the

International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Gu idance for Industry, E6 GCP: Consolidated 
Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, where applicable  the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(Recommendations guiding Medical Doctors in Bio medical Research Involving Human Subjects), and 
with the NH&MRC National Statement on Ethical Conduc t in Human Research (2007).  The conduct of 
the study will be in accordance with the No tes for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice 
(CPMP/ICH/135/95), as adopted by [CONTACT_633801] (2000).   
 Ethics Committees 
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the site’s 
informed consent form, and any other information that will be presented to potential subjects (e.g., 
advertisements or information that supports or suppl ements the informed consen t form) are reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_196490].  The investig ator agrees to allow the IRB or IEC direct access to 
all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be c onstituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  The sponsor will provide the investigator  with relevant documents or data needed for IRB 
or IEC review and approval of the study.  Before in vestigational products and CR Fs can be shipped to the 
site, the sponsor must receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_633770], the approved informed consent form, 
and any other information that the IRB or IEC h as approved for presentation to potential subjects. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any ot her information that the IRB or IEC has approved for 
presentation to potential subjects is amended during the st udy, the investigator is responsible for ensuring 
that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where app licable, these amended documents.  The investigator 
must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pe rtaining to the use of an amended informed consent 
form, including obtaining IRB or IEC approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take 
part in the study using the new version of the form .  The investigator must promptly forward to the 
sponsor copi[INVESTIGATOR_633771].  IRB or IEC approval of the 
consent forms must be obtained in addition to the ap proval given for the clinical study.  Regulatory 
review and approval may be required in some count ries before IRB or IEC approval can be sought. 
 General Considerations 
The Investigator must conduct the study in accordance  with this protocol and ICH GCP guidelines which 
have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Investigator and Tris Pharma will sign the protocol 
and study contract to confirm agreement.  The I nvestigator will not implement any amendment (deviation 
or changes of the protocol) without agreement by [CONTACT_633802]/information, except 
where necessary to eliminate immediate  hazards to study subjects or when changes involve only logistical 
or administrative aspects of the study.  
Tris Pharma, Inc.  Protocol v. 2.[ADDRESS_846363]’s consent is obtained, the 
Investigator and Tris Pharma will consult with each ot her on how to deal with the information.  When 
Tris Pharma and a responsible Investigator judge it necessary, the Investigator must immediately provide 
the subjects with such information, revise the writte n information and other explanatory documents based 
on the new information, and obtain approval from the I RB(s).  In this instance, the Investigator should 
also immediately inform subjects currently participating in the clinical study of such information, confirm 
their intention to continue particip ation, re-explain the study to them using the revised written information 
and other explanatory documents, a nd obtain written consent to conti nue participation based on their 
voluntary decision. 
 Informed Consent 
Subjects aged [ADDRESS_846364] sign the 
informed consent form. The sponsor will provide inves tigators with a sample informed consent form and 
assent form for this study.  Investigators are encourag ed to use the sample form ; however, they may adapt 
the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required 
elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part  50.25).  The final informed consent form must be 
accepted by [CONTACT_196491].   Investigators must provide the sponsor with an 
unsigned copy of the final informed consent form befo re and after it is approved by [CONTACT_4186].  If 
any new information becomes available that might affect  subjects’ willingness to participate in the study, 
or if any amendments to the protocol require cha nges to the informed consent form, the sponsor will 
provide investigators with a revised informed c onsent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written 
approval of any revisions to the informed  consent form in advance of its use. 
Investigators must provide subjects with all the in formation necessary to make an informed decision 
about their participation in the study, including th e nature and intended purpose of the study, possible 
benefits, and possible risks. 
Before written informed consent is obtained, the s ubject should be given ampl e time and opportunity to 
inquire about the details of the study.  All questions mu st be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or 
his or her legally authorized representative). 
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent form and the assent 
form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423] (or hi s or her legally authorized representative) and any 
other signatories as required by [CONTACT_4186]. 
After all required signatures have been obtained, a co py of the informed consent form should be provided 
to the subject, and the original must be kept on f ile at the site and made available for review by [CONTACT_103].  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the subject’s case history. 
 Subject Confidentiality 
Individual subject medical information obtained as a r esult of this study is considered confidential, and 
disclosure to third parties is prohibited.  Informati on will be accessible to authorized parties or personnel 
only.  Medical information may be given to the s ubject’s physician or to other appropriate medical 
personnel responsible for the subject ’s well-being.  Each subject will be asked to complete a form

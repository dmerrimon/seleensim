COVID -19 infection. To include this exclusion, related to 
the COVID -19 pandemic situation.
Section 7.3Excluded Medications Added OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors 
and otilonium bromide/Spasmomen 
to excluded medications .A recently complete d OATP (drug -
drug interaction ( DDI)study (Study 
TAK -906-1009) suggested that 
coadministration of TAK -906 with a 
single dose of rifampin (OATP1B1 
and 1B3 inhibitor) resulted in high 
exposure of TAK -906,which may 
potentially increase the safety risk (eg, 
adverse events [ AEs], toxicities). Thus, 
the concomitant use of OATP1B1/1B3 
inhibito rs will be excluded.
Added otilonium bromide/Spasmomen 
to the list of excluded medications due 
to its anticholinergic and 
antispasmodic effects.

Study Design : This is a global multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 2b 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice daily (BID) oral (PO) capsule administration of a peripherally 
acting dopamine (DA) receptor D 2/D3antago nist, TAK -906, in adult male and female s ubjects aged 18 to 85 years, 
inclusive, with symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis ([IG and DG], respectively). Gastroparesis is a 
disorder of the stomach characterized by [CONTACT_717840], in the absence of mechanical obstruction.
Subje cts will attend the study site for a screening/consent visit (Visit 1, Day -35), when their consent will be 
obtained, and general eligibility to participate in the study will be reviewed. After signing the informed consent 
form, subjects will have a blood sample taken to assess their laboratory values. Subjects will discontinue all 
excluded medications and return to the site [ADDRESS_979038] (GEBT) (Visit 2, Day -21). Subjects with confirmed d elayed gastric emptying by [CONTACT_717841]’s medical records prior to screening do not have to undergo the Visit [ADDRESS_979039] is required before the GEBT. Subjects who required the Visit 2 GEBT will then

use of an electronic patient reported outcomes tool (ePRO) for collecting the daily symptoms of gastroparesis, daily 
dosing and meal time recordings, and capture of rescue medication use. The instrument used to capture symptom 
data will be the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societ y Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index -
Daily Diary  (ANMS GCSI -DD) along with a bloating severity scale. Subjects will record their symptoms once daily 
(in the evening) and will return to the clinic approximately 2 weeks later to assess their gastroparesis symptom 
eligibility based on the ANMS GCSI -DD (Visit 4, randomization). Subjects need to be compliant with completing 
the Daily Symptom Diary, defined as ≥80% diary completions, during the 2 -week symptom assessment period. 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1: 1 into 1 of 3 treatment groups: TAK -906 maleate (TAK -906M) 25, and [ADDRESS_979041] dose of study medication at the 
randomization visit (Day 1) and will take their morning dose in clinic at Visits 5, 6, and 7 . Subjects will complete 
the Daily Symptom Diary daily for 12 weeks and complete visits at Weeks 4 (Visit 5), 8 (Visit 6), and 12 (Visit 7). 
At Day  1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/early termination, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be taken both predose and 
postdose. A safety follow -up phone call will be made approximately [ADDRESS_979042] dose of study medication

Statistical Considerations:
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who were randomized, received at least [ADDRESS_979049] common treatments are used with equal frequency, then the randomiz ed treatment will be used as the actual 
treatment.
Primary  Efficacy Analysis: The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 12 in weekly ANMS GCSI -
DD composite score. Analysis will be based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment, 
center, week, subject disease population (DG and IG), and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects, baseline 
and baseline score -by-week interaction as covariates, with an unstructured covariance structure if applicable. The 
point -estimates , nominal p -values and confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary analysis will be based on the Week 
[ADDRESS_979050] to the primary 
endpoint. The 2 statistical tests for the pri mary  efficacy analysis are 1 -sided and will be conducted using a 5% level 
of significance. Nominal p-values will be evaluated for statistical significance. In addition, point estimates and CIs 
along with descriptive statistics for change from baseline scor es in ANMS GCSI -DD at earlier time points, will be 
presented. The MMRM -based analysis assumes that missing data follow a missing -at-random (MAR) assumption. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: The secondary endpoint of proportion of subjects with at least 50% re ductio n from 
baseline in ANMS GCSI -DD composite score will be analyzed at all time points by [CONTACT_717843], subject disease population and treatment by [CONTACT_717844].
Sample Size Justification: 
In order to manage the likelihood of statistical, clinical, and operational success of this study in the setting of the 
COVID -19 pandemic, the sample -size considerations are revisited in Protocol Amendment 8 . The statistical testing 
is revised from 2 -sided (with a significance level of 5%) to 1 -sided (with a significance level of 5%), the planned 
sample size is reduced by 10 subjects per arm and randomization into the 5 mg dose arm is to be discontinued. 
Thesample -size rationale for the resultant reduced sample size and updated 1 -sided statistical testing is as follows: 
Assuming a SD of 1.25 anda true difference of 0.625 between TAK -906M active dose and placebo in the change 
from baseline in the ANMS GCSI -DD composite score, and a 15% dropout rate, a total of 205 subjects is sufficient 
to achieve approximately 80% power to detect the treatment effect of 0.625 at a 1 -sided 5% significance level. The 
total of [ADDRESS_979051] already been randomized to receive 5 mg 
capsule BID prior to terminating randomization of subjects into the 5 mg dose arm ,and 60 subjects per treatment

INTRODUCTION 4.0
4.1 Background
TAK -906 i s being developed as an oral (PO) therapy  for moderate to severe, di abetic 
gastroparesi s (DG) and i diopathic gastroparesis (IG). A significant unmet medical need for safe 
and effective chronic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_717804]. Gastroparesis is a disorder of the 
stom ach characteri zed by  [CONTACT_717846]. It 
is est imated that there is in the range of 5 to 10 millio n gastroparetics (approximately 3% of the 
total popul ation) in the [LOCATION_002] (US) [1], with idiopathic (36%), di abetic (29%), 
postsurgical (13%), and Parkinson (7%) etiologies comprising the majorit y of cases in the 
tertiary referral  setting [2]. Symptoms consist of nausea, vo miting, early satiety, abdo minal pain,
and postprandial fullness that are chronic wit h epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c symptom  exacerbat ion [3]. Gastroparesis 
causes nutrit ional co mpromise, impaired glucose control, and a reduced qualit y of life, 
independent of other factors such as age, tobacco and alcoho l use, or ty pe of diabetes [3]. The 
impact of gastroparesis has a serious outcome on day -to-day functioning i s well -docum ented 
both for the patient’s deteriorating qualit y of life, productivit y, and on the di rect and indirect 
economic burden placed on societ y [4].
Current ly in the US, there ex ists a significant unmet medical need because there are no approved 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_717805] c treatm ent of DG. Validated targets for gastroparesis are the dopamine 
(DA) receptors D 2and D 3. The D 2receptor antagonist metoclopramide is indicated for the sho rt-
term treatm ent of acute and recurrent DG and has been limit ed in dose and duration of treatment 
because of well -docum ented toxi cities, the m ost notabl e of which are extrapy ramidal  symptoms 
(EPS) [5]. EPS are caused by [CONTACT_3433] e blockade of  the D 2receptor in the dorsal striatum and thus are

TAK-[ADDRESS_979056] concern is tardive dyskinesia, a severe and often irreversible 
EPS. The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_717806] (total cumulative dose), and conse quently, the US package insert for metoclopramide 
includes a black box warning regarding the chronic use of metoclopramide for longer than 
12weeks [6].
Domperidone is a peripherally-acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist marketed for use as an 
antiemetic and prokinetic agent in a number of countries worldwide, although not in the US 
because of its cardiovascular safety profile, which includes a risk for drug-induced QT 
prolongation, t orsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death [7]. DA receptor antagonists are 
effective in the treatment of delayed gastric emptying and gastroparesis symptoms because of the 
role of DA receptors D 2and D3in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in the area postrema, 
which controls vomiting [8-10].Both of these areas are outside of the blood brain barrier. 
Therefore, a peripherally-selective D 2/D3antagonist could achieve the desired efficacy without 
the undesired central nervous system (CNS) effects such as EPS [11,12].
TAK-906 is a peripherally acting (ie, limited penetration of the blood brain barrier) DA receptor 
D2/D3antagonist. 
4.[ADDRESS_979057] demonstrated 
primary pharmacologic actions of TAK-906 c onsistent with D2/D3antagonism. Overall, 
TAK906 is expected to be e ffective in the treatment of gastroparesis, based on nonclinical 
pharmacology data demonstrating D2/D3 antagonism  with a potency comparable to or greater 
than domperidone and metoclopramide. 
4.2.2 Safety Pharmacology
A series of safety pharmacology studies evaluated TAK-906 as outlined inInternational 
Conference on Harmonisation(ICH)S7A, including assessments of cardiovascular safety, CNS 
safety, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_247169]. TAK-906 weak ly blocked human ether-à-go-go–related gene
(hERG)potassium channel current ( 50% inhibitory concentration [IC
50] = 15.6 μM). In a dog 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology study, small decreases in systolic and pulse pressure were 
observed at ≥10 mg/kg with a compensatory increase in heart rate with associated lower QT and 
PR interval electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters observed at 30 mg/kg. There were no changes 
in corrected QT interval (QTc). Changes in lo comotor activity (rearing, basic, and fine 
movement) were observed at ≥100mg/kg in the repeat-dose 28-day rat study, but TAK-906 was 
not associated with any other biologically signif icant changes in CNS or respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951]. Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usede de

TAK -[ADDRESS_979058] Metabolism
Absorpti on, di stributi on, metabolism , excreti on, and pharmacokineti c (PK)properties of TAK -
906 and [14C]TAK -906 were evaluated using in vit ro or in vivo assays. Using the maleate form 
intended for the clinic, studies in rats and dogs demo nstrated that TAK -906 i s absorbed 
following PO administration. The abso lute bioavail ability (BA) of TAK -906 was approximately 
19% in rats fo llowing PO gavage administration, and up to 18% in dogs fo llowing PO capsule 
administration. At pharmaco logically relevant PO doses, time of first occurrence of maximum 
observed plasm concentration (t max) was 20 to 30 minutes. TAK -906 administered PO shows a 
somewhat greater than proportional increase in TAK- 906 exposure with dose across the wide 
range of doses studied; 3 to 1000 mg/kg in rats and 1 to 500 mg/kg in dogs. Exposure in female 
animals was generally greater than that in males but usually by [CONTACT_21316] 2 -fold. Accumulat ion 
was not observed with repeated dosing. An in vitro permeabilit y study  of [14C]TAK -906 using 
human co lonic adenocarcino ma(Caco -2)cells showed that TAK -906 has m oderate perm eabili ty. 
[14C]TAK -
906-derived radioactivit y distributed widely into tissues, and almost completely  
eliminated fro m them by 72 hours after a single PO dose to albino rats; in pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922], 
[14C]TAK -
906-derived radioactivit y had litt le affinit y for melanin. Pl asma protein binding of 
TAK -906 in m ouse, rat, dog, and human plasma was ≥90% and mainly to human serum albumin 
(HSA) . Penetrati on of  TAK -906 into the brain is minimal as demonstrated by  
[CONTACT_319110] -to-cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872](CSF) level comparisons in rats an d dogs using the PO route of 
administration, and by [CONTACT_717847] 
(IP)route of administration.
In vitro, using hepatocy tes from humans, rats, and dogs, TAK -906 is m etabo lized to a ketone 
reducti on m etabo lite (M23) and unident ified metabo lites. No uni que human metabo lites are 
observed. TAK -906 is m ainly metabolized by a non -cytochrome P
-450 ( CYP )pathway and via 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5. In vitro investigations demo nstrated that format ion of M23 occurred in 
human liver cy tosol  and not in CYP -expressing liver microsomes. Therefore, M23 is likely 
formed by  a cy tosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) -dependent 
reductase like aldo-keto ( AKR )and/or short -chain dehydrogenase ( SDR )rather than by [CONTACT_097]. A 
metabo lic stabilit y study  with TAK -906 in human liver S9 with or without a pan CYP inhibitor 
(ABT), indicated the relat ive contribution of CYP and non-CYP toward in vitro metabo lism o f 
TAK -906 was 43.3% and 56.7%, respectively. In vi vo m etabolic profiling of plasma and excreta 
from rats and dogs indicated the presence of TAK- 906, M23, N-dealkylated m etabo lite (M28), 
and unident ified metabo lites. TAK -[ADDRESS_979059]- cannulated rats. Similarly, in 
fasted dogs, urinary  and fecal  excretion were 8.0% and 91.3%, respectively , over 96 hours.
TAK -906 showed little potential to inhibit or induce CYP. TAK -906 i s a substrate of P -
glycoprotein (Pgp), OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but not breast cancer resistance protein , organic 
anion transporter 1/3, organi c cat ion transporter 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1, 
and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 2-K. In vitro invest igations using human 
hepatocy tes and OATP1B1/1B3

TAK -[ADDRESS_979060] ration. Rat and dog repeat 
dose studies with twice daily  dosing (BID) up to [ADDRESS_979061] ion for 6-month rat and 9- month dog BID 
studi es. A full  battery  of genotoxi city assays (in vitro Am es and chrom osom e aberrati on and in 
vivo rat micronucleus assays), embry o-fetal devel opment studi es in rats and rabbits, a fert ility 
and early  embry onic devel opment study  in rats, and a phototoxicit y study  in rats were also 
conducted. Mou se repeat dose BID studies were conducted to guide dose select ion for a 6-month 
transgenic mouse carcinogenicit y study .
Dose -limit ing toxicit y was seen in the form of tremors and weight loss in dogs treated with 
TAK -906 at ≥250 mg/kg for up to 4 day s. At l ower repeated doses (<100 mg/kg/day) , slight 
tremor and the presence of expected class- related pharmacol ogical effects, including signs 
associ ated wi th mild sedat ion, were observed in dogs.
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 13 -week repeat -dose toxicit y study  in rats wi th TAK-906 administered once daily  
(QD) by  [CONTACT_717848], the no-observed -adverse -event l evel (NOAEL )was 1000 mg/kg/day. Target 
organ effects in male and female mammary t issue, mucificat ion in the cervix and vagina, and 
corpus l uteum  hypertrophy  in the ovary  were associated with hyperprolact inemia, which is a 
known indicator for target engagement for this drug class and may result in reproductive changes 
consistent with hyperprolactinemia (ie, amenorrhea, infertilit y in females, gyneco mast ia in 
males). 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_717808] 13-week repeat -dose toxicit y study  in dogs wi th TAK -906 administered QD PO by  
[CONTACT_162293], the NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day, at which CNS -associ ated pharmacol ogical effects 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_717809] 50 mg/kg/day , including decreased act ivity, 
tremors, incoordinat ion (ataxia), decreased muscle tone (droopi[INVESTIGATOR_717810]), partly  closed eyes 
(squint ing), and protruding nictitating membrane (periocular swelling). Based on the overall 
nonclinical safet y profile, the dog is considered the more sensi tive species.
In 28 -day repeat dose toxi city studi es wi th TAK -906 in both rats and dogs, NOAELs were lower 
with BID versus QD administration. The 28 -day rat BID NOAEL was determined to be 
150mg/kg BID (300 mg/kg/day), as doses of 500 mg/kg BID (1000 mg/k g/day) were not 
tolerated and adverse liver findings (hepatocellular vacuo lation with occasi onal inflammat ion) 
were noted at 375 mg/kg BID (750 mg/kg/day). The 28- day female dog BID NOAEL was 
determined to be 10 mg/kg BID (20 mg/kg/day) due to adverse prol actin-related m ammary  gland 
inflammat ion and fibrosis at 30 mg/kg BID (60 mg/kg/day ).
TAK -906 was nongenotoxic in in vitro mutagenicity  and chro mosomal aberrati on assays or in an 
in vivo micronucleus assay  in rats at a limit dose of 1000 mg/kg BID (2000 mg /kg/day  total  
dose) administered by  [CONTACT_717848] . TAK -906 was negative for cutaneous and ocular phototoxicit y 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_129881] 500 mg/kg BID (1000 mg/kg/day).

the pi[INVESTIGATOR_717813] y and early embryo nic develo pment study  at doses of 50, 150, and 
325mg/kg BID (100, 3 00, and 650 mg/kg/day) in males and females, TAK -906 was associated 
with effects on gross necropsy  findings and/or organ weights in the prostate, uterus, and ovary , 
reproducti ve perform ance, and intrauterine parameters at ≥100 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for 
fema le reproductive toxicit y and early embry onic toxi city coul d not be determined because all 
doses were considered adverse. The effects on reproduction performance in males were 
considered secondary  to the effects noted for the females. The NOAELs for systemic toxicit y 
were 300 mg/kg/day and 650 mg/kg/day for males and females, respect ively.
4.3 Human Experience
4.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology
To date, 6 clinical studies wit h TAK -906 m aleate (TAK -906M) capsule have been completed, 
and 1 clinical study  is ongoing in s ubjects wi th DG and IG.
Study  AT-01C consisted of 2 phases: a single ascending dose phase and a mult iple ascending 
dose phase. In general, PO administration o f single (5 to 300 mg) or mult iple (50 or 100 mg BID 
over 5 day s) doses of TAK -906M was safe and w ell tolerated in healt hy male and female 
subjects.
TAK -906 showed a rapid absorption (median plasma TAK -906 t maxacross both single and 
multiple PO doses of TAK -906M across all cohorts was approximately  1.1 hours) and a rapi d 
eliminat ion over 24 hours (mea n plasma TAK -906 terminal disposit ion phase half -life was 
approximately  4.0 hours across all cohorts in the single ascending dose phase and was 11.0 and 
6.2 hours at the 50 and 100 mg BID doses, respectively, on Day  5 in the m ultiple ascending dose 
phase). Food significant ly reduced exposure to TAK -906M 25 mg; maximum observed 
concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) in fed subjects were 
approximately  40% l ower com pared wi th the same subjects when fast ing. Wit h single PO doses 
of TAK -906M between 5 and 300 mg, TAK -906 exposure increased in a manner proportional to 
dose increment. With BID dosing o f 50 and 100 mg TAK -906M for 5 days, accumulat ion was 
minor. Addit ionally, TAK -906 PK profiles were generally  similar between Japanese men 
(TAK -906- 1004) and non -Japanese healthy men and women (Study  AT -01C).
M23, the major and pharmaco logically  inactive m etaboli te identified in rat and dog plasma, 
represented approximately  11% of  the TAK -906 (parent) AUC. Following PO administration of
TAK -906, approximately 1.5% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged TAK -906 in 
the urine of humans. Based on preliminary populatio n PK analysis (ut ilizing data from first in

significant effect on exposure of TAK -906 in healt hy subjects or DG and IG subjects.
Coadministration of itraconazo le (potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and Pgp) with TAK -906 increased 
geom etric mean C maxby [CONTACT_3450]  1.98 -fold and area under the concentration -time curve 
from time 0 to infinit y of TAK -906 by  [CONTACT_3450] 1.28 -fold (TAK -906- 1003). AUC ∞and 
Cmaxof TAK -906 decreased approximately  12% to 13% when coadministered with 40 mg 
esomeprazo le compared to 25 mg TAK -906 administration alone i n healt hy subjects 
(TAK -
906-1006).
Coadministration of a single intravenous ( IV)infusion of 600 mg rifampin (a prototypic inhibitor 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) with a single oral dose of 25 mg TAK -906 increased the mean area 
under the concentration

5.2 and 6.2 -fold (TAK -906- 1009). 
The pr olactin increase fo llowing PO administration of single doses of TAK -906M, which was

not increase in a dose -proporti onal manner. There was litt le if any accumulati on in serum  
prolactin concentration wit h BID dosing for 5 day s.
The concentration QT interval wit h Fridericia correction method (QTcF) analysis o f data from 
Study  AT-01C was perform ed using linear mixed effects modeling methods. The analysis 
demonstrated that TAK -906M in single doses from 5 to 300 mg, which resulted in plasma 
concentrations of up to 171 ng/mL, did not have a clinically meaningful effect (<10 msec) on the 
placebo -adjusted change from baseline in QTcF (at relevant concentration range <200 ng/mL).

4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
The prevalence of gastroparesis in the US is 24.2 per 100,000 [1]. The m ost comm on causes of 
gastroparesi sin these countries are idiopathic (~36%) and diabetes (~29%). Domperidone and 
metocl opramide are D 2antagonists, which have been shown to reduce symptoms associated with 
gastroparesi sbut are associ ated wi th serious cardi ovascular (dom peridone) and CNS 
(metocl opramide) side effects. There is, therefore, a significant unmet need for a safe and 
efficacious chronic treatment of gastroparesis in patients. TAK -[ADDRESS_979063] ing 
D2/D3antagonist with minimal known CNS penetration and cardiac effects, likely attributable to 
structural  difference or chemoty pe difference fro m metoclopramide and domperidone. In phase 1 
studi es in heal thy volunteers, TAK -906 dem onstrated suitable PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
properties without the CNS liabilit ies of metoclopramide or cardiac liabilit ies associated with 
domperidone. Given the posit ive on -target effects and good tolerabilit y, TAK -906 is being 
developed for use in patients with gastroparesis .

TAK -906-2002 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
phase 2b study  to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of BID PO administration of TAK -906M 
capsules in adult male and female subjects aged 18 to 8 5 years inclusive, with symptomatic IG or 
DG. 
Pharmacogeno mic (PGx) analysis may be conducted to evaluate the contribut ion of genet ic 
variance and/or gene expressio n on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safet y. 
Parti cipation of  study  subjects i n PGx sample collection is optional.
As PGx is an evo lving science, currently many genes and their funct ion are not y et fully 
understood. Future data may suggest a role o f some of these genes in drug response or disease, 
which may  lead to addi tional hypothesis -generating exploratory  research on sto red samples.
4.5 Benefit/Risk Profile 
Gastroparesis causes nutrit ional compromise, impaired glucose control, and a reduced qualit y of 
life, independent of other factors such as age, tobacco and alcoho l use, or ty pe of diabetes [4]. 
The serious negative impact of gastroparesis on day
-to-day functioning is well- documented both 
for the patient’s deteriorating qualit y of life, productivit y and on the di rect and indirect eco nomic 
burden placed on societ y.
DA receptors D 2and D 3have been shown to be validated targets for gastroparesis since D [ADDRESS_979064] ay 
a role in gastric m otilit y [8-10] . Blocking D 2receptors is associated with a reduction in nausea 
and vo miting and blocking D 3receptors i s associ ated wi th an increase in gastric motilit y [8-10] .
However, DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist domperidone’s
safet y profile includes a risk for 
drug-induced QT prolongat ion, cardi ac arrhy thmia, and death [7], and DA receptor D 2antagonist 
metocl opramide’s neurological safet y profile includes increased risk of  adverse events (AEs) 
related to EPS and the potential for tardive dyskinesia . In addi tion, DA receptor D2/D3
antagonists elevate serum  prolactin levels, w hich may lead to AEs related to reproductive 
endocrino logy such as infert ility, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gyneco mastia, and impotence in 
some subjects.
Consequent ly, there current ly exists a significant unmet medical need because there are no 
approved ther api[INVESTIGATOR_717814].
TAK -906 i s a peri pherally  acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist with a high safet y margin 
between in vitro hERG channel inhibit ion and projected efficacious clinical exposures; no effects 
in dog ECG parameters in nonclinical safety studies, no clinically significant cardiovascular AEs 
in the phase [ADDRESS_979065] been reported with 
the use of metoclopramide. However, TAK -906 i s a peri pherally a cting DA receptor D 2/D3
antagonist with limited CNS penetration expected. As such, the risk of CNS and extrapyramidal 
system  effects are ant icipated to be low. Hy perprolactinemia and prolact in related symptoms are

expected of all D 2receptor antagonists such as domperidone, metoclopramide and neuroleptics. 
However, given the relat ively short (12 weeks) duration of the study , this ri sk is considered 
manageable and risk mit igation measures have been included in this study  to ensure safet y of 
subjects who may devel op hyperprol actinemia or prolact in related symptoms.
Therefore, given the significant unmet medical need and the expected reduced cardiovascular 
and CNS safet y risk and manageabilit y of risk of hyperprolact inemia /prolactin related symptoms
compared wi th other drugs in the cl ass, the benefit -risk profile is thought to be favorable for the 
use of clinically effective doses of TAK -906 in DG/IG subjects.

STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION 6.0
6.1 Study Design
This is a global mult icenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel- group, phase 
2b study  to eval uate the efficacy and safet y of BID PO capsul e administrati on of  a peri pherally  
acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist, TAK -906, in adul t male and female subjects aged 18 to 
85years, inclusive, with symptomat ic IG or DG. Gastroparesis is a disorder of the stomach 
characterized by [CONTACT_717840], in the absence of mechanical obstruction.
The study  is designed to characterize the dose -response relat ionship to support dose selection for 
evaluat ion of subjects to be enrolled in the planned phase 3 studies. 
Subjects will attend the study  site for a screening/consent visit (Visit 1, Day  -35), when their 
consent will be obtained, and general eligibilit y to parti cipate in the study  will be reviewed. After 
signing the informed consent form, subjects will have a blood sample taken to assess their 
laboratory  values. Subjects will discont inue all excluded medicat ions and return to the site 3 to 
17 day s later to perform a 4 -hour 13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_530993] (Vi sit2, Day  -21). Subjects who have

The study  will also be used to perform final validatio n of the ePRO tool (Daily Symptom Diary ) 
[13] for use in the phase [ADDRESS_979077] and minimize potential safet y and tol erabilit y 
concerns. Under Protocol Amendment 8, randomization into the 5 mg dose arm has been 
discontinued. Rando mizat ion into the 5 mg dose arm was halted to improve operational 
feasibilit y in the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic and to reduce the number of subjects being 
exposed to a potentially minimally efficacious dose that likely approaches the lower end of the 
dose response curve .This change wa s not necessit ated by  [CONTACT_45308] y findings. Several drug -related 
param eters were evaluated for dose -selection including safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD. In 
general, oral administration of single (5 to 300 mg) or mult iple (50 or 100 mg BID over 5 days) 
doses of TAK -906 was well tol erated in heal thy mal e and female subjects. Prolactin has been 
used as a measure of target engagement. At a TAK- 906 plasma concentration of approximately 
20ng/mL (~C maxof 50 m g dose), the TAK -906–prol actin concentration relat ionship reached 
near maximum, and wit hout clinically meaningful adverse effects. TAK

Therefore, because of safet y concerns associated wit h the above treatments and the fact that this 
will be a glo bal study  including the US, there is no suitable act ive comparator that can be used in 
a clinical study  of 12 weeks durati on. 
There i s often a s ignificant treatment response to placebo in patients with functional GI disease

that there is a posit ive treatment effect over placebo and not just from baseline to the end of the

study  as it is current ly under development to measure symptoms to evaluate potential new 
treatm ents in DG and IG clinical trials. The ANMS GCSI -DD was based on the original 
Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI ) [18,19], which is the most frequently used 
symptom  severi ty measure in gastroparesis clinical trials and other clinical studies [16,20-27] , 
including the National Institutes of Healt h Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium 
Gastroparesis Registry  study  [
28,29] . 
Efficacy will be based on a significant difference between group means. The primary  endpoint 
will be between group differences on the ANMS CGSI
-DDcomposite score of nausea, upper 
abdo minal pain, early satiety, and postp randial fullness. Furthermore, item level responses will 
be evaluated as secondary  endpoints to determine which symptom item(s) are driving changes in 
the overall co mposite score, and to evaluate if any symptoms within the co mposite score are 
worsening. Of note, bloating will also be recorded using the electronic diary alo ng wit h the other 
symptoms routinely  captured in the ANMS GCSI -DD (nausea, early sat iety, upper abdominal 
pain, postprandial fullness, vo miting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and overall symptom severit y) for ease of patient 
use. Bl oating is being captured as an addit ional endpoint using the electronic diary  and is 
currently not part of the ANMS GCSI -DD.

9.1.3 Physical Examination Procedure
A baseline physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment before first dose of study  drug) will 
consist of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) ears, nos e, throat; (3) cardiovascular system; 
(4) respi [INVESTIGATOR_36517]; (5) GI sy stem; (6) dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; 
(8)musculo skeletal  system; (9) nervous system; (10) lymph nodes; (11) other. All subsequent 
physical examinat ions should assess clinical ly significant changes from  the assessment before 
first dose examinat ion. Any clinically  significant changes from the baseline examinat ion will be 
recorded as an AE.

From  signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study ,and for [ADDRESS_979135] 
dose of study  drug, nonsterilized** male subjects who are sexually  active wi th a female partner 
of childbearing potential* must use barrier contraception (eg, condom wit h or without 
spermicidal cream or jelly). In addit ion, they must not donate sperm during this period. Women 
of childbearing potential* who are partners of male subjects must also use highly  effect ive 
contraception during this period as shown in the list below.

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
*A woman is considered a woman of childbearing potential, that is, fertile, fo llowing menarche 
and until beco ming postmenopausal unless permanent ly sterile. Permanent sterilizat ion methods 
include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state i s defined as no 
menses for 12 months wit hout an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulat ing hormone
(FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a 
postm enopausal state in y ounger women (eg, those <45 y ears old) or wom en who are not using 
horm onal contracepti on or horm onal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months 
of amenorrhea wi th an FSH >40 IU/L or at l east [ADDRESS_979137] regul ar menses, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.
** Ste rilized men should be at least [ADDRESS_979138] had bilateral 
orchi ectomy .
The follow ing procedures apply for contraception and pregnanc y avoidance.
Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as those, alone or in combinat ion, that 1.
resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly and 
correctly ). In this study , where m edicat ions and devi ces containing hormones are included, 
the only acceptable methods of contraception are:
Nonhorm onal methods: 
– Intrauterine device. 
–Bilateral tubal occlusio n. 
–Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the study 
participant) and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgi cal success. 
Horm onal methods:
–Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibit ion of ovulation initiated at least [ADDRESS_979139] d ose of study  drug 
OR combined with a barrier method (male condom, female condo m or diaphragm) if 
for shorter durati on unt il she has been on contraceptive for 3 months:

barrier m ethod (m ale condo m, female condo m, or di aphragm ) if shorter till  she has 
been on con tracepti ve for 3 m onths.
Oral.
Injectable/implantable.
Unacceptable methods of contraception are:2.
Periodic abst inence (eg, calendar, ovulat ion, symptothermal, postovulat ion methods).
Spermicides only .
Withdrawal.
No m ethod at all.
Use of female and male co ndoms together.
Cap/di aphragm/sponge wi thout spermicide and wit hout condom.
Sexual abst inence is NOT an acceptable method of contraception.
Subjects will be provided with information on highly effect ive methods of contraception as 3.
part of the subject infor med consent process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating 
that they  understand the requi rements for avoi dance of pregnancy, donation of ova and sperm 
donati on during the study .
During the study , regul ar urine human chori onic gonadotropin (hCG) p regnancy  tests will be 4.
performed only  for wom en of childbearing potential and all subjects (male and female) will 
receive cont inued guidance with respect to the avoidance o f pregnancy and sperm donat ion 
as part of the study  procedures. Such gui dance shoul dinclude a reminder of the fo llowing:
Contraceptive requirements of the study.
Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in male subjects with pregnant partners.
Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
–Have you used the contracept ion consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
– H ave y ou forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
–Are y our menses l ate (even in women with irregular or infrequent menstrual cy cles a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”).
–Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?
In addi tion to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at screening, female subjects of 5.
childbearing potential must also have a negat ive urine hCG pregnancy test before receiving 
any dose of study  medicat ion [as close as possible and before the first dose of study  
medicat ion, preferably on the same day ].

Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosi s is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be AEs if they are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG retest an d/or conti nued m onitoring of an abnorm al value or finding is not 
considered an intervention. In addit ion, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnorm allaboratory  values or ECG findings are the result of pathology  for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. If the subject 
experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a concurrent medical condit ion, the 
worsening or complica tion shoul d be recorded appropriately an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c concurrent medical condit ion (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) 
any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_717830], seri ous or severe in nature. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures t he change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as an AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening

which pat ients will develop D 2receptor antagonist -induced tardive dyskinesia. 
There i s no known e ffective treatment of established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although in 
some patients, tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to 
months after discont inuat ion of causative agent. 
In subjects with suspected EPS, study drug shoul d be immediately  interrupted, and subjects 
referred for appropriate neurological consultation. If, after neurological consultat ion, EPS i s 
confirmed, study  drug shoul d be discont inued, and the subject withdrawn fro m the study . In the

10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for which possible 
involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the 
drug, such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions and 
concurrent treatments, may  also be responsible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m 
administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_209790], such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions 
and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to st udy procedures should be determined for all AEs.
The rel ationship should be assessed as Related if the invest igator considers that there is 
reasonable possibilit y that an event i s due to a study  procedure. Otherwise, the relat ionship 
shoul d be assessed as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/SAE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.

10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug 
Drug withdrawn: a study  drug i s stopped due to the par ticular AE.
Dose interrupted: the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE. 
Dose not changed: the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study drug.
Unknown: only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been 
taken.
Not a pplicable: a study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, for 
example, the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  drug was al ready  
stopped before the onset of the AE.
10.1.13 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved: subject returne d to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/resolving: the intensit y is lowered by 1 or m ore stages: the diagnosed AE or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the reference range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved: there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosed AE , signs/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the 
observed study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital 
anomaly; the subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolv ed”.
Reso lved with sequelae: the subject recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal : the AEs which are considered as the cause of death . 
Unknown: the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47350]’s participation in the study .

obtained after clinical database lock will be captured through the safet y database wit hout 
limitation of  time.
[IP_ADDRESS] AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subject ive AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing an 
SAE m ust be m onitored until  the symptoms subs ide and any  clinically rel evant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
All subjects experiencing AEs (postdose), whether considered associated with the use of the 
study  drug or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant 
changes in laboratory  values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory  explanat ion 
for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF, whet her or 
not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The fo llowing

analysis will be based on the Week [ADDRESS_979189] to the primary  endpo int. The 2statistical tests for the 
primary  efficacy  analysis are 1 -sided and will be conducted using a 5% level of significance. 
Nominal p -values will be evaluat ed for statist ical significance. In addit ion, point estimates and 
CIs al ong wi th descri ptive statist ics for change from baseline scores in ANMS GCSI -DD at 
earlier time points, will be presented. The MMRM -based analysis assumes that missing data 
followa missing -at-random (MAR) assumption.

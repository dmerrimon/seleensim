 [ADDRESS_658554]  Background: Healthcare professionals have negative implicit biases toward minority and poor patients. Few communication skills interventions target implicit bias as a factor contributing to disparities in health outcomes. We report the protocol from the COmmuNity-engaged SimULation Training for Blood Pressure Control (CONSULT-BP), a trial evaluating a novel educational and training intervention targeting graduate medical and nursing trainees that is designed to mitigate the effects of implicit bias in clinical encounters. The CONSULT-BP intervention combines knowledge acquisition, bias awareness, and practice of bias mitigating skills in simulation-based communication encounters with racially/ethnically diverse standardized patients. The trial evaluates the effect of this 3-part program on patient BP outcomes, self-reported patient medication adherence, patient-reported quality of provider communication, and trainee bias awareness. Methods: We designed a cluster randomized trial of the intervention among cohorts of internal medicine (IM), family medicine (FM), and nurse practitioner (NP) trainees at a single academic medical center. Within each academic year, we aimed to randomize training times to [ADDRESS_658555] year of our study because our study was paused during the COVID emergency. To maintain clinical staff services in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we were not able to maintain the randomization of training role out to all clinics and cohort. We aimed to enroll entire specialty cohorts of IM, FM, and NP trainees over a 3-year period, with each academic year constituting an intervention cycle, with 3 cycles of implementation corresponding to 3 sequential academic years. Due to COVID, we extended enrollment to a 4-year period. Therefore, we analyze these data as cohort study. Primary outcome of blood pressure control is measured at the patient-level for patients clustered within trainees. Eligible patients for outcomes analysis are: English-speaking; non-White racial/ethnic minority; Medicaid recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (regardless of race/ethnicity); hypertension; not have pregnancy, dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or other serious comorbidities that would interfere with hypertension self-control; not enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. Secondary outcomes include trainee bias awareness. A unique feature of this trial is the engagement of academic and 
 [ADDRESS_658556] and implement a training program addressing healthcare. Discussion: Equippi[INVESTIGATOR_509336]. Our novel, integrated approach may improve patient outcomes.  Key words:  implicit bias; medical education; bias awareness; community engagement; simulation training    
 [ADDRESS_658557] clinical decision-making3-6 and interpersonal communication.7 Mitigating clinician bias through targeted training in bias awareness and interpersonal communication skills is a promising strategy for decreasing healthcare disparities for racially, ethnically, and socio-economically disadvantaged persons.8 Few rigorously designed trials of communication skills target implicit bias as a factor contributing to disparities in health outcomes.9,10    To address this gap, we designed a theoretically-grounded, multi-component, training intervention trial called “COmmuNity-engaged SimULation Training for Blood Pressure Control” (CONSULT-BP). The primary aim of the trial is to improve patient outcomes using a training program that combines knowledge acquisition, bias awareness development, and simulation-based communication practice with racially and ethnically diverse patients in order to better prepare clinicians for patient interactions in which implicit bias may affect healthcare outcomes. The clinical focus of the intervention is hypertension management because it represents a challenging public health priority,11,12 with healthcare disparities and clinical outcomes mediated, in part, by [CONTACT_509343]-patient communication, bias13 and unsatisfactory patient experiences of care.14   The current educational arsenal to address racism and bias in healthcare has critical gaps, notably failing to incorporate personal bias awareness and evidence-based bias mitigating strategies into a program of practice and feedback from patients.10 We address these gaps in our trial by [CONTACT_67940] a multi-component “knowledge, awareness, and practice” training model that involves community member and patient representation during the design and operationalization of the educational intervention. This protocol report provides a resource for others seeking to design a trial that evaluates and implements a training intervention to mitigate implicit bias in clinician-patient encounters. Objectives   The aims of the clinical trial are to evaluate the effect of this 3-part, training program on:  1. patient blood pressure outcomes, reported in the electronic medical record (EMR); 2. self-reported patient medication and diet adherence, as measured by [CONTACT_509344] 
 5 Nonadherence Scale15 and the Blood Pressure Self-Care Scale;16 3. patient-reported quality of provider communication, as measured by [CONTACT_509345];[ADDRESS_658558] sub-scale of the Primary Care Assessment Survey;18 and 5. trainee bias awareness, as measured by [CONTACT_509346].19  Version 3.0 updates:  Objectives 2-4 were not possible because the collection of patient self-reported data was precluded due to the COVID emergency.  INTERVENTION Description of the CONSULT-BP Educational Intervention  Core Educational Elements   The three (3) core elements of the educational and training intervention include: 1. trainee knowledge acquisition about healthcare disparities, implicit bias and racism; 2. trainee awareness of personal bias; and 3. provision of skills to mitigate bias, along with an opportunity to practice those skills with authentic standardized patient actors. A Standardized Patient (SP) is a person carefully recruited and trained to take on the characteristics of a real patient thereby [CONTACT_509347] a simulated clinical environment.    To build knowledge, we used National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities-funded e-learning modules about health disparities, implicit bias, and patient-centered communication skills.20 We also deliver evidence-based practice knowledge about hypertension management, because the skills practice cases with SPs focus on hypertension management. To develop personal bias awareness, we use the Implicit Association Tests (IAT)21 with results feedback to the trainee. To develop skills, we present evidence-based strategies to mitigate bias previously tested in a randomized trial by [CONTACT_509348].22 Finally, trainees are provided an opportunity to practice those bias-mitigating skills using high-fidelity simulated clinical encounters with SPs.23 (Figure 1)   Theoretical Framework    The educational intervention and its delivery, conceived in [ADDRESS_658559] key features of an adaptation of Bennett’s intercultural competency framework.25,26 In this theoretical model, to overcome denial about ones’ own implicit biases, learners need to first acquire knowledge and 
 [ADDRESS_658560] integration and recognition of implicit bias within themselves and their clinical encounters. The ultimate goal is to motivate learners to acquire and apply effective communication skills in situations where implicit bias is likely to arise.     Applying the simulation-based training model of repeated practice and feedback for skills acquisition and progression to skill mastery,27 the CONSULT-BP training featured “mock” clinical encounters designed to “activate” trainee biases in the clinical care setting. To replicate the “authentic” experience of implicit bias in clinical care, the CONSULT-BP intervention developed face-to-face simulated clinical encounters with “acting” SPs recruited from local racial and ethnic communities as a foundational component of the program. These face-to-face interactions provided a “contact-based educational intervention.”[ADDRESS_658561] of temporal trends in clinical skill proficiency. 
 7 Version 3.0 updates:  The cluster randomized trial design was not feasible beyond the first year of our study because our study was paused during the COVID emergency. To maintain clinical staff services in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we were not able to maintain the randomization of training within year because the needs of the training program’s provision of clinical services took precedent over the didactic training. Therefore, we analyze these data as cohort study. Setting This trial is being conducted at a single academic safety net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509337], a community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and three outpatient centers. Approximately 40% of medical center’s primary care patients are low income and ~27% non-white. The surrounding community includes 34% of residents that do not speak English at home, 21% are Hispanic/Latinx, and there are large newcomer immigrant and refugee populations. The medical center is a major regional training site for medical students, graduate nursing students, and postgraduate medical residents. The participating training programs include the internal medicine (IM), family medicine (FM) residency training programs, and the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) nurse practitioner graduate school program. Participant recruitment started in September [ADDRESS_658562] 2021. Data collection will continue until November 2021.  Version 3.0 updates:  Participant recruitment started in September [ADDRESS_658563] 2022. Data collection continued until December  2022.   PARTICIPANTS Eligibility Criteria Trainee Enrollment    Training programs assign their own trainees to participate in the intervention. Eligibility criteria for inclusion of trainee measures in the trial’s outcomes analysis are: 1. practice at a clinical site supported by [CONTACT_509349]’s EMR to allow data collection for BP outcome measurement; 2. a 15-week clinical look-back period; and 3. no prior completion of the CONSULT-BP intervention. Trainees are provided a fact sheet and asked to opt-out of the study if they do not want their data used for outcomes analysis. Patient Enrollment 
 [ADDRESS_658564]. Patients eligible for inclusion in the outcome analysis included being: 1. English-speaking; 2. Non-White racial/ethnic minority; 3. Medicaid recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (regardless of race/ethnicity); 4. have hypertension. Exclusion criteria: We exclude patients with pregnancy, dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or other serious medical co-morbidity that would interfere with hypertension self-control, including enrollment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. Secondary patient-reported outcomes of self-reported adherence and quality of communication with providers is measured from a subset of patients meeting the same eligibility criteria who are randomly recruited in periods before and after the training intervention. Intervention Assignment and Recruitment   The educational intervention was integrated into the residency programs in IM and FM, and into the curriculum for DNP students. We initially aimed to enroll entire specialty cohorts of IM, FM, and NP trainees over a 3-year period, with each academic year constituting an intervention cycle, with [ADDRESS_658565] pre-COVID academic year, we randomized training times to 1 of 5 start dates using a stepped wedge design. Our biostatistician used a random sequence generator to assign 5 groups of learners, from within each program, to 1 of 5 staggered intervention training dates within an academic year.  Version 3.0 updates:  Due to COVID, randomization to training times within each academic year was not possible.  Each training program schedulers assigned the trainees according to availability within the learning schedules in order to maintain clinician availability to provide care during the COVID crisis.  However, across all years, the program was delivered over two in-person sessions (and via virtual teleconferencing during COVID), scheduled five weeks apart, to leverage a spaced learning design.30    The sessions were designed to minimize the time burden of the intervention on trainees outside of the classroom. As such, the in-person training sessions combined multiple educational components that trainees completed individually, but as part of an onsite group session. In each educational session, components included: “individual” online didactic modules, online IATs, face-to-face clinical practice simulation with SPs, and “group-based” facilitated debriefing sessions. Originally, training in skills to mitigate the effects of implicit bias detailed by [CONTACT_509350] 
 9 al.22 was addressed as part of the group-based IAT debriefings that preceded case simulations with SPs. Each of the two, in-person sessions lasted about four hours. If trainee participants were unable to attend one of the sessions due to scheduling conflicts, we provided alternative dates for attendance. Version 3.0 updates:  After the first year or the intervention and in response to feedback from learners and faculty and in light of growing awareness of the need to address learner defensiveness in implicit bias education,24 we re-designed subsequent the CONSULT educational program. Implicit bias and mitigating skills were updated and reframed based on strategies described by [CONTACT_509351]:  Respect, Empathize, Listen, Ask about your assumptions, Talk and Engage patients in problem solving (RELATE).31 Cooper’s framework is grounded in what is known about effective communication between clinicians and patients of different racial and ethnic groups and in the Ladder of Inference of Argyris and Senge32,33 about how to interrupt unconscious processes that people follow to make decisions. Further theoretical grounding for the item domains was drawn from early evidence for bias mitigation skills proposed by [CONTACT_509348].22 These original strategies include: 1) individuation, which relies on preventing stereotypic inferences by [CONTACT_509352]34,35 and 2) perspective taking, which involves taking the first-person perspective in the individual with whom you are trying to communicate. RELATE does not retain two controversial elements of Devine’s original strategies, including ‘stereotype replacement’, which involves replacing stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_509338]-stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_509339], and ‘counter-stereotypic imaging’ which involves imagining a representative person that goes against a standardized mental pi[INVESTIGATOR_509340] a group and that represents an prejudiced attitude;[ADDRESS_658566] trainee age, gender, race/ethnicity, training year, whether they are US or foreign-born, and fluency in another language.   Trainee IAT, Explicit Bias Measures, Bias Awareness, and Reaction to the IAT. Trainees are asked to complete online Race/Ethnicity IATs [Black/White, Latino/White]21 and Race/Ethnicity-Medical Compliance IATs [Black/White, Latino/White].37 Trainees were asked about their corresponding explicit beliefs and perceptions of what “other health professionals” 
 10 believe about race/ethnicity and race/ethnicity-related medical compliance in order to assess trainees’ perception of their own bias as being “better than average".38 To assess trainees’ reaction to the IAT, three questions are included from Howell & Ratliff38 using a 4-point scale (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree) to measure the trainees’ degree of defensiveness to the IAT. Trainees also complete a 7-item Bias Awareness Scale, with items assessed on a 6-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) and higher scores indicating greater bias awareness.19 In year 1, these items were collected online during each of the in-person training sessions and included 2 IATs at each session (total 4 IATs).  Version 3.0 update:  After the first year or the intervention and in response to feedback from learners and faculty and in light of growing awareness of the need to address learner defensiveness in implicit bias education,[ADDRESS_658567], emotional response, concern, empathy, listening skills, involvement in shared decision-making, engagement and partnership, BP measurement technique, and global performance. Standardized patient evaluators included simulation center standardized patient staff who participated in hypertension management clinical simulations with the trainees. Standardized patient evaluators were not limited in the number of trainees they could evaluate and provided ratings between September 2018-April 2022.   Version 3.0 update:  The evaluation checklist was organized to reflect the RELATE framework.   Patient Measures    The primary trial outcome is the change in BP as reported in the EMR. Clinical measurements are collected in the 15-week control period prior to CONSULT-BP training period and during a 20-week post intervention period. The main outcome measures in the primary analysis will be systolic and diastolic BP (mm Hg) from the EMR. Analyses will stratify BP control as defined by [CONTACT_509353] 840: controlled HTN defined as SBP of <140/[ADDRESS_658568] patients, or SBP < 150/90 for patients ≥60 years without a diagnosis of diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and uncontrolled hypertension as defined as greater than these values.  
 11 Version 3.0 updates: The original study design also included secondary patient self-reported outcomes including adherence to visits, diet modification and antihypertensive medication use as measured by [CONTACT_509354]-Care Scale,[ADDRESS_658569] Implicit via an internet-based interface. Standardized patient assessments of trainee performance in the simulation lab are entered into the Learning Space data capture system used for all training and evaluation exercises at the clinical simulation lab. Statistical analysis Version 3.0 updates:  To maintain clinical staff services in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we were not able to maintain the cluster randomized stepped wedge design of training role out to all clinics and cohort during the COVID emergency. Therefore, we analyze these data as cohort study.  The first step of statistical analysis was examining the distribution of all data points to identify outliers or errors in the data of primary interest.  Unadjusted analysis of categorical data was conducted with chi-square tests; analysis of continuous data used analysis of variance.  Mixed effects regression models were fit to estimate the relative changes of clinical outcomes (BP values and clinical cut points) for patients seen by [CONTACT_509355] [ADDRESS_658570] linear regression models (logit models for normal and optimal BP categories) were fit with mixed effects for resident ID and for study cohort. All mixed-effect models also contained terms for the additional terms to account for study composition and potential confounders: study population (race and insurance strata), 
 12 clinical department (Family Medicine vs Medicine), age and sex, and relevant clinical comorbidity(diabetes, obesity, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and tobacco use). In order to determine if the study intervention was differentially effective for the different patient groups (ie. white patients with Medicaid and patients of color with either private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid), we modeled interaction terms between 4-level population variable and intervention period.  P-values less than 0.[ADDRESS_658571] 5 eligible patients per 5-week training block (assuming trainees see ~25 patients per outpatient rotation block, of whom ~40% have HTN (n~10), and of whom ~45% are low income). Thus, each trainee will see ~10 eligible patients in the 3-block pre-intervention period, and ~[ADDRESS_658572]-intervention period. We estimate there will be approximately 205 enrolled trainees over a 3 year accrual period, yielding ~205x10 pre-intervention observations (n=2050) and 205x20 post-intervention observations (n=4100) for all patients with HTN, and fewer (control~1025 and intervention ~2050) for participants with uncontrolled HTN (50-70% in minority and poor populations).[ADDRESS_658573] >90% power to detect a [ADDRESS_658574] and implement the educational and training program. To adapt the core educational elements and strategies into a feasible and acceptable intervention, we used a participation action research approach in which investigators collaboratively partnered with stakeholder participants. The goal was to work together to address system-specific issues affecting program operationalization.42 Community stakeholder partners for educational design and delivery were racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse community leaders representing our local patient population. A local community health organization, with whom the study team had a long-standing research relationship, served as the community member recruitment liaison. Key academic stakeholder partners for educational design were School of Medicine and Graduate School of Nursing faculty from our target healthcare system. A separate community-based transformational change organization, with extensive experience in staff bias training and who worked closely with 
 [ADDRESS_658575], and SP training protocols that were integrated into a cohesive, replicable training program. Finally, community members were recruited to be SPs, which created an opportunity for empowerment and equity, as community SP’s provided direct skills feedback to healthcare trainees and contributed their “voice” as equal partners in the team effort to develop and refine the simulation scenarios. We sought to understand whether this creative and novel approach to communication skills training of healthcare professionals catalyzed the motivation of our learners to take their patient communication skills to a higher level of mastery through direct, objective, and specific feedback from individuals of color trained as SPs.26,43,[ADDRESS_658576] created a data safety and monitoring plan and established formal monitoring procedures to closely monitor participant safety, data quality and study progress. A data monitoring committee is not needed since the study is minimal risk.   Monitoring for protocol adherence will be performed monthly to ensure early identification of poor performance. Specific parameters being monitored include psychological harm from the intervention, contact[CONTACT_509356]; all adverse events are reported to the IRB. Our study protocol includes informed consent of the trainees for inclusion of their data in the outcome analysis, and informed consent for the patient questionnaires, and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) waiver for use of medical record data in the aggregated outcomes analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Safety Concerns   We obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at the UMass Chan Medical School. To minimize research-associated risk and to protect the confidentiality of participant data, all investigators and staff involved in this project have completed extensive courses and passed certifying examination on the protection of human subjects in research through Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative training and HIPPA certification. The IRB conducts interim audits per their policies and procedures to assure compliance with standards of trial implementation.

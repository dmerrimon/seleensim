1.0  Purpose of the Investigation  (Background) : 
In 2004, Friedman and colleagues (Friedman, O'Colmain et al. 2004 ) applied age, ethnicity, and 
gender specific rates of age -related macular degeneration to the [ADDRESS_1275826] o ver 3.3 million patients with exudative macular degeneration 
in 2004. These numbers are likely underestimates of the true prevalence of this disease. The majority 
of these patients are receiving intravitreal injection therapy (IVT) multiple times per year in one or 
both eyes. Recent studies have demonstrated that IVT is at least as successful as laser therapy in 
treating vision threatening retinal disease in patients with diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein 
occlusions, resulting in IVT becoming the standa rd of care in these patients as well. In addition, there 
are several novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_908713].   
The rapi[INVESTIGATOR_908714], as IVT is a time 
consuming proced ure. Ophthalmologists perform these injections in busy clinics, frequently treating 
[ADDRESS_1275827] of care (SOC)  is to provide  anesthesia by [CONTACT_908727] -tipped applicators soaked in lidocaine, applying lidocaine gel, or giving a subconjunctival 
lidocaine injection. These methods of anesthesia increase the time for patient preparation by [CONTACT_908728]. The other  commonly  used option  is to provide  anesthesia via topi[INVESTIGATOR_211652] , which is more 
time efficient, but may result in patient discomfort (Blaha, Tilton et al. 2011 , Davis, Pollack et al. 
2012 , Sanabria, Montero et al. 2013 , Xing, Dorrepaal et al. 2014 ). Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a device to provide 
rapid anesthesia of the ocular surface will improve patient comf ort and physician efficiency. A recent 
case report on a patient with an allergy to lidocaine demonstrated that excellent anesthesia is possible 
with the application of ice to the ocular surface. (Lindsell, Miller et al. 2014 ) The cryoanesthesia 
device provides very focal, rapid cooling, resulting in a safer, more reproducible, and more effective 
way of delivering anesthesia to the ocular surface. With over [ADDRESS_1275828] of this device would be significant.

 1.1 Name [CONTACT_331698]:  
Cryoanesthesia device  
1.2 Intended Use of the Investigational Device:  
The cryoanesthesia (CA) device is designed to provide anesthesia to a focal area on the surface of 
the eye immediately  prior to intra ocular injections . The device is a portable, handheld device that 
utilizes thermoelectric cooling to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_908715] a 4x4 mm area on the surface of the eye. It is 
designed to decrease patient discomfort before, during, and after intraocular injections compared to 
current anesthetic methods.  
1.3 Risk Analysis : 
Safety Studies:  
Our confidence in our ability to create a safe device is based on clinical studies that occurred with 
the advent of cryotherapy to treat ocular tumors and retinal tears. The goal of cryotherapy to treat 
retinal tears and choroidal and retinal tumors is to create tissue destruction, and the initial pre -
clinical and clinical safety studies of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_2146] a wealth of histopathologic data that 
has guided our initial safety studies. Chi and Kelman (Chi and Kelman 1967 ) studied corneal 
endothelial viability following the application of cryotherapy at various te mperatures to the cornea 
for 20 seconds. They reported no endothelial cell loss at -10°C with largely reversible cell loss at 
-20°C . Irreversible endothelial cell loss occurred at the temperature of -80°C, particularly in eyes 
treated with a larger probe t ip. Maumenee and colleagues (Maumenee and Kornblueth 1949 ) carried 
out a safety study looking at the toxicity of -78°C applied to a rabbit cornea for 5 sec onds (6 mm 
treatment spot). They found cellular damage within the first 5 days that completely resolved at days 
10 and 12. Curtin and colleagues  (Curtin, Fujino et al. 1966 ) examined the effect of -40°C applied to 
rabbit sclera via histopathology. The temperature was applied until retinal whitening was s een 
(generally 10 -20 seconds). The authors reported minor cell loss at days [ADDRESS_1275829] treatment. In a separate study, 
scleral bursting strength was found to remain stable follow ing 6 cryotherapy treatments of -60°C 
applied for 1 minute each. (Beckman, Leff et al. 1975 )  
More recently, cryotherapy histopathologic damage on human cadaveric eyes was studied using 
atomic force microscopy. 3 eyes were sectioned into 30 scleral sectio ns. A cryoprobe at -80°C was 
used for treatments. Three groups were treated for 5, 10, or 20 seconds respectively (N=6 in each 
group). One group received a sham treatment (room temperature probe applied to sclera, N=6) and 
one group did not come into conta ct with the probe (control, N=6). All scleral sections were 
examined via atomic force microscopy. Lee and colleagues found that eyes treated at -80°C for 5 
seconds showed mild changes in scleral thickness and collagen fibril density (mild increase due to 
inflammation). These changes were more marked in the eyes treated for 10 or 20 seconds. Eyes 
treated for 5 seconds had no significant nanostructural differences in the diameter of collagen fibrils 
compared to controls. There were significant changes in eyes  treated for 10 or 20 seconds. (Lee, 
Choi et al. 2013 ) This study showed that temperatures that are designed to cause tissue damage, and 
are many times colder than our device is capable of achie ving, do not cause significant damage if 
applied for short periods of time. Studies of cryosurgery have demonstrated reversible nervous 
system blockade at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to -10°C, with no pathologic tissue 
damage. (Garamy 1967 )  
Testing Completed – Animal Safety Study:  
Our team completed preliminary safety testing using a specialized and more powerful non -portable 
prototype with  the capability of achieving temperatures as cold as -40°C. We treated 20 New 
Zealand rabbits, utilizing 2 treatment times (10 and 30 seconds) and the following 10 temperatures: 
20°C, 0°C, -5°C, -10°C, -15°C, -20°C, -25°C, -30°C, -35°C and -40°C. Each rabb it received

(Fig 1 ). In all eyes, the anterior segment (cornea, iris, ciliary process, lens and scler a were 
within normal limits, as was the retina and optic nerve.  Of note, none of the eyes treated with -
40C for [ADDRESS_1275833] temperature planned for the 
proposed study is -10C (23F) for 20 seconds.

 Risks of the Proposed Study:  
The primary risks patients will be exposed to relate to those that occur with IVT (SCH, conjunctival 
hyperemia and injection, and corneal keratopathy). The risks of t he CA device include mild ocular 
discomfort secondary to the cold temperature.  
All patients will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_908716] (proparacaine ) prior to focal anesthesia (either CA 
or SOC). These drops will help reduce the occurrence of pre -injection discomfort. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_908717]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_908718] -alone anesthesia prior to intravitreal injections is 
one of the common methods of providing anesthesia and is considered within the standard of care 
for intravitreal injections  (Blaha et al. , 2011 , Davis 2012) .  
Patients receiving  SOC undergo the risk of increased corneal keratopathy. In addition, patients 
receiving the SOC have an increased risk of post injection pain. The risk of mild ocular discomfort 

Protocol v 4.0 10/11/2017             PI: [INVESTIGATOR_908712], MD  
 
Page 5 of 15 
 with CA is mitigated by [CONTACT_908729][INVESTIGATOR_558825].   
   1.3.1  Primary Objective : 
We plan to carry out  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_908719] (CA) device  in minimizing the pain caused by [CONTACT_781776] (IVT)  and 
determine the most effective temperature and time of treatment . Specifical ly, we intend to 
record patients’ subjective injection pain. The study will be carried out in patients receiving 
bilateral injections, and one eye will be anesthetized using the CA device, with the fellow eye 
receiving anesthesia via a topi[INVESTIGATOR_908720] (SOC), a common method  of providing 
anesthesia in current clinical practice . 
   1.3.2  Exploratory  Objective(s) : 
We will measure injection preparation pain, [ADDRESS_1275834] injection pain.  Patients will 
rate ocular irritation immediately after injection as well as 4 and 24 hours after injection (1 – 
no irritation ; 2 – mild irritation  3 – moderate irritation 4 - marked irritation ). Patients will rate 
visual func tion in the treated eye immediately after injection as well as 4 and 24 hours after 
injection (1 – no changes from baseline ; 2 – mild blurring of vision  3 – moderate blurring of 
vision 4 - marked blurring of vision ).  Physicians will record  patients ’ objective response to 
intraocular needle penetration  (1 – no pain/movement; 2 – mild pain/movement 3 – marked 
pain/movement with the injection ). In addition, physicians  will record the following common 
ocular side effects following IVT: subconjunctival he morrhage  (SCH) , conjunctival 
hyperemia, and conjunctival injection. These will be assessed via a slit lamp examination 
performed within 30 minutes and 24 hours of the administration of the intravitreal injection. In 
addition, each eye will be assessed for other signs of anterior segment toxicity, including AC 
reaction  or hypotony.  Patients will be examined or receive a call 1 week after the injection to 
assess any adverse effects .  
1.4 Anticipated duration of the clinical investigation:  
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_1275835] patients receiving bilateral injections receive both injections in a 1 -2 week period  (1 eye at 
day 0, and the second eye by [CONTACT_4475] 14). This is the current standard period between intravitreal 
injections, and is used regardless of the form of local anesthesia delivered. Some patients receive 
bilateral injections during the same clinic visit. First eye treatment  will be randomly assigned to  one 
of the CA treatment groups and the other  eye will be randomly assigned to SOC .

  2.3.1 Screening Procedures : 
  Physician will  verify the need for IVT  prior to beginning the study . 
 2.3.[ADDRESS_1275841] Procedures : 
Device Overview :  
The cryoanesthesia device is a handheld instrument measuring approximately 10 
inches in length and 1.5 inches in diameter. A 4×[ADDRESS_1275842] the eye and cooled to the temperature s etpoint (e.g., -5°C, -7°C, or -
10°C) via activation of a switch on the device. Cooling slows conduction of pain 
fibers in the conjunctiva (outermost layer of the eye) and the sclera (white of the eye) 
to a depth less than a millimeter. The key features of the device include a temperature 
regulating feedback loop to maintain highly accurate temperature control and a 
lockout mechanism to prevent excessive cooling. Two small protrusions on the tip 
leave temporary indentations on the surface of the eye to guide subsequent placement 
of the intravi treal needle. The cooling region of the device is located on a replaceable 
metal tip . An “ON” switch is first activated to cool the contact [CONTACT_908730], 
after which this region is placed against the eye, initiating rapid cooling to anesthetize 
the injection site while simultaneously marking the cooled location. After the 
specified cooling time is reached, the device is removed, i mmediately after which the 
physician performs intravitreal injection.    
 
   Instructions for administering CA : 
All physicians taking part in this study will receive a practical training session on use 
of the prototype prior to study initiation to ensure that they are comfortable operating 
the device.   
 
Injection procedure:  
After obtaining written consent, the brow  above the eye to receive intravitreal 
treatment  will be marked . Next, one drop of proparacaine will be applied into the eye 
to at least [ADDRESS_1275843] a lid speculum in the patient’s eye. A 
drop of betadine will be applied at the site of treatment. The physician or his assistant 
will then act ivate the CA device by [CONTACT_908731] . He or she will review 
the LED display  to verify that the device is set to achieve the cor rect temperature and 
time setpoint s depending on the arm of the study to which the patient is randomized. 
The physicia n will adjust the  temperature and time set  points using the main device  
button  if the y are not correctly entered. The physician will then verbally review the 
selected treatment temperature and time, after which he or she will activate the device  
to enable the device tip to reach the required temperature . Immediately prior to 
placing the device tip against the eye, the physician will press the activation switch , 
after which he or she will apply the device to the surface of the eye. When the timer 
sounds, he or she will remove the device from the surface of the eye. The device tip 
has markers on it that will leave a temporary indentation [ADDRESS_1275844] a drop of betadine on 
the surf ace of the eye at the site marked for the  injection  and wait 20 seconds . The 
physician will then give the intravitreal injection.  
 
The procedure for the patients receiving SOC will be similar to that described above . 
After obtaining written consent, the brow above the eye to receive intravitreal 
Protocol v 4.0 10/11/2017             PI: [INVESTIGATOR_908712], MD  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1275845] a drop of betadine over this spot, wait 20 
seconds and then administer the injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Allocation to Treatment : 
Patients will be randomly assigned to [ADDRESS_1275846] eye receive either 
CA or SOC.  
  [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Adherence/Study Compliance :  
If a patient is does not require, or refus es, an injection in either eye,  they will 
be removed from the study. Because IVT prev ents blindness, the refusal of 
IVT is extremely rare. In addition, it is extremely rare for patient who have 
been determined to need IVT to have improvement in vision prior to IVT . 
If patients withdraw from the study, we will plan to recruit additional pat ients 
to replace them.  
 2.3.3 Follow -up Procedures : 
    [IP_ADDRESS] Procedures to Assess Efficacy : 
Patients will record their subjective pain (pre -injection preparation pain, 
injection pain, and [ADDRESS_1275847] injection pain) using a visual analog scale (1 to 
10, with 10 being severe pain and 1 being no pain). The study coordinator will 
call the patients within [ADDRESS_1275848] injection assessment .  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Procedures to Assess Safety : 
Physicians will record the following common ocular side effects following 
IVT: SCH, conjunctival hyperemia, and conjunctival injection. These will be 
assessed via a slit lamp examination performed within [ADDRESS_1275849],  and will suspend the study if there appears to be 
significantly more ocular side effects following CA. For  the reasons laid out 
Protocol v 4.0 10/11/2017             PI: [INVESTIGATOR_908712], MD  
 
Page 9 of 15

3.0        Repor ting of Adverse Effects to the IRB :   
In accordance wit h applicable policies of the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board 
(IRB MED ), the investigator -sponsor will report, to the IRB, any observed or volunteered adverse 
effect that is determined to meet all of the following criteria: 1) associated wi th the investigational 
device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) ; 2) a serious adverse effect ; 
and 3) an unexpected adverse effect .  Adverse event reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance 
with the respective IRB pro cedures.  
Applicable adverse effects will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 
10 calendar days following the investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective information.  Adverse 
effects which are 1) associated with the  investigational drug or, if applicable, other study treatment or 
diagnostic product(s) ; 2) fatal or life -threatening ; and 3) unexpected  will be reported to the IRB 
within 24 hours of the investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective information.  
Follo w-up information to reported adverse effects will be submitted to the IRB as soon as the relevant

of the eye) and the sclera (white of the eye) to a depth less than a millimeter. The key features of the 
device include a temperature regulating feedback loop that maintains highly accurate and precise 
temperature control and an integrated timer that controls the duration of cooling, both of which 
facilitate sufficient cooling and prohibit excessive cooling.  Two small protrusions on the tip leave 
temporary indentations on the surfac e of the eye to guide placement of the intravitreal needle. The 
cooling region of the device is located on a replaceable metal tip . An “ON” switch is first activated to 
cool the contact [CONTACT_908730], after which this region is placed against the ey e, initiating rapid 
cooling to anesthetize the injection site while simultaneously marking the cooled location. After the 
specified cooling time is reached, the device is removed, i mmediately after which the physician 
performs intravitreal injection.

Safety Features : 
 At maximum power, the device achieves a temperature of -12°C. Any device malfunction 
would result in an increase in this temperature rather than a decrease.   
 Prior studies as well as our own histological studies with rabbits indicate that this minimum 
cooling temperature ( -12°C) is not low enough to cause ocular tissue damage, even with 
extended exposure.  For the purpose of the study, the device will not be set to a temperature 
colder than -10°C. 
 A temperature regulating feedback loop maintains highly accurate and precise temperature 
control, and an integrated timer controls cooling time.  
 The device tip is replaced with a new sanitized or sterile tip before each use to help ensure  
safe contact [CONTACT_908733].  
 Device tip indents the eye surface, guiding subsequent needle placement.  
 Ergonomic and lightweight design, facilitating safe use on or near the eye.  
 Low operating voltage (11 V).  
 
Prototype Description:

 The device uses  thermoelectric (Peltier) cooling to create the low temperature required for 
cryoanesthesia; thermoelectric cooling has the advantages of being lightweight, small, solid -state (thus 
no fluids or moving parts), and electrically driven (thus allowing straigh tforward control of 
temperature). The device uses a unique design for efficient heat spreading in which an inner arm made 
from a thermally conductive metal ( 1 in Fig. 3 : cold arm) is simultaneously cooled by a group of 
Peltier modules ( 2 in Fig. 3 ) and is thus able to achieve a large cooling power and maintain a low 
temperature at the cooling surface on the replaceable tip ( 3 in Fig. 3 ).  This configuration also allows 
the Peltier modules to reject heat to an area of a heat sink ( 4 in Fig. 3 ) that is not on ly large and hence 
efficient but also extended away from the cooling surface, thus allowing a narrow shape with better 
visual clearance during use.

inlet, 6–air vent, 7 –vice-like mechanism, 8 –protrusions  
 
Air is received  from the inlet openings ( 5 in Fig. 3 ) by [CONTACT_908734], cools the fins, and exits through 
vents at a location far from the replaceable tip ( 6 in Fig. 3 ). The location of the vents far from the 
replaceable tip not only reduces parasitic  convection heating at the tip surface but also prevents the 
airflow from drying the eye surface. A rechargeable lithium ion battery pack (28 Wh), which provides 
sufficient energy on a single charge to ope rate the device at -10˚C for approximately one hour (~100 
treatments), can be easily removed from the rest of the device to facilitate simple charging. 
Temperature control is achieved by [CONTACT_908735] 
a thermal sensor and provides appropriate power to the thermoelectric coolers via pulse width 
modulation (PWM) of the DC battery source. While the cooling surface is unable to reach a 
temperature lower than -12˚C when the device is operated at typi[INVESTIGATOR_908722] (20˚C), a 
failsafe automatically powers the device off if the cooling surface falls below -12˚C. Other automatic 
power offs occur if the battery temperature exceeds 60˚C or the heat sink temperature e xceeds 50 ˚C.  
A single button on the device is used to set the cold tip temperature and timer duration, as well as 
power the Peltier modules. Operation of the button comprises: 1) Clockwise rotation to increase the 
cold tip temperature setpoint , 2) Counte r-clockwise rotation to decrease the cold tip temperature 
setpoint , 3) Clockwise rotation while the button is pushed, to increase the timer duration, 4) Counter -
clockwise rotation while the button is pushed, to decrease the timer duration, and 5) Double -pressing 
to activate the Peltier modules. A second tactile button located near the grip position is used to activate 
(or deactivate) the timer. When the timer is activated, the device produces two consecutive beepi[INVESTIGATOR_908723], follo wed by [CONTACT_908736][INVESTIGATOR_908724] 10 seconds during the timer 
duration, and finally two long consecutive beepi[INVESTIGATOR_908725]

 duration has expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]. If the “Timer” button is pushed again before the set time is reached, two sho rt 
consecutive beeps at high and low frequencies occur and the timer is immediately terminated.   
 
A user readies the device by [CONTACT_908737]. A vice -like 
mechanism (7 in Fig. 3 ) is used to provide both convenient ti p replacement and sufficient pressure 
between the replaceable tip and cold arm for good thermal contact . The replaceable tip is coated  by a 
thin hydrophobic polymer layer that mitigates  ice adhesion between the device and tissue. Two small 
protrusions ( 8 in Fig. 3 ) on the replaceable tip leave temporary indentations on the eye surface to guide 
subsequent treatment (e.g., placement of the intravitreal injection needle 3 or 4mm from the corneal 
limbus).  
 
After setting the desired cold tip temperature setpoi nt and timer duration and inserting the replaceable 
tip, the user operates the device by [CONTACT_908738] -pressing the main ( “rotation & push”) button, which 
turns on the Peltier modules and brings the tip temperature to the setpoint (this takes approximately 20 
seconds for a setpoint of -10˚C). He or she then brings the tip into contact [CONTACT_10970]’s eye and 
presses the “timer” button (which responds with a beep). If the timer duration is set to 10 (or 30) 
seconds, the device maintains -10 ˚C for 10 (or 3 0) seconds and then beeps. After the timer duration, 
the device returns to ambient temperature.  
 
 There are no anticipated changes to the device during the course of this study.  
 
5.0    Future Studies:  
We plan to conduct a second phase of the study where we will compare the SOC  to only one 
cryoanesthesia temperature setpoint and one time setpoint, selected after t he analysis of the first 40 
patients .

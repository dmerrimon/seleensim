Title of Study:
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of TAK -935 (OV935) as an Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric Patients with 
Developmental and/or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_352994] (ELEKTRA)
Study Number: TAK-935- 2002 (OV935) Phase: 2
Study Design:
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, study in 
pediatric patients (aged ≥2 and ≤17 years) with Dravet syndrome and Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 
demonstrating ≥3convulsive or ≥4 drop seizures , respectively, per month during the 3 months 
immediately prior to Screening (based on historic alinformation) and ≥3 convulsive or ≥4 drop seizures , 
respectively, during a minimum of 4 weeks during the prospective Baseline Period (based on the seizure 
diary records). Convulsive seizures include generalized tonic -clonic, focal to bilateral tonic -clonic with 
impair ed awareness, hemi -clonic ,and simultaneous bilateral clonic (generalized clonic) seizures. D rop 
seizures are defined as involving the entire body, trunk, or head that leads to a fall, injury, slumpi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a 
chair, or head hitting a surface, or that could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the position of the 
patient at the time of the seiz ure or spell. Examples of seizures causing drop include, but are not limited 
to, atonic, clonic, and tonic seizures.
Approximately 126 patients will be randomized to ensure 112 evaluable patients. Randomization will be 
stratified by 2 categories: patients with Dravet syndrome with convulsive seizures and patients with LGS 
with drop seizures. Stratification will be performed to ensure balance of treatments within each stratum.
The study will begin with a phased enrollment based on age. Patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_439461], 
prior to open enrollment in the study, for assessment of safety. The independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (iDMC) will review the adverse event (AE) profile sof the first 12 patients aged ≥9 years 
completing 4 weeks of treatment across all ongoing pediatric TAK -935 studies , prior to recommending 
treatment for patients aged <9 years.
Study Periods:
This study consists of 2 main periods:
4-to 6-week Screening/Baseline Period
20-week Treatment Period
8-week Dose Optimization Period
12-week Maintenance Period
The Treatment Period consists of the Dose Optimization Period and Maintenance Period.

historical information) and ≥3 convulsive or ≥4 drop seizures , respectively, during a minimum of 
4weeks during the Baseline Period (based on the seizure diary records) will be eligible for entry into the
study.
At the end of the 4- week Baseline Period, patients will return to the clinic (Visit 2 ). Seizure diaries will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_353044] a patient did not meet the eligibility criteria, 
including minimum number of seizures required for the study, the patient will be discontinued from the 
study and considered a screen failure. 
The patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomi zed in a 1:1 ratio to double -blind treatment with 
TAK-935 or matching placebo for the 20-week Treatment Period ( 8-week Dose Optimization Period and 
12-week Maintenance Period).
Dosing and Titration Schedule
All patients will receive TAK -935 twice a day ( BID)orally or via gastrostomy tube (G -tube)/
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube with or without food (patients enrolled in clinical sites 
in China are not to receive study drug via G -tube/PEG tube).
For patients weighing <60 kg, the total daily dose of study drug (either placebo or TAK -935) is 
calculated based on body weight at Visit 1 and will be given BID (Table 1). The selected doses for the 
differ ent weight groups are listed in
 Table 1. For patients weighing ≥60 kg at Visit 1, dosing will be 200 
mg/day followed by 400 mg/day, then 600 mg/day 
(Table 1). Study drug can be taken with or without 
food. For patients aged ≥9 years at Visit 1, the total daily dose of study drug (either placebo or TAK -935) 
is calculated based on body weight at Visit [ADDRESS_439464] 7 days after randomization on Visit 2. In the subsequent phone call 
and visit (phone call 1 [Day 8 ]and Visit 3 [Day 15] ),the study drug dose will be increased to Dose 2 and 
Dose 3. The maximum dose for any patient will be 600 mg/day (300 mg BID). Patients will be contact[CONTACT_353045] 2days following escalation to the maximum dose to assess safety and 
tolerability of the study drug. Study drug dose will be allowed to change in first 6 weeks of Dose 
Optimization P eriod,based on the judgment of the Investigator and with the approval of the Medical 
Monitor . The final dose level will be maintained until the end of the Maintenance Period; however, the 
dose may be decreased to the previous lower doses, for safety and t olerability issues. Patients who cannot 
tolerate Dose 1 will be withdrawn from the study (and will complete the early termination and safety 
follow -up visits).

PK in all patients. The first 12 randomized patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_439465] 12 randomized patients 
aged <[ADDRESS_439466] dose of TAK -935 or placebo in the clinic; PK blood draws will occur 
within 1 hour before the morning dose (pre-morning dose)and 30 min ( ±10 min) and 1, 2, and 4hours 
(±10 min) post-morning dose. After Visit 2 (Day 1), additional PK samples will be collected within 
1hour before the morning dose (pre-morning dose) and 30 min (±10 min) post-morning dose at Visit s
3, 
4, 5, and [ADDRESS_439467] dose of TAK -935 or placebo in the 
clinic, with PK blood draws occurring within 1 hour before the morning dose (pre-morning dose) and 
30min(±10 min )post-morning dose at Visit s
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 during the study.
Concomitant and Prohibited Medications:
Adjunctive antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551] (AED) treatment, (medical) marijuana, cannabidiol products, vagal nerve 
stimulator (VNS) settings, and ketogenic diet should not be altered during the study. Concurrent 
treatment regimen data will be collected throughout the study.
Use of strong inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (prescription medications, OTC 
medications, or dietary supplements) within 30 days before randomization through follow -up is 
prohibited, except for AEDs (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin). Refer to Appendix 4for a 
list of prohibited CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.
Use of perampanel from screening through follow -up is prohibited.
Use of traditional Chi nese medicines should be approved by [CONTACT_353046].
Following completion of the study, patients will have the option to enroll in a long -term (24-month), 
open -label extension study (under a separate protocol, TAK -935-18-001 [OV935] ) or t o enter a 
double -blind taper period (maximum 14 days). During the taper period, the study drug dose will be de -
escalated to a lower dose (taper Dose 3 to Dose 2, taper Dose 2 to Dose 1) every 3 days or less frequently 
based on Investigator’s discretion until there is no de -escalation and study drug dose is discontinued. 
After tapering, the patients will complete a Safety Follow -up visit approximately [ADDRESS_439468] visit in this 
study will be approximately 30 weeks.
An iDMC will monitor the patients’ safety, in accordance with the iDMC charter.
Procedures:
Daily seizure diaries will be used to determine seizure frequency for the evaluation of efficacy.
Bloo d samples for clinical safety laboratory tests (5 .7mL at each sample time point) ,including 
hematology and chemistry, will be collected at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 4 (Day 36), and 
at Visit 6 (Day 141) .One blood sample will be collected (2mL for PD assessment) at Visit 7 (Day 169) , 
the follow -up visit. In addition, urinalysis will be performed at the specified visits.

Page 15of 106Efficacy Analysis Set
All mITT patients whose efficacy assessments are compliant with Protocol Amendment 2 will be 
included in the efficacy analysis set. Efficacy analyses for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will 
be based on the efficacy analysis set.  
Efficacy analyses will be based on each patient’s randomized treatment 
assignment.
Safety Analysis Set
All randomized patients who take at least 1 dose of study medication will be included in the Safety 
Analysis Set. Safety analyses will be based on the medication that was actually administered to each 
patient. 
Stratification by [CONTACT_353047] 2, all eligible patients will be stratified by 2 categories: Dravet syndrome patients with 
convulsive seizures, and LGS patients with drop seizures to ensure balance of treatments within each 
stratum. Note that patients with the minimum number of convulsive or drop seizures will be assigned to 
a stratum following the stratification rules.
Patients with Dravet syndrome :
!46 eligible patients diagnosed with Dravet syndrome with ≥3 convulsive seizures per 28 days 
during the prospective Baseline period will be randomized into the Dravet syndrome stratum.
Patients with LGS (Lennox Gastaut Syndrome):
!80 eligible patients diagnosed with LGS with ≥4 drop seizures per 28 days during the 
prospective Baseline period will be randomized into the LGS stratum.
If a patient does not meet any of these criteria, the patient will be considered a screen failure.
Primary Efficacy Analyses
For the patients randomized to the Dravet syndrome stratum ( ≥3 convulsive seizures per 28 days), 
convulsive seizure frequencies per 28 days for the 4-week prospective Baseline Period and the
Maintenance Period will be calculated.
For the patients randomized to the LGS stratum ( ≥4 drop seizures per 28 days), drop seizure frequencies 
per 28 days for the 4-week prospective Baseline Period and the Maintenance Period will be calculated.
For each patient, percent change from Baseline to the frequency during Maintenance Period (per 
28 days) will be calculated for the seizure type corresponding to the assigned stratum of that patient (convulsive for the Dravet stratum and drop for the LGS stratum). Percent change from Baseline will be 
compared between TAK-935 and placebo using a Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test adjusting for Baseline 
and randomization stratum.
The null hypothesis of no treatment difference will be tested at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
The Mann-Whitney estimator and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing TAK-935 
with placebo will also be displayed.
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
For each patient, percent change from Baseline to the frequency during Treatment Period (per 28 days) 
will be calculated for the seizure type corresponding to the assigned stratum of that patient (convulsive 
for the Dravet stratum and drop for the LGS stratum). Percent change from Baseline will be compared between TAK-935 and placebo using a Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test adjusting for Baseline and randomization stratum.CCI

a two-sided 0.1 level of significance. The Mann-Whitney estimator and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing TAK-935 with placebo will also be displayed.
The primary analysis will be repeated for the 20-week Treatment Period.
For the Dravet syndrome stratum, the proportion of treatment responders based on ≥25% worsening, 
<25% and >1% worsening, no change (Worsening of 1% to Reduction of 1%), ≥25% reduction, ≥50% 
reduction, ≥75% reduction, and 100% reduction from Baseline in convulsive seizure frequency for the 
Maintenance Period will be summarized for TAK-935 and placebo. The 95% CIs for the difference of 
proportions will be displayed for each responder category. For the LGS stratum, the proportion of treatment responders based on ≥25% worsening, <25% and >1% worsening, no change (Worsening of 
1% to Reduction of 1%), ≥25% reduction, ≥50% reduction, ≥75% reduction, and 100% reduction from 
Baseline in drop seizure frequency for the Maintenance Period will be summarized for TAK-935 and placebo; 95% CIs for the difference of proportions will be displayed for each responder category.
Change in CGI-S/C responses of Investigator reported impression of efficacy and tolerability of study 
drug and change in Care GI-C responses of parent/family reported impression of efficacy and tolerability of study drug will be analyzed descriptively.
Techniques for handling missing information with respect to reporting of seizures in the treatment period 
(Dose Optimization and Maintenance) will be specified in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
Safety Analyses
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all safety endpoints, by [CONTACT_1570]. Two-sided 95% 
CIs will be presented where meaningful. Data summaries will be displayed for incidence of AEs, clinical 
laboratory variables, vital signs, body weight and height, ECG parameters, percent myoclonic and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_267901]-free days, as well as changes in behavioral and adaptive functioning measures using 
VABS and sub-scales of ABC-C, as appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Plasma concentrations of TAK-935 and the metabolite of TAK-935 (M-I) will be summarized and 
displayed graphically per nominal time points. Mean plasma concentrations over time will be presented 
graphically.

relationships between TAK -935 exposure or 24HC responses and clinical and safety endpoints. Full 
details of the relevant population PK/PD modeling work (including objectives, relevant endpoints, 
methodology, software, etc.) will be defined in a separate data a nalysis plan or the study SAP , and 
results will be reported separately. The actual elapsed time from dose will be used in the final PK 
modeling and parameter calculations.
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size calculations are based on unadjusted Man n-Whitney (Wilcoxon rank -sum) test.
The randomization will be stratified by 2 categories: Dravet syndrome stratum and LGS stratum. The 
primary endpoint is defined as percent change in convulsive seizures for the patients in the Dravet 
syndrome and percent change in drop seizures for those in the LGS stratum.
Assuming that the mean difference in percentage change from baseline between active and placebo arms 
is 29% for the [ADDRESS_439480] deviation is 42.3%, with 56 patients per treatment 
group, there will be 92% power to test the treatment difference at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Assuming a 10% drop -out rate, [ADDRESS_439481] power of 80%. The following table shows 
the within stratum sample size calculations:
Dravet Syndrome Stratum LGS Stratum

Power 80% 80%
N per group 20 36
N per group (after 10% adjustment) 23 40
Total N 46 80
Interim Analysis:
Plasma concentrations of TAK -[ADDRESS_439483] 12 patients within each category of aged ≥9years and 
<9years will be used to estimate PK parameters using the current population PK model. If needed, 
adjustment to the dose will be made. The frequency of PK sample collection may be changed based on 
results of interim analysis.
Overall and by -stratum (LGS and Dravet strata) futility and interim analyses may be performed. 
Enrollment may be stopped for one of the strata if the treatment effect is not sufficiently strong. If one 
stratum is discontinued, enrollment will continue with the other stratum until the total sample size is 
achieved. Thresholds for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_353002] -specified in the interim analysis plan .

5The revised classification now refers to DEEs. Dravet syndrome (DS) or severe 
myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_353011] e most well-known disorders of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_98593]. Clinically, DS is characterized by [CONTACT_353049], 
followed later by [CONTACT_353050], mainly cl onic and unilateral, of long duration and frequent 
status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE). Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is rare and is one of the most severe forms of childhood epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. The syndrome usually has its onset between the ages of 1 and 
8 years (typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 3 and 5 years), but occasionally it occurs in children who are more 
than 8 years old, even into adulthood. The hallmarks of the disease include: presence of multiple seizure types: the hallmark tonic-atonic seizures; the most hazardous are drop seizures/attacks, 
which can lead to serious injuries and occur in about 56% of patients. Other seizure types include 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_353012], but tonic-clonic, myoclonic, a nd partial seizures are al so frequently present.
The current study is designed to further characterize the effects of TAK-935 on seizure 
frequency using a seizure diary. An additional aim is to explore the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of multiple-dose TAK-935 administration in pediatric patients with developmental and/or

5.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  TAK -935-2002 (OV935) is a Phase 2, mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, parallel -group, study  in pediatri c patients (aged ≥2 and ≤17 y ears) wi th Dravet 
syndro me and LGS demonstrating 
≥3 convulsive or ≥[ADDRESS_439498] ively, per m onth 
during the 3 months immediately  prior to Screening (based on histori cal information) and 
≥3convulsive or ≥[ADDRESS_439499] ively, during a minimum of 4 weeks during the 
prospective Baseline Period (based on the seizure diary  records). Convulsive seizures includ e 
generalized tonic -clonic, focal to bilateral  tonic -cloni c with impai red awareness, hemi -clonic and 
simultaneous bilateral clo nic (generalized clo nic) seizures. Drop seizures are defined as 
involving the ent ire body , trunk, or head that leads to a fall, i njury, sl umpi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a chair, or head 
hitting a surface, or that could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the position of the 
patient at the time of the seizure or spell. Examples of seizures causing drop include, but are not 
limited to, atonic, clon ic, and toni c seizures.
Approximately  126 pati ents will be rando mized to ensure 112 evaluable patients. Randomization 
will be stratified by 2 categories: Dravet syndro me patients wi th convulsive seizures and LGS 
patients wi th drop sei zures. Stratificat ion will be performed to ensure balance of treatments 
within each stratum.
The study  will begin wi th a phased enro llment based on age. Patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_439500], prior to open enrollment in the study, for assessment of safet y. The independe nt 
Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will review the adverse event (AE) profile sof the fi rst
12patients aged ≥9 years com pleting 4 weeks of treatment across all ongoing pediatric TAK -935 
studi es, prior to recommending treatment for patients aged <9 years.
This study  consists of 2 m ain periods:
4-to 6-week Screening/Baseline Period
20-week Treatment Period
-8-week Dose Optimizat ion Period
-12-week Maintenance Period
The Treatm ent Peri od consists of the Dose Optimization Period and Maintenance Period. 
Figure 1illustrates the study  design.
Dravet syndrome patients who have had, on average, ≥[ADDRESS_439501] 
had on average ≥4 drop sei zures per m onth during the 3 months immediately  prior to Screening 
(based on historical informat ion) and ≥3 convulsive or ≥4 drop seizures , respectively, during a 
minimum o f 4weeks during the Baseline Period (based on the seizure diary  records) will be 
eligible for entry  into the study .
At the end of the prospective 4 -to 6-week Screening/ Baseline Peri od, pati ents will  return to the 
clinic (Visit 2). Seizure diaries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_353051]

Date: 11February  [ADDRESS_439519] the option to enroll in an OLE study  (under 
a separate protocol; see Secti on5.1) or to enter a double - blind taper period (maximum 14 days). 
During the taper period, the study  drug dose will be de -escalated to a lower dose (taper Dose 3 to 
Dose 2, taper Dose 2 to Dose 1) every  [ADDRESS_439520] igator’s discret ion 
until there is no de -escalat ion and study  drug dose is discont inued. After tapering, patients will 
complete a Safet y Follow-up vi sit approximately  [ADDRESS_439521] dose of study  drug and 
exit the study .
The Investigator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:
Explaining the correct use of the invest igational agent(s) to the patient/site 
personnel/legal representa tive
Verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly
Maintaining accurate records of study  drug dispensing and accountabilit y
Returning or destroying all unused medicat ion to the Sponsor or its designee at the 
end of the study
Patients or the pati ent’s legal representative (i .e., parent or l egal guardian) will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_353061] a co mplaint or problem wit h the 
study  drug so that the situation can be assessed.
All clinical trial material provided to the Investigator will be stored in a secure and locked place 
and allocated and dispensed by [CONTACT_353062] -response system ( IWRS ). The allocat ion and 
dispensing of the study  drugs will be fully  documented. Detailed records of the amounts of the 
study drug received, dispensed, and remaining at the end of the study will be maintained.
TAK -[ADDRESS_439522] acebo tabl ets/mini -tablets shoul d be administered at approximately  the same t imes 
on each day . The actual  time of all dose administrations prior to PK samp le collection will be 
recorded in the patient’s source documents and transcribed into electronic case report form 
(eCRFs).
7.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized to double -blind treatment at 
Visit2. Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer -generated random 
sequence using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign tablets/mini -tablets containing 
doubl e-blind study  drug to each patient.
To achieve between -group com parabilit y, randomization will be stratified.
At Visit 2, all eligible pat ients will be stratified by 2 categories: patients with Dravet syndrome 
with convulsive seizures, and LGS patients with drop seizures to ensure balance of treatments 
within each stratum .

Date: 11 February 2019 
Page 43of 106Note that patients with the minimum number of convulsive or drop seizures will be assigned to a 
stratum following these stratification rules:
Patients with Dravet syndrome:
!46 eligible patients diagnosed with Dravet syndrome with ≥3 convulsive seizures per
28 days during the prospective Baseline Period will be randomized into the Dravet 
syndrome stratum
Patients with LGS (Lennox Gastaut Syndrome):
!80 eligible patients diagnosed with LGS with ≥4 drop seizures per 28 days during the 
prospective Baseline period will be randomized into the LGS stratum
If a patient does not meet any of these, the patient will be considered a screen failure.
7.4. Continued Access to Study drug
7.5. Blinding
This is a double-blind study.
Emergency unblinding for AEs may be performed t hrough an IWRS. This option may be used 
ONLY if the patient’s well-being requires know ledge of the patient’s treatment assignment.
All calls resulting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by [CONTACT_8784].
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient 
must be discontinued from the study. In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study, the Investigator must obtain specific approval from the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor for the patient to continue in the study.
Unblinding should only be considered for the safety of the patient. If unblinding is deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator can unblind the patient’s treatment allocation 
using IWRS. The Investigator must note the date, time, and reason for unblinding.
The Investigator should inform the Sponsor that the patient was unblinded, however they are not 
required to reveal to the Sponsor the patient’s treatment allocation.
When an AE is an unexpected related SAE, the blind will be broken by [CONTACT_353063]. The blind will be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study (such as the monitors, Investigators , etc.) and those responsible for data analysis and 
interpretation of results at the conclusion of the study, such as biometric s personnel. Unblinded 
information will only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the safety reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committees, and/or IRBs.
Investigators will receive only blinded information unless unblinded information is judged 
necessary for safety reasons.CCI

7.7. Treatment Compliance
Patient compliance with study medication will be assessed at each visit. On in-clinic dosing days, 
after administration of study drug, appropriate mouth and/or hand checks will be performed to ensure that the dose is swallowed and noted in the source document. If a site visit is not possible 
during the morning hours, the patient should take their morning dose prior to attending the visit 
during the afternoon hours. The date and time of dose given in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and on the eCRFs.
Patients and/or patients’ caregivers will be required to bring study drug/unused study drug and 
the daily recording in the dosing card to each dispensing site visit. All patients and/or patients’ caregivers should be re-instructed about the dosing requirements during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the patient 
source records.
Patients who are significantly noncompliant will be discontinued from the study. A patient will 
be considered significantly noncompliant if he  or she intentionally misses more than 20% of 
study medication during the study. Similarly, a patient will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she is judged by [CONTACT_353064].CCI

8.1.4. Neurological Examination Procedure
A separate neurological examination will be performed and collected in the eCRF. This will 
include testing mental status, gait, cerebellar function, cranial nerves, motor function, and 
sensation.
8.1.5. Weight and Height
Weight and height are to be measured while the patient is wearing indoor clothing and with 
shoes off. If unable to obtain height or wei ght, data may be collected  from other sources
(e.g., medical records or the patient’s caretaker). The Investigator must document in the source 
document the reason for not obtaining height or w eight (e.g., the patient is in a wheelchair).
8.1.6. Vital Signs Procedure
Vital signs to be measured are temperature, blood pressure, heart rate (beats per minute), and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. 
Vital signs should be measured at the same time of  day across visits, if possible. When vital 
signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draw will take priority and vital 
signs will be obtained within 15 minutes before or after the scheduled blood draw, if possible.
All vital signs data collected at study visits will be recorded on the source documents and in the 
eCRF.
8.1.7. Seizure Diary Procedure
The seizure diary is an observer-reported clinical outcome assessment measure that captures the 
total number of motor seizures (i.e., drop seizures,  tonic-clonic, tonic, bilateral clonic, atonic, 
myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, focal seizures with bilateral hyperkinetic motor features) by [CONTACT_24975], in accordance with the new seizure classification system .
7Patients and/or 
patients’ caregivers will be the observers and reporters in the current study. Patients and/or 
patients’ caregivers may record seizures throughout the day and must ensure that the daily diary 
assessment is completed each evening, even if no seizures occurred.
Drop seizures are defined as a seizure involvi ng the entire body, trunk, or head that leads to a 
fall, injury, slumpi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a chair, or head hitting the surface, or could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the position of the patient at the time of the attack or spell. Drop seizures will be 
counted separately for patients enrolled in LGS stratum (e.g., tonic seizures or generalized tonic 
clonic seizures leading to a drop will be captured as a drop). Convulsive seizures include CCI

report form s(eCRFs).
8.1.9. Documentation of Concomitant Medications
Concomitant medicat ion is any drug given in addit ion to the study  drug. These may  be
prescribed by  a physician or obtained by  [CONTACT_353067]. Concomitant medicat ion is 
not provi ded by  [CONTACT_1034]. At each study  visit, pati ents and/or caregivers will be asked
whether patients have taken any medicat ion other than the study  drug (used from signing of
inform ed consent through the e nd of the study ), and all  medicat ion including vitamin 
supplements, over -the-counter m edicat ions, and herbal preparat ions, m ust be recorded in the 
source document and eCRF. Documentation will include generic medication name, dose, unit, 
frequency , route of administration, start and end dates, and reason for use.
AED treatment, VNS settings, and ketogenic diet should not be altered during the study .
8.1.10. Documentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions
Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing condi tions or di seases that are 
present at signing of informed consent. These include clinically  significant l aboratory , ECG, or 
physical examinat ion abnormalit ies noted at Screening (Visit 1), according the judgment of the 
Invest igator. The condit ion (i.e., diagnosis) should be described and recorded on the Medical 
History  form.
8.1.11. Procedures for Clinical Laboratory Samples
Blood and urine samples are to be collected at the time points stipulated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 3). Sam ples will be collected in accordance wit h acceptable laboratory

Page 48of 106The clinical laboratory  tests to be performed are listed in Appendix 2.
For an individual pat ient, the maximum vo lume of blood collected over the c ourse of the study  
will be 73.2 mL (Appendix 3). As this is a pediatric study , blood vol ume limitat ions will 
sometimes preclude the co llection of all samples in a particular study  visit.
 Appendix [ADDRESS_439528] ing guidelines for blood sample volume limits (ranging fro m 1% to 5% of total 
blood volume wit hin 24 hours and up to 10% of total bl ood vol ume over 8 weeks) are consistent 
with the limi ted evidence available on “minimal risk” to children. Examples of guidelines for 
blood draw limit s in pediatrics can be found at: h ttp://www.who.int/bullet in/volumes/89/1/BLT -
10-080010- table - T2.ht ml.
Thecentral  laboratory  will perform  laboratory  tests for hem atology, serum  chemistry , and 
urinalysis. The results of clinical laboratory  tests will  be returned to the Invest igator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. The Investigator wi ll maintain a copy  of the 
laboratory  accredi tation and the reference ranges for the laboratory  used.
If pat ients experience ALT or AST >3 × ULN, follow- up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum 
alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, GGT, and INR) should be performed preferably 
within [ADDRESS_439529] ease refer to 
Secti on6.3.1 for discontinuat ion criteria and Section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting requirements related to

8.1.13. ECG Procedure
A 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1) and at 30 min (±10 min) after the morning 
dose at other visit s. If the pati ent cannot tol erate being supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], a sitting ECG may  be obtained. 
The Investigator (or a qualified observer at the study  site) will  interpret the ECG using 1 of the 
following categori es: wi thin norm al limits, abnormal  but not clinically significan t, or abnorm al 
and clinically  significant. The interpretation of the ECG will be recorded in the source 
docum ents and in the eCRF. The time that the ECG was performed will be recorded. The
following parameters will be recorded on the eCRF from the pat ient’s ECG trace: heart rate, RR 
interval , PR interval, QT interval, QRS interval with QTcF, and corrected QT interval. ECG 
traces recorded on thermal paper will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_353017].
8.1.14. Clinical Assessment of Suicidal Ideation an d Behavior
Suicidal  ideati on and behavi or will  be assessed in children aged ≥6 years by [CONTACT_179708] 
C-SSRS. The C- SSRS is a 3- part scale that measures suicidal ideat ion (e.g., pati ent endorses 
thoughts about a wish to be dead or has other thoughts of su icide), intensit y of ideation 
(frequency), and suicidal behavior (actually, interrupted, and aborted attempts at suicide)
.8
Two versions of the C-S SRS will be used in this study , the Screening/Baseline C- SSRS Lifet ime 
and the Since -Last-Visit C-SSRS.
Study  staff trained in the administration of the C -SSRS will assess patient suicidalit y using the 
C-SSRS, elicit ing answers fro m the pati ent or the pati ent’s caregiver . Ultimately, the 
determinat ion of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on the clinical judgment 
of the invest igator .
If a patient exhibits signs of suicidal ideation, the patient may  be discont inued as described in 
Secti on 6.3.[ADDRESS_439535]
Behavior will be assessed by  [CONTACT_353068] -C questi onnaire, which is a rating scale that 
measures the severit y of a range o f probl em behaviors comm only observed in individuals wit h 
intellectual  and devel opmental  disabili ties.9It is completed by  [CONTACT_18629]. It i s an empi[INVESTIGATOR_353018] 5 domains wit h 58 i tems: irritabili ty, agitation, and crying (15 items); 
lethargy , social  withdrawal  (16 i tems); stereoty py (7 items); hyperact ivity/nonco mpliance 
(16items); and inappropriate speech (4 items).

Page 50of 106If the patient is unable to comply wit h the ABC -C,for example due to the l anguage barri er 
(e.g.,unavailabilit y of validated test in patient’s language) ,the Invest igator may also use clinical 
judgment to assess for behavior.
8.1.16. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale
The Vineland Adapt ive Behavior Scales, 3rd Edit
ion, Parent Caregiver Form (VABS -3 Parent 
Caregiver Form), is a parent -report questionnaire of adaptive funct ioning or how an individual 
behaves in their day -to-day life at ho me and in the communit y.10It assesses adaptive funct ioning 
across 4 domains : probl em behavi or, communicat ion, daily living, and socialization. The 
questionnaire takes about 20 minutes to complete.
If the patient is unable to comply wit h the VABS , for example due to the language barrier 
(e.g.,unavailabilit y of validated test in patient’s l anguage), the Invest igator may also use clinical 
judgment to assess for adaptive funct ion and behavior.

emotional wellbeing, behavi or, general  health, and general qualit y of life.
8.1.18. Sleep Disruption Numerical Rating Scale
The patient’s caregiver will be asked:
“On a scale o f ‘0 to 10’, please circle the number that best describes y our child’s sleep 
disrupt ion in the last week.”
The m arkers range from 0 (slept extremely  well) to 10 (unable to sleep at all). If the main 
caregiver is not available at the appropriate visit then this information can be captured over the

Caregiver Global Impression of Change (Care GI- C)
At Visit 2 (prior to administration of the first dose of study  drug), the caregiver will be asked to 
write a brief descript ion of the patient’s overall condit ion as a memory aid for the Care GI -C at 
subsequent visits.
The Care GI -C com prises the foll owing question to be rated on a 7 -point scale:
Since y our child started treatm ent, pl ease assess the status of y our child’s overall condit ion
(com paring their condit ion now to their condit ion before treatment) using the scale below.

If the main caregiver is not available at the appropriate visit then this information can be 
captured over the telephone, ideally on the day of the visit or otherwise within 3 days.
8.1.20. Clinician’s Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Change (CGI-S/C)
CGI-Severity (CGI-S) is used to obtain an asse ssment of symptoms severity. The CGI-S focuses 
on clinicians’ observations of the patient’s cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance 
since the beginning of the study . The CGI-S/C measure s improvement from the first assessment.
The CGI-S is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of 
responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).
For the CGI-Change (CGI-C) treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic 
efficacy and treatment-related AEs and range fro m 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) 
and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). Each component 
of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.

1. The screen failure data should be entered as a screen failure patient.
2. Rescreened patients should be assigned a new patient ID number and treated as a 
stand-alone patient.

product, whether considered related to this medicinal product.
The definit ion of an AE also covers medicat ion errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the 
protocol  only  if an AE resul ts from the error, including in tentional misuse, abuse, and overdose 
of the product. Adverse events (including S AEs)associ ated wi th overdose should be reported 
according to the procedure outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . In the event of drug overdose, the patient 
shoul d be treated symptomat ically .
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admissio n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-exist ing disease(s) or 
condi tion(s) present or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen are not AEs.
Ovid has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish drug effect.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  drug are to be 
reported. Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory  reporting and 
drug safet y evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s pre -exist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatm ent in 
the study .
Seizures in this pat ient population will be measured using the seizure diary and seizure frequency 
as a primary study  endpoint (see Secti on8.1.7 ). For the purpose of this study , reporting of 
seizures should meet the AE/SAE reporting requirements. As seizures are considered a baseline 
condi tion, seizures shoul d be reported as an AE/SAE if: 1) there is a clear increase in the 
frequency  of seizures co mpared to the pati ent’s baseline, 2) there is an emergence of a new 
seizure ty pe, or 3) the patient experiences status epi[INVESTIGATOR_80339], and 4)any other time the 
Invest igator feels the seizure should be captured as an AE/SAE, in which case the Investigator 
shoul d docum ent his/her reasoning. All seizures will be captured in the seizure diary  collected at 
the site during the study  and will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_353070] h the reportable SAEs in 
evaluat ing risk:benefit. The Sponsor will report the SAE events of seizure that meet these criteria 
in an aggregated unblinded report at the conclusio n of the stud y.
After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, site personnel will record any change in the 
condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs. If a pa tient experi ences an AE after 
signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study  drug, the event will be reported, but will 
be included in the patient’s medical history  unless the event is serious, or the Invest igator feels 
the event may have been caus ed by a protocol procedure.
In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study drug must be 
reported to Ovid or its designee via the eCRF.

Protocol TAK-935-2002 (OV935) Amendment 2 OvidTherapeutics, Inc.
Date: 11February  [ADDRESS_439538] igators will be instructed to rate the severit y of AEs using the following cri teria:
Mild Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities.
Moderat e Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause som e interference with functioning.
Severe Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.
Change in severit y of an AE shoul d be docum ented based on specifi c gui delines in the eCRF 
Com pletion Guidelines.
Severit y and seri ousness m ust be differentiated: severit y describes the intensit y of an AE, while 
the term  seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality Assessment
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Ovid or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or study  drug via the CRF.
An Invest igator causalit y assessment (unrel ated or rel ated) m ust be provi ded for all  AEs (bot h 
serious and non -serious). This assessment m ust be recorded in the CRF and any addit ional forms 
as appropri ate.
Relationship of AEs to the defined study  treatm ent (TAK -935 [after the start of TAK -935 on 
Day 1]), will  be determined by [CONTACT_353071]. Please note 
that not all criteria must be present to be indicat ive of a particular relat ionship.
Not Related Exposure to the defined study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE is 
not reasonably related in t ime
Unlikely Related The AE occurred in a reasonable time after the defined study treatment and is 
doubtfully related to the investigational agent/procedure
Possibly Related The defined study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE 
could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_353072], and the AE 
was more likely explained by [CONTACT_25313], or the defined study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Ovi d or i ts desi gnee via CRF the circumstances and data leading 
to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuat ion of treatm ent.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent. If a patient 
experiences an SAE after signing informe d consent, but prior to receiving study  drug, the event 
will be reported, but will be classified as a pre -treatm ent SAE unl ess the Investi gator f eels the 
event m ay have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.

Study  site personnel  must al ert Ovi d or i ts desi gnee of  any SAE within [ADDRESS_439539] igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If  alerts are i ssued via tel ephone, they  
are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official  notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This
24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow -up SAE
inform ation.
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in 1 or m ore of the fo llowing outcom es:
Results in death
Requi res or prol ongs hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094]
Is life threatening (that is, immediate risk of dying)
Persi stent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y
Congenital ano maly or bi rth defect
Other medically important serious event
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_328448], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeop ardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events occurring up to and including the patient’s last study  visit will  be 
collected, regardless of the Investiga tor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_353023].
If an Invest igator becomes aware of SAEs occurring to a patient after the patient’s participat ion 
in the study  has ended (including any  protocol -requi red post -treatm ent follow-up), the 
Invest igator should report the SAEs to the sponsor, regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of 
causat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the Invest igator identifies as related to study  drug or procedure. [LOCATION_002]
21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated 
detailed guidance or national regulatory  requi rements in parti cipat ing countries require the 
reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Ovid has procedures that will be fo llowed f or the recording and expedited 
reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regul ations and the associated detailed 
guidance.

Date: [ADDRESS_439540] be recorded in the eCRF upon awareness.
Any AE that meets SAE criteria ( Section [IP_ADDRESS])  must immediately (i.e., within 1 business day) 
be sent to the Sponsor upon learning of any SAE that occurs (whether or not attributable to the study drug). It is the I nvestigator’s responsib ility to ensure that SAE re porting procedures are 
followed appropriately. All SAE reports and any revisions to an SAE report must be sent to the 
following fax number or email. All supporting source information concerning the SAE (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]) should als o be provided by [CONTACT_40743].
Country-specific fax numbers will be provided in a separate document.
Email : 
If there is a question concerning an SAE, the site needs guidance regarding reporting of an SAE, 
the site is returning a call from the Sponsor’s safety specialist, or the site urgently needs to report 
an SAE or make the Sponsor aware of an SAE, the safety hotline should be used(country-specific hotline numbers provided in a separate document).
If an SAE is reported via the hotline, the site should first submit the SAE paper form and then 
enter the SAE in the eCRF. Any AE that meets SAE criteria must be entered into the EDC 
system immediately (i.e., within 1 business day)  after site personnel first learns about the event 
in addition to faxing/emailing the SAE Report form. Once the qualifying SAE data are entered 
into EDC, the Sponsor will be notified by [CONTACT_183004], which will contain high-level safety information.
All SAEs must be reported starting from the time that informed consent for study participation is 
provided. If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the patient’s last 
dose of study drug or within [ADDRESS_439541] be followed until the event resolves, the event or sequelae stabilize, or it is unlikely 
that additional information can be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts (i.e., the patient or health care practitioner is unable to provide additional information, or 
the patient is lost to follow up). Serious AEs that occur more than [ADDRESS_439542] dose of 
study drug need not be reported unless the Investigator considers them related to study drug.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Reporting Requirements
The Sponsor or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteri a. This protocol will use Appendix A of the 
current IB as the Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE 
will be determined by [CONTACT_353073].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator Reporting Requirements
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. 
It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will 
also be notified of all S[LOCATION_003]R events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible 
for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs.[COMPANY_003]

8.3.2. Exposure During Pregnancy and/or Lactation
TAK -935 shoul d not be adm inistered to pregnant and lactating females because the potential for 
adverse reactions to TAK -935 in pregnant females, fetuses, and nursing infants is unknown.
Pregnancy data will be collected during this study  for all  patients. Exposure during pregnancy 
(also referred to as exposure in -utero [EIU]) can be the result of either maternal exposure or 
transmissio n of drug product via semen fo llowing paternal  exposure.
For all Ovid products, both in development or post -approval, exposure during pregnancy must b e 
recorded and the patient fo llowed unt il the outcome of the pregnancy is known (spontaneous 
miscarri age, el ective terminat ion, normal birth, or congenital abnormalit y), even if the patient 
discontinues study  drug or di scont inues from the study .
If a patie nt within this study  or a pati ent’s partner beco mes pregnant while treated or exposed to 
study  drug, the Invest igator must submit a pregnancy form to Ovid via the same method as SAE
reporting. Pharmacovigilance will supply the Investigator with a copy  of a“Pregnancy Reporting 
and Outcom e Form /Breast Feeding.” When the outcome of the pregnancy  becomes known, the 
form shoul d be com pleted and returned to Ovid or Ovid Pharmacovigilance delegate. If
additional follow-up is requi red, the Invest igator will be requested to provi de the inform ation.
Exposure of an infant to an Ovid product during breastfeeding must also be reported and any  
AEs experienced by  [CONTACT_58076] m ust be reported to Ovid Pharmacovigilance or designee via 
Email or fax ( Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Pregnancy is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that study  drug may  have 
interfered wi th the effectiveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. However, complicat ions of 
pregnancy and abnorm al outcom es of pregnancy are AEs and may  meet cri teria for an SAE 
(such as ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or 
congenital ano maly). El ective abortions without complicat ions should not be reported as AEs.

10.1. General Considerations
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3 or higher. All clinical study 
data will be presented in patient data listings. Data summaries will be presented for all endpoints 
and will include descriptive statistics (number of patients [n], mean, standard deviation [SD], 
first quartile [Q1], median, third quartile [Q3], minimum and maximum) for continuous 
variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables. If there are
missing values, the number of missing will be presented, but without a percentage. For all 
analyses, ‘Baseline’ refers to the prospective 4-week Baseline Period.
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate.
10.2. Stratification by [CONTACT_353047] 2, all eligible patients will be stratified by 2 categories: patients with Dravet syndrome with convulsive seizures, and patients with LGS with drop seizures to ensure balance of 
treatments within each stratum. Note that pa tients with both the minimum number of convulsive 
and drop seizures will be assigned to a stratum following the noted rules.
Patients with Dravet syndrome:
!46 eligible patients diagnosed with Dravet syndrome with ≥3 convulsive seizures per
28 days during the prospective Baseline period will be randomized into the Dravet syndrome stratum
Patients with LGS:
!80 eligible patients diagnosed with LGS with ≥4 drop seizures per 28 days during the 
prospective Baseline period will be randomized into the LGS stratum
If a patient does not meet any of these criteria, the patient will be considered a screen failure.

10.9.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses
For the pati ents randomized to the Dravet syndrome stratum ( ≥3 convulsive seizures per 
28days), convulsive seizure frequencies per 28 days for the 4 -week prospective Baseline Period
and the Mainte nance Period will be calculated.
For the pati ents randomized to the LGS stratum ( ≥4 drop seizures per 28 days), drop seizure 
frequencies per 28 day s for the 4 -week prospective Baseline Period andthe Maintenance Peri od 
will be calculated.
The seizure frequency per 28 days in a study  period will be calculated as
(# of seizures) / (# of days seizures were assessed) 28
For each patient, percent change fro m Baseline to the frequency  during Maintenance Period (per 
28 day s) will be calculated for the seizure t ype corresponding to the assigned stratum of that 
patient (convulsive for the Dravet and drop for the LGS stratum). Percent change fro m Baseline 
will be co mpared between TAK -[ADDRESS_439552] acebo using a Mann -Whit ney (Wilcoxon) test 
adjusting for Baseline seizure frequency and randomizat ion stratum.
The null hypothesis of no treatment difference will be tested at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_439553] imator and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) 
comparing TAK -[ADDRESS_439554] ing for Baseline drop 
seizure frequency. The Mann -Whitney estimator and the corresponding 95% CI comparing 
TAK -935 wi th placebo will  also be displayed.
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be repeated for the 20-week Treatment Period.
For the Dravet syndro me strata, the proportion of treatment responders based on ≥25% 
worsening, <25% and >1% worsening, no change (Worsening of 1% to Reduction of 1%) , 
≥25% 
reducti on, ≥50% reducti on, ≥75% reducti on, and 100% reduction from Baseline in convulsive 
seizure frequency for the Maintenance Period will be summarized for TAK -935 and placebo. 
The 95% CIs for the difference of proportions will be displayed for each responder category. For 
theLGS stratum, the proportion of treatment responders based on ≥25% worsening, <25% and 
>1% worsening, no change (Worsening of 1% to Reduction o f 1%), ≥25% reduction, ≥50% 
reducti on, ≥75% reduction, and 100% reduction from Baseline in drop seizure frequency for the 
Maintenance Period will be summarized for TA K-935 and placebo; 95% CIs for the difference 
of proportions will  be di splayed for each responder category .

Page 84of 1065. Changed the follow -up visit from a phone call to a clinic visit
Description of Change : The Follow -up P eriod previously consisted of a phone call with the 
option to have fo llow-up assessment performed at the clinic. This Follow-up V isit is now a 
clinic visit with final assessments forconcomitant medicat ions, vital signs, physical 
examinat ion, neuro logical examinat ion, collect ion of seizure diary, plasma sample for 24HC,

investigate the PK in all pat ients. The first 16 12 rando mized pat ients aged ≥[ADDRESS_439572] 16 12 randomized patients aged <[ADDRESS_439573] d ose of  TAK -935 or 
placebo in the clinic; PK blood draws will occur within 1 hour before the morning dose ( pre-
morning -dose) and 30 min (±10 min) and 1, 2, and 4 3, and 5 hours (±10 min) after the first
morning dose. After Vi sit 2 (Day  1), addi tional PK sam ples will  be collected within 1 hour 
before themorning dose (pre-morning -dose)and 30min (±10 min) post-morning -dose (1 to 5
hours after the dose) at Visit s3, 4, 5, and [ADDRESS_439574] dose of TAK -935 or 
placebo in the clinic, with PK blood draws occurring within 1 hour before the morning dose

4, 5, and 6 4, 5, 6, and 7 during the study.
Rationale for Change :No window was previously provided in the protocol; adding a window 
grants flexibilit y to the si tes in collect ion of this sample. The phrase “wit hin 1 hour before 
dose” was not previously consistent throughout the protocol. Adjusted the visit days to reflect 
new schedule of phone calls and visits. The PK sampling times were changed to better capture

revised fro m during the Treatm ent Peri od to during the Maintenance Period, and the 
proporti on of  patients with LGS considered treat ment responders in patients and pat ients with 
Dravet Syndro me considered treatment responders was revised fro m during the Treatment 
Period to during the Maintenance Period. 
The PK secondary  endpo intwas revised as fo llows:
Correl ation ofTAK -935 concentra tion and plasma 24HC levels withseizure frequency
To characterize plasma 24HC levels and change in seizure frequency in pat ients treated 
with TAK -935 as an adj unctive therapy
Rationale for Change :Because the primary  objective was changed to the Maintenance 
Period, the secondary  objective was changed to the Treatment period to evaluate the changes 
in seizure frequency that may potentially  occur earlier, i e, during the ent ire treatm ent peri od.
Consistent with the primary  objective/endpoint and give n the importance of the responder 
analysis, the frequency o f patients considered as treatment responders waschanged to the 
Maintenance Period (last 12 weeks of treatment).
The PK secondary  object ive of the correlat ion of 24HC levels wit h seizure frequency is more

ABSTRACT  
Context:  Orkambi  is a novel FDA approved  (August, 2018) therapy for use in patients with 
cystic fibrosis ( CF) who are [ADDRESS_151079] of Orkambi  treatment for this 
unique younger ( 2 to 5 years) patient cohort . This proposal extends our previous highly 
informative nutrition and weight gain investigation of ivacaftor treatment in people  with CF 
gating mutations to another CFTR modulator treatment ( Orkambi ) in people homozygous 
for F508del mutations . 
Objectives : The primary aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of 24 weeks of 
Orkambi  treatment in 2 to 5 year old subjects with CF homozygous for F508del mutations 
on sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133436] e, growth status and gut health and function in 
n=32 children ages 2.0 to 5.9 years of age.  P rotocol evaluations will occur at  baseline (pre -
treatment) and [ADDRESS_151080] in young subjects  with CF will be explored. All 
subjects will be evaluated as outpatient at The Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684], and will 
be recruited both regionally and nationally to ensure timely enrollment.  
Study Design : Obse rvational prospective study with evaluations before and after 24 weeks 
of Orkambi  treatment.   An interim assessment at  12 weeks will also be included.  
Setting/Participants : Thirty -two subje cts ages 2 to 5 years of age with CF  homozygous for 
F508del mutations who are in a general state of good health from CF centers  in US and 
Canada .  
Study Interventions and Measures : Subjects will be evaluated before and after Orkambi  
treatment for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133437], weight and BMI, BMI Z score , gut 
health and function  as indicated by [CONTACT_133465], fecal elastase and fecal calprotectin .  
Dietary intake, growth status  for stature (length/ height ), body composition,  and serum fat 
soluble vitamins, bile acids and cal protectin will also be assessed.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Nutritional Impact of Orkambi  Treatment in 2 to 5 Year Old Children 
Homozygous for F508del Mutations   
Funder  Vertex Pharmaceutical , Inc.  and CHOP Center for Human 
Phenomic Science and Nutrition Center  
Study Rationale       Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by [CONTACT_133466] 
(CFTR), a chloride channel in many types of cells. Mo st CF 
mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell 
surface (synthesis and processing mutations) or impair channel 
function (gating or conductance mutations).  Orkambi is a novel 
approved therapy for use in people homozygous for the F508de l 
mutation in the CFTR gene.  It is a combination of lumacaftor (VX -
809) and ivacaftor( VX -770)  th at addresses both the processing 
and gating defects of the F508del mutation.  The small -molecule 
corrector lumacaftor corrects the F508del processing defect a nd 
increases epi[INVESTIGATOR_133438]1. Ivacaftor is a CFTR 
potentiator that in creases the channel open probability in F508del -
mutant CFTRs that undergo epi[INVESTIGATOR_133439]2-4.  In a 
randomized, doubled -blind, placebo -controlled trial of 1108 subjec ts 
homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation (12 years of age and 
older), Wainwright et al5 demonstrated  that 24 weeks of Orkambi 
treatment was safe and significantly improved pulmonary function, 
with both increase in FEV1 % predicted and a reduction in 
pulmonary exacerbations, and also BMI. In an open label phase 3 
study of 58 children ages 6 -11 homozygous for F508del CFTR 
mutation, Milla et al4 demonstrated significant improvements over 
24 weeks in sweat chloride, BMI Z score, Cystic Fibrosis 
Questionnaire Revised Respi[INVESTIGATOR_133440], and lung 
clearance index6,7. In an open -label trial of 57 children ages 2 -5 
years old, significant improvement in sweat chloride and BMI Z 
score of 0.29 (95% CI 0.14, 0.45) was found after 24 weeks of 
Orkambi treatment8. 
    Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was the first 
of a new class of drugs that improved CFTR gating dysfunction3,9,10. 
In randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trials, ivacaftor 
treatment in indivi duals (ages 6 to adulthood) with at least one 
G551D mutation resulted in clinically significant improvements in 
weight and body mass index (BMI), pulmonary function, and patient 
reported quality of life outcomes (QOL)10,11.  Lung function and 
weight changes occurred over eight weeks, then plateaued and 
were sustained over 48 weeks.  Ivacaftor has shown similar benefit 
in younger children and has been approved for use in 2 to 5 year 
old children.  Ivacaftor was found to be s afe and effective in 33 
children in the KIWI study completed 24 weeks of treatment in the 
KIWI study, with significant reductions in sweat chloride 
    
   vii 
concentration, and an average increase in weight Z score of 
0.2±0.3 and BMI z score of 0.4±0.412.  Some exocrine pancreatic 
function restoration was demo nstrated in these young children, as 
Davies et al.12 noted an increase in fecal elastase concentrations in 
a small sample of children after 24 weeks ivacaftor treatment.  Prior 
to treatment, 93% were PI [INVESTIGATOR_133441] <50 
µg/g, and after treatment this increased 100 µg/g on ave rage.  
Furthermore, in the KLIMB study, a long -term follow -up to the KIWI 
study, the increased fecal elastase concentrations were sustained 
with mean increase of 129 µg/g after [ADDRESS_151081] that exocrine pancreatic function early in life 
may be partially restored with ivacaf tor12,14.  
     In our recent longitudinal observational study of 23 subjects 
(ages 5 to 61 years), we identified several mechanisms for weight 
gain with 3 -month ivacaftor treatment including decreased resting 
energy expenditure (REE), gut inflammation and  dietary fat 
malabsorption, resulting in a positive energy balance and weight 
gain. Weight gain in this study was 2.5 kg and associated with a 
significant decrease in REE percent predicted of 5.5%, and in fecal 
calprotectin of 30 ug/g stool, a measure of g ut inflammation15-17. 
   A phase [ADDRESS_151082] children. Whether Orkambi treatment 
will improve sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133437] (SEE/REE), 
growth status and gut health and function related to improved fat 
absorption in young children is not known.  
   Several outcomes related to improved energy balance are 
considered in this proposal. We will focus on the importance of 
determining the effect of treatment on clinically important non -
pulmonary outcomes. Our primary aim in this study of young 2.0 to 
5.9 year old children is to det ermine if 24 -week Orkambi treatment 
results in decreased SEE/REE and improved growth status as 
indicated by [CONTACT_8497], BMI and BMI Z score. Our secondary aim is to 
determine improvement in gut health related to fat digestion, 
including increased total plasma fatty acids and decreased fecal 
calprotectin (gut inflammation).  Exploratory aim includes 
investigating the impact of Orkambi treatment on dietary intake, 
height status, on serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and 
calprotectin, and on fecal elastase.

Study Phases   Screening : screening for eligibility and obtaining consent  
Baseline : baseline study visit at CHOP  
Follow up:  12 week visit at CHOP  after confirmation of timing of the 
start of clinically prescribed Orkambi  treatment (±2 week window)  
Follow up:  24 week visit at CHOP  after confirmation of timing of the 
start of clinically prescribed Orkambi treatment (±2 week window)  
Safety Evaluations  As part of safety assessment, a serum comprehensive metabolic 
panel including the ALT and AST liver enzymes, and complete 
blood count will be assessed (CHOP Clinical Laboratory).  
Dosing will likely be interrupted by [CONTACT_133470] 5 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN).  
Subjects will be asked about all adverse events at the 12 and 24 
week protocol visits and during the monthly  phone calls, and rate d 
by [CONTACT_2236] (mild, moderate, severe). Serious adverse events will 
be reported as per various policies  in a timely manner to CHOP IRB  
and CHPS.  
Statistical And 
Analytic Plan  Analysis will begin with descriptive analyses of the study sample 
using means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges for 
continuous variables, and frequency distributions for categorical 
variables. Descriptive statistics and exploratory graphing such as  
frequencies, means, standard deviations, box plots, and scatter 
plots will be used to assess the normality of the data in terms of the 
presence of skew and/or outliers. Primary Aims:  The goals of the 
primary aims of this study are to determine whether Ork ambi 
treatment improves SEE/REE, weight and BMI Z score. Secondary 
Aims:  The goal of the secondary aim is to determine whether 
    
   x 
Orkambi improves gut health and function as measured by [CONTACT_133471]. Analysis of efficacy fo r the 
primary and secondary outcomes will be based on change from 
baseline (before treatment) in SEE/REE% predicted (Schofield), 
weight and BMI Z scores, total plasma fatty acids, and fecal 
calprotectin. The differences between baseline and 24 weeks 
contin uous outcomes will initially be compared using paired -t-tests 
if continuous variables are normally distributed and nonparametric 
tests (Wilcoxon sign rank) if they are not. Subsequently, mixed 
effects longitudinal models will be performed to assess change over 
all three time points (baseline, 12 and 24 weeks), adjusting for 
potential covariates such as age, sex, and adherence to treatment. 
Chi-squared tests will be used for comparison of categorical 
variables before and after Orkambi treatment. Using simila r 
methods, exploratory analyses will examine improvement in dietary 
intake of calories and fat, in growth status ( length/ height -for-age), 
serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids, and calprotectin, and fecal 
elastase.   
DATA AND SAFETY 
MONITORING PLAN Safety will be formerly monitored weekly by [CONTACT_3476]. The 
study protocol will be carried out in accordance with OHRP 
guidelines and requirements. SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, 
and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to  the 
study sponsor, IRB, CHPS, and members of the research and 
clinical teams in accordance with requirements. Anticipated SAEs 
or those unrelated to the study intervention will be reported to the 
same individuals/entities in accordance with requirements. There 
will be ongoing collection of data on adverse events and 
compliance to the treatment protocol throughout the study by 
[CONTACT_133472] [INVESTIGATOR_133443].  Out of 
range laboratory values w ill be reviewed continually by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_94068].

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
     Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by [CONTACT_133473] (CFTR), a chloride channel in many types of 
cells. Most CF mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell su rface 
(synthesis and processing mutations) or impair channel function (gating or conductance 
mutations).  Orkambi is a novel approved therapy for use in people homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  It is a combination of lumacaftor (VX -809) and 
ivacaftor( VX -770)  th at addresses both the processing and gating defects of the F508del 
mutation.  The small -molecule corrector lumacaftor corrects the F508del processing defect 
and increases epi[INVESTIGATOR_133438]1. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that 
increases the channel open probability in F508del -mutant CFTRs that undergo epi[INVESTIGATOR_133444]2-4.  In a 
randomized, doubled -blind, placebo -controlled trial of 1108 subjec ts homozygous for 
F508del CFTR mutation (12 years of age and older), Wainwright et al5 demonstrated  that 
24 weeks of Orkambi treatment was safe and significantly improved pulmonary function, 
with both increase in FEV1 % predicted and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations, and 
also BMI. In an open label phase 3 study of 58 children ages 6 -11 homozygous for F508del 
CFTR mutation, Milla et al4 demonstrated significant improvements over 24 weeks in sweat 
chloride, BMI Z score, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised Respi[INVESTIGATOR_133440], 
and lung clearance index6,7. In an open -label trial of 57 children ages 2 -5 years old, 
significant improvement in sweat chloride and BMI Z score of 0.29 (95% CI 0.14, 0.45) was 
found after 24 weeks of Orkambi treatment8. 
    Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was the first of a new class of drugs 
that improved CFTR gating dysfunction3,9,10. In randomized, double -blind, placebo 
controlled trials, ivacaftor treatment in indivi duals (ages 6 to adulthood) with at least one 
G551D mutation resulted in clinically significant improvements in weight and body mass 
index (BMI), pulmonary function, and patient reported quality of life outcomes (QOL)10,11.  
Lung function and weight changes occurred over eight weeks, then plateaued and were 
sustained over 48 weeks.  Ivacaftor has shown similar benefit in younger children and has 
been approved for use in 2 to 5 year old children.  Ivacaftor was found to be safe and 
effective in 33 children in the KIWI study completed 24 weeks of treatment in the KIWI 
study, with significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, and an average increase 
in weight Z score of 0.2±0.3 and BMI z score of 0.4±0.412.  Some exocrine pancreatic 
function restoration was demonstrated in these young children, as Davies et al.12 noted an 
increase in fecal elastase concentrations in a small sample of children after 24 weeks 
ivacaftor treatment.  Prior to treatment, 93% were PI [INVESTIGATOR_133441] 
<50 µg/g, and after treatment this increased 100 µg/g on average.  Furthermore, in the 
KLIMB study, a long -term follow -up to the KIWI study, the increased fecal elastase 
concentrations were sustained with mean increase of 129 µg/g after [ADDRESS_151091] that exocrine pancreatic func tion early in life may be 
partially restored with ivacaftor12,14.  
      In our recent longitudinal observational study of 23 subjects (ages 5 to 61 years), we 
identified several mechanisms for weight gain with 3 -month ivacaftor treatment including 
decreased resting energy expenditure (REE), gut inflammation and dietary fa t 
malabsorption, resulting in a positive energy balance and weight gain. Weight gain in this 
   
   2 
study was 2.5 kg and was associated with a significant decrease in REE percent predicted 
of 5.5%, and in fecal calprotectin of 30 ug/g stool, a measure of gut infl ammation15-17.      
      A phase [ADDRESS_151092] of treatment on clinically important 
non-pulmonary outcomes. Ou r primary aim in this study of young 2.0 to 5.9 year old 
children is to determine if 24 -week Orkambi treatment results in decreased SEE/REE and 
improved growth status as indicated by [CONTACT_133474], BMI and BMI Z score. Our secondary 
aim is to determine improve ment in gut health related to fat digestion, including increased 
total plasma fatty acids and decreased fecal calprotectin (gut inflammation).  Exploratory 
aim includes investigating the impact of Orkambi treatment on dietary intake, length/ height 
status, on serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and calprotectin, and on fecal elastase.   
     In addition to reduced dietary fat absorption, altered fatty acid metabolism has been 
shown in CF and PI18,19, and may be linked to CFTR dysfunction, and little is known of 
changes with CFTR modulator treatment. In the GOAL study, change in serum fatty acid 
concentrations with ivacaftor treatment were explored. Serum arachidonic ac id levels 
decreased while linoleic and docosahexenoic acid levels did not change in 40 subjects with 
G551D CFTR mutation20. We previously demonstrated a significant increase in total plasma 
fatty acids from 8.5±1.6 to 10.2±3.6 mmol/L (P<0.01) with 3 -month treatment of a structured 
lipid-based nutritional supplement: linoleic, lauric, palmitoleic, oleic and docosatetrae noic 
acids all significantly increased as well18. We propose to assess a plasma fatty acid panel 
that includes concentrations for 22 individual fatty acids as well as total fatty acids, as an 
indicator of change in fat absorption.  
     Serum calprotectin is a marker for whole body inflammation includin g lung and gut 
inflammation in CF, and other chronic inflammatory diseases21-23, and will be assessed 
along with fecal calprotectin. Improvements in growth status will likely result from a 
reduction in SEE/REE in these children which may be associated with Orkambi treatment. 
Furthermore, comparisons of metabolic profiles in children with CF and their healthy 
counterparts, showed that the children with CF had profiles indicating bile acid processing 
abnormalities24.  Whether Orkambi treatment results in improved plasma fatty acid profiles, 
gut and systemic inflammation (fecal and serum calprotectin), bile acids and fat soluble 
vitamin status as markers of improved fat absorption in young children homozygous for 
F508del CFTR mutations is not known and represent novel and clinically meaningful 
outcomes in young children with CF.  
We propose  a longitudinal study design to determine whether [ADDRESS_151093],  growth status as BMI Z score, and gut health related to fat digestion in 
32 ch ildren ages 2.0 to 5.9 years homozygous for F508del mutation.  There will be a mid -
treatment evaluation after 12  weeks of Orkambi treatment to explore the pace of the 
change in the primary and secondary outcomes. To plan the study, we assume that 1/3 of 
   
   3 
subjects will be recruited locally within a 150 mile radius of Philadelphia and the remaining 
2/3 from other CF Centers in North America and will travel to Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133445] (CHOP) for three protocol visits, each visit lastin g 2 or 3 days , conducted at 
our Center for Human Phenomic Science (CHPS) and Nutrition and Growth Laboratory.  
The primary aims  of this study are to determine whether 24 weeks of clinically prescribed 
Orkambi t reatment reduces SEE /REE and increases BMI Z score. Secondary aims  are to 
determine if Orkambi  treatment improves gut health and function resulting in better fat 
absorption as indicated by [CONTACT_133475] [ADDRESS_151094] on dietary intake, growth status  for stature (length/ height ) and measures of body 
composition , serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids, and calprotectin  as a measure of 
systemic inflammation , and on fecal elastase .   
 
1.2 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133446] 45 CFR 46 .  All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent  
and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance 
with The Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66939]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure 
the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
[ADDRESS_151095] typi[INVESTIGATOR_133447] s, weight and BMI, BMI Z score, and gut health related to fat digestion in 32 
children ages 2.0 to 5.9 years homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation. We anticipate that 
these changes will accompany meaningful improvements in dietary intake, growth status, 
body c omposition, serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and calprotectin, and fecal elastase 
in these young children.       
2.1 Primary Aims  
H1:  Orkambi treatment will result in a significant reduction in SEE/REE as percent 
predicted over 24 weeks compared to base line, thereby [CONTACT_133476].  
H2:  Orkambi treatment will result in significantly increased weight and BMI Z score over 24 
weeks compared to baseline.  
2.2 Secondary  Aims 
H3:  Orkambi treatment will result in significantly improved gut health and function resulting 
in better dietary fat absorption as indicated by [CONTACT_133477] [ADDRESS_151096] of Orkambi treatment over 24 weeks compared to baseline in:  
 Dietary intake of calories and percent calories from fat  
 Growth status for stature (length/ height ), and measures of body composition (fat 
free mass [FFM] and fat mass [FM] from skin fold measures ) 
 Serum fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, bile acids and calprotectin, and fecal 
elastase  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Subjects (n=32 ) will be recruited to participate in the study from a pool of subjects 
homozygous for F508del mutations .  Given our previous success in enrolling subjects with 
CF from both CHOP and regional  CF Centers and more distant Centers who traveled 
considerable distances to participate in our research protocols, we expect that enrollment 
will be  achieved in a timely fashion. The plan to initiate treatment and the clinical eligibility 
for treatment is determined by [CONTACT_423]’s family and the CF care team.  
Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The 
CF Center s around the country and Canada  will provide the study with resources that will 
aide in recruitment efforts (i.e. to help to identify subjects 2 to 5 years of age homozygous 
for F508del mutations and eligible to receive Orkambi treatment ). The subject’s CF care 
team will be contact[CONTACT_133478]’s medical record.  To collect medical data for 
screening purposes, a verbal or in person consent from parents/guardians will be obtained.  
Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) will be obtained prior to any study rel ated 
procedures being performed .  
3.1.[ADDRESS_151097] of assessments and the study timeline for the pace of recruitment.  
3.1.3  Follow -up Phase  
Their initial baseline visit (Visit 1) will occur before clinicall y prescribed Orkambi  treatment 
has begun . The exact date of the start of medication will vary for families as they obtain 
their medication.  Subjects will return to CHOP for the 12 week visit (Visit 2) and the 24 
week  visit (Visit 3 and final) after subject /family  has confirmed the timing of the start of 
Orkambi  treatment . There may be a delay between the baseline visit and the [ADDRESS_151098] 
study visit will be 24 weeks.  For each of the 12 and 24 week visits following the start of 
Orkambi treatment, there will be a window of ±2 weeks for the visit to occur (i.e. [ADDRESS_151099] Orkambi treatment).   
Refer to Table [ADDRESS_151100] study visit will be 2 4 
weeks  with a window of ±2 weeks . 
3.2.2  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at one investigative site  in the [LOCATION_002].  
Recruitment will stop when [ADDRESS_151101] s will be 
enrolled to produce 26 evaluable subjects.

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening  
Subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Written (in  
person) or v erbal (via phone) parental/guardian permission will be obtained prior to 
scheduling any study screening related procedures . Informed written consent  will be 
obtained at the baseline visit  prior to conducting any research procedures.   
All subjects will be enrolled in their usual state of good health defined as no 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency room or unscheduled acute illness clinic visits, and wi th activity 
levels and food intake considered typi[INVESTIGATOR_133448] .    
   
   6 
4.2 Observational Period  
Many of the protocol assessments could occur  on any of the visit days (i.e. questionnaires, 
spot stool sample) . Below is the best estimate of how each day will proceed. The baseline 
(Visit 1) and the 24 week (Visit 3) visit after Orkambi treatment has begun  are nearly 
identical with the exception of obtaining informed consent which will occur at Visit 1 Day 1 
prior to any assessments being done or specimens being collected.  For the 12 week (Visit 
2) and 24 week (Visit 3) visits that will occur after confirmation of the timing of the start of 
clinically prescribed Orkambi  treatment, there will be a ±2 week window for the visit. (i.e. [ADDRESS_151103] Orkambi  treatment).   
The description provided here applies to subjects who are not local to CHOP and w ho will 
be traveling to Philadelphia from other regions of the US and Canada and staying at a local 
hotel for one or two nights  depending on the time of their scheduled research procedures. 
For non -regional families, Day [ADDRESS_151104] is local to CHOP, we will still require a Day 1 visit for in -person written consent 
for Visit 1, however, for Visits 2 and 3, Days 1 and 2 can be combined to complete study 
protocol procedures, and they will come in to CHOP from home for the major study protocol 
days: Day 2 for Visit 2 and Day 2 and again on Day 3 (if needed) for Visit 3.

5.1.2  Laboratory Evaluations  
Plasma Total Fatty Acids: A total plasma fatty acid panel will be assessed (ARUP 
Laboratories) to measure change  in status of 22 fatty acids.  
Serum F at Soluble Vitamins : Serum vitamin A and vitamin E assessed at Craft 
Technologies Laboratories. Serum vitamin D determined using Liquid Chromatography -
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (CHOP).  As a measure of vitamin K status, % 
undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Gundberg Lab, Yale University) will be assessed.

Serum Bile Acids:  Total serum bile acids and 14 bile acid concentrations will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_133482] s pectrometry (ARUP Laboratories)  
Serum Calprote ctin: Serum calprotectin will be obtained as a marker of lung and gut 
inflammation21,22 using a Buhlmann MRP8/14 ELISA kit (Alpco, Salem, NH)).  
   
   10 
Safety Assessment : As part of safety assessment, a comprehensive metabolic panel 
including the ALT and AST liver enzymes, and complete blood count will be assessed 
(CHOP Clinical Laboratory).  
5.1.3  Study Assessments  
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133457]:  The primary outcome for the assessment of 
energy expenditure is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133437] ( SEE or REE). Using indirect 
calorimetry, SEE or REE and respi[INVESTIGATOR_133458] a computerized 
metabolic cart Vmax ENCORE at each protocol visit  while the child is asleep (SEE ) for  
children who typi[INVESTIGATOR_133459] . SEE will be assessed in the morning if possible 
whether SEE or RE E and the time of the day of the testing will be replicated at all study 
visits. For children who do not  typi[INVESTIGATOR_133460],  REE will be assessed  in the early 
morning after an overnight stay nearby.  Subjects will fast from food and medication for [ADDRESS_151109] is performed between 7:00 
and 10:00 AM.  SEE/REE  is compared to predicted values derived from the World Health 
Organization that adjust for age, sex and weight25 and Schofield equations that adjust for 
age, sex, weight and stature ( length /height )26.  SEE /REE  as kcal/d will also be assessed by 
[CONTACT_133483] (FFM) and fat mass (FM) obtained from skinfold 
measurements (see below).  
Anthropometric Assessment : The outcomes for weight gain, growth and nutritional status 
will be stature ( length /height ), weight, BMI, and head circumferen ce Z scores. Measures of 
body composition will also be conducted to determine relative muscle and fat stores. All 
anthropometric techniques will follow those described by [CONTACT_89869]27. Weight (0.1 kg) 
will be measu red on a digital electronic scale (Seca, Munich, [LOCATION_013]), height (0.1 cm) on 
a stadiometer (Holtain, Crymych, [LOCATION_006]), length (0.1 cm) on an infantometer, (Holtain, 
Crymych, [LOCATION_006]), and head circumference (0.1 cm) using an insertion tape. Skinfold thickness 
will be measured (0.1 mm) at the triceps, biceps, subscapular, and supra -iliac sites with a 
skinfold caliper (Holtain, Crymych, [LOCATION_006]) to assess subcutaneous fat stores. Mid upper arm 
circumference measured with a non -stretchable fiberglass tape (0.1 cm) (McCoy, Maryland 
Heights, MO). All measurements will be used to generate age -sex-specific Z scores for 
height, weight, BMI, head circumference, arm circumference, triceps and subscapular 
skinfolds using WHO reference data28,29.  CDC reference data will also be used to generate 
age- sex-specific Z  scores for length, height, weight and BMI (2.0 -5.9 yrs)30. 
Body Composition : Total body comp osition, total FFM and FM and percent body fat (%FAT) 
and regional fat deposition, will be assessed by [CONTACT_133484].   .   
Fecal Elastase I:  Pancreatic function will be assessed by [CONTACT_133485] 1 to determine th e level of pancreatic enzyme activity31,32. Subjects will be 
provided with the stool collection kit and proper instructions and supplies, and will bring a 
stool sample back the next day. The stool sample will be stored at -20oC, and analyzed with 
an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay kit sent to ARUP Laboratory (Salt Lake City, UT).  
Fecal Calprotectin : Spot stool samples will be obtained to determine fecal calprotectin, a 
marker for gut inflammation (CHOP Laboratories), determined using a QUANTA Lite® 
ELISA kit.  
Dietary Intake : Three day weighed food record will be obtained and calories, macro - and 
micro -nutrient content averaged over the three days. Families will be trained by [CONTACT_133486], spoons and all supplies necessary for the co llection of the dietary 
data.  Detailed verbal and written instructions will be provided to ensure that the recording 
procedures are clearly understood. Also assisting with this will come from the CHPS staff 
and Bionutrition Unit system33,34. Dietary intake of all nutrients will be analyzed using 
   
   11 
Nutrition Data System for Research software version 2012 developed by [CONTACT_133487] (NCC, University of Minnesota. Minneapolis, MN)35.   
Health Questionnaire : The questionnaire will be administered by [CONTACT_133488], and will consist of two sections. The Health History  section has general questions 
about the subject’s health history including documentation of medical history, recent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133461], medications, and nutrient supplement use. A section 
describes aspects of environment  such  household size , insurance for child and whether on 
Medicaid.  In addition to family contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, address, phone numbers), 
contact [CONTACT_133489] -household contacts will be collected to maintain contact 
[CONTACT_133490].  
Adherence:  Questionnaire at the 24 week in -person visit regarding adherence to treatment 
will be administered.  Four phone calls will be made to all families at the 4  (± 4 days ), 8 (± 
4 days ), 16 (± 4 days ), and 20  (± 4 days ) week time points and in person at the [ADDRESS_151110] four weeks.  Adherence to treatment with Orkambi treatment, 
pancr eatic enzyme medication use, and vitamin use (CF -specific and other vitamin 
supplements) will be assessed.  
Adverse Events Diary: Families will be asked about all adverse events for their child at the 
12 and 24  week protocol visit s and during the monthly phone calls, and rate by [CONTACT_2236] 
(mild, moderate, severe). Serious adverse events will be reported as per various policies in 
a timely manner to CHOP IRB, and CHPS.  
5.[ADDRESS_151111] 
liver enzymes,  and complete blood count  will be assessed (CHOP Clinical Laboratory).  
Dosing will likely be interrupted  by [CONTACT_133491] 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).  
Subjec ts will be asked about all adverse events at the 12 and 24 week  protocol visits and 
during the monthly phone calls, and rate by [CONTACT_2236] (mild, moderate, severe). Serious 
adverse events will be reported as per various policies in a timely manner to CHOP IRB, 
and C HPS. For adverse events relating to subject’s Orkambi treatment, all events will be 
managed by [CONTACT_423]’s CF clinical care team.  
[ADDRESS_151112] deviations, box plots, and scatter p lots will be used to assess the 
normality of the data in terms of the presence of skew and/or outliers.  
6.1.1  Analysis of Primary  & Secondary  Aims  
Data Analysis:   Analysis will begin with descriptive analyses of the study sample using 
means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables, and frequency 
distributions for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics and exploratory graphing such 
as frequencies, means, standard deviations, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to 
   
   12 
assess the normality of the data in terms of the presence of skew and/or outliers. Primary 
Aims:  The goals of the primary aims  of this study are to determine whether Orkambi  
treatment improves SEE /REE, weight and BMI Z score. Secondary Aims:  The goal of the 
secondary aim is to determine whether Orkambi improves gut health and function as 
measured by [CONTACT_133492] s and fecal calprotectin. Analysis of efficacy  for the 
primary and secondary outcomes will be based on change from baseline (before treatment ) 
in SEE/REE % predicted  (Schofield), weight and BMI Z scores, total plasma fatty acids, and 
fecal calprotectin.  The differences between baseline and 24 weeks con tinuous outcomes 
will initially be compared using paired -t-tests if continuous variables are normally distributed 
and nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon sign rank) if they are not. Subsequently, mixed effects 
longitudinal models will be performed to assess chan ge over all three time points (baseline, 
12 and 24 weeks) , adjusting for potential covariates such as age, sex, and adherence to 
treatment. Chi -squared tests will be used for comparison of categorical variables before and 
after Orkambi treatment . Using sim ilar methods, exploratory  analyses will  examine 
improvement in dietary intake of calories and fat, in growth status ( height -for-age), serum 
fat soluble vitamins, bile acids, and calprotectin, and fecal elastase .   
6.2 Sample Size and Power  
Sample Size and Powe r: This is a longitudinal study of the effects of Orkambi treatment  on 
outcomes before and after 24-week  treatment.  The sample size of [ADDRESS_151113] the primary outcomes of decrease in 
SEE/ REE percent predicted value (5% change), and increase in weight (1.8 kg) and BMI Z 
score ( 0.15). Using STATA, power calculations were generated, with an α=0.05, for paired 
data (n=32) within the same sample (before and after 24 weeks  of treatment with Orka mbi) 
using the changes described above for the primary outcomes.  
Primary outcomes:   A sample size of 26 subjects results in 80% power to see a decrease of 
5% in SEE/REE  (i.e. from 115 to 110)  with a standard deviation of the change of 9%, using 
a paired t -test with α=0.[ADDRESS_151114] used the o utcomes 
reported by [CONTACT_133493]4 for 6-11 year old children homozygous for F508del, and the more 
recent data for BMI Z score for younger children ages 2 to 5 years, a fter 24 months of 
Orkambi treatment . A sample of 2 6 subjects will provide 82% power with α=0.[ADDRESS_151115] 
an increase in weight of 1.8 kgs over 24 weeks compared to the 1.0 kgs expected 6 -month 
increase for children of this age group28, an increase of 0.8 ± 1.4 kgs more than expected.  
A sample of 26 will also provide  81% power with α=0.[ADDRESS_151116] an increase in BMI Z 
score of 0.15±0.[ADDRESS_151117] and two-sided significance level.  
Secondary outcomes:  A sample of 16  subjects  will provide  80% power to detect an 
increase in total plasma fatty acids  from 8.5 to 10.5 mmol/L with a standard deviation of 
2.8, and will provide 85% power to detect a decrease in fecal calprotectin  of 30 ug/g stool 
with a standard deviation of  the change of 40 ug/g stool .  We previously demonstrated a [ADDRESS_151118] previously demonstrated a 3 -
month decrease of 30 ug/g stool in fecal calprotectin with ivacaftor treatment in [ADDRESS_151119] deviations of 9% for REE, 0.3 for BMI Z score, 40 ug/g stool for fecal 
calprotectin,  and 2.8 mmol/L for total plasma fatty acids are reasonable estimates of the 
variability expected in changes for these variables from our experience with [ADDRESS_151120] deviation of 8% in SEE 
percent predicted values39. 
     We plan for  up to 20 % attrition over the 24 weeks. By [CONTACT_79323] 32 subjects we can 
account for attrition and also allow for the possibility of greater variability in the SEE/REE , 
weight and BMI Z scores, and gut health an d fat absorption measures in these youngest 
children .

8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Clinica l Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are n otable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 Data Collection and Management  
Data Management : The CHPS will work with the study team to create case report forms, 
set up REDcap database, and provide training for data entry and quality assurance. 
REDcap, a secure, web -based database, provides real time calculations, error detection 
and an automated export procedure for seamless data downloads to Excel, SAS and Stata. 
REDcap and all study computers are password protected and allow for storage of direct 
identifiers and de -identified data in a single database. Subjects will be assigned a unique 
identification number to insure confidentia lity. Biological specimens are stored, identified 
using unique numbers in locked CHPS freezer. Routine backup to a secure server, 
including images of forms, the main study database, and files created for analysis, and 
analysis programs will be archived dai ly. Source documents will be stored in locked 
cabinets in secure research facilities with locked doors and security alarm with [ADDRESS_151122] software (e.g. RedCap). 
The database will be designed to perform automatic computations, such as exact age 
based upon birth date and date of exam, and averaging anthropometric measu res, which 
are recorded in triplicate. Reports containing the number of subjects enrolled and data 
entered for each subject are generated and reviewed each month by [CONTACT_978].  The  PI, or 
study staff, will review all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for data completeness 
and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. Following data entry, all primary and 
secondary endpoint data will be verified against original source documen ts.  Data 
verification will be performed by [CONTACT_133494].   
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number that will be used to insure strict 
confidentiality. The databases are s ecured with password protection to insure 
confidentiality and security. The informatics manager receives only coded information 
which is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Electronic 
communication with outside collaborators invol ves only unidentifiable information.  A 
master list containing PHI and subject ID number will be kept separate from the data forms 
and the database that will only have a study ID number. The master list will be on a 
separate  password protected  file on CHOP ’s secured server . All source documents 
including case report forms, laboratory results, and subject study binders will be kept in 
secured locations  on the 14th floor of the Roberts Center for Pediatric Research .  The file 
cabinets and the study -specific r oom will be locked with access to study personnel only, 
and the outer hallway is also locked with limited access to CHOP research personnel.  
Routine backup to the main study database, files created for analyses, and analysis 
programs will be completed. The  main study database will be archived on a daily basis and 
stored on a CHOP secured server. The Informatics Core of the CHPS  will create case 
report forms, set up the database in RedCap, and provide oversight for data entry and 
quality assurance for this s tudy.  
There is no set time for destroying the information that will be collected for this study .

will be stated in the consent form.  Confidentiality is assured by [CONTACT_133495]. 
All data, whether gen erated in the laboratory or at the bedside, will be identified with a 
identification code unique to the subject.  
To maintain confidentiality, private health information will be collected, accessed and stored 
in accordance with Institutional policies and HIPAA guidelines, including the use of 
multilevel password protection and enforcement of system user privileges on the database. 
To minimize the risk of disclosure, all direct identifiers will be removed as soon as possible 
and codes will be substituted fo r personal identifiers. Records of individuals are stored with 
ID numbers and a code with no discernible personal identifiers. Code lists and data files will 
be stored in separate, secure locations. Data will be accessed and stored on password -
protected co mputers  on the CHOP network . To maintain confidentiality, codes will be used 
in the database, presentations and publications. The Investigator and other site personnel 
will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study .

treatment until all procedures for the baseline visit (Visit 1) have been completed.  
The procedures in this study involve the potential risks related to the drawing of blood.  
The risks of drawing blood are rare, and minimal . There is a small risk of pain, infection 
and local irritation associated with the blood draw . However, this is considered a minimal 
risk and skilled pediatric research nursing staff will  perform phlebotomy . Each subject will 
have approximately 18cc (approximately 1.2 tablespoons ) of blood d rawn at baseline (Visit 
1) and 2 4 week  (Visit 3) study visit , and 5 cc( 1 teaspoon) at the 12 week visit  (Visit 2) , and 
no more than 5mL/kg over an eight week period.    
The sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133462] . Children will be able to drink beverages and eat prior to this 
procedure.  Study staff will record amount and type of liquid and solid food prior to the 
procedure.  This will also be used as a reference to repeat same conditions at each 
subsequent visit.  
There is minimal risk associated with anthropometric measurements, sharing dietary 
intake, demographic  information, health history and medical information.   
Collection and storage of  stool is associated with a small risk of fecal contamination. 
However, for safety and convenience, subjects will be provided with proper stool collection 
instructions and supplies (gloves, disposable collection containers, storage freezer 
container).  
Private health information will be collected, accessed and stored according to HIPAA 
guidelines, including the use of multilevel password protection and enforcement of system 
user privileges on the database. To minimize the risk of disclosure, all direct i dentifiers will 
be removed as soon as possible and codes will be substituted for personal identifiers. 
Records of individuals are stored with ID numbers and a code with no discernible personal 
identifiers. Code lists and data files will be stored in separa te, secure locations. Data will 
be accessed and stored on password -protected computers. To maintain confidentiality, 
codes will be used in the database, presentations and publications.  
If clinically significant results  are found as a results of this resea rch study, subjects/families 
will be informed and consent to share findings with their clinical care team will be obtained.  
Once consent to share medical information is obtained, the subject’s clinical care team will 
be contact[CONTACT_133496] -up. 
In the event of a serious adverse event during the study protocol, it will be reported to [CONTACT_133506] (Principal Investigator), the IRB and CHPS, all study team members and sponsor 
as directed by [CONTACT_81712] a nd procedures and in accordance with requirements. With the 
approval of families, the information will be provided to their care providers as directed.  
   
   [ADDRESS_151125] of mouth and at the 
recommendation of the subjects ’ CF Care Team. The CF Foundation, CF Centers  and CF 
support organizations around the country and Canada will provide the study with resources 
that will aide in recruitment efforts (i.e. to help to identify young 2 to 5 year old subjects 
homozygous for F508del mutations  and eligible to receive Orkambi treatment ). Subjects will 
be recruited after introduction by [CONTACT_423]’s CF Care Team. Once a family has expressed 
interest in participating  a CHOP -based research team member will contact [CONTACT_133497] . Written (in  
person) or v erbal (via phone) consent will be acquired to collect medical information to 
determine eligibility.  For verbal screening consent, a waiver of documentation of consent, a 
waiver of assent and an alteration of HIPAA to obtain verbal c onsent and HIPAA 
authorization for screening over the phone will be in place.  A waiver of verbal assent is 
requested due to the fact that the child is too young to provide it . 
In the event that a non -English speaking family is approached for screening, an  interpreter 
will be used either by [CONTACT_133498] a language 
understandable to the subjects/families. The interpreter can be conferenced into  the phone 
call for the consent process.  The screening consent will include the Study Summary  
Document for interpreter documentation attesting to statements on the summary document. 
This document will be faxed or emailed (using secure email) to the interpreter to sign and 
sent back electronically if the process takes place by [CONTACT_648]. All members of the team will 
be available to discuss the details and answer any study related questions as they arise. 
Once interest and eligibility are determined , procedures to set up enrollment will begin.  
9.5 Informed Consent/Assent  and HIPAA Authorization  
At entry into the study, parent(s) or legal guardian of the subjects will be asked to review 
the study informed consent form (ICF) .  The Project Coordinator  or other member of the 
clinical research team will meet with the  family on Day [ADDRESS_151126] or 
parent/guardian might have.  After all study -related qu estions are answered and subjects 
and families have had time to consider their decision, the Project Coordinator  or member of 
the clinical research team will obtain fully informed, written consent from parent(s) or legal 
guardian of the subjects. Again, in  the event of enrollment of a non -English speaking 
subject/family, an interpreter will be u sed to present the study and the consent document in 
a language understandable to the family. The main ICF will include a Study Summary 
Document for interpreter docu mentation attesting to statements on the summary document,  
   
   17 
If the interpreter is not in  person but is instead conferenced in by [CONTACT_648], then a copy of this 
attestation document will be faxed or emailed (using secure email) to the interpreter to sign 
and return to the team electronically.  The consent will be signed in the presence of a team 
member. The families will be given a printed copy of the signed, informed consent.   The 
subjects will be too young to assent to this study.  
9.5.1  Waiver of Documentation of Consent /Assent and Alteration of HIPAA 
Authorization  
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133463] a waiver of documentation to consent/parental 
permission and alteration of HIPAA authorization  to obtain verbal authorization . The rights 
and welfare of the s ubject will not be adversely affected because during the verbal consent 
process it is explained to the subject that we are recording their health information to 
determine eligibility for the study. Study staff stress during the verbal consent that the 
screening is voluntary, but necessary if they wish to participate, and that they can decline 
and stop the process at any point. A written informed consent will be obtained upon study 
entry before any study procedures are performed.  
9.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
We will compensate  subjects/families  via bank card (ClinCard)  at a standard rate  of $150 
per research visit day  to offset incurred expenses, including compensation for time, food, 
and baby[CONTACT_133499]. The baseline and 2 4-week visits will require 2 or 3 days and one 
or two  overnight stays to complete the protocol. For the baseline  (Visit 1)  and 2 4 week (Visit 
3) visits, we have assumed that half the families will receive  $150 to complete the visit and 
study protocol procedures for a one day visit and half will require a n additional day to 
complete procedures  and will receive $300. For the 12-week visit  (Visit 2) , all families will 
receive  $150 as an additional day will not be an option . The average compensation t o 
complete the s tudy is $600 , with a minimum of $450 and maximum compensation of $[ADDRESS_151127]/family total compensation exceeds $600 in one calendar year, they will be 
provided with a W9 form.  
  
   
   18 
 
Summary of Range of Payment  
               Each Visit  If Additional  day required  
Visit 1 (Baseline)  $150  $300  
Visit 2 ( 12-weeks) * $150 * $150 * 
Visit 3 ( 24 weeks)  $150  $300  
            $450 (minimum)              $750 (maximum)  
*The compensation for Visit 2 ( 12 weeks) will always be $150 as there is no additional 
research procedure day option.  
Subjects/Families will be compensated $150 for each visit for time and effort associated 
with the study protocol procedures . Since oneimportant tests ( SEE or REE) for this 
Baseline Visit 1 require subjects to be very still, these are planned to be conducted during a 
nap (with childr en who typi[INVESTIGATOR_133464] s)  or while child is awake lying very still (with 
children who do  not typi[INVESTIGATOR_133460]) . If the SEE /REE  is not completed in one day 
than an additional day m ay be needed.   
If subjects are not local to CHOP, they will stay in a nearby [CONTACT_133500] 1 or 2 nights 
depending upon time of research procedures and whether a Day 3 is needed to complete 
the SEE /REE .   Subjects will also be reimbursed to cover the costs of travel  and parking. 
Subjects/families will provide  official  receipts for these items. The 24-week Visit 3 plan is 
the same as Visit 1. The 12-week Visit  2 requires one day of research study procedures.  . 
Subjects traveling regionally by [CONTACT_133501] b e reimbursed at the completion of the study visit for 
mileage/gas/parking. For all subjects not from the Philadelphia area, we have assumed that 
the cost of travel will  paid for the subject and one family member to accompany the subject . 
The overnight stays will also be paid for the family at a hotel nearby [CONTACT_133502].  
Travel expenses that are considered reimbursable are: miles to/from CHOP for subjects 
who are traveling regionally by [CONTACT_128646] , miles to/from the airport or train station  (at a rat e of 
$20/day) , parking at the airport or train station, cab to and from the airport or train station, 
checked bags.  All expenses will be reimbursed with receipts by [CONTACT_133503].  
All subjects will be informed prior to participation of all trav el arrangements and what costs 
are reimbursable and that receipts will be needed for ClinCard payment requests.

in recent years into increasing the complete response (CR) rates. In elderly patients (over 
the age of 60), CR rates are lower, 40 to 50%, and long term disease -free and overall 
survival is less than 10%.1 The therapeutic options for relapsed/refractory AML are 
significantly limited. Bortezomib has shown promising activity in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, including those with leukemia and non- Hodgkin’s lymphom a.  
Pre-clinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibition promotes apoptosis of tumor 
cells in part through stabilization of the negative regulator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF -
κB).  Several in- vitro studies have also shown bortezomib to induce apoptosis in human 
AML cells.  In addition a recent phase I study that utilized bortezomib in combination with standard induction therapy patients with relapsed/refractory AML was shown to produce high response rates with minimal additional toxicity.

11. Anthracyclines, in part, exert anti -tumor activity by [CONTACT_91819]- κB driven, anti -
apoptotic process. Laboratory evidence has suggested that activity of the transcription 
factor NF -κB promotes anthracycline resistance.   This particular resistance can be 
overcome when a proteasome inhibitor is given in conjunction with the anthracycline.  We 
showed that the combination of bortezomib 1.5mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 with liposomal 
doxorubicin was well -tolerated with 13% of patients having grade [ADDRESS_101410] activity in relapsed/refractory AML patients, with partial remissions 
in 20% of patients and blast count reductions in 79%.

dose- limiting toxicities. Toxicities were similar to the 10 -day decitabine studies, and grade 3 
neurotoxicity related to bortezomib was seen in 3 of 19 patients  (all three events were after 
induction) . CR was achieved in 50% of untreated and 22% of relapsed/refractory patients.

using the combination of 10- day decitabine and bortezomib with or without additional 
agents ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], three of the bortezomib doses are being administered concurrently with the 10- days of decitabine (decitabine days 
2-11 and bortezomib days 1, 4, 8 and 11) . 
Using the SC formulation of VELCADE

reduced neurotoxicity due to decreased time in the infusion room and it would decrease overall cost of care.  
1.2    VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection  
1.2.1    Scientific Background  
VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection is a small -molecule proteasome inhibitor developed 
by [CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  VELCADE is currently approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is 
also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy.  In the European Union (EU), VELCADE in combination with melp halan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously 
untreated MM who are not eligible for high -dose chemotherapy with bone marrow 
transplant.  VELCADE is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of progressive MM in patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_101413] itute (NCI) in  vitro and in vivo assays.
3  In addition, 
VELCADE has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation.
4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16  Notably, 
VELCADE induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl -2, a genetic trait that confers 
unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.17

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/[ADDRESS_101414]/indirect effects on various molecular targets including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal transduction molecules, transcription factors c -jun and HIF1-α , tumor suppressor protein 
p53, angiogenesis facto rs, and many others.  VELCADE is thought to be efficacious in 
multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF -κB) activation, its attenuation of 
interleukin -6 (IL -6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and possibly anti -
angiogenic  and other effects.

1.2.2    Nonclinical Pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, VELCADE displays a 
rapid distribution phase (t
½α < 10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t ½β 5-15 
hours).  VELCADE has a large volume of distribution (range 5- 50 L/kg).  The plasma PK 
profile is well described by a 2- compartment model.  
The pharmacodynamic action of VELCADE is well established and can be measured 
through an ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity).[ADDRESS_101415] in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with VELCADE in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a half -life 
less than 24 hours, with proteasome activity returning to pretreatment baseline within 
24 hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in rat after a single dose of VELCADE.  
Further, intermittent but high inhibition (> 70%) of proteasome activity was better tolerated 
than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice- weekly clinical dosing regimen was chosen in order 
to allow return of proteasome activity towards baseline between dose administrations.  
Subcutaneous administration 
In monkeys, plasma bortezomib tmax generally occurred at 0.117 h following IV dosing and 
0.117 to 0.25 h following SC dosing. After administration of 1.2 mg/m2, peak plasma 
concentration and AUC0- 72h attained 124 ng/mL and 141 ng.h/mL following IV 
administration and 113 ng/mL and 211 ng.h/mL following SC administration on the last day of dosing, demonstrating a bioavailability close to 100%. Treatment with bortezomib induced an inhibition of the whole blood 20S proteasome activity reaching a maximal effect 
between 15 minutes and 1 hour after dosing. The profile of inhibition over time was comparable between cycles and similar after subcutaneous  and intravenous injections.

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/17  
Confidential  12 1.2.3    Nonclinical Toxicity  
Single -dose, IV toxicity studies were conducted with VELCADE in the mouse, rat, dog, and 
monkey to establish the single- dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 
0.25 mg/kg (1.5 mg/m2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_101416] sensitive species, rat 
and monkey, respectively.  
Repeat -dose, multicycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the 
monkey, each with 8- week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic 
toxicity of VELCADE when  administered by [CONTACT_91820].  
The MTD in the 6- month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs 
were the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and hematopoietic and lymphoid systems.  The MTD in 
the 9- month monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the 
GI tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.  
In general, the nature of the toxicity of VELCADE is similar across species, and target organs of toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of VELCADE in animals is characterized by a steep dose- response with mortality seen at 
dosages above the MTD.  The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is considered to be 
related to indirect cardiovascular (CV) effects of hypotension and vascular changes with 
secondary bradycardia and the cause of death in long -term studies has been attributed to 
GI or hematologic toxicity.  The pharmacologic effects of VELCADE on the CV system have been extensively characterized and have demonstrated that indirect effects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are abrogated by [CONTACT_91821].  
Subcutaneous administration 
Repeat dose toxicity of VELCADE administered by [CONTACT_91822] 
(up to 4 cycles of 11 days of VELCADE) was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Each of cycles 1, 2 and 3 consisted of dosing  on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by 1 week of 
recovery. VELCADE treatment at 1.2mg/m
2 IV or SC induced abnormal feces (soft, liquid 
and/or mucoid), emesis, reduced appetite and decreased activity. Local tolerance was very good for SC administration. There were no hematological changes associated with the 
administration of VELCADE SC or IV but slight decreases in total, protein and globulin values as well as microscopic changes in the peripheral nervous system, kidneys, bone marrow, and immune system of animals were seen. There were no clear differences in the  
incidence and severity of these findings between animals dosed subcutaneously and those treated intravenously.

1.2.4    Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
The clinical pharmacology characterization of VELCADE has been determined from phase 
1 studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
VELCADE demonstrates multicompartmental pharmacokinetics.  Following intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first -dose maximum observed 
plasma concentrations of VELCADE were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively, in 11 patients 
with MM and creatinine clearance values > 50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0- mg/m
2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3- mg/m2 dose.  The 
mean elimination half -life of VELCADE upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_101418] dose.  Mean total body c learances 
were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m
2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does 
not result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans.  
In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 20S activity) occurred within 1- hour postdose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m
2 in 
subjects with MM, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1 hour postdose was approximately 61%.  
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_91823], followed by [CONTACT_91824] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable (10% –30%) levels of proteasome inhibition 
have been observed at the next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780].  
The relationship between VELCADE plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be described by a maximum effect (E
max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with 
small changes in plasma VELCADE concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases in the percent inhibition (0– 60%).  After that, a plateau occurs 
where marginal increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_91781].

concentration (C max) was approximately 10 times lower following SC administration (20.4 
[8.9] ng/mL) compared with IV administration (223 [101] ng/mL), with a short Tmax of 
approximately one- half hour following VELCADE SC injection. However, AUC last was 
equivalent for both routes of administration with a geometric mean ratio (SC to IV) of 0.992 and 90% CI of 80.18% to 122.80%; ie, within the standard 80 – 125% bioequivalence 
criteria. 
The mean percent inhibition of proteasome activity (E
max) was comparable for the SC and 
IV groups (63.7% vs. 69.3%; respectively) following multiple 1.3 mg/m2 SC or IV doses of 
VELCADE. Mean AUE 72 following SC injection was comparable to that of the IV injection 
and within the observed variability (CV = 36 - 55%).  
The exploratory analyses showed that there were no apparent pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic differences related to the site of SC injection (abdomen versus thigh) taking into consideration the small sample size of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic part of the study.  
Bortezomib was reconstituted to a concent ration of 2.5 mg/mL for SC administration. In the 
randomized Phase 1 study CAN -1004, bortezomib was injected subcutaneously in a 
concentration of 1 mg/mL. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the SC administration were comparable between the 2 studies (Table 1-1 ). Thus, the 
concentration of the SC injected solution does not appear to influence bortezomib pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters following IV administration in the current study were also comparable to those observed previously for IV administration.

treated through Millennium -sponsored clinical trials, Investigator- Initiated Studies, the US 
NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially available drug.  
VELCADE has been commercially available since 13 May 2003.  
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of VELCADE in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects 
with various advanced malignancies.  In a phase 1 trial in patients with refractory 
hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly dosing for 4 weeks of a 42- day cycle 
was 1.04 mg/m
2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, 
and malaise.[ADDRESS_101421] and fourth weeks of therapy.  In 
the 3- week schedule of VELCADE monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 
a 21- day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 
diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m
2/dose.  In a 35- day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of VELCADE  
monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, 
diarrhea, and syncope.  
In phase 1 clinical studies, antitumor activity was reported in subjects with Non- Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma (NHL), MM, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.

survival at 1 year was 89% for the bortezomib arm versus 72% for the dexamethasone arm, 
which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with bortezomib (p = 0.0098).  Updated response rates and survival data were reported for M34101- 039.
37  
The updated CR + PR rate was 43% with VELCADE.  The CR + nCR rate was 16% with 
VELCADE.  With a median 22 months of follow -up, overall survival was significantly longer 
for patients on the bortezomib arm versus patients  on the dexamethasone arm.  T he 
median overall survival was 29.8 months (95% CI:  23.2, not estimable) for the VELCADE 
arm vs 23.7 months (95%  CI:  18.7, 29.1) for the dexamethasone arm  (hazard ratio = 0.77, 
p = 0.0272).  The probability of survival at 1 year was 80% for the bortezomib arm versus 
67% for the dexamethasone arm (p = 0.0002). 
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
were investigated in an international, phase 2, multicenter study M34103- 053, also referred 
to as the PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782].38  The single -arm study was designed to evaluate the response 
rates, duration of response (DOR), TTP, overall survival (OS), and safety of bortezomib 
treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. For 141 evaluable patients, the response rate was 31% (8% CR/unconfirmed CR [Cru]).  Median time to 
response was 40 days (range 31- 204 days).  The median number of cycles administered 
across all patients was 4; in responding patients, the median number of cycles was 8.  The 
median DOR by [CONTACT_91825] 9.2 months and 13.5  months in patients w ith CR/CRu.  
Median TTP for both groups was 6.[ADDRESS_101428] commonly reported adverse events (AEs) 
were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal events.  A ti me-to-event update to 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782]
39 was reported after a median follow -up of 26.4 months.  TTP was 6.7 
months for all patients, 12.4 months in all responders.  The median DOR was 9.2 months in all responders and had not been reached in patients achieving CR/Cru.  Overall survival was 23.5 months in all patients and 36 months in patients with CR/Cru.  Survival at 12 
months was 69% overall and 91% in responding patients.  
The phase 3 study (MMY 3002) known as the VISTA study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of VELCADE, melphalan, and prednisone in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients who were not candidates for stem cell transplant.
40  
The study was designed to determine the benefit of adding VELCADE to MP (melphalan and prednisone) as assessed by [CONTACT_91826].  Patients (682) were randomized to receive nine 6-week cycles of melphalan 9mg/m
2 and prednisone 60 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 4, alone or in 
combination with VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 by [CONTACT_91827]  1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 
during Cycles 1 to 4, and on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 during Cycles 5 to 9.   Response was 
evaluated every 3 weeks using the EBMT criteria.  At a preplanned interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped since the

Confidential  18 prespecified statistical boundary end point of TTP had been crossed.   Response rates 
were 30% with 4% CR.  The rates of partial response or better were 71% in the VELCADE 
(VMP) group compared to 34% in the MP group (p = 0.001).  With follow -up of 16.3 months, 
the TTP for the VMP group was 24 months compared to 16.6 months in the MP group (p = 0.000001) and was associated with a 52% reduced time to progression.  The median DOR  
was 19.9 months in the VMP group and 13.1 months in the MP group.  Overall survival had not been reached in either group.  Hematologic toxicity was similar in both groups.  The 
incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in the VMP group.   The incidence of herpes zoster was 3% in patients in the VMP group who 
received antiviral prophylaxis.  Fifteen percent of patients in the VMP group discontinued therapy due to AEs compared to 14% in the MP group. 
The VISTA study update after extended follow -up of 25.9 months,
41 confirmed a survival 
benefit for the VMP group.  Overall survival was not reached in either group:  VMP group 
(75) deaths, 3 year OS 72%; MP group (111) deaths, 3 year OS 59% (p = 0.0032).  
Patients on VMP were less likely to start second -line therapy (VMP 38% vs MP 57% at the 
time of data cut -off) with a longer time to next therapy (TNT) and treatment free interval 
(TFI).  Of the MP patients who received subsequent therapy, 43% went on to receive 
VELCADE.  
Based on investigator -reported best responses to subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], patients relapsing 
after therapy with a novel agent were not intrinsically more resistant than after receiving a 
traditional agent.  
In the VISTA study, VMP was associated with prolonged TT P, TNT, TFI, and OS.  Patients 
were successfully treated with subsequent IMiD -based therapy and retreated with 
bortezomib.  After 36.7 months follow -up, OS continued to be superior for VMP.   The OS for 
VMP had not yet been reached compared to MP (43.1 mont hs).42 In an updated analysis of 
overall survival based on 387 deaths (median follow -up 60.1 months), the median overall 
survival for VMP was 56.[ADDRESS_101429] ration of 0.695 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.85).

Confidential  19 The data from the Phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_91784] a randomized, 
Phase 3 study that compared the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous versus intravenous bortezomib at the approved 1.3 mg/m
2 dose and twice per week schedule in patients with 
relapsed multiple myeloma 26. 222 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
either subcutaneous (n=148) or intravenous (n=74) bortezomib. The response- evaluable 
population consisted of 145 patients in the subcutaneous group and 73 in the intravenous group. Patients received a median of eight cycles (range one to ten) in both groups.  
The ORR (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_91828], was 42% in both the SC and IV treatment 
groups for the response -evaluable population. The ORR after 4 cycles in the IV arm was 
consistent with what was observed in historical single- agent VELCADE trials with relapsed 
multiple myeloma subjects. The stratified Mantel Haenszel estimate of the relative risk of achieving response for SC treatment group versus IV treatment group was 0.99 with 95% CI (0.71, 1.37). The 95% CI for ORR_SC - 0.6 ORR_IV was (6.1, 27.1), which excludes 0. 
Thus the study met the noninferiority objective (p- value for the noninferiority hypothesis was 
0.[ZIP_CODE]). Results in the ITT population were similar; noninferiority of SC versus IV was also demonstrated.  
The CR rate after 4 cycles of treatment was 6% in the SC treatment group and 8% in the IV treatment group; the nCR rate after 4 cycles of treatment was 6% in the SC treatment group 
and 5% in the IV treatment group; the very good partial response ( VGPR ) rate after 4 
cycles of treatment was 4% in the SC treatment group and 3% in the IV treatment group. Therefore , 17% subjects in the SC treatment group and 16% subjects in the IV treatment 
group had obtained at least VGPR after the first 4 cycles.  
The ORR (CR+PR) after 8 cycles of treatment was 52% in both the SC and IV treatment groups for the response -evaluable population. The stratified Mantel -Haenszel estimate of 
the common relative risk of achieving response for SC versus IV was 1.00 with 95% CI (0.77, 1.31). Twenty -five percent of subjects in the SC treatment group and 25% of subjects 
in the IV treatment group  had obtained at least VGPR during the first 8 cycles.  
The median TTP (Kaplan- Meier estimate) was 10.[ADDRESS_101431] ratio was 0.839 with 95% CI (0.564, 1.249), and the p=0.3866 (strat ified log -rank test), indicating similar results between the SC 
and IV arm.  
The median PFS (Kaplan- Meier estimate) was 10.[ADDRESS_101432] ratio was 0.824 with 95% CI (0.574,

Among the responders, the median time to first response was 1.4 months (44 days) in the 
SC arm and 1.4 months (43 days) in the IV arm. Among the responders, the m edian

SAFETY SUMMARY FOR SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION   
While the safety profile between the SC and IV treatment groups in general was comparable in most System Organ Classes ( SOCs ), a difference in incidence in certain 
safety parameters in favor of the SC treatm ent group was noted. One hundred and forty 
(95%) subjects in the SC treatment group and 73 (99%) subjects in the IV treatment group reported at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event. In the SC treatment group, there 
was a lower incidence of Grade ≥3 adverse events as compared with the IV treatment 
group (57% vs. 70%, respectively); a lower incidence of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations (22% in the SC treatment group and 27% in the IV treatment group); and a lower incidence of adverse events leading to dose modifications in the SC 
group: dose reduction (33% in the SC treatment group compared with 45% in the IV 
treatment group); dose withholding (30% in the SC treatment group compared with 39% in

Confidential  27 the IV treatment group); or cycle delay (20% in the SC treatment group compared with 34% 
in the IV treatment group). Serious adverse events were similar between the 2 treatment groups (36% in the SC treatment group and 35% in the IV treatment group). Deaths during treatment (within [ADDRESS_101438]  dose) were 5% in the SC treatment group and 7% in the IV 
treatment group.  
The SC treatment group reported a lower incidence in several adverse events associated with VELCADE toxicity. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy events (all Grades) was 38% in the SC treatment group and 53% in the IV treatment group; the incidence of Grade 
≥2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% in the SC treatment group and 41% in the IV 
treatment group; and the incidence of Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy event was 6% in the 
SC treatment group and 16% in the IV treatment group. There also appeared to be a trend 
towards lower incidence in gastrointestinal adverse events (37% for SC and 58% for IV, 
predominantly due to differences in Grade 1- 2 abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dyspepsia); as 
well as a ≥5% difference in incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory results in the 
SC treatment group compared with the IV treatment group for white blood cells  (8% in the 
SC treatment group compared with 18% in the IV treatment group), neutrophil count (22% in the SC treatment group compared with 28% in the IV treatment group) and platelets (18% in the SC treatment group compared with 23% in the IV treatment group).  
Local tolerability of SC administration was acceptable. Nine (6%) subjects  reported a local 
reaction to SC administration as an adverse event. Eighty -five (58%) subjects in the SC 
treatment group reported at least [ADDRESS_101439] common local 
injection site reaction was redness which was reported in 84 (57%) subjects. The majority 
of subjects with worst injection site reactions were assessed as mild (38%) or moderate 
(18%). Only 2 (1%) subjects were reported as having severe injection site reactions. All local site reactions resolved completely and rarely led to treatment modifications.  
In conclusion, the SC administration of VELCADE has good local tolerance. The systemic safety profile for the SC administration of VELCADE was associated with a lower incidence 
of Grade ≥3 adverse events, and treatment modifications (discontinuations and dose 
reductions). In particular, there was a lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy NEC 
reported.

1.3  Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil)  
1.3.1    Scientific Background  
Doxorubicin HCl liposome injection is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from  
Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius . The mechanism of action of doxorubicin HCl is 
thought to be related to its ability to bind to DNA and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis. Cell 
University of [LOCATION_004] Davis   VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection  
Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/[ADDRESS_101440] demonstrated rapid cell penetration and perinuclear chromatin 
binding, rapid inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic acid synthesis, and induction of mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations (Doxil® Product Information Booklet 2005) . 
Greater than 90% of the drug (doxorubicin) is encapsulated in STEALTH® liposomes,  
microscopic vesicles composed of phospholipid bilayer that are capable of encapsulati ng 
active drugs. It is hypothesized that because of their small size (ca. 100 nm) and persistence in the circulation, the pegylated liposomes are able to penetrate the altered and often compromised vasculature of tumors. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_91831]- containing STEALTH® liposomes, which can be visualized microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. 
Evidence of penetration of STEALTH® liposomes from blood vessels and their entry and accumulation in tumors has been seen in mice with C -26 colon carcinoma tumors and in 
transgenic mice with Kaposi's sarcoma -like lesions. Once the STEALTH® liposomes 
distribute to the tissue compartment, the encapsulated doxorubicin HCl becomes available. The exact mechanism of release is not understood (Doxil® Product Information Booklet 2005) . 
 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is a common treatment option, approved for patients with 
metastatic recurrent ovarian carcinoma who are refractory to paclitaxel and platinum -based 
chemotherapy. Although doxorubicin has been associated with poor response in recurrent 
ovarian cancer, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of recurrent/relapsed ovarian cancer in several clinical trials. Long -term follow up has 
shown that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin significantly prolongs survival compared with topotecan for patients with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Median overall survival was 107.9 weeks for platinum sensitive patients treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin compared to 70.1 weeks for those treated with topotecan
43.  For patients with 
platinum refractory disease, no statistically significant difference in survival was observed between the two groups. Median overall survival was 35.6 weeks for platinum refractory patients treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin compared to 41.3 weeks for those treated with topotecan.

Information Booklet 2005), linear pharmacokinetics were observed in 23 male Kaposi’s  after 
administration, with a relatively short first phase (approximately 5 hrs)  and a prolonged  
second phase (approximately 55 hrs) that accounted for the majority of the area under the 
curve ( AUC) . At 50mg/m2, the pharmacokinetics are reported to be nonlinear. At this dose 
the elimination halflife is expected to be longer and the clearance lower (compared to 20 
mg/m2). The exposure (AUC) is expected to be more than proportional at a 50 mg/m2 dose 
when compared with the lower doses. In contrast to the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, which displays a large volume of distribution, ranging from 700 to 1100 L/m
2, the small 
steady state volume of distribution of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin shows that it is confined mostly to the vascular fluid volume. Plasma protein binding has not been 
determined for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin but is approximately 70% for doxorubicin. Doxorubicinol, the major metabolite of doxorubicin, was detected at very low levels (range: 0.8 to 26.2 ng/mL) in the plasma of patients who received 10 or 20 mg/m
2 pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin. Plasma clearance was slow, with a mean clearance value of 0.041 L/h/m
2 at a dose of 20 mg/m2. This is in contrast to doxorubicin, which displays a clearance 
value from 24 to 35L/h/m2. Because of its slower clearance, the AUC of pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin, primarily representing the circulating liposome- encapsulated 
doxorubicin, is approximately two to three times larger than the AUC for a similar dose of conventional doxorubicin HCl. Pharmacokinetics have not been separately evaluated in women, different ethnic groups or in individuals with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Drug -
drug interactions between pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and other drugs, including antiviral agents, have not been evaluated.

months (median, 11 months). The most common toxicity that was associated with Doxil was the hand -foot syndrome (palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia) seen in up to 20% of the 
patients in the above study. When the dose was decreased from 50mg/m
2 to 40mg/m2, the 
anti-tumor effect was preserved with a significant improvement in the toxicity profile.

infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.46 
The overall response rates for Doxil and Topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively (P =.390). Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan.  For overall survival, Doxil was significantly superior to topotecan (P =.008), with a median of [ADDRESS_101444] cancer and normal cardiac function, the overall survival in the two groups 
were similar, but toxicities significantly lower in the Doxil group.

2%), stomatitis (22% versus 15%) and mucositis (23% versus 13%) were more often associated with Doxil than doxorubicin.  
 Doxil is considered to be the accepted first -line therapy in AIDS -related Kaposi’s sarcoma.

subjects experiencing grade 3 and 0% grade 4. Grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy was seen in 4% of subjects.  
   1.4 Decitabine 
 
1.4.1 Scientific Background  
 
Decitabine (5- aza-2’-deoxycitidine), an analogue of the natural nucleoside 2’ -deoxycytidine, 
is a member of the hypomethylator or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class. Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved 
at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-
induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are 
critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91786], the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non- proliferating 
cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.  
 Decitabine is indicated for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS of all French-
American- British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, 
refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) and intermediate- 1, intermediate -2, 
and high- risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups. Decitabine also has 
significant activity in AML as described in Section 1.1.

1.4.4  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
 
Please refer to the Decitabine package insert (Appendix 8.10).  
 Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro  and in vivo.  However, 
there have been no studies of decitabine- induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
 Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m
2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 
15 mg/m2 infused over 3 hours (treatment Option 1). Plasma concentration- time profiles 
after discontinuation of infusion showed a bi -exponential decline. The CL of decitabine was 
higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3- fold lower 
than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

 1.4.5  Clinical Experience  
 Please refer to the Decitabine package insert (Appendix 8.10).  
 A randomized open- label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French- American -British (FAB) classification 
criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High -Risk, Intermediate -2 and 
Intermediate -1 prognostic scores. Eighty -nine patients were randomized to decitabine 
therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found 
that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at 
baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent -to-Treat 
(ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups.  
 Patients randomized to the decitabine arm received decitabine intravenously infused at a dose of 15 mg/m
2 over a 3- hour period, every 8 hours, for 3 consecutive days. This cycle 
was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient’s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response.  
 The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine- treated 
patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in 
decitabine -treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with 
pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116- 388) and median time to response (range) was  93 days (55- 272). All but one of 
the decitabine -treated patients who responded did so by [CONTACT_91833]. Benefit was seen 
in an additional 13% of decitabine -treated patients who had hematologic improvement, 
defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC

Confidential  34 patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death 
versus supportive care. All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML.  
 Three open- label, single -arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate- 1, Intermediate- 2, or high 
risk prognostic scores received decitabine by [CONTACT_91834] a dose of 20 mg/m2 IV 
over 1- hour daily, on days 1- 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were 
consistent with the results of the controlled trial.  Several studies have evaluated the activity and safety of decitabine in AML, using a variety 
of dosing schedules. These studies are described in Section 1.1.

Six patients had fatal events associated with their underlying disease and myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) that were considered at least possibly related to drug treatment. Of the 83 DECITABINE -treated patients, 8 permanently discontinued 
therapy for adverse events; compared to 1 of 81 patients in the supportive care arm.

discontinuation. Eight patients had fatal events due to infection and/or bleeding (seven of 
which occurred in the clinical setting of myelosuppression) that were considered at least possibly related to drug treatment. Nineteen of 99 patients permanently discontinued therapy for adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients >65 years of age and younger patients in these myelodysplasia trials. No significant gender differences in safety or efficacy were detected. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non -white patients were available to draw 
conclusions in these clinical trials.  
 Serious Adverse Events that occurred in patients receiving DECITABINE regardless of 
causality, include:  
• Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly.  
• Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio- respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], cardiomyopathy, atrial

in recent years into increasing the complete response (CR) rates. In elderly patients (over the age of 60), CR rates are lower, 40 to 50%, and long term disease -free and overall 
survival is less than 10% (Dohner et al ).
1 The therapeutic options for relapsed/refractory 
AML are significantly limited. Bortezomib has shown promising activity in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, including those with leukemia and non- Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma.  Pre- clinical studies have shown that prot easome inhibition promotes apoptosis 
of tumor cells in part through stabilization of the negative regulator of nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF -κB).  Several in -vitro studies have also shown bortezomib to induce apoptosis in 
human AML cells.  In addition a recent phase I study  that utilized bortezomib in combination 
with standard induction therapy patients with relapsed/refractory AML was shown to 
produce high response rates with minimal additional toxicity.

and 11. Anthracyclines, in part, exert anti- tumor activity by [CONTACT_91819]- κB driven, anti -
apoptotic process. Laboratory evidence has suggested that activity of the transcription 
factor NF -κB promotes anthracycline resistance.   This particular resistance can be 
overcome when a proteosome inhibitor is given in conjunction with the anthracycline.   
Orlowski and colleagues performed a phase I study of bortezomib combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies resulting in a number of patients (with MM, T -cell NHL, B -cell NHL) achieving significant responses.  
This was confirmed in a phase III trial in patients with relapsed Myeloma and the

Confidential  37 combination of Velcade and Doxil is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed myeloma.  
Given the available data suggesting efficacy of bortezomib in combination with doxil in patients with relapsed MM, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and NHL as well as the known sensitivity of AML to anthracylines and in vitro  data demonstrating the sensitivity of 
multiply resistant AML cells to bortezomib, we proposed the use of this combination in 
patients with relap sed/refractory AML or elderly patients that are not candidates for  
standard induction therapy.
52 We enrolled 15 patients who were evaluable. Toxicity was 
manageable with 13% of patients experiencing grade [ADDRESS_101455] counts in 79% of patients. The duration of response was short and the maximum number of completed cycles was two.  
 The hypomethylating agents (HMA), including decitabine, have significant activity in AML and have been shown to work primarily through inhibition of DNA methyltrans ferase 
enzymes  and NF-κB.
53-58 Recently, a 10- day dosing schedule of decitabine (at 20mg/m2 IV 
days 1- 10 on a 28- day cycle) for AML has demonstrated significant activity, with CR rates 
of 40 -64% in untreated older patients and 16% in relapsed/refractory patients.59-[ADDRESS_101456] 
common. The 10- day decitabine regimen was combined with IV bortezomib in a phase I 
study in relapsed/refractory AML or untreated older patients.62 The bor tezomib dose was 
escalated to 1.3mg/m2 on days 5, 8, 12 and 15 without dose- limiting toxicities. Toxicities 
were similar to the 10 -day decitabine studies, and grade 3 neurotoxicity related to 
bortezomib was seen in 3 of 19 patients  (all three events were after induction) . CR was 
achieved in 50% of untreated and 22% of relapsed/refractory patients. These studies continued decitabine with or without bortezomib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
53-54,59-62 Based on these studies , there is an ongoing clinical trial using the 
combination of 10- day decitabine and bortezomib ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], three 
of the bortezomib doses are being administered concurrently with the 10- days of decitabine  
(decitabine days 2- 11 and bortezomib days 1, 4, 8 and 11) . 
 Given that we have shown the combination of SQ bortezomib and pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin is safe and has activity in relapsed/refractory AML and the combination of decitabine and IV bortezomib is safe and has activity in relapsed/refractory AML, we 
propose testing the combination of decitabine, SQ bortezomib and pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or older untreated patients unfit for or who refuse induction chemotherapy. We will use dosing schema established as safe and 
effective from the prior studies, including the 10 -day decitabine dosing and bortezomib at 
1.3mg/m
[ADDRESS_101457]- induction therapy . One difference from the prior 
publi shed regimen of 10- day decitabine and IV bortezomib is that we will give the 
bortezomib SQ, which is associated with decreased toxicity. Since the combination of all

regimen (62) during induction and move PLD later in the cycle to day 12. Our hypothesis is that there was synergistic toxicity between the three agents when given concurrently and 
this schedule will administer the PLD after completion of the decitabine and some of the bortezomib doses. The new dosing schedule is hypothesized to remain mechanistically relevant, given our hypothesis that NF-kB signaling can mediate anthracycline resistance and bortezomib inhibits NF- kB signaling. To lessen risk of neuropathy during post -induction 
courses, we are eliminating the day 15 and day 22 bortezomib doses and moving PLD later in the cycles to day 12.

parameters. Use of hematologic growth factors is permitted for patients in CR/CRi. Please 
refer to the study calendar in Appendix 8.1 for further study treatment and assessment 
details.  
 Rules for the safety  lead- in
: the above intended induction dose of decitabine, bortezomib 
and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin will be tested in the first 6 patients. If 0- 1 dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) are observed then the study will continue to accrue as per the Simon’s two-stage design (refer to Section 5.2 – these safety lead- in patients will be included in the 
efficacy analysis). If [ADDRESS_101464] 6 patients, then 3 additional subjects will be assessed for DLTs. If 3 or more of the 9 subjects experience DLTs, enrollment will be halted and a different schedule or dose considered. The two subjects 
experiencing DLTs at the dosing schedule per Amendment 9 will not be included in this new 
safety lead- in cohort, but will be included in the response assessment as described in 
Section 5.2. For the safety lead- in, if patients do not experience a DLT during cycle 1 but 
miss more than 20% of the total planned treatment doses for the cycle, they will be 
replaced.  
 Definition of DLT
: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_101465].  
 DLT assessments will be based on treatment -related adverse events (AEs) in the first cycle 
(C1D1 -C2D1 pre -dose). All patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced. 
Subjects will receive cycle 1 therapy regardless of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. RBC and platelet transfusion support is allowed during this time . 
Filgrastim will not be permitted during cycle 1 , unless indicated for the treatment of febrile 
neutropenia. Antimicrobial prophylaxis will also be allowed. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a given patient is defined as:   Any Grade 5 toxicity related to study treatment.  
 Hematologic : 
Due to the nature of this disease, hematologic AEs will not be considering DLTs; however,

related to study treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_91789]: 
- Grade 3 infection or febrile neutropenia is not a DLT, however an infection with life-
threatening consequences or requiring urgent intervention (Grade 4) will be considered a DLT if it is determined to be study drug related (e.g. in a subject starting treatment with a normal neutrophil count).  
Grade 3 fatigue will not be considered a DLT.  
Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea persisting greater than or equal to 7 days or Grade 4 
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_91790]/antidiarrheal therapy will be 
considered a DLT.

considered a DLT.  
Grade 3 rash persisting for less than or equal to 7 days with or without  steroids, unless it is 
a serious form of rash such as Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19342], Steven’s Johnson Syndrome or other desquamating rash or associated with anaphylaxis, will not be considered a DLT.

3.3    Study Treatments  
3.3.1   Clinical Trial Materials  
VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and is 
supplied in vials containing VELCADE and mannitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials 
containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE contain 35 mg of mannitol.  
 Doxil (Pegylated liposomal  doxorubicin) is a sterile, translucent, red liposomal dispersion 
provided in single use glass vials. Each vial contains 20 mg/ 10 ml of doxorubicin HCL or 50 mg/25ml of doxorubicin HCL at a concentration of 2mg/ml.  
 Lipodox is a drug with the same active ingredient, dosage, strength, and route of administration as Doxil, and Lipodox is manufactured in a facility that has been inspected by [CONTACT_91837]. Lipodox has not been approved by [CONTACT_8415], and therefore, FDA cannot consider it a "generic" of Doxil. The agency has exercised enforcement discretion for the importation of Lipodox during the critical shortage of Doxil.  
 Decitabine for Injection contains decitabine (5- aza-2’-deoxycitidine), an analogue of the 
natural nucleoside 2’ -deoxycytidine. Decitabine is a fine, white to almost white powder with 
the molecular formula of C8H12N4O4 and a molecular weight of 228.21. Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4-amino-1- (2-deoxy -β- D- erythro -pentofuranosyl) -1,3,5- triazin -2(1H)-one. Decitabine is 
slightly soluble in ethanol/water (50/50), methanol/water (50/50) and methanol; sparingly soluble in water and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Decitabine for Injection is a white to almost white sterile lyophilized powder supplied in a clear colorless glass vial. Each 20 mL, single dose, glass vial contains 50 mg decitabine, 68 mg monobasic potassium phosphate (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) and 11.6 mg sodium hydroxide. Please refer

The commercial supply of Doxil and decitabine will be used for this study.  
3.3.2     Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Destruction of Drugs  
VELCADE  
Vials containing lyophilized VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection should be stored 
according to the label requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC (77ºF); for Europe, do not store above 30ºC (86ºF); excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59- 86ºF).  To date, stability data indicate that the lyophilized 
drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_101474] them from light.  
Dissolution is completed in approximately 10 seconds.  The reconstituted solution is clear and colorless, with a final pH of 5 to 6.  Reconstituted VELCADE should be administered promptly and in no case more than 8 hours after reconstitution.  
Drug Administration and Dosage Schedule  
VELCADE Administration  
Velcade will be administered at 1. 3mg/m2 SQ on days 5, 8, 12 and 15 of a 4 week cycle 
during induction courses and at 1.3mg/m2 SQ on days 1, and [ADDRESS_101475]-induction courses . 
Drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis, if possible.

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/[ADDRESS_101476], or appropriately qualified 
and trained personnel.  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body weight using a standard nomogram or calculation (see Appendix 8.3).  The dose should be 
calculated on Day  1 of each cycle; the dose administered should remain the same 
throughout each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a patient experiences a >10% change in weight within a cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_91838], then the patient’s dose should be recalculated at that time based on clinical judgment.  
There must be at least [ADDRESS_101477] different reconstituted  
concentration. Caution should be used when calculating the volume to be administered.  
Reconstitution

different routes of administration. The reconstituted concentration of bortezomib for SC 
administration (2.5 mg/mL) was g reater than the reconstituted concentration of bortezomib 
for IV administration (1.0 mg/mL). See Table 3-1 below.

SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION:  
Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE.   Each vial of 
VELCADE for Injection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabinet 
(hood) within eight hours before dosing with 1.4 mL  of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium 
Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted solution contains VELCADE at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL  for subcutaneous administration.   
Subcutaneous Administration Precautions:  
• The drug quantity contained in one vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the usual dose 
required.   Caution should be used in calculating the dose to prevent overdose.

Confidential  47 • When administered subcutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) 
should be rotated.    
• New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into 
areas where the site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated.  
• If local injection site reactions occur following VELCADE administration 
subcutaneously, a less concentrated VELCADE solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 
mg/mL) may be administered subcutaneously.   Alternatively, the IV route of 
administration should be considered.   
• In clinical trials of VELCADE IV, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of patients, 
but extravasation of VELCADE was not associated with tissue damage. In a clinical trial of subcutaneous VELCADE, a local reaction was reported in 6% of patients as an adverse event, mostly redness.

Doxil  or LipoDox  
Handling instructions for the preparation of Doxil or LipoDox (pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin) solution for intravenous administration  
 
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is a sterile, translucent, red liposomal dispersion provided in single use glass vials. Each vial contains 20 mg/ 10 ml of doxorubicin HCL or 50 mg/25ml of doxorubicin HCL at a concentration of 2mg/ml. 
 Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin:  
• Use of gloves is required.  
• If pegylated liposomal doxorubicin comes into contact [CONTACT_91839], immediately  
wash thoroughly with soap and water. 
• Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin should be considered an irritant and precautions should be taken to avoid extravasation. With intravenous administration, extravasation may occur with or without an accompanying stinging or burning sensation, even if blood returns well on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_91792]. If any signs or symptoms of

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/[ADDRESS_101478] occurred, the infusion should be immediately terminated and 
restarted in another vein.  
• Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin must not be given by [CONTACT_91840].  
• Refrigerate at 2° -8°C. Avoid freezing.  
• Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin should be handled and disposed of in a manner consistent with other anticancer drugs. 
Doxil or Lipodox Administration  
The appropriate dose of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, up to [ADDRESS_101479] be diluted in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration. Doses exceeding 90 mg should be diluted in 500 ml of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration. Aseptic 
technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The diluted preparation must be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and administered within 24 hours.  
• Do not use with in- line filters.  
• Do not mix with other drugs.  
• Do not mix with any diluent other than 5% Dextrose Injection.  
• Do not use any bacteriostatic agent, such as benzyl alcohol.  
 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is not a clear solution but a translucent, red liposomal dispersion.  
 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_91793]. 
Rapid flushing of the infusion line should be avoided.  
Doxil or LipoDox Dosage and Administration  
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin will be administered once every four weeks as a single  
intravenous infusion at a dose of 40 mg/m
2 (day 12 of each cycle), at an initial rate of 1 
mg/min to minimize the risk of infusion reactions. If no infusion- related AEs are observed, 
the rate of infusion can be increased to complete administration of the drug over one hour.  
Body surface area (BSA) calculation will be based on actual body weight.  Dose 
adjustments  should be made for any change in body weight >10% occurring throughout the 
study. Patients seen to be benefiting from treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
may continue to receive treatment once every three weeks until satisfactory response (CR, 
PR, SD), progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death occurs or defined in the protocol. At all times, the investigator may discontinue the subject from the study at his or

(HFS), stomatitis, or hematologic toxicity, the dose may be delayed or reduced.  
 
Injection Site Effects  
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is not a vesicant, but should be considered an irritant and  
precautions should be taken to avoid extravasation. With intravenous administration of  
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, extravasation may occur with or without an accompanying  
stinging or burning sensation, even if blood returns well on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_91792].  
If any signs or symptoms of extravasation have occurred, the infusion should be immediately terminated and restarted in another vein. The application of ice over the site of extravasation for approximately [ADDRESS_101480] not be given by [CONTACT_91841].  
 Infusion reactions  
Serious and sometimes life -threatening or fatal allergic/anaphylactoid- like infusion reactions  
have been reported with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Medications to treat such 
reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use.  These 
reactions were characterized by [CONTACT_91842]: flushing,  shortness 
of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and 
throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, 
apnea, and hypotension. In most patients, these reactions resolve over the course of several hours to a day once the infusion is terminated. In some patients, the reaction resolved when the rate of infusion was slowed. The majority of infusion- related events 
occur during the first infusion. Similar reactions have not been reported with conventional doxorubicin and they presumably represent a reaction to the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin liposomes or one of its surface components. The initial rate of infusion should be 1 mg/min to help minimize the risk of infusion reactions.  
 
Storage and Stability  
Refrigerate unopened vials  of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). 
Avoid freezing. Prolonged freezing may adversely affect liposomal drug products; however, 
short -term freezing (less than 1 month) does not appear to have a deleterious effect on 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.

Doxil or LipoDox Dose Modification and Delay  
Patients treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) should be carefully monitored 
for toxicity. Following the first appearance of a Grade 2 or higher adverse event  related to

Confidential  55 Cardiac toxicity  
Cardiac function should be carefully monitored in patients treated with pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin. (Doxil® Product Information Booklet 2005)  The use of pegylated liposomal  
doxorubicin injection may lead to cardiac toxicity. Acute left ventricular failure can occur,  
particularly in patients who have received total dosage exceeding the currently recommended limit of 550 mg/m
2. Lower doses (400 mg/m2) appear to cause heart failure 
in patients who have received prior radiotherapy to the mediastinal area or are receiving concomitant therapy with other potentially cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin should be administered to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk, and cardiac function should be carefully monitored. All patients who enroll in the study are required to have a MUGA scan or a 2- D echocardiogram performed at screening (within 30 days prior 
to start of study medication), every two cycles starting with Cycle 7 (e.g. , pre-Cycle 7, 9, 11, 
and End of Study Treatment. The LVEF value at screening must be >=50%. All MUGA/2- D 
echocardiograms must be recorded on video and maintained at the site. During treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, when a patient has reached a total (lifetime cumulative) anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m
2, follow -up MUGA scans or 2 -D 
echocardiograms are to be performed every two cycles  (and this schedule will replace the 
schedule of assessments every two cycles after Cycle 6 listed above for applicable patients) . Additional evaluations may be performed throughout the trial as clinically 
indicated for patients receiving  pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to monitor cardiac toxicity. 
If left ventricular ejection fraction declines to less than 45% or a decrease by [CONTACT_91844] 20% from the baseline value is noted, treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is to be temporarily suspended or discontinued and restarted at investigator 
discretion.
[ADDRESS_101490]-induction therapy per protocol, pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin should be discontinued once the total lifetime doxorubicin (or 
equivalent) dose of 550 m g/m2 is reached or a m aximum of 12 cycles . These subjects may 
continue on protocol therapy without pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at investigator 
discretion. 
 
Other toxicities  
If a patient in the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin arm experiences any other Grade 3 or 4  
non-hematologic toxicity  related to PLD , PLD should be held until the toxicity  resolves to < 
Grade 2 and subsequent doses of Doxil should be dose reduced by 25% . If the ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_101491] be discontinued.  These subjects may continue on protocol

Monitoring Plan. The UCDCC is committed to pursuing high- quality patient -oriented clinical 
research and has established mechanisms to ensure both scientific rigor and patient safety in the conduct of  clinical research studies. The UCDCC relies on a multi -tiered committee 
system that reviews and monitors all cancer clinical trials and ensures the safety of its 
participants, in compliance with institutional and federal requirements on adverse event 
(AE) reporting, verification of data accuracy, and adherence to protocol eligibility 
requirements, treatment guidelines, and related matters. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) assumes overall oversight of cancer studies, with assistance and input from two independent, but interacting, committees: the Quality Assurance Committee and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. A multi -level review system strengthens the ability of the 
UCDCC to fulfill its mission in conducting high quality clinical cancer research.  
 As per University of [LOCATION_004] Davis Cancer Center (UCDCC) Clinical Trials Support Unit (CTSU) SOP AM 506: Protocol Specific Meetings, the principal investigator (PI), clinical research coordinator (CRC), and the clinical research nurse meet at least mont hly for 
ongoing study information, to discuss patient data and adverse events and to determine if dose escalation is warranted, when applicable.   
 According to the UCDCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), any new serious adverse events related to the drugs being used on this trial are reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_91851] (DSMC) and any applicable changes to the study are recommended to the PI, if necessary.  
 The UCDCC Scientific Review Committee (SRC) determines if a UCDCC Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is required.  If required, the DSMC will appoint a DSMB. The

4.    ADVERSE EVENTS  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, causality, and whether 
commercial or investigational VELCADE is used) must be reported to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  See Section 4.3 for the reporting of SAEs.  
The sponsor -investigator is responsible to meet all regulations and requirements  applicable 
to the sponsor -investigator.  
4.1    Definitions  
4.1.1    Adverse Event Definit ion 
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.  
For this protocol an abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.  
Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unint ended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. This includes adverse 
reactions which arise from: use of a medicinal product within the terms of the mar keting 
authorization; use outside the terms of the marketing authorization, including overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors; and occupational exposure*.

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/17  
Confidential  63 * This corresponds to the exposure to a medicinal product for human use as a result of 
one’s occupation, such as nurses who may handle products routinely in their occupational 
setting.  
4.1.2    Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see clarification  below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91800] 4.2). 
• Results in persistent  or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.    
o Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
o With respect to the suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), whether 
pathogenic or non- pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.   
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
University of [LOCATION_004] Davis   VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection  
Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/17  
Confidential  64 (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
4.2    Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Adverse events (AEs) may be spontaneously identified by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to 
an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures .  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory 
assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE.  AEs which are serious must be 
reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from first dose of VELCADE up to and including [ADDRESS_101503] be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from the first dose of bortezomib up to and including [ADDRESS_101504] dose of bortezomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of 
VELCADE treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the investigator and/or 
sponsor -investigator considers to be related to any study drug must
 be reported to the 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91801] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should 
be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Since this is an invest igator -initiated study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_91802], MD , 
also referred to as the sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s EC or IRB.   
Regardl ess of expectedness or causality, all SAEs  must also be reported in English to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance or designee.  Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 
hours of the sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event . 
All other serious (non- fatal/non- life threatening) events within 5 calendar days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.

• Intensity of the event(s) : Sponsor -investigator’s or sub- investig ator’s determination. 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by [CONTACT_91852] , as a guideline, whenever possible.  
The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
• Causality of the event(s) and): Sponsor -investigator’s or sub- investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration.

Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by [CONTACT_91853], as a guideline, whenever possible.  The cr iteria are 
available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
In the event that this is a multisite study, the sponsor -investigator is responsible to ensure 
that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all si tes 
participating in the study.  Sub- investigators must report all SAEs to the sponsor -
investigator so that the sponsor -investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting 
obligations to the required regulatory agencies and to Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor -investigator and sub- investigator(s).   
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator by [CONTACT_91854]: Is there a reasonable possibility that 
the AE is associated with the study drug(s)?

5.    STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
5.1    Study Design and Overview of Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
This is an open label , Phase II study in patients with relapse/ref ractory AML or previously 
untreated patients that are not candidates for standard induction therapy.  The primary endpoints are overall response rate and PFS. The secondary endpoints are overall survival and toxicity. There will be a safety lead- in to assess dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the 
first 6-9 subje cts described in Section 3.1 .

Clinical Study Protocol [UCDCC#230]   Version Date:   04/03/17  
Confidential  67 5.2    Sample Size Estimation/Accrual Rate  
Up to 14 patients will be treated with decitabine, SQ VELCADE and doxil at dose levels 
previously established to be safe  (including the two patients treated per the dosing 
schedule in Amendment 9) . Fifteen patients have been treated to date through prior 
versions of this protocol with SQ bortezomib and peylated liposomal doxorubicin. Objective 
response (CR  + CRi + PR) will be monitored using Simon’s minimax  2-stage design. This 
study design is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the expected sample size among 
competing designs. The OR rate in relapsed/refractory AML patients treated with a 10- day 
decitabine regimen is estimated to be approximately 16%. A 30% increase in the objective 
response rate with the addition of VELCADE and Doxil to 46% would justify evaluation of 
this regimen in larger, more definitive trials. We assume a one- sided type I error rate of 5% 
and desire at least 80% power to conclude that this regimen elicits an objective response 
rate significantly greater than 16% if the true response rate of this regimen is 46% or higher. 
Under these assumptions, if 2 or fewer OR’s are observed in the first 9 patients  (which 
includes the two patients treated per the dosing schedule in Amendment 9) , the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_91803]. 
Otherwise, accrual will continue to a total of 14 patients. If 5 or more OR’s are observed in 
14 patients, this regimen will be deemed sufficiently active to warrant further study.  
 The sample size determination and rules for the safety lead- in portion are described in 
detail in Section 3.1.

summarized with frequency tables and 95% confidence intervals, and compared to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91804]. Continuous variables (e.g., age, hematology values, molecular studies/cytogenetics/Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH )) 
will be summarized using the mean (s.d.) or median (range). Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables. Logistic regression will be used to assess the impact of patient characteristics (e.g., cytogenetics)  on the objective response rate. The distribution of 
time-to-event endpoints (e.g., CR , PFS, overall survival) will be estimated using the method 
of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time- to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_91855] (based on known prognostic factors, e.g cytogenetics) will be made using the

Toxicity information recorded will  include the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, 
and the probable association with the study regimen.  Tables will be constructed to 
summarize the observed incidence by [CONTACT_91639].   
Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. 
The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 whenever possible. Unacceptable toxicity experienced in patients will be monitored according to guidelines for monitoring toxicity in pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/phase II trials using sequential probability ratio test based criteria.  The guidelines will be used to raise a flag if the number of patients who experience unacceptable toxicity is excessive is greater than 20%.  Toxicity information recorded will include the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with the study regimen. Tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by [CONTACT_91639].  Baseline information (e.g. the extent of prior therapy, extent of disease) and demographic information will be presented, as well, to describe the patients treated in this Phase II study.

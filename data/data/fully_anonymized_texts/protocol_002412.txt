Background and Rationale:
Crisaborole, also referred to as PF-06930164 and AN2728, is a low molecular weight 
benzoxaborole anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor that penetrates into the skin to the sites of inflammation.  PDE-4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.  While the specific mechanism(s) by[CONTACT_686424], it is thought that crisaborole reduces the production of several inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD).
Supporting evidence of the safety and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older 
represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the treatment-limiting effects of currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in favor of crisaborole ointment 2% BID versus vehicle ointment BID in the two Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].  Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no crisaborole treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classified as possibly related), and the majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild and deemed unlikely or not related to investigational product.  Safety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients younger than 2 years of age.
This 4-week study will evaluate the safety, , and efficacy of 
crisaborole ointment 2%, applied twice daily (BID) in subjects who are 3 months to less than 24 months of age with mild-to-moderate AD.  The dose selected for this study has been shown to be safe, well tolerated and efficacious in patients and healthy volunteers 2 years of age and older who participated in previously conducted studies.  Based on these results and the observed  profile of crisaborole, it is anticipated that crisaborole ointment 2% will demonstrate similar efficacy and satisfactory safety and local tolerability in the pediatric population to be enrolled in this study.
Objectives and Endpoints:
Primary Objective Primary Endpoint(s)
To study the safety of crisaborole ointment 2% 
applied twice daily (BID) in children aged 3 months to less than 24 months with mild to moderate ADIncidence of treatment emergent AEs (including 
application site reactions), SAEs, and clinically significant changes in height, weight, vital signs,

Subjects in the  cohort will also have twice dailyclinic visits on Days [ADDRESS_930401] and a minimum of 1 clinic visit on Day 8 for  sample collection and additional study procedures. Following the Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_930402] application, some or all of the remaining applications through Day 8 AM as well as 2 of the 3 scheduled Day 8  sample collections may be performed by a qualified health care professional in the subjects’ home at the discretion of the Investigator and subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian.  One on-site visit is required on Day 8 to perform the remaining visit assessments.
For the 16 subjects in the  Cohort 3 additional blood samples of approximately 1 mL each 
(approximately 3 mL total), will be collected for plasma  analysis, according to the following schedule:
Before the Day 8 AM dose (ie, 168 1 hour after recorded time of completion of the 
Day 1 dose application);

1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
Crisaborole, also referred to as PF- 06930164 and AN2728, is a low molecular weight 
benzo xaborole anti -inflammatory phosphodiesterase -4 (PDE -4) inhibitor that penetrates into 
the skin to the sites of inflammation.  PDE -4 inhibition results in increased intracellular 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.  While the specific mechanism(s) by
[CONTACT_686424], it is thought that 
crisaborole reduces the production of several inflammatory cytokines implicated in the 
pathophy siology of atopic dermatitis (AD).   
On 14thDecember 2016, EUCRI SA(Crisaborole) Ointment 2% was approved by [CONTACT_170055] (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in patients 
2years of age and older.
1.2.Background 
AD, alsoreferred to as eczema , is a chronic and relapsing disease affecting an i ncreasing 
number of patients.  Although AD affects patients of all ages, it is one of the most common, 
chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15- 30% of all children in the United 
States (US) with 85% of affected individuals showing signs of the disease before [ADDRESS_930409] a personal or family  history  of other atopic condition s such as 
asthma or allergic rhinitis.1,4  The majority  of patients (up to 90%) with AD present with 
mild to moderate disease.5Manifestation of the disease includes intense pruritus, 
erythematous papules, excoriation, exudation, lichenification, and bacterial colonization.6
Continuous scratching during exacerbations can lead t o lichenification, excoriations, and 
serious skin infections. AD is often associated with other conditions including asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, and food allerg y. AD has been cited as a major risk factor for the 
development of asthma in a number of longit udinal studies, and children with AD are at 
increased odds 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_686387].7,8The burden of the 
clinical sy mptoms of AD coupled with the stigma associated with highly  visible skin lesions 
correlates with significant morbidity  and extensive impairments on health related quality  of 
life measures (HRQL) for patients, especially  in children, and caregivers.1,9,10,[ADDRESS_930410] on HRQoL  caused b y childhood AD exceeds that in asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , 
and diabetes, is comparable to that in renal disease or cy stic fibrosis, and is equal (child) or 
exceeds (parents) th at in psoriasis.2,10,13  The hallmark symptom of itching causes scratching 
which is associated with sleep disturbance in greater than 60% of patients. Sleep deprivation 
leads to phy sical and mental exhaustion in patients and other famil y members resulting in 
loss of concentration and impaired performance at school or work.14
,15AD is often 
associated with significant childhood behavioral problems and ps ychological disorders 

Crisaborole (PF-06930164 [AN2728])
C3291002
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page 20including depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, stress, and autism.16  
Pre-school children with AD show a significant increase in behavioral symptoms compared with matched controls.
17  Absolon et al18reported that the rate of psychological disturbance 
in school-age children with AD doubled compared with matched controls. For older children with AD, in addition to problems associated with itching and sleep disturbance, their social and school life may be substantially affected. Social embarrassment, due to visible signs of the disease (crusted, excoriated, oozing, bleeding lesions), teasing, and bullying, often results in social isolation leading to depression.
[ADDRESS_930411] on the overall well-being of the patient and their family on multiple levels; medical management and treatment, HRQoL, and psycho-social implications. In summary, AD is a disease with multiple comorbidities and significant impact on the health, day to day functioning, and HRQoL of AD patients, their caregivers, and family members.
AD may also be a source of significant economic burden
19as this relapsing disease is often 
misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and ineffectively treated.[ADDRESS_930412] in patients 2 years and older represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the treatment-limiting effects of currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in favor of crisaborole ointment 2% BID versus vehicle ointment BID in the two Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491]. Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no crisaborole treatment-related SAEs (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classified as possibly related), and the majority of AEs were mild and deemed unlikely or not related to investigational product.  Safety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients younger than 2 years of age.

favorable and supported by [CONTACT_716]:
The expected efficacy of crisaborole ointment 2% for the treatment of atopic 
dermatitis based on the results of clinical studies conducted to date;
The expected limited crisaborole systemic exposure when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_686388] 2% to date;
The satisfactory safety and local tolerability demonstrated in non-clinical and clinical 
studies conducted with crisaborole ointment 2% to date.
The main benefit for subjects participating in this study is based on access to regular clinical 
assessments and active atopic disease management as well as expected efficacy of treatment with crisaborole during the study. Based on the favorable clinical safety profile as well as the limited systemic exposure of crisaborole, the risk to subjects treated with crisaborole is deemed to be minimal and appropriately monitored. 
1.3. Drug Development
Crisaborole ointment 2% is an oxaborole compound developed as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_247024]-inflammatory agent. It demonstrates in vitro inhibition of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammatory skin diseases. Crisaborole has been formulated as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_125053]. The formulation ingredients for crisaborole ointment 2% are listed in Section 5 .
Crisaborole inhibits a range of cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin 
diseases, including TNF- , IFN-y, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23.
22The level of 
inhibitory activity, ie, the concentrations needed to produce 50% inhibition, ranges from the high nanomolar to the low micromolar concentrations. Crisaborole also inhibits the release of chemokines that are important inflammatory mediators. One mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of crisaborole is through inhibition PDE-4. Crisaborole proved efficacious against an inflammatory challenge in vivo, in a mouse model of ear edema induced by [CONTACT_686430] 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Crisaborole formulated as ointment and cream formulations for topi[INVESTIGATOR_686389]. Safety has been evaluated in a total of 23 completed clinical studies.

In support of the current clinical study to evaluate crisaborole ointment 2% in children (aged 3 to less than 24 months), a juvenile toxicity study in rats was conducted.  Juvenile rats were administered crisaborole by [CONTACT_686431] 4 weeks (from postnatal Days 7 to 35) at 0, 15, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day followed by a 2-week recovery period.  Exposures at the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL, 100 mg/kg/day) in this study were approximately 9× higher than those observed in the AD Maximal Use Systemic Exposure (MUSE) clinical study.
Based on the nonclinical safety studies conducted to date, crisaborole ointment 2% has an 
acceptable safety profile.  Refer to the IB for further information on the nonclinical experience with

differences in burning/stinging, erythema, or pruritus at any of the application sites over the course of the study between subjects who received crisaborole ointment 2% or Vehicle.Overall, crisaborole ointment 2% was well to lerated over 21 days of dosing in sensitive skin
areas of healthy subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitizing and Cumulative Irritation Potential
In a repeat-insult patch test and cumulative irritation study in healthy subjects 
(Study AN2728-RIPT-101), the potential for inducing cutaneous sensitization was assessed in 238 subjects randomized in Cohort 1.  None of the subjects demonstrated cutaneous evidence of sensitization potential (a reaction of at least Grade 4 [definite edema] or a pattern suggestive of contact [CONTACT_686432][INVESTIGATOR_689]) to the investigational products, crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  The potential for causing cutaneous irritation was evaluated among 40 subjects randomized in Cohort 2.  There were no statistically significant differences in irritation between the crisaborole ointment 2% and vehicle.  Crisaborole ointment 2% and vehicle showed no evidence of sensitization and only very minimal irritation.

1.4. Rationale 
1.4.1. Study and Dose Rationale 
This 4-week safety study will evaluate the safety profile of crisaborole ointment 2% BID in 
subjects who are [ADDRESS_930418]-approval commitment to FDA as part of the pediatric study plan.
The dose strength and regimen selected for this study has been shown to be safe, well 
tolerated and efficacious in patients and healthy volunteers 2 years of age and older who participated in previously conducted studies of crisaborole.  Crisaborole ointment 2% applied BID was studied in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies, and a Phase [ADDRESS_930419] compared to vehicle with no safety concerns in patients 2 years and older.

Page 26demonstrated that the long-term use was well tolerated and not associated with any systemic 
safety signals.  The Phase 1 maximal use absorption study in children and adolescents aged2 to 17 years old,
36showed that subjects who were administered crisaborole ointment 
2% BID (single dose on Days 1 and 8) to had overall blood levels of crisaborole that were similar to those previously observed in adults after 
.  An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no statistically 
significant differences in  parameters between the age cohorts represented in the study (Cohort 1, ages 12–17 years; Cohort 2, ages 6–11 years; and Cohort 3, ages 2–5 years). 
Based on the results of clinical studies conducted with crisaborole ointment 2% to date, it is 
anticipated that crisaborole ointment 2% will demonstrate similar efficacy and satisfactory safety and local tolerability in the pediatric population to be enrolled in this study.

5.1. Allocation to Treatment
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular subject or affect the order in which subjects are enrolled.
All subjects will receive crisaborole ointment 2% during their participation in this study.  
Subjects will be enrolled through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) system (interactive Web-based response [IWR]).  The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number and dispensable unit (DU) or container number(s) assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
The study-specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_110275]. 
5.2. Subject Compliance
For subjects in the  cohort, a subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen 
if they receive at least [ADDRESS_930429] doses (no more than 2 missed doses between Day 1 and Day 6) administered in accordance with the protocol.  Thereafter,  cohort subjects will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if they receive at least [ADDRESS_930430] doses (ie, 80–120%, inclusive, of the expected number of doses) administered in accordance with the protocol.
For Non-PK subjects, a total of [ADDRESS_930431] doses (ie, 80–120%, inclusive, of the expected number of doses) administered in accordance with the protocol.
Following the Baseline/Day 1 visit, a parent/legal guardian will apply crisaborole ointment 
2% to the subject at home for subjects in the nonPK cohort The  cohort will have investigational product applied either at the site or at home by a visiting healthcare professional during the PK portion of the study, and the remaining doses applied at home.  Compliance with all at-home dosing will be recorded by [CONTACT_7071](s)/legal guardian using a dosing diary provided by [CONTACT_779].

minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The in tent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007].  
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used

Page 365.5. Administration
Crisaborole ointment 2% is for external use on the skin only.  Large areas that need to be 
treated can have the ointment applied slowly and segmentally to minimize pain associated with application. Subjects should avoid contact [CONTACT_426881] (ie, inside of nostrils, mouth, vagina, urethra, and rectum), and the eyes.  Additionally, for subjects in the 
 cohort, though AD lesions in the perioral area (within 2 cm of the mouth) or on the 
extremities (below wrists and below ankles) are exclusionary at baseline, if they occur following enrollment, crisaborole ointment 2% should not be applied to those areas during the  phase (Day 1 AM dose through Day 8 final  sample collection) in order to reduce the possibility of accidental ingestion that could adversely affect  results.
5.6. Preparation and Dispensing of Investigational Product
Within this protocol, preparation refers to the investigator site activities performed to make 
the investigational product ready for administration or dispensing to the subject/caregiver by [CONTACT_3436].  Dispensing is defined as the provision of investigational product, concomitant treatments, and accompanying information by [CONTACT_22806](s) to ahealthcare provider, subject, or caregiver in accordance with this protocol.  Local health authority regulations or investigator site guidelines may use alternative terms for these activities. 
The investigational product will be dispensed using an IRT drug management system from 
Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_930433] via unique container numbers in the cartons provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule.  
For doses to be administered at home, the caregiver (parent(s)/legal guardian) or the visiting 
health care professional, where applicable, should be instructed to maintain the product in the package provided throughout the course of dosing and return all used and unused product and cartons to the site at the next study visit.
5.7. Investigational Product Application
5.7.1. Non-PK Cohort Subjects
Before the Day [ADDRESS_930434] application is performed, the designated areas 
for treatment will be identified at the Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_930435]’s study records. The subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian will be provided with a body map 
documenting the designated treatment areas and a paper dosing diary for recording all 
investigational product applications applied at home.
Wearing gloves, study staff will apply a thin layer of crisaborole ointment 2% to all treatable 
AD lesions identified at Baseline/Day 1 for the purpose of instructing the parent(s)/legal guardian how to dispense and apply the ointment. All subsequent doses, including second dose on Day 1, will be applied at home.  See Section 5.8 for details regarding study treatment

Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_930455] Withdrawal/Early Termination
The following criteria will be considered for the subjects’ discontinuation or withdrawal from 
the study:
The occurrence of adverse events that require the subject to stop participation in the 
study, due to availability for, or intolerance to, the study procedures.
Adverse effects of the study active ingredient that are considered to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_686439], and/or might be harmful to the subjects’ health.
Abnormal laboratory tests considered to be clinically relevant.
Concurrent diseases that require use of a prohibited medication.

 
 
  
Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions.
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study at any time at their parent(s)/legal guardian’s 
request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section) or, 
behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given investigator site.  The early termination visit applies only to subjects who are enrolled and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study.
Subjects should return to the clinic for the early termination visit as early as practically 
feasible following the decision to withdraw from the study.  Subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal.  Every effort must be made to complete the assessments outlined in the Day 29/End of Treatment visit (Section 6.8 ). Subjects will in addition be requested to be available for the follow-up 
contacts at [ADDRESS_930456] dose of study treatment.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the subject’s safety was preserved.
Withdrawal of consent :
Subjects for whom it has been requested to discontinue receipt of study treatment by [CONTACT_31588](s)/legal guardian must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures.  The only exception to this is when a subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian specifically withdraws consent for the subject for any further contact [CONTACT_686440]. The subject’s parent(s)/legal CCI

In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the 
investigator upon consultation with the sponsor. In the  cohort, subjects discontinuing for reasons other than TEAE may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor to ensure [ADDRESS_930458] to follow-up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow-up with persons authorized by [CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/legal guardian as noted above.  Lost to follow-up is defined by [CONTACT_686441]’s parent(s)/legal guardian after a minimum of [ADDRESS_930459]’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian contact [CONTACT_53983]-up portion of the study.  The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031]. If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last-known-alive date as determined by [CONTACT_109415]’s medical records.
If a subject is not brought back for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
[CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/legal guardian.  The Investigator or site staff should attempt to contact 
[CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/legal guardian twice.  After [ADDRESS_930460]’s parent(s)/legal guardian, the subject will be considered lost to follow up.  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/legal guardian and information received during contact [CONTACT_155806]’s medical record.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.

Page 607.1.2. Physical Examination, including Height/Length, and Weight
Physical examinations, including height/length, and weight will be performed at times 
specified in the STUDY PROCEDURES section of this protocol.
Physical examinations may be conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation.  A full physical examination will include, but is not limited to the following organ or body systems: head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, abdomen (liver, spleen), cardiovascular, and neurological systems.  In addition, an assessment will be made of the condition of all AD-involved skin.  
The limited or abbreviated physical examination will be focused on general appearance, the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, and neurological systems, as well as towards symptoms reported by [CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/legal guardian. In addition, symptoms and signs of diarrhea and vomiting should be assessed to monitor for evidence of dehydration.
The neurological examination component of all physical examinations should include 
evaluation of clinical signs that have been associated, in published reports, with  toxicity
[ADDRESS_930463]’s AD related signs.  
Results from blood pressure and prior ECG assessments should be referred to when 
performing the cardiovascular component of all physical examinations in order to actively monitor for clinical signs that have been associated, in published reports, with  toxicityincluding hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia.
For both weight and height/length measurements, the investigator or examiner should be 
trained in measuring height/length and weight as well as in calibration procedures. Ideally, the same person should measure the subject at every visit. Attempts should be made to schedule visits, so that measurements can be taken at approximately the same time throughout the study. The parent / caregiver is needed to help with measurement and to soothe and comfort the child. Explain to the parent/ caregiver the steps in the procedures and that it is important to keep the child still and calm to obtain good measurements. 
For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be 
placed on a stable, flat surface.  Subjects must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and 
jackets so that only light clothing remains.  They must also remove the contents of their 
pockets and remain still during measurement of weight.
For measuring length, a length board (infantometer) must be used and be placed on a flat, 
stable surface, such as a table.
For both weight and height/length, three reproducible measurements of both the child’s 
weight and height/length should be recorded and the average of the 3 recordings will be entered onto the eCRF.CC

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.

occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associa ted with an AE), 
except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy , 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
Abbreviations: CRF=case report form; CT=clinical trial; SAE=serious adverse event; AE=adverse event.
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require rep orting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_930467] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of t he event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, lab oratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.

Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728])
C329 [ADDRESS_930468]
in the det ermination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to reco rd on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject’s 
parent(s)/legal guardian .  In addition, each study subject’s 
parent(s)/legal guardian will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non -leading 
manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal/Early Termination section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.  
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_930469] s who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Fo rm.

Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728])
C329 [ADDRESS_930470] after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being rela ted to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non -serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_686443] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record t he causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the invest
igational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the even t will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local r egulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, bu t are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;

C329 1002
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page 70Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include si gns and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when any  of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result lea ds to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.

Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728])
C329 [ADDRESS_930471] medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /inca pacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospit alization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admiss ion also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page 72Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief );
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no pla ce to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elec tive 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and thera peutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the a djectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with s ubject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.

Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728])
C329 1002
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page 73Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for Serious Adverse Events, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans expos ed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger o f a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 t imes the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.” 
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) prec ede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare insta nces, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiolog y of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:

C329 1002
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page 74Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or 
ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_930472] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood tra nsfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test ( LFT)abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.  
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after a ll results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.

Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728])

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 01 May 2018
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discont inuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemothera peutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
In this protocol, in which the [ADDRESS_930473] via topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407] b y the parent/legal guardian, an EDP may  
occur to the parent/legal guardian via environmental exposure.  
If a subject ’s parent/legal guardian becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addi tion, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  usin g the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to te rmination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and no tify [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -
up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths t hat occur within [ADDRESS_930474].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Re lease of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awaren ess, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Repo rt Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product by [CONTACT_1148], or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Medication errors include:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately.Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149], as determined by [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and non-serious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_930476] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Sample Size Determination
This is a multi-center, open-label, safety study of subjects with AD.  To ensure 
100 completers, 125 subjects will be enrolled assuming a 20% drop out rate.  Of the [ADDRESS_930477] completed all  assessments will be included in a

9.6. Data Monitoring Committee 
This study will use an external data monitoring committee (E-DMC). 
The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of subjects in the study 
according to the charter.  The recommendations made by [CONTACT_941] E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for a final decision.  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may also occur after study completion.
During study conduct and/or after study completion, the investigator site may be subject to 
review by [CONTACT_686446]/ethics committee (IRB/EC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].
The investigator(s) will notify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission to the regulatory CCI

and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292].  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained ( if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Reten tion
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] ), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.

Page 83If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study  records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institu tion, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_930483] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals shou ld be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/ ECand [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Gu idelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
or other identifiable data in any  reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required b y law. 
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_686420] p arties, subject 
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical codes based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study  subjects.  The investigator 
site will maintain a confidential list of subjects wh o participated in the study , linking each 
subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will

before use, and available for inspection.
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under local law, they  must re -consent as adults to remain in the study .  If the 
enrollment of emancipated minors is permitted by  [CONTACT_74100], the I RB/EC, and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent witho ut the 
permission of a parent or legal guardian.
All subjects enrolled in this study  will be 3 months to less than 24 months of age at the time 
of their enrollment in this study . The maximum duration of this study  is 88days and 
therefore no subjects will reach an age where they  are able to provide informed 
consent/assent during their participation. As such, informed consent must be obtained from 
their parent(s)/legal guardian .
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject’s parent(s)/legal guardia nis fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian , the subject’s assent 
(affirmative agreement) must subsequently  be obtained when the subject has the capacit y to 
provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that a subject’s 
decisional capacit y is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted b y 
the IRB/EC and consiste nt with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the subject’s assent 
may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the 
study  subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record 
why the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionall y impaired adult), how the 
investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject’s legally  
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, pare nt, 
spouse), and that the subject’s assent was obtained or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y, 
it must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from the subject's parent(s)/legal guardian before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent 
document.

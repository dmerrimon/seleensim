A summary of revisions to this SAP includes:
Changes in wording to simplify  and distinguish between extension Baseline/Week and 
core Baseline/Week (coBL/coWeek vs exBL /exWeek) ,
Other baseline characteristics: changes in some categories and addition of some 
variables reflecting the treatment interval related to the transition period ,
BCVA and CSFT: 
oChange sin categories and baseline values considered for the shift tables
oRemoval of sensitivity analy sis based on observed data without imputation and 
without censoring of assessments after start of alternative anti -VEGF treatment 
in the study  eye, due to the low number of cases observed during the study 
conduct,

1 Introduction
This Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) describes the analyses to be conducted after Database Lock 
(DBL).
This SAP describes the analysis according to Section 9 of the study  protocol along with any 
additional anal yses, specifications or deviations from the protocol .  
1.1 Stud y design
This is a double -masked, multicenter, two-arm extension study . Patients recruited at US sites 
who completed the 96-week core study  CRTH258A2301 (also referred to as RTH258 -C001) , 
regardless of the treatment group (brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg) 
are eligible for inclusion in the extension study  provided Visit 26/ Week 96 in the core study  is 
≤ 12 weeks from the Basel ine visit in the extension study . The time period between the End of 
Study visit (EoS) of the core study  and the first visit of the e xtension study  is referred to as the 
transition period. Patients who were treated with aflibercept during the core study  will continue 
to receive aflibercept in the extension study . Patients who were treated with brolucizumab 3mg 
or 6mg in the core st udy will receive brolucizumab 6 mg in the extension study .
Enrolled patients receive three intravitreal injections of either brolucizumab 6mg or aflibercept 
2mg according to the protocol specified dosing schedule . This extension study  consists of 7 
study  visits at 4-week intervals, labeled Visit 1/Baseline to Visit 7/EoS over a period of 24 
weeks. 
The study  eye will be the same eye that received brolucizumab or aflibercept study  treatment 
in the core stud y.
Approximately  75 to100 patients who completed study  CRTH258A2301 are expected to be 
enrolled in this study . This sample size is not based on a power calculation but depends on the 
number of patients in the core stud y fulfilling the eligibility  criteria of the extension study .
The final analysis will be conducted on allenrolled patient data at the time the trial ends. An y 
data analysis carried out independently  by [CONTACT_85689].

Objective(s) Endpoint(s)
To collect data on safety and efficac y of the 
brolucizumab [ADDRESS_726622] used in Phase III clinical studiesIncidence and characteristics of treatment 
emergent adverse events (AE)
Loss in B est Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) of [ADDRESS_726623] -baseline visit
Change in BCVA from Baseline at each 
post-baseline visit
q12 treatment status at Week 24

2 Statistical methods
2.1 Data analy sisgeneral information
The final analy sis will be performed by [CONTACT_552724] 9.4.  This SAP describes 
the anal yses to be conducted after the final DBL.  
No formal hypothesis testing is planned for this study. Neither the patient selection proce ss nor 
the expected sample size support a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. 
Therefore, descriptive analy ses will be presented for the brolucizumab treatment group with 
selected analyses presented stratified by [CONTACT_552725] (brolucizumab 6mg, 
brolucizu mab 3mg). Data for the aflibercept treatment group will be presented in listings, no 
analyses will be performed for this treatment group.    
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, standard errors, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum valu
es. Categorical 
variables will be summarized with number of observations, the number of observations for each 
catego ry and the corresponding percent.

2.1.1 General d efinition s
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline and post -baselin e definitions
Extension baseline (Day  1) is defined as the date of the first study  treatment in the extension 
study . The extension baseline value for efficacy  and safety  variables is the last available value 
collected  pri or to the first study  treatment .
All data collected after first study  treatment are d efined as post- baseline. 
The study  day for a n extension post-baseline scheduled or unscheduled visit is defined as :
Study day = (d ate of visit) –(date of first study treatment in the extension study ) + 1
The study  day for a scheduled or unscheduled visit before extension baseline is defined as:
Study day = (date of visit) – (date of first study treatment in the extension study )
[IP_ADDRESS] End of study /end of treatment day  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_552723] a patient completes or discontinues the study. The “Date 
of Last Exposure” is the date of the last study  treatment. 
For reporting data by [CONTACT_552726], the end of study/end of treatment visit will be allocated 
to the actual (repo rted) visit number. If end of study  date is not on a scheduled visit, then the
end of study  visit will be allocated ,based on study  day,to the closest future scheduled study 
visit.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unscheduled visits
Data collected at unscheduled visits (with the exceptio n of data col lected at unscheduled visits
see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will not be used in ‘by -visit’ tabulations or graphs , but will be included in 
analyses b ased on all post-baseline values such as last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
imputation, summary  of maximum decrease or increase from extension baseline for vital signs 
data and maximum letter loss in BCVA from extension baseline (exBL) at any  visit .
All data collected at unscheduled visits will b e included in listings.
[IP_ADDRESS] Missing and implausible dates
The general approach to handling missing dates is shown in Section 5.[ADDRESS_726624] one injection of study  treatment in this extension study .
The Extension Safety  Set will be used for the descriptive analyses and listings related to both 
efficacy  and safet y for the broluciz umab treatment group and for the listings for the aflibercept 
treatment group.
Patients will be reported under the treatment they were randomized to in the core study
(brolucizumab, aflibercept) .Note: In the core study , patients in the safety  set are analyzed 
according to the treatment group from which they received the majorit y of treatments up to and 
[COMPANY_001] For business use only Page 8

Descriptive statistics for change from exBL in BCVA to each post- exBL study  visit and 
coWeek [ADDRESS_726630] (LOCF) rules to be used to 
impute censored or missing BCVA values .  
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details of the sensitivity  analyses which will be performed for the above 
BCVA endpoints .
Using the core study  data, descriptive statistics for change from coBL in BCVA (LOCF) to each 
post-baseline study  visit for patients included in the Extension Safety  Set will be summarized 
by[CONTACT_552725] (brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg)and pooled . This will 
be repeated for BCVA without imputation with LOCF (with censoring) of BCVA data after 
start of alternative anti- VEGF treatment in the study  eye.
Means and standard errors (SE) for change in BCVA (LOCF) for the study  eye will be presented 
graphicall y by [CONTACT_552732] 96 week core study  treatment period and the 24 week extension 
study  treatment period.  Core study  data will be plotted together with extension study  data by 
[CONTACT_552733] y treatment group. 
Using thecore study  data, summary  statistics will be display ed forthe avera ge change in BCVA
from core Week 68(coWeek 68) to Week 84 through Week 96in the core study ,the average 
change in BCVA from exBLto Week 12 through Week 24in the extension study and for the 
difference (with 95% confidence interval) . In addition, average change in BCVA from coWeek 
68to coWeek 84 through coWeek 96 vs the average change in BCVA from exBLto exWeek 
12 through exWeek 24 will be display ed using a shift table with categories: ≤ -15, >-15 to <-
10, ≥-10 to <10, ≥10 to <15, ≥ 15 letters. The analy siswill be conducted 1) with censoring of 
BCVA assessments after start of alternative anti -VEGF treatment in the study  eye and censored 
or missing BCVA values imputed with LOC F and2) with censoring of BCVA assessments 
after start of alternative anti-VEGF treatment in the study  eye butwithout imputation with 
LOCF of missing or censored values.
q12 treatment status at exWeek 2 4
The proportion of patients with a positive q12 treatment status at Week 24will be presented. 
Patients without an identified q8 need (according to the investigator ’s disease activity 
assessment (DAA) ) at exWeek [ADDRESS_726631] a positive q12 status 
at ex Week 24.
The estimate for the proportion of patients with a positive q12 treatment status at Week 24will 
be derived from Kaplan Meier time-to-event analy ses for the event ‘first q8-need’ applying a 
‘q8-need’ allocation in case of missing or confounded data attributable to lack of efficacy  and/or 
lack of safet y and censoring as described below.
[COMPANY_001] For business use only Page 14
SAP Amendment CRTH258A2301E1
The proportion of patients with a positive q12 treatment status will be derived as follows 
requiring ‘duration of effect ’(as assessed by q8 need) together with ‘sufficient efficacy  and 
safet y’:
For the ‘duration of effect’ requirement patients will need to have the status of ‘q8 need = 
no’ at exWeek 16 and exWeek 20 unless the ‘q8 need = yes’ is confounded by [CONTACT_552734]/or safet y (see censoring details below).
The requirement regarding ‘sufficient efficacy and safet y’ will be a ddressed by  [CONTACT_485423] – even without an explicit ‘q8 need = yes’ –as having a negative q12 status in case 
any of the following confounding factors is attributable to lack of efficacy a nd/or lack of 
safet y of the study  treatment (assessed based on a masked medical review , see Section 5.3
for further details): early  treatment/study  discontinuation, use of forbidden concomitant 
medications/procedures and/or other deviation from treatment schedule (e.g. due to a missed 
visit/treatment).  The corresponding q8 need will be allocated to the next DAA visit
(according to the protocol )following the occurrence of such a confounding factor.
In case the missing or confounded data regarding the q12 treatment status are attributable 
to reasons other than lack of efficacy  and/or safety , the patient is censored within the q12 
treatment status according to the following specifications:
Early treatment/stud y discontinuation: Censoring at the last valid DAA.
Single missed visit with a relevant DAA: Censoring at the last valid DAA prior to 
the missed visit.
Prohibited concomitant medications/procedures: Censoring at the last valid DAA
prior to the corresponding application.
Discrepancy  between DAA by [CONTACT_552735]: 
Censoring at the visit of the discrepancy  (assuming the DAA is valid) .
Other treatment allocations/applications deviating from the concept of ‘disease 
activity ’. Censoring at the last valid DAA at or prior to the deviation.
Remark: Patients without any relevant va lid DAA are considered censored at extension baseline.
The proportion of patients with a positive q12 treatment status at exWeek 24 will be display ed 
by q12 treatment status at coWeek 96 and by[CONTACT_552736] g roup (brolucizumab 6 mg, 
brolucizumab 3 mg).
Central Subfield Thickness
The change in CSFT from exBL to each post-exBL study  visit will be summarized descriptivel y 
for the study  eye.CSFT assessments after start of alternative anti -VEG F treatment in the study 
eye will becensored and imputed by [CONTACT_552737].
See Section 2.5.3 for further details regarding the LOCF rules tobe used to imput e missing 
CSFT values .
CSFT data for the stud y eye and fellow ey e will be listed for both treatment groups.
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details of the sensitivity  analy sis which will be performed for CSFT.

SAP Amendment CRTH258A2301E1
Using the core study  data, change in CSFT (LOCF) for the study  eye for patients included in 
the Extension Safety  Set will be summarized by [CONTACT_552738] 
(brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg) and pooled . This will be repeated for CSFT without 
imputation with LOCF of CSFT data after start of alternative anti -VEGF treatment in the study 
eye.
Means and SEs for change in CSFT (LOCF) for the study  eye will be presented graphically  by 
[CONTACT_552732] 96 week core study  treatment period and the 24 week extension study  
treatment period.  Core study  data will be plotted together with extension study  data by [CONTACT_552739]. 
Using the core stud y data, summary statistics will be displayed for the average change in CSFT
from coWeek 68 to coWeek 84 through coWeek 96, the average change in CSFT from exBLto 
exWeek 12 through exWeek 24 and for the difference (with 95% confidence interval).  In 
addition, average change in CSFT from coWeek 68to coWeek 84 through coWeek 96 in the 
core stud y vs the average change in CSFT from exBL to exWeek 12 through exWeek 24 in the 
extension study  will be display ed using a shift table with categories: ≤ -100, > -100 to < -50, ≥

2.5.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations
For the efficacy  variables, BCVA and CSFT, m issing data will be imputed using LOCF .
Observed values from both scheduled and unscheduled study  visits will be used for the LOC F 
imputation . For patient s with no post -exBL value, no imputation will be performed.
For patients who discontinue treatment but continue in the study, the efficacy  data will be 
censored at the time the patient started alternative anti -VEGF treatment in the study  eye.  Start 
date of an alternative anti-VEGF treatment will be identified using the Concomitant Medication 
eCRF where Standardized Medication Name (SAS variable name = CMDECOD) = 
"RANI BIZUMAB", "AFLIBERCEPT", "BEVACIZUMAB" or "PEGAPTANIB ".  No other 
censoring is applied . Censored or missing data will be imputed by  [CONTACT_552747] -VEGF treatment.
Details regarding handling of missing values and discontinuations including the timing of 
censoring within the time-to-event analysis of the proportion of patients with a positive q12 
treatment status at exWeek 24 are specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

The following sensitivity  analyses, will be conducted, in which, for patients who discontinue 
treatment but continue in the study , with application of alternative anti-VEGF treatment, their 
safet y data are censored at the time the patient starts alternative anti- VEGF treatment.  That is, 
only safety data collected prior to receiving alternative anti-VEGF treatment will be used for 
these analyses(see Section 2.5.3 for further details regarding the identification of start date of 
alternative anti-VEGF treatment) . Using number and percentage of patients the following 
summaries will be presented :
Treatment emergent AEs by  [CONTACT_314724]

5.1 Imputation rules
5.1.1 AE date imputation
[IP_ADDRESS] AE end date imputation
1.If the AE end date month is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the earliest of 
the ( 31DECYYYY, date of death).
2.If the AE end date day  is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the earliest of the 
(last day  of the month, date of death).
3.If AE year is missing or AE is ongoing, the end date will not be imputed.
If the imputed AE end date is less than t he existing AE start date then use AE start date as AE 
end date.
[IP_ADDRESS] AE start date imputation
The following table explains the notation used in the logic matrix. Please note that completely  
missing start dates will not be imputed.
Day Month Year
Partial Adverse Event Start Date Not used MON YYYY
Treatment Start Date Not used TRTM TRTY
The following matrix explains the logic behind the imputation.
MON MISSING MON < TRTM MON = TRTM MON > TRTM

Before imputing AE start date, find the AE start reference date.
1. If the (imputed) AE end date is complete and the (imputed) AE end date < treatment
start date then AE start reference date = min (informed consent date, earliest visit date).
2. Else AE start reference date = treatment start date
Impute AE start date -
1. If the AE start date year value is missing, the date uncertain ty is too high to impute a

rational date. Therefore, if the AE year value is missing, the imputed AE start date is set
to NULL.
2. If the AE start date year value is less than the treatment start date year value, the AE
started before treatment. Therefore:
a. If AE month is missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the mid -year point
(01JulYYYY).
b. Else if AE month is not missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the mid -month
point (15MONYYYY).
3. If the AE start date year value is greater than the treatment start date y ear value, the AE
started after treatment. Therefore:
a. If the AE month is missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the y ear start point
(01JanYYYY).
b. Else if the AE month is not missing, the imput ed AE start date is set to the later of
(month start point (01MONYYYY), AE start reference date + 1 day ).
4. If the AE start date year value is equal to the treatment start date year value:
a. And the AE month is missing the imputed AE start date is set t o the AE reference
start date + 1 day .
b. Else if the AE month is less than the treatment start month, the imputed AE start
date is set to the mid -month point (15MONYYYY).
c. Else if the AE month is equal to the treatment start date month or greater than t he
treatment start date month, the imputed AE start date is set to the later of (month
start point (01MONYYYY), AE start reference date + 1 day ).
If complete (imputed) AE end date is available and the imputed AE start date is greater than the 
(imputed) AE end date, then imputed AE start date should be set to the (imputed) AE end date.
5.1.2 Concomitant medication date imputation
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant medication (CM) end date imputation
1. If the CM end date year value is missing, the date uncertainty  is too high to impute a
rational date. Therefore, if the CM end year value is missing or ongoing, the imputed CM
end date is set to NULL.
2. Else, if the CM end date month is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the
earliest of the (treatment end date, 31DECYYYY, dat e of death).
3. If the CM end date day  is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the earliest of the
(treatment end date, last day  of the month, date of death).
[COMPANY_001] For business use only Page 23
SAP Amendment CRTH258A2301E1
If the imputed CM end date is less than the existing CM start date, use the CM start d ate as the
imputed CM end date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant medication start date
In order to classify  a medication as prior and prior/concomitant, it may  be necessary to impute 
the start date.
Completely  missing start dates will be set to one day prior to treatment start date. As a 
conservative approach, such treatments will be classified as prior and concomitant (and 
summarized for each output).
Concomitant treatments with partial start dates will have the date or dates imputed.
The following table explains the notation used in the logic matrix

1. If the CM start date year value is missing, the imputed CM start date is set to one day  prior
to treatment start date.
2. If the CM start date year value is less than the treatment start date year value, the CM
started before treatment. Therefore:
a. If the CM month is missing, the imputed CM start date is set to the mid- year point
(01JulYYYY).
b. Else if the CM month is not missing, the imputed CM start date is set to the mid -month

5.3 Censoring rules for analy sis of q12 treatment status at exWeek 
24
For the anal ysis of q12 treatment status at exWeek 24, Analysis Restrictions (ARs)will address 
the limitations in the patient’s evaluability  resulting from missing or confounded data with an 
underly ing background not qualify ing as a PD, i.e. early study  terminations, early treatment 
discontinuations, missedvisits /treatments /assessments.
The consequence of an AR on the evaluability  depends on the underl ying reason, while three 
different categories of reason are considered:
Lack of efficacy  of the study  treatment (= 1)
Lack of safet y/tolerability  of the study  treatment (= 2)
Other (= 0)
The focus of the ARs is the identification of censoring related to the analysis of the q12 
proportion asderived from DAA and described inSection [IP_ADDRESS] . Censoring is only applied 
in case the underl yin g reason for a confounded DAA is assessed as ‘0’.
ARs will be identified at the patient level b y masked team members before DBL .
The following rules apply for handling missed injections/visits during the study (Unmasked 
Clinical Scientific Expert will perform AR/PD review and will present in masked fashion to 
masked clinical team to ensure appropriate PD or AR allocation) :
a.If a patient missed sham injection → not a PD or AR.
b.If a patient missed active treatment due to an AE related to study  drug or study  procedure 
with action taken “drug interrupted ” or “drug withdrawn” → not a PD but an AR.
c.If a patient missed active treatment due to AE not related to study  drug or study  procedure 
(e.g. fall and fractured hip) but which prevented the study  visit from occurring, or had an 
ocular AE determined unrelated to study  treatment / procedure but which prohibited safe 
administration of study  treatment (e.g. blepharitis) → not a PD but an AR.
d.If a patient missed active treatment due to an y other reason → a PD. 
e.Allocation of AR codes for early treatment discontinuations and early study  
discontinuations wi ll be based on a totality  of available patient data.
The following tables specify  for all relevant protocol specifications and study  assessments the 
criteria to be used for establishing whether a protocol deviation or analy is restriction has 
occurred and, if applicable, whether the ARhas an effect on anal ysis (censoring for DAA).

Study Phase Phase 3
Target Population Adult subjects aged 50 to 85, inclusive, with mild to moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_729730] 3 groups by [CONTACT_926].
Number of Subjects 
PlannedApproximately 1150 randomized subjects:
RVT-101: 575 subjects
Placebo:  [ADDRESS_996677] treatment to stable 
donepezil therapy will be evaluated over a 24-week treatment period.
All subjects will remain on stable doses of donepezil for the duration 
of the study.  The randomization ratio will be 1:1 (RVT-101:placebo) 
and will be stratified by [CONTACT_729731] [ADDRESS_996678] approximately 33 weeks:  0 to 28 days
for Screening, a 3-week Single-Blind Run-In Period to evaluate 
baseline status, a 24-week randomized Double-Blind Treatment 
Period, and a 2-week Follow-Up Period (for subjects who do not 
enter the open-label extension study RVT-101-3002).
Criteria for Evaluation Primary efficacy measures: The primary efficacy response will be an 
assessment of change at 24 weeks from baseline in cognition and 
activities of daily living.  Cognition will be measured by [CONTACT_729726]-Cog-11 and activities of daily living will be measured by [CONTACT_729732]-ADL.
Secondary efficacy measures: An additional measure of cognition 
will be the ADAS-Cog-13. Global assessment of change will be 
measured by [CONTACT_729733]+. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and 
psychopathology will be measured by [CONTACT_183245]. Subject dependency 
will be measured by [CONTACT_729734].
Tertiary efficacy measures: Healthcare resource utilization, and quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_729735], and the EQ-5D.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation: Plasma levels of RVT-[ADDRESS_996679] population PK parameters 
will be calculated for RVT-101.
Safety evaluation: Safety will be based on adverse events (AEs),
changes in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIAL(ECGs), suicidality (via the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
[C-SSRS]) and routine clinical laboratory assessments.
Statistical Methods Efficacy:  Treatment comparisons between the RVT-101 and placebo 
groups in ADAS-Cog-11 and ADCS-ADL scores change from 
baseline at Week 24 will be analyzed using a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with restricted maximum likelihood 
estimation.
Additional analyses for the change from baseline at Week 24 
endpoints including ADAS-Cog-13, CIBIC+, NPI, and DS will be
analyzed using the same method as that for the primary endpoints.
The CIBIC+ will also be analyzed using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
Treatment comparisons between the RVT-101 and placebo groups for 
the responder endpoints will be analyzed using logistic regression and 
compared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.
The RUD Lite, and the EQ-5D will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_3148]. Treatment comparisons between RVT-101 and placebo 
will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.
Pharmacokinetic: Plasma concentrations for RVT-101 and donepezil 
will be measured.  RVT-101 PK parameters (area under the 
concentration-time curve at steady state [AUC ], peak concentration 
at steady state [C max-ss], and minimum (trough) concentration at steady 
state [C min-ss]) for each subject will be estimated via a population PK 
model using nonlinear mixed effect analysis.
Safety:  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_10996], 
laboratory analytes, vital signs, physical examination, C-SSRS, and 
ECG parameters.

CONFIDENTIAL3. INTRODUCTION
3.1. Background
3.1.1. Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_729736], progressive impairment of activities of 
daily living, and a variety of behavioral disturbances (Cummings, 2004). An estimated 
5.2 million American’s have AD (Alzheimer’s Association, 2013). In 2010, approximately
503,400 deaths in Americans aged 75 years and older were attributable to AD dementia
(James et al, 2014), and the incidence is increasing as the global population ages 
(Cummings et al, 2014). Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart 
disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16%, 23%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the 
proportion of deaths resulting from AD increased 68% (Alzheimer’s Association, 2013).
The first drug specifically approved for the treatment of AD was tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitor (AChEI).  AChEIs increase levels of acetylcholine (ACh), a key neurotransmitter for 
cognitive processes.  Although approved in many countries, tacrine was not widely used, most 
likely because it is associated with liver toxicity and because of an inconvenient dosing regimen.  
Soon after the approval of tacrine, donepezil, another AChEI, was approved and became the 
most widely used drug to treat AD, likely due to its lack of liver toxicity and once-daily dose 
regimen (Aricept®[donepezil] Package Insert, 2013).  Two other AChEIs were approved 
subsequently, resulting in a total of 4 marketed drugs of this class.  Memantine, the only other 
drug approved for the treatment of AD, is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
and is only approved to treat moderate to severe AD.
Although the approved agents produce a modest improvement in cognition in the short term,
they do not prevent progression of the disease, and patients continue to show decline in cognitive 
performance and inexorable progressive loss of function despi[INVESTIGATOR_729705].
There is a lack of treatment options available for patients once the initial effectiveness of the 
AChEI starts to wane, and there are no treatments currently approved for adjunct therapy to 
AChEIs in subjects with mild to moderate AD. No new chemical entities for AD have been 
approved in more than 10 years.  Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new drugs for the 
treatment of AD.
5-Hydroxytryptamine sub-type 6 (5HT 6) receptors are widely distributed in regions of the brain 
that are associated with cognition. 5HT 6receptor antagonists have a modulatory effect on 
cholinergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, a profile that is clearly distinct from that of the 
AChEIs (Mitchell and Neumaier, 2005). In addition, 5HT 6receptor antagonists have been 
reported to cause increases in the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule 
(PSA-NCAM) in the hippocampal and medial temporal regions of the brain during a learning 
task (Seki and Arai, 1993; Kiss et al, 2001). PSA-NCAM increases have been correlated with 
increases in synaptic plasticity in areas such as the hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and 
hippocampus of the adult nervous system (Seki and Arai, 1993; Kiss et al, 2001).
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996680], 
which is being developed as an oral treatment for subjects with mild to moderate AD.
Pharmacology predicts central nervous system (CNS) effects on ACh for both donepezil and 
RVT-101. However, the mechanisms by [CONTACT_729737]. Donepezil exerts its effect by [CONTACT_729738] (AChE), thus inhibiting 
the hydrolysis of ACh, which results in increased ACh levels. This can be associated with 
systemic cholinergic side effects, principally gastrointestinal in nature, but these events can be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_195348]. RVT-101 causes a release of neurotransmitters primarily localized in 
the CNS through its antagonism at the 5HT 6receptor. The potential increase in ACh following 
the addition of RVT-101 is expected to augment that already achieved with donepezil, and thus 
may result in an adjunctive treatment benefit (Benhamu et al, 2014).
RVT-101 has previously been investigated as monotherapy in subjects with mild to moderate 
AD in 3 multinational Phase 2 studies, Study AZ3100603, Study AZ3106242, and 
Study AZ3110865. Studies AZ100603 and Study AZ3110865 compared the efficacy of 
RVT-101 to placebo or donepezil on the co-primary endpoints of cognition (Alzheimer’s Disease 
Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog]) and global function (Clinician’s
Interview-Based Impression of Change – plus caregiver interview [CIBIC+]) after 24 weeks of 
treatment. Study AZ3100603 demonstrated dose-related effects of RVT-101 on cognition
(ADAS-Cog) with a 1.28-point treatment difference from placebo (p=0.135) at a dose of 35 mg 
and a statistically significant benefit on global function (CIBIC+) (p=0.047). Of note, there was 
no evidence of a placebo decline in this study. Study AZ3110865 did not show a statistically 
significant effect of either donepezil or RVT-101 on ADAS-Cog or CIBIC+.  This study also 
failed to show a decline in the placebo arm.
A third monotherapy study, AZ3106242, was initiated with the aim of investigating whether the 
historical efficacy of donepezil (i.e., approximately 3-point difference from a declining placebo 
group on ADAS-Cog after 24 weeks), could be repeated against non-declining placebo groups,
such as those seen in Studies AZ3100603 and AZ3110865. It has become increasingly common 
in recent trials of potential agents for the treatment of AD to be unable to show the same 3-point 
difference from placebo on ADAS-Cog that was observed in these early studies with AChEIs 
(Panisset, 2002). In addition, the study allowed the effect of RVT-[ADDRESS_996681]. This exploratory study was not 
powered for formal statistical comparison of RVT-101 and donepezil. For ADAS-Cog and 
CIBIC+, neither RVT-[ADDRESS_996682] of both treatments was larger among 
subjects with moderate AD (Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE] less than or equal to 18) than 
among mild subjects, with ADAS-Cog treatment effects of -2.9 (90% confidence interval [CI]: -
5.5, -0.2) and -4.5 (90% CI: -7.1, -1.9) for the RVT-101 and donepezil groups, respectively.
Study AZ3110866 was a 48-week, Phase 2b study that randomized 684 subjects in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_996683] to stable donepezil 
treatment.  The study utilized co-primary cognitive endpoints at Week 24 (ADAS-Cog and 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIALClinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB]). The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative 
Study – Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) was also included as a secondary endpoint to 
assess the activities of daily living.  When compared to placebo, a statistically significant 
difference of 1.5 points in ADAS-Cog was observed for the 35-mg RVT-101 group versus the 
placebo group at Week 24 (p=0.012). Statistically significant benefit versus placebo was also 
demonstrated at Week 12 (-1.3, p=0.006) and at Week 48 (-1.64, p=0.024).  There was a strong 
trend for statistically significant benefit at Week 36 (-1.21, p=0.057) versus placebo.  The change 
from baseline for the CDR-SB for the 35-mg group was numerically superior to placebo at all 
post-baseline visits.  This difference was statistically significant at Week 12. There were no 
statistically significant differences between the 15-mg group and placebo for either co-primary 
endpoint although the 15-mg group was generally numerically superior to placebo. The 
ADSC-ADL also showed a statistically significant effect for 35 mg RVT-101 compared to 
placebo at Weeks 12 (1.72, p=0.019), 24 (2.0, p=0.024), and 36 (1.93, p=0.038), with a 
continued trend at Week 48 (1.94, p=0.088).  Additional secondary endpoints included the
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and MMSE.  
There was no statistically significant effect of RVT-101 on RBANS for either dose over placebo, 
but some degree of separation did appear at later visits for the 35-mg group.  No statistically 
significant difference for either group was seen on the MMSE at Weeks 24 or 48.
Details of all the preclinical and clinical investigations with RVT-101 are contained in the 
current version of the RVT-101 Investigator’s Brochure.
3.2. Study Rationale
The effects of RVT-[ADDRESS_996684] of RVT-101 on both cognition and 
activities of daily living when added to stable donepezil treatment when compared to treatment 
with donepezil alone.  This study will also provide further information on the safety and 
tolerability of the 35-mg dose of RVT-101 when used in combination with donepezil. The 
primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of a 35-mg dose of RVT-101 compared 
with placebo when added to stable treatment with donepezil on the co-primary endpoints of 
cognition as measured by [CONTACT_33341]-Cog 11 item subscale (ADAS-Cog-11; Rosen et al, 1984) and 
activities of daily living as measured by [CONTACT_33340]-ADL (Galasko et al, 1997) after [ADDRESS_996685] been employed in previous AD studies, supporting their 
inclusion as primary endpoints in this study.
3.3. Dose Rationale
A daily dose of 35 mg RVT-101 was selected for use in this study based on the results of the 
AZ3110866 study.  This dose, administered in addition to donepezil, was shown to be well 
tolerated and when added to stable donepezil treatment demonstrated efficacy on measures of 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIALcognition and activities of daily living that were statistically significant when compared to 
placebo treatment.  Additional receptor occupancy and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies further 
support the dose selection.

5.1. Overall Design
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 
patients with mild to moderate AD who are on stable donepezil therapy.  The efficacy and safety 
of RVT-101 at a dose of 35 mg will be evaluated over a 24-week treatment period.
Approximately 1150 subjects will be enrolled.  The randomization ratio will be 1:1 
(RVT-101:placebo) and will be stratified by [CONTACT_729745].  The primary endpoints will 
be measured after [ADDRESS_996689] approximately 33 weeks:  
0 to 4 weeks for Screening, a 3-week Single-Blind Run-In Period to evaluate baseline status, a 
24-week randomized Double-Blind Treatment Period, and a 2-week Follow-Up Period (for 
subjects who do not enter the open-label extension study RVT-101-3002).

6.5. Screening Failures
Screen Failures are defined as subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) for 
RVT-101-3001 but are never subsequently randomized and who do not enter the Single-Blind 
Run-In Phase. A minimal set of screen failure information is required including demography,
screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events (SAEs).
Subjects who are Screen Failures may be rescreened once only after approval by [CONTACT_729746].
6.6. Withdrawal Criteria
6.6.1. Reasons for Withdrawal
A withdrawal from the study is defined as withdrawing any time after entering the Single-Blind 
Run-In Phase and before completion of the Week 24 Visit (Visit 8).  Subjects who permanently 
discontinue use of investigational product will be considered to be withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.  The investigator (or 
designee) must document the reason for withdrawal in the appropriate section of the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). Information related to AEs will continue to be collected as per usual 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996704] withdrawal will be recorded and may include, but are 
not limited to:
Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
subject in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_729709] (discontinuation of treatment, but will be followed until the 
outcome of pregnancy is known)
Significant protocol violation
Subject requests to discontinue for any reason; it is important to determine whether the 
withdrawal of consent is primarily due to an AE, lack of efficacy, or other reason
The above reasons do not automatically lead to withdrawal from the study in all cases. The final 
decision will be based on consultation between the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_729710], with the ultimate decision by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_729711]. Subjects may 
discontinue from treatment with study investigational product but may agree to continue to be 
followed for additional safety evaluation.
If a subject meets discontinuation criteria during treatment, an Early Termination Visit will be 
required (Section 6.6.2 ).
6.6.2. Subject Withdrawal Procedures
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from treatment with the investigational product, the 
investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations scheduled for the Early 
Termination Visit ( Table 2 ).  In the case where the subject permanently discontinues study 
medication between scheduled clinic visits, he/she should be recalled to the clinic as soon as 
possible and preferably within [ADDRESS_996705] to follow-up: If a subject is lost to follow-up, every effort must be made by [CONTACT_729747], inquire about the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal, and 
follow up with any unresolved AEs/SAEs.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_996706] for the Single-Blind Run-In Period (Weeks -3 to 0) will be supplied as 
single individual bottles, each bottle containing [ADDRESS_996707] for the Double-Blind Treatment Period 
(Weeks 0 to 24) will be supplied at Visits 3, 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_996708] 4 months and on a stable 
dose of 5 or 10 mg/day for at least [ADDRESS_996709] and caregiver should be obtained at Visit 4 (Week 3) and re-confirmed 
thereafter as needed. Subjects will need to re-start their clinical supply of donepezil (clinically

CONFIDENTIAL7.2. Randomization/Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be assigned to receive RVT-[ADDRESS_996712] therapy to existing stable 
donepezil therapy in accordance with the randomization schedule, prior to the start of the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period, using validated software.
Following confirmation of eligibility at Visit 3 (end of Single-Blind Run-In Period), subjects will 
be randomized to placebo or RVT-101 in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified according 
to subjects’ baseline MMSE scores, so as not to exceed the limits described in Section 10.2.
7.3. Blinding
This will be a double-blind study. The study will include a 3-week Single-Blind Run-In Period 
during which investigators will know that the subject is taking placebo but the subject and 
caregiver will not.  This will be followed by a 24-week Double-Blind Treatment Period when 
neither subjects nor their caregivers nor investigators will know which of the [ADDRESS_996713] is receiving.  Subjects will be informed that they will receive placebo at some point 
during the study but they will not know when this will be.  Subjects will not be informed of 
transition from the Single-Blind Run-In Period to the Double-Blind Treatment Period. RVT-101
and placebo will be provided as tablets that are indistinguishable in appearance, smell, and taste.  
Donepezil will be supplied at the start of the Run-In Period and will be clearly marked 
throughout the study in an unblinded fashion.
The following will apply:
The investigator or treating physician may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment. Such a 
measure should be taken only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious 
medical condition when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the 
appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject as judged by [CONTACT_093].
In the event that a medical emergency or condition requires knowledge of the subject’s 
treatment assignment, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_729748].  Unblinding will be done through the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS).  The procedure of 
unblinding for a specific subject is provided in the Study Reference Manual.
If, for safety reasons, the investigator determines that the subject’s treatment must be 
immediately unblinded to provide adequate medical treatment, the investigator must inform 
the Medical Monitor about the unblinding as soon as possible, but without revealing the 
treatment assignment of the unblinded subject. 
The sponsor will be informed without delay of the decision to unblind any subject and will 
determine whether any additional measures need to be taken for the safety of subjects 
currently in the study.
Any other requests to reveal a subject’s treatment identity must be requested of, and 
approved by, Axovant Sciences.

is required to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations, such as expedited SAE reporting.
7.4. Packaging and Labeling
RVT-101 35-mg tablets and matching placebo tablets will be packaged in high-density 
polyethylene bottles.  Labels for RVT-101 and placebo bottles will meet all applicable 
requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Annex 13 of Good

CONFIDENTIAL7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
No special preparation of investigational product is required. Investigational product will be 
stored at up to 30°C and protected from light.
Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive investigational product and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer investigational product.  All investigational product must 
be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or automated) area 
in accordance with the labelled storage conditions, with access limited to the investigator 
and authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for investigational product accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
Site staff will record the subject number on the packaging label for both investigational 
product and study-supplied donepezil for each bottle dispensed. 
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused investigational product are 
provided in the Study Reference Manual.
Under normal conditions of handling and administration, investigational product is not 
expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff.  In the case of unintentional 
occupational exposure, notify the study monitor, Medical Monitor, and/or the Axovant
Sciences study contact.
A Material Safety Data Sheet/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and 
recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is 
required by [CONTACT_1207], or is available upon request from Axovant Sciences.
7.6. Compliance with Investigational Product and Study-Supplied 
Donepezil Administration
When subjects are dosed at the site, they will receive investigational product directly from the 
investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.  The dose of investigational 
product and study subject identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of 
the study site staff other than the person administering the investigational product.
Every effort should be made to encourage subject compliance with the dosage regimen as per 
protocol for both investigational product and continued treatment with study-supplied donepezil.
The investigator is responsible for discussing methods to ensure high treatment compliance with 
subjects and caregivers before randomization.  All subjects and their caregivers should be 
instructed to return medication bottles with any unused drug at each visit to the investigator. A
record of the supplies dispensed, taken, and returned at each visit will be made in the eCRF. The 
investigator or designee is responsible for reconciling the number of tablets returned with the 
expected number of tablets to be taken by a study subject and accounting for any discrepancies.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996718] administration should be avoided wherever possible, 
short-term interruptions (less than or equal to 7 days) due to forgetfulness; caregiver illness or 
absence; a pause in investigational product administration required during an intervention, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or while a subject considers the study continuation; or for any other reason are 
not grounds for automatic withdrawal but should be assessed by [CONTACT_093].
Other major protocol violations as well as use of prohibited drugs (see Section 7.9.2 ) may be 
cause for discontinuation of investigational product or withdrawal from the study.
7.7. Treatment of Investigational Product Overdose
Any dose of RVT-[ADDRESS_996719]’s clinical status.
In the event of an overdose the investigator or treating physician should:
Contact [CONTACT_27465],
Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities and ensure 
appropriate clinical management. Overdose in the absence of other AEs will not be reported 
as an AE in its own right.
Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within [ADDRESS_996720], if requested by [CONTACT_1689] (determined on a case-by-case basis), and
Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the time of administration of the 
overdose in the eCRF.
It is not necessarily required that the investigator unblind a subject who has taken an overdose.  
As noted in Section 7.3, unblinding should only be done in the case of an emergency OR in the 
event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the investigational product is essential 
for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged by [CONTACT_093].
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by [CONTACT_729749].
7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post-study 
care of the subject’s medical condition.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996721] may be considered for enrollment in the open-label 
extension study RVT-101-3002. Only subjects who do not enroll in the extension study will 
complete the Follow-up Visit (Visit 9).

8.1. Time and Events
The Time and Events Schedule ( Table 2 ) displays each study assessment and procedure along 
with the time of occurrence.  All study assessments should be conducted by [CONTACT_093], 
and/or a suitably qualified designee approved and documented for this study. All raters will be 
trained and certified to perform the specific rating scales in this study.
For Visit 2 there is a visit window of + 5 days.  In the event the Single-Blind Run-In period is 
extended to repeat the MMSE, the new Visit 2 window will be + 3 days.  For Visits 4 and 5 there 
is a visit window of ± 3 days; for all other post-randomization visits, there is a visit window of 
± [ADDRESS_996728] dose of IP. If the visit window is used, 
the subsequent visit should remain according to the planned visit schedule (i.e., the subsequent 
visit date should not be re-calculated from the date of the previous visit but should remain 
relative to baseline).
Information will be recorded in the source documents and, where appropriate, the eCRF.
Every effort should be made to administer the ADAS-Cog within ±[ADDRESS_996729] rating scale given to caregivers
when possible at each visit.
If medical assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, then the assessments should be 
given after the cognitive testing and occur in the following order whenever possible:
12-lead ECG
Vital signs
Blood draws
Screening Period (up to 28 days before Visit 2): Subjects will be screened for eligibility 
during the Screening Period. Subjects who do not qualify for the study during this period will be 
considered Screen Failures. An ICF will be signed by [CONTACT_6992], if he or she is able, or by [CONTACT_729750].  An ICF will also be signed by [CONTACT_729751]-specific procedures are performed.  Subjects will be screened according to study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  This Screening Period may be extended for up to an additional 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 v3.0
CONFIDENTIAL14 days if needed to complete assessment activities after approval by [CONTACT_40862].
Subjects who are Screen Failures during the Screening Period may be rescreened after discussion 
with the Medical Monitor. Note: Subjects who are Screen Failures may be rescreened only 
once.
Single-Blind Run-In Period (21 + 5 days before Visit 3): At Visit 2, subjects who meet all 
study screening criteria will enter a Single-Blind Run-In Period.  Investigational product will be 
dispensed.  Subjects will be instructed to take the investigational product once daily in the 
morning.  Subjects will be instructed to take the first Single-Blind Run-In investigational product
(single-blind placebo) during the study visit.  Study-supplied donepezil matching the subject’s 
stable clinical dose will also be dispensed.  Subjects and caregivers should be instructed that 
subjects are to take study-supplied donepezil throughout the course of the study and to 
discontinue any clinically dispensed donepezil prescribed by [CONTACT_1766]’ personal physician.  
Visit 2 assessments will be performed according to Table 2 below.  To qualify for randomization 
at Baseline (Visit 3) subjects must return unused study medication, be considered capable of 
completing study assessments, remain within study-specified criteria for MMSE, and meet all 
other eligibility requirements.
The Single-Blind Run-In Period may be extended for [ADDRESS_996730]’s baseline if randomization criteria are met.  No new investigational product or 
study-supplied donepezil will be dispensed for the additional run-in period; subjects should be 
instructed to continue taking blinded investigational product and study-supplied donepezil 
dispensed at Visit 2.
The ADAS-Cog assessment should be the first assessment performed, followed by [CONTACT_729752].  
If the MMSE score does not meet the stability criterion for randomization, no other assessments 
should be performed.  If after discussion with the Medical Monitor it is determined that the 
Single-Blind Run-In Period may be extended by [ADDRESS_996731] 
should be scheduled to return to the clinic in 3 weeks’ time (+ 3 days), and all baseline 
assessments should be performed at this repeat visit.
Baseline (Visit 3) and Double-blind Treatment (Visit 4 through Visit 8): At Visit 3(Baseline), prior to ingestion of double-blind investigational product, Baseline assessments will 
be performed to determine subject eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to [ADDRESS_996732] in 
the clinic in the presence of study center personnel; this may cause dosing to not occur in the 
morning on this visit according to the timing of the subject’s visit schedule.  All additional doses 
will be ingested as outpatients, except for the Visit [ADDRESS_996733] each morning, and to take study-provided donepezil in accordance with
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 v3.0
CONFIDENTIALtheir previously prescribed treatment regimen. Discontinuation of donepezil prescribed by 
[CONTACT_1766]’ personal physician should be confirmed at Visit 3 (Baseline + 5 days). As needed, 
subjects should be reminded to maintain discontinuation of clinically prescribed donepezil while 
taking study-supplied donepezil. Note: no investigational product or study-supplied donepezil 
will be dispensed at Visit 4 (Week 3); subjects will be redispensed the medication that they 
received at Visit [ADDRESS_996734] and study-supplied donepezil should be assessed at Visit 4, and study 
bottles returned to subjects to continue until Visit 5 (Day 42 ± 3 days) when the next bottles will 
be dispensed.
Throughout the Baseline and Double-Blind Treatment Periods, all clinic visits will be scheduled 
according to specified visit windows, and all specified assessments will be completed (Table 2).
The administration of the ADAS-Cog should be kept within a ± 1-hour window of the time of 
day of the Baseline assessment for each subject to diminish the potential impact of circadian 
fluctuations in cognition.  This should be taken into consideration when scheduling and 
performing baseline ADAS-Cog assessments.
The order of assessments should remain consistent during the Double-Blind Treatment Period,
and when possible, the ADAS-Cog should be given to the subject first, followed by [CONTACT_729753].  If possible, other assessments, including ECG, vital signs, and blood 
draws, should be performed after cognitive testing and other endpoint scales. When possible 
ADCS-ADL should be given as the first assessment to the caregiver followed by [CONTACT_729754].
Although caregiver and subject visits are recommended to be on the same day, this is not 
required so long as they are each kept within the specified visit window. However, every effort 
should be made to have the same caregiver throughout the study.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue double-blind investigational product should be 
encouraged to return to the clinic for an Early Termination Visit, and the early termination 
procedures should be performed as indicated in the time and events schedule.
Safety Follow-Up: All subjects who complete the Double-Blind Treatment Period and do not enter the open-label extension study RVT-101-3002 will be required to attend a Safety Follow-

8.3. Study Assessments and Procedures
8.3.1. Efficacy Assessments
All study assessments should be conducted by [CONTACT_093], and/or a suitably qualified 
designee, all of whom will be trained and certified to administer these measures for this study.
Every effort should be made for the same person to conduct specific assessments on each 
individual subject at each study visit. Assessments will be monitored for quality. Screening 
assessments along with accompanying data will be reviewed to insure that subjects meet the 
inclusion criteria.  Other assessments will be monitored by [CONTACT_729755]. Additional 
information regarding the method of quality monitoring of efficacy assessments is provided in 
the Study Reference Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
The MMSE (Folstein et al, 1975) consists of 11 tests of orientation, memory (recent and 
immediate), concentration, language, and praxis.  Scores range from [ADDRESS_996744] and takes 
approximately 5 to 10 minutes to administer.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)
The 11-item and 13-item ADAS-Cog (Rosen et al, 1984; Mohs et al, 1997) assesses a range of 
cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place, and 
spontaneous speech.  Most items are evaluated by [CONTACT_729756], but some are dependent on clinician 
ratings on a 5-point scale.  The ADAS-Cog-11 total score range is from 0 to 70, with a higher 
score indicating more severe cognitive impairment.  The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11
with 2 additional items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation.  Scores for the ADAS-

[IP_ADDRESS]. Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living
(ADCS-ADL)
The ADCS-ADL scale (Galasko et al, 1997) measures functional impairment in terms of 
activities of daily living. The ADCS-ADL is an interviewer-administered, informant-based scale 
where the informant (caregiver) responds to [ADDRESS_996747].  The questions range from basic to instrumental activities of daily living and take 
approximately 20 minutes to complete.  The score ranges from 0 to 78; the lower the score, the 
greater the impairment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Interview
(CIBIC+)
The CIBIC+ assessment (Schneider et al, 1997) measures the global functioning of the subject 
through structured interviews by [CONTACT_729757].  The CIBIS 
(Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Severity) will be administered at Baseline and the 
CIBIC+ will be administered at subsequent study visits.  The change from baseline is recorded 
on a 7-point scale with a score of 4 indicating no change, scores above 4 indicating worsening, 
and scores below 4 indicating improvement. This scale will be administered by a rater 
independent of the ADAS-Cog, who will be trained and certified for this study.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)
The NPI (Cummings et al, 1994) is a behavior rating scale composed of a 12-item structured 
interview of the caregiver that is scored from 0 to 144 (the higher the score, the greater the 
psychiatric disturbance).  It assesses 12 behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: 
delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, 
disinhibition, aberrant motor activity, night-time behavior disturbances, and eating disturbances.
Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Resource Utilization in Dementia Lite (RUD Lite)

CONFIDENTIAL8.3.1.7. Dependence Scale
The DSmeasures the amount of assistance patients with dementia require in performing daily 
activities (Brickman et al, 2002).  The caregiver answers questions about the dependency of the 
subject.  The scale consists of 13 items, representing a range of severity from mild to severe
levels of dependency. The score range is from 0 to 15 with higher scores indicating greater 
dependency.
[IP_ADDRESS]. EuroQol-5D
The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status that provides a measure of health-related 
quality of life that is widely used in clinical trials (Rabin and deCharro, 2001).  For this study the 
EQ-5D will be a caregiver proxy assessment.  The assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_729758]’s impressions of how the subject would rate his/her own quality of 
life.  The EQ-5D questionnaire consists of 2 components: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the 
EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).  The EQ-5D descriptive system includes 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  The EQ-VAS 
records overall health status on a 20-cm vertical line with a score of 0 (worst health one can 
imagine) to 100 (best health one can imagine).
8.3.2. Safety and Screening Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that 
meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  Therefore an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding or vital sign measurement), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, without any judgment about causality.
AEs are recorded from the time that informed consent is signed, including those that occur 
during the Single-Blind Run-in Period.  Treatment emergent adverse events are defined as those 
that occur on or after the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include :
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996749] or a concomitant medication.
Clinically significant abnormal findings (laboratory test results, vital signs, physical 
examination findings, ECGs, radiologic exams, or other studies) should be recorded as AEs.
A “clinically significant” finding is one that affects clinical management, including
additional visits, monitoring or referrals, diagnostic tests, or alteration of treatment, or that is 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  A clinically significant finding may be 
a change in a test that has previously been abnormal but now requires additional action.
When a medical or surgical procedure is performed, the condition that leads to the procedure 
should be recorded as the AE.
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations or expected progression of pre-existing disease(s) or 
condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study unless judged by [CONTACT_729759]’s underlying condition.
Abnormal laboratory, ECG, or vital sign measurements that are not labelled clinically 
significant (see definition above).
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Overdose in the absence of other AEs will not be reported as an AE in its own right.
Changes in C-SSRS during the course of the study indicating worsening should be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_35955], and if clinically significant (e.g., alteration in 
medical care or intervention is required), an associated AE should be recorded, if present.  
The AE should be the primary underlying clinical manifestation assessed as clinically 
significant, and not the change in score itself.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either investigator or sponsor, it results in any of 
the following outcomes:
Death,
A life-threatening AE,
An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does 
not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
The determination of whether an AE is life-threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_661075].  Thus, if either believes that it meets the definition of 
life-threatening, it must be considered life-threatening for reporting purposes.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996750] 
normal life functions, or
A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
This definition of an SAE permits either the sponsor or the investigator to decide if an event is 
serious.  Because SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety 
problems, FDA believes taking into account both the investigator’s and the sponsor’s assessment 
is important.  For example, the investigator’s perspective may be informed by [CONTACT_729760], and the sponsor is likely to have broader knowledge of the drug and its 
effects to inform its evaluation of the significance of the event.  If either the sponsor or 
investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated 
by [CONTACT_729761].
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information
Collection of AEs and SAEs will begin at the time a subject signs informed consent and 
continues until the follow-up contact. SAEs that are spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_729762]-up visit and 
up to [ADDRESS_996751] has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the 
investigational product or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor 
or sponsor representative.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIAL8.[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Adverse Events
The severity of each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], or designee approved and 
documented for this study, as mild, moderate, or severe based on the below definitions:
Mild: Event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living
Moderate: Event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Severe: Event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Note that severity is not the same as “seriousness,” which is defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
Outcome will be assessed using the following categories: recovered/resolved, not recovered/not 
resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, or unknown.
Instructions for assessing causality are provided in the Study Reference Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.  
Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?”
“Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”
“Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last 
visit/contact?”
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts.  All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the 
condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to 
follow-up.
[IP_ADDRESS].7. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All new SAEs must be reported in English to the study sponsor or sponsor’s representatives 
within [ADDRESS_996752] be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996753]’s date of birth, subject identification number, 
period of investigational product intake, event term, nature of the event, the seriousness criteria,
and the investigator’s attribution regarding relatedness to investigational product.  In addition, 
the initial SAE report should include all pertinent known information about the SAE and the 
affected subject. In addition, the investigator should provide a narrative to describe the course of 
events including any treatments or relevant procedures.  Follow-up information, which may 
include copi[INVESTIGATOR_729718].  Follow-up SAE reports 
may describe the evolution of the reported event and any new assessment of outcome and/or 
relationship to investigational product.  Full supporting documentation should be solicited by [CONTACT_729763].  Such documentation may 
include copi[INVESTIGATOR_729719]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], pathology, or autopsy reports.
Additional instructions regarding SAE reporting are provided in the Study Reference Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS].8. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_729764]-serious AEs occurring during a clinical trial is essential so that legal obligations and ethical 
responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation are met.
Axovant Sciences has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Axovant Sciences
will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and 
investigators.
Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (those 
not listed in the Investigator Brochure) according to local regulatory requirements and Axovant
Sciences policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE(s) or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from Axovant Sciences will file it with the 
Investigator Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Monitoring Committee
An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established by [CONTACT_729765]-101-[ADDRESS_996754] of the study.  The content and format of the safety 
data provided will be in agreement with requests by [CONTACT_729766].  However, the SMC will be provided unblinded treatment codes for these 
studies if a significant safety concern is identified.  Ad hoc SMC meetings may be held as 
necessary.
After reviewing the interim safety data from RVT-101-3001, the SMC may make a 
recommendation to Axovant Sciences to continue the study with or without modification or to 
terminate the study. All SMC meetings will be properly documented in a SMC report to the 
sponsor.
SMC membership and responsibilities will be further outlined in the SMC Charter, which will be 
maintained separately from the protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations will be performed as indicated in Table 2. A complete physical 
examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Neurological examinations will include assessment 
of gait, balance, coordination, cranial nerves and motor and sensory systems.  A brief,
symptoms-directed physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the lungs, 
cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Physical examinations at Screening and 
Visit 8 will be full examinations; at all other study visits, an abbreviated physical examination is 
required.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured after the subject has been in the seated position for 5 minutes and 
will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].
Postural changes will be measured within 3 minutes of appropriate body position change.  Body 
weight will also be recorded at each visit and height will be recorded at Screening.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Single 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at each time point during the study using an ECG machine 
that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals with 
the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. The investigator or designated qualified physician at the site 
will evaluate the Screening ECG for any abnormalities that should exclude the subject from the 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIALstudy or require acute additional evaluation or intervention.  They should also evaluate the ECG 
printouts for all subsequent visits for any new abnormalities. Any abnormality should include a 
determination of clinical significance. A clinically significant ECG finding is one that requires 
additional medical evaluation or treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table [ADDRESS_996755] be conducted in 
accordance with the Study Reference Manual and Protocol Time and Events Schedule ( Table 2 ).
Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples must be clearly labelled with the 
subject number, protocol number, site/center number, and visit date. Details for the preparation 
and shipment of samples will be provided by [CONTACT_729767]. Reference ranges for all safety parameters will be provided to the site by [CONTACT_729768].
Abnormal laboratory tests that are clinically significant should also be recorded as AEs on the 
eCRF. Clinically significant means that the confirmed abnormal test result has an impact on
patient management, including additional monitoring or diagnostic tests, or changes in treatment.
The same standard applies to additional non-protocol specified laboratory assessments that are 
performed at the institution’s local laboratory and result in a change in subject management (i.e.,
monitoring, diagnostic tests, or any alteration in treatment).
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for appropriate processing and handling of samples to 
avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws.

participation in the study or at the follow-up visit should be repeated until the values return to 
normal or baseline or until the value stabilizes.  If such values do not return to normal within a 
period judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the Medical 
Monitor notified.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Suicidality
Subjects will be assessed for suicidality before and during the study using the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).  Subjects considered to be at significant risk will be excluded 
from the study.  The C-SSRS is a brief measure which is designed to assess severity and change 
of suicidality by [CONTACT_729769].  It assesses intensity of ideation (a 
potentially important marker of severity), specifically asking about frequency, duration, 
controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the ideation which was most severe during the 
respectively assessed timeframe.  Suicidal behavior is also assessed by [CONTACT_729770], interrupted, or aborted attempts; as well as preparatory 
and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. The C-SSRS will be completed by a rater trained and 
certified to administer this scale.  Any change in C-SSRS score indicating the presence of 
suicidality should be evaluated by [CONTACT_729771] (Section 6.3) and appropriate clinical actions (including but not 
limited to a referral to a mental health professional).
Clinically meaningful suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior and completed suicide should be 
recorded as AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of dosing and until 
[ADDRESS_996758] be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and 
status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after 
the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_729772]’s representative.
The investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male 
study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study.  Pregnancy 
information must be reported to the sponsor or the sponsor’s representative as described above. 
The partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor or the sponsor’s representative.
Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. 
Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.

CONFIDENTIAL8.3.3. Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for PK analysis of RVT-101 and donepezil will be collected in a subset of 
patients at selected sites during the study visits indicated in Section 8.1.  The actual date and time 
of each blood sample collection will be recorded, as well as the date and time of the previous 
dose of double-blind IP and/or donepezil administration. The timing of PK samples may be 
altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK 
monitoring.
Five PK samples per subject will be taken for the purpose of assessing plasma concentrations of 
RVT-101 and donepezil at the following specific time points:
At Baseline (Visit 3), the PK blood sample should be taken after cognitive testing, ECG, 
and vital signs measurements have been performed, and the date and time of the previous
dose of donepezil will be recorded.  The actual date and time of sample collection will be 
recorded.At Visit 5 (Week 6), the PK blood sample should be taken after cognitive testing, ECG, 
and vital signs measurements have been performed, and the time of the last dose of 
double-blind IP will be recorded.  The actual date and time of sample collection will be 
recorded.
At Visit 6 (Week 12) subjects will be instructed not to take their dose of double-blind IP
in the morning but wait until in the clinic, after 1 PK sample is collected (before dosing,
but after cognitive testing, ECG, and vital signs measurements have been performed). 
Donepezil can be taken on the regular schedule. The date and time of the previous 
double-blind IP and donepezil doses will be recorded along with the actual date and time 
of the pre-dose sample collection at Visit 6.
At Visit 7 (Week 18), the PK blood sample should be taken after cognitive testing, ECG,
and vital signs measurements have been performed, and the time of the last dose of 
double-blind IP will be recorded.  The actual date and time of sample collection will be 
recorded.
At Visit 8 (Week 24), [ADDRESS_996759] been performed. The date and time of the previous 
donepezil and double-blind IP doses will be recorded along with the actual date and time 
of sample collection.
Unscheduled PK samples may be requested by [CONTACT_729773] (e.g., in cases of suspected drug reactions).
The samples will be centrifuged and the resulting plasma stored.  Further details with regard to 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], collection, and processing of samples are provided in the Study Reference Manual.
Plasma analysis will be performed under the control of Axovant Sciences, the details of which

Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-[ADDRESS_996761] null hypothesis is that there is no difference between RVT-101 and placebo, when 
added to stable donepezil, in the change from baseline in total ADAS-Cog-11 score at Week 24
in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population. The first alternative hypothesis is that there is a 
difference between RVT-[ADDRESS_996762] will be performed at the 5% level of significance. All 
hypothesis tests will be 2-sided, with no correction for multiple comparisons.
10.2. Sample Size Considerations
The primary comparisons of interest are to compare RVT-101 to placebo at Week 24 for change 
from baseline in both ADAS-Cog-11 and ADCS-ADL. A sample size of 435 subjects per 
treatment group will allow a difference of 1.6 points between placebo and active treatment in the 
change from baseline in ADAS-Cog score to be detected with 95% power and a 0.[ADDRESS_996763] deviation (SD) of 6.5.
This sample size will also allow a difference of 2 points between placebo and active treatment in 
the change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score to be detected with 90% power and a 0.05 
significance level assuming an underlying SD of 9. Sample size estimates were based on data 
from study AZ3110866. 
Both endpoints need to achieve a significance level of 0.05 to maintain an overall 5% 
significance level. Hence, the multiplicity issue associated with the trial having 2 primary 
endpoints is addressed as efficacy will only be concluded if both endpoints are significant.
Assuming a drop-out and missing data rate of approximately 25% up to Week 24, a total of 
approximately 1150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_996764] of baseline severity and possible sub-populations of milder and more moderate 
subjects is an important consideration of this study. Hence, a stratified randomization will be 
used to enroll subjects according to their baseline MMSE score in the groupi[INVESTIGATOR_559074] 10-15 points, 
16-20 points, and 21-26 points.
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIALTwo subgroups using MMSE score at baseline will be examined: moderate 10-20 and mild 16-26. 
The thresholds for randomization presented in Table 4 will be enforced.
Table 4. Baseline Mini Mental State Examination Stratification
Baseline MMSE Score 10-15 16-20 21-26
Target for recruited population ;20% ;40% ;20%
The purpose of this ratio is to ensure that approximately 70% of the recruited population will 
contribute data to a data-defined subgroup analysis of either milder or more moderate subjects on 
ADAS-Cog-11 and/or ADCS-ADL. It is estimated that a difference from placebo of 1.6 points 
in ADAS-Cog-11 and 2.0 points in ADCS-ADL will be observable with approximately 80% 
power in a subgroup, which includes approximately 70% of subjects.

10.4.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses
The primary analyses will be based on the ITT Population.  In addition, analyses of the PP 
Population will be used to support the primary efficacy analysis.
Treatment comparisons between the RVT-101 and placebo groups in ADAS-Cog-11 and 
ADCS-ADL scores change from baseline at Week 24 will be analyzed using a mixed model for 
Axovant Sciences Ltd. RVT-101-3001 Protocol v3.0 
CONFIDENTIALrepeated measures (MMRM) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation.  This model 
corrects for dropout and accounts for the fact that measurements taken on the same subject over 
time tend to be correlated, by [CONTACT_729776] a dropout-free population.  
No imputation of the missing values will be made or required and the data used in the analysis 
will be the actual observed responses at each visit. The statistical model will be fitted with terms 
for treatment group, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], baseline score, baseline MMSE, and 
pooled center.

estimated treatment difference for at each visit will be displayed in the summary of statistical 
analysis together with the 95% confidence interval and the associated p-value.
The nature of missing data will be explored and the extent of missing data will be summarized.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to support the MMRM analysis.  This will include analysis 
based on completer, and analyses based on complete datasets for Week 24 derived via 
imputation techniques using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Details on covariates for 
ANCOVA and missing data imputations will be provided in the SAP.
The relationship between ADAS-Cog-11, ADCS-ADL, and baseline severity will be

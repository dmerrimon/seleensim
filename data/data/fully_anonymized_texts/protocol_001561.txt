1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Alpha -1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD, Alpha- 1) is an autosomal co- dominant genetic condition that 
predisposes to early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease. The 
SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene instructs production of alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT), a protease inhibitor  that protects lung 
tissue from damage due to uninhibited neutrophil elastase. AAT is primarily produced in the liver . The 
wildtype SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene encodes for normal AAT type M. Classic severe AATD results from the 
presence of two deficiency alleles . Numerous deficiency alleles have been reported and the homozygous 
state for the Z allele (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217428]) is the most common severe deficiency type.  The heterozygous Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217429] a more mild deficiency in serum AAT  and thus lower disease risk in most individuals . However, 
there exists heterogeneity of clinical presentation in most populations of AATD and genetic variation in 
the Alpha- [ADDRESS_260943] the genetic signatures that are associated with these advanced clinical phenotypes would allow improved diagnostics and therapeutics for these individuals' lung disease.

The Alpha Coded Testing (ACT) Study is an established and confidential home genetic testing study for 
alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Two primary populations choose to test through ACT. This is a 
preferred program for individuals in the US to test family members of those who have been found severely deficient. In addition, this test is used by [CONTACT_217453] a confidential manner. The ACT Study is sponsored and endorsed by [CONTACT_217454]- 1 Foundation. As a result 
of the demographics, 27% of the ACT cohort adults who complete testing are found to have one Z allele 
(N=4153). The serum levels estimated from these blood spot cards are non- normally distributed with 
significant variation.  
 
ACT participants with heterozygous genotype MZ will be invited to participate in this matched- control 
study. In the absence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_217430], the validated COPD severity score

link all areas of SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  genomic variation with presence and severity of COPD.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Literature and Previous Studies  
Alpha -1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD, Alpha- 1) is the best established genetic risk factor for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease. COPD represents a major health burden, with 
nearly 12.6 million individuals in the [LOCATION_002] diagnosed. COPD is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and related social and financial burden. Understanding heritable and environmental risk factors for COPD  is important to guide  targeted risk reduction recommendations, detection, and intervent ion.   
AATD -related COPD is phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_217431] 1-3% of 
COPD is r elated to severe homozygous AAT  deficiency. AATD is an autosomal co- dominantly inherited 
susceptibility . The SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene  on chromosome 14 encodes production of alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT), 
a protease inhibitor that is primarily produced in the liver. The wildtype gene produces the normal AAT protein M, which in circulation is protective to the lungs through inhibition of  neutrophil elastase. Two 
specific SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  mutations account for approximately 95% of  Alpha -1 deficiency alleles, though over 
500 deficiency alleles are now estimated. These common mutations produce the common abnormal AAT 
proteins S and Z, respectively, which result in corresponding serum deficiency of AAT. U ninhibited 
neutrophil elastase predisposes to COPD, while the Z protein specifically aggregates in the liver and raises risk for liver disease. Other rare mutations in the SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene also result in abnormal AAT 
protein production, leading to serum deficiency or nonfunctional AAT and similar disease risks . 
Severe classic AATD occurs in the presence of two abnormal alleles ( e.g. ZZ, SZ), where wildtype-
deficiency heterozygotes ( e.g. MZ, MS) are at lower disease risk; however,  there exists heterogeneity of 
clinical presentation in most populations of AATD  and understanding other genetic and environmental 
modifiers of risk in each group is important . Because AAT production is allele- dependent, heterozygotes, 
or carriers,  have interm ediate levels of circulating AAT with values lower than that of homozygous 
wildtype genotype MM but  higher than levels of classic deficiency . The MM genotype corresponds with 
serum AAT levels of 19.0- 59.[ADDRESS_260947] increased susceptibility to COPD  among MZ individuals in the presence of additional risk 
factors. Malloy, et al (2014) found that MZ individuals who smoke are more susceptible to COPD than a 
control group of matched wildtype MM smokers. In the absence of this other major risk factor  studied  
(smoking), COPD risk was not significantly different between MZ and MM groups. Smoking is the leading 
environmental modifier of the onset of COPD symptoms in populations with and without AATD.  
Some MZ individuals present at a young age with classic panlobular emphysema similar to that which is 
common ZZ individuals and uncommon in the wildtype population. Group mean lung function differences 
can hide the clinical observation that some Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217432]-related phenotype. Genotype is traditionally established by [CONTACT_217455], 
yet genetic variation in the Alpha- [ADDRESS_260948], including protease inhibitor typi[INVESTIGATOR_217433] 
(PI [INVESTIGATOR_217434]), serum quantification of AAT , SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  genot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  next generation 
sequencing. Pi [INVESTIGATOR_217435], 
respectively. These methods ascertain the majority of carriers and classically affected individuals  and 
correctly assign genotype in most cases . Serum AAT quantification does not definitively determine 
genotype; however, an unusually low AAT level when only one or no Pi [INVESTIGATOR_217436] a rare or null allele. Next generation sequencing is a high-
throughput and scalable sequencing platform able to clarify  genomic sequence of  many rare variants 
within coding regions of the SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene. A majority of  carriers and severely  deficient individuals 
have not had any sequencing test performed. Next generation sequencing in these populations may 
reveal previously undetected but significant risk variants for Alpha- 1.    
The Alpha Coded Testing (ACT) study is an established and confidential home genetic testing study for Alpha -1. Over 4,[ADDRESS_260949] cohort.  
  
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Aim:  
The number of individuals with additional SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  mutations in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217437]1  mutations in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217438].  
The primary analysis will determine whether SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  genetic signatures detected by [CONTACT_217456] w ith presence of COPD in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217439].  
3.2 Secondary Aims:    
3.2.[ADDRESS_260950] kit will be determined.  
3.2.2  To correlate COPD severity scores to specific SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  variants.  
 
3.3 To invite participation in the MUSC Alpha -1 Biorepository Participants will be invited to 
donate to the MUSC Alpha- 1 biorepository by [CONTACT_217457], 
PAXgene RNA and EDTA plasma tubes. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_217440]. These biosamples will be linked to the sequence data for longitudinal 
transcriptional and proteomic data. Biologic samples are stored for future use with permission for study of Alpha- 1, genomics and epi[INVESTIGATOR_78942]. A separate informed consent for biorepository 
participation will be provided to interested individuals ( Pro00039387).   
4. RATIONALE FOR  THE STUDY  
4.[ADDRESS_260951] consented to be contact[CONTACT_217458]- 1 
and/or  genetic testing- related studies. The MZ cohort with the lower quartile of AAT level is selected as 
the most reasonable first population for a study of this nature that seeks to identify whether previously 
untested SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  variations correlate with COPD. MZ individuals in the lower quartile of level report 
the highest MZ incidence of COPD, and this cohort of MZs contains sufficient numbers to obtain matched 
pairs of COPD -affected and control individuals from this target group.  Based on findings of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], studies of this nature may be  expanded to include matched pairs from other MZ -level co horts and 
other COPD populations in the future.  The 25% of the MZ cohort with lowest levels will have A1 -PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_217441] 11 to approximately 16 uM with the median MZ value equal 19.6 uM.  
4.3 Use of the DNA1 kit  
CSL Behring partnered with Biocerna LLC in 2013 to offer the DNA1 Advanced Alpha- 1 Screening 
(DNA1) test, the only comprehensive  Alpha -[ADDRESS_260952] kit involves performing a finger  stick in the home setting to obtain 
spots of blood that are used for testing. Testing includes: clinical chemistry (a blood spot assay to test 
AAT levels, as well as a C -reactive protein (CRP) to provide full clinical analysis), targeted genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(identifies all known, clinically relevant variants, including S, Z, and F), next generation sequencing 
(sequencing of the SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene to identify unknown variants), and isoelectric focusing (Results 
compared to genetic results as a confirmatory step). The next generation sequencing includes coverage 
of the promoter region, exons and intronic splice sites . The variety of genomic variations detected by 
[CONTACT_217459][CONTACT_208130]1  gene will likely be large. Biocerna will define if they believe mutations are 
likely to be in functional regions of the gene, independent of knowing if the patient has COPD or not.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_260953]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) is a COPD assessment that has been shown to 
correlate well with established measures of symptom level and disease activity. Presence and severity of COPD can thus be assigned for each participant. The COPD severity score collected previously through ACT study participation will be again administered as part of this study. Thus interval reports will be available as a proxy for disease progression for those who may not have spi[INVESTIGATOR_217442]. Spi [INVESTIGATOR_217443], where possible. The COPD severity score is  a validated 
questionnaire- based instrument that is  internally consistent, reliable, and appears to capture a broad 
range of disease severity. The COPD severity  score survey  may be administered by [CONTACT_217460] a 
written questionnaire. COPD data will allow for correlation of COPD presence and severity with genomic findings.   
 
Questionnaires will be formulated in REDCap, with hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_217444]. Following signed informed consent and HIPAA forms, participants will either be mailed questionnaires to complete and return or will be emailed a secure link for access  to 
REDCap questionnaires, including the SGRQ, COPD severity score and demographic surveys . Any 
paper survey documents will be digitized, reviewed by a team member to confirm that all pages are present and legible, facing the appropriate direction and are an exact copy of the paper forms. Each page 
will be individually labeled with the participant’s study ID and the question item responses provided will be 
entered by a trained study coordinator under the participant’s ID in the electronic database. The original 
paper documents  will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the Alpha- 1 office.  
 
4.5 Invitation to the biorepository  
Participants will be asked to check Yes or No on this study’s consent form regarding their interest in 
donating blood to the MUSC Alpha- 1 Biorepository. Interested participants will be presented with the 
separate Biorepository informed consent (Pro39387). U pon providing consent participants who are not 
on-site at MUSC will be mailed PAXgene DNA, PAXgene RNA, and EDTA plasma tubes that require 
collection at a physician’s office. Overnight return mailing and processing charges are included in study 
funding. The purpose of the Biorepository is to foster future biological research related to Alpha- [ADDRESS_260954] participation in this study.  
 
5. STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
5.1 Overview  
The MZ Alpha- 1 Carrier Genomics study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_217445] 150 MZ  individuals, with a 
goal of attaining 50 matched pairs. COPD+ and COPD - individuals will be matched on age, sex, race and 
smoking history. Any consented individuals who do not have a match in the study cohort will be allowed 
to continue with participation. Their samples will be analyzed as unmatched COPD + or – samples, which 
will be accounted for statistically and discussed in study reports .  
 
Presence and severity of COPD is  assessed by a COPD severity score for each registrant in the ACT 
database. We will addition ally ask as part of this study that current COPD  questionnaires and 
demographic surveys be completed, and that patients submit previous lung function testing if this has 
been done. Participants will be mailed a DNA1 test kit to obtain and return a blood sample by [CONTACT_217461][CONTACT_208130]1  gene sequencing. Gene sequencing at Biocerna LLC will  identify , if 
present,  genomic signatures that may correlate with COPD in this cohort.  Biocerna LLC will determine 
likely pathogenicity of sequence variants detected blinded to knowing COPD -status of the patient tested. 
Statistical an alysis will correlate genetic findings with COPD presence and severity.  Participants will 
receive their results by [CONTACT_2319]. Participants will also be invited to contribute additional samples to the MUSC 
Alpha -[ADDRESS_260955] 
previously provided COPD severity scores.  We propose to invite these 370+ individuals to participate. 
Potential participants will be invited  by [CONTACT_217462], though  subsequent 
contact [CONTACT_217463], including but not limited to email or home mailing per ACT 
protocol policy procedures . Eligible individuals who did not test through ACT and are able to provide 
documentation of their MZ and lower quartile level results will also be accepted into this study.  The study 
personnel contact[CONTACT_217464], 
including that questionnaire based responses, spi[INVESTIGATOR_217446], and a blood sample by [CONTACT_217465]. Once participants are enrolled (signed informed consent and 
HIPAA), an email will be sent  contain ing a secure link for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_217447]. If needed, paper questionnaires may be mailed.  Test kits will be mailed 
following receipt of completed questionnaires.   
All participants may make a written decision separate from primary study consent and participation 
whether to allow their clinical and genomic data linked to personal identifiers to be stored in the MUSC 
Alpha -1 Biorepository indefinitely after the conclusion of this study. No personally  identifying information 
will be published and personal information obtained and stored will remain confidential to the extent possible within State and Federal law.  
5.3 Inclusion/Exclusion  
5.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Signed informed consent  
2.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217448].  
5.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Age <18 years  
2. Known homozygous or compound heterozygous classic severe AATD (e.g. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_217449], ZZ, Znull)  
5.3.3. Conditional Exclusions  
1. Incomplete return of study materials. Those who consent but fail to both complete questionnaires and 
return a blood sample may be excluded from analysis.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_260956] by [CONTACT_756]. In this event , following adequate opportunity to ask questions willing participants will sign the consent and 
HIPAA forms and return them to the consenting member of the research team by [CONTACT_217466]. At the same time, the consenting member of the research team will also sign and date a copy of both the consent and HIPAA forms. Once the participant’s signed forms are received, they will be stapled together with those signed by [CONTACT_217467] a note entered at the bottom of the patient’s consent linking the files. At this point the participant is enrolled. The complete paperwork is then scanned as a pdf and submitted to the electronic database established for the study. Participants will be encouraged to retain 
their copy for their records.  
 
All pages of any paper consents will be digitized, reviewed by a team member to confirm that all pages 
are present and legible, facing the appropriate direction and are an exact copy of the paper consent. Each consent will be individually labeled with the participant’s study ID. The consents will be saved in a 
secure server and indexed for immediate access by [CONTACT_19062]. Certification that 
the pdf consent is identical to the paper copy will be added as initials and date in adobe acrobat. After certification has been added the file will be locked and saved. The original paper consents will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the Alpha- 1 office.  
 
5.5 Withdrawal  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. At the time of withdrawal the 
participant may 1) decline to provide any more data or specimens to the study but allow use of previously collected data and/or specimens, 2) request withdrawal of all his/her data from study databases and request that any stored samples be destroyed, or 3) withdraw some portion of the data collected (i.e. 
participants may withdraw specimens but not questionnaire data or vice versa).  Genomic sequencing 
results in extensive genetic data, including genetic sequence that cannot be unknown. Laboratories often 
retain records of all sequence data that results from testing in their facility. Participants may not be able to recover all records of their genomic sequence; however, the laboratory sequence data will be linked only to study number in their records and no personally identifying information will be linked. Participants may 
specify that they wish for data that results from sequencing of their assigned study number to be omitted 
from research analysis or use; however, such data may not cease to exist upon withdrawal.    
If a participant chooses to withdraw  the research coordinator will determine the disposition of the 
participant’s study data and provide the participant with any clinically relevant study results, or establish how the participant would like to be contact[CONTACT_217468].  
 
5.6. Study Schedule  
1. Following IRB approval and establishment of CSL contracts study coordinators will contact  [CONTACT_217469] . Follow -
up calls may  be made to boost initial recruitment and matching.  
2. For each informed consent and questionnaire set received, a barcoded DNA1 test kit will be mailed  
with instructions for obtaining and returning the required sample. P ostage paid return mailing supplies  will 
be provided.  
3. The samples returned will go by [CONTACT_217470]. Biocerna will 
have the sample and barcode only (no personal health information), while all survey items and identifiers 
are collected and stored for linkage at MUSC.    
4. MUSC will perform matching of age, sex,  and smoking -status COPD -affected and control MZ 
participants .  
5. Biocerna LLC will perform SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  sequencing on samples sent by [CONTACT_217471].  
6. Study personnel will  link the results to the participant and  mail results  to the participant. The results will 
include  a study interpretation of results and recommendations for accessing appropriate resources . 
7.  
8. Statistical analysis of all  matched pairs using paired T -test and descriptive analysis will allow for 
conclusions of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_217450].  Participants for whom no match is available in the study cohort 
will be included in an uneven CO PD+ / - arm analysis and aggregate study reporting.  
9. The study will be complete in approximately [ADDRESS_260957] for the American Thoracic Society annual meeting in May  2016.   
 
5.7.1 Blood Samples  
Safety and Processing: Samples will be received by [CONTACT_217472], MD where safety and sample processing will occur per their usual protocols. Biocerna runs the DNA1 analysis on a clinical and commercial basis and has necessary and proper protocols in place to receive and handle specimens of this study.   
5.7.2 Sequencing / Integrated Genomics  
Genetic sequencing is used to determine the order of nucleotides within a gene. State of the art  next 
generation sequencing methods will be applied  to detect sequence variants  in all regions of the 
SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene, including regions upstream and downstream of coding regions of the gene, promoters 
and regulatory regions. Such testing is more thorough than that which is traditiona lly performed on a 
clinical basis  yet the role of various mutations within and around the SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1 coding region is 
potentially important in pathogenicity. Genomic interpretation software and models will be used by 
[CONTACT_217473].

This assesses clinical severity of COPD. Interval assessment allows for disease progression to be inferred.  
Demographic questions not already in ACT 
Demographic questions to ensure fidelity of matching will be asked. See corresponding questionnaire.   
 
5.9 Ethical Considerations 
5.9.1 Human Subjects’ Protections and Risk  
DNA1 test kit finger  stick 
Finger stick  is a common method to obtain blood spots for testing. Blood obtained by [CONTACT_217474] a needle that can cause pain. Very rarely, infections can occur at the site of 
puncture. Proper safety instructions including proper disinfection of the puncture site prior to needle stick 
are provided with each test kit. The aforementioned risks are described in the informed consent.  
Genetic Testing  
SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  genetic testing risks include the possibility of identifying previously unknown genetic risk for 
COPD or identifying a genetic change for which the significance is unknown. Testing and results of 
testing may be associated with feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Because genetic variants are often shared by [CONTACT_103106], testing may inadvertently reveal risk to relatives. The aforementioned risks, as well as potential benefits of knowing genetic information, are described in the informed consent. Study personnel are available to answer questions participants may have prior to or during participation. The 
Alpha -[ADDRESS_260959] of human biomedical and genetics research an d 
HIPAA information security. Proof of training will be collected from all study personnel.  
Longer descriptions of human subjects protections are provided in the informed consent.   
5.9.2 Adverse Events 
Procedures for Adverse Events 
Minimal risk for adverse events exists related to participation in this study. Pain and bruising may occur at 
the site of a needle stick; rarely, infections can occur at the site of puncture. In the event that a study 
coordinator is notified of an adverse event by [CONTACT_648], the coordinator will consult the MD PI [INVESTIGATOR_217451]. Any adverse event  will be 
reported within one week of notification of event to the IRB. Study coordinators will comply with local 
regulations and policies when notifying the institutional IRB.   
Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The FDA (2009) defines a serious adverse event as an adverse event that: results in the participant’s 
death, is life -threatening, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), results  in significant, persistent, or 
permanent  change, impairment, damage, disruption, or disability in the participant’s body 
function/structure, physical activities or quality of life, results in a congenital anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
Risk for serious adverse events is not anticipated.  
Measures to Protect the Participant  
Instructions for disinfecting the puncture site and safely performing a finger stick will be included with each DNA1 test kit. Further, a link to the YouTube instructional video that details safe and effective 
sample ascertainment will be provided.  
 
6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
6.1 Primary Aim:  The number of likely significant gene mutations between COPD and matched 
control groups will be compared using a paired T -test 
The variety of mutations in non- coding and coding regions of the SERPI[CONTACT_208130]1  gene will be large. 
Therefore, Biocerna will define if they believe mutations are likely to be in functional regions of the gene, 
independent of knowing if the patient has COPD or is  a matched control. The number of likely significant 
gene mutations between COPD and matched control groups will be compared using a paired T -test. 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_260960] kit. Enrolling up to 150 allows better chances of finding 50 matched 
pairs. All samples that are received by [CONTACT_217475]. If we end up with uneven numbers in the 
COPD+ and COPD- arms, more than [ADDRESS_260961] (AATD). RNA, mRNA, and proteomic data as available are linked with samples and corresponding clinical phenotype for the purpose of building longitudinal transcriptional and proteomic data. Biosamples are stored for future use with permission for study of Alpha -1 and related genomic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_78942]. Sample use and regulations are specified in the 
Biorepository IRB Protocol  (Pro00039387) .   
 
8. STUDY MONITORING  
8.[ADDRESS_260962]. Strange and institutional  regulatory bodies study staff will  coordinat e meetings, 
conference calls, and web- conferences  as needed ; determine and delegate needs for administrative 
support (e.g. scheduling, minutes)  for committees and subcommittees; ensure fidelity of all data 
management activities, including form design, regular reports, reimbursing, including contracts, ide ntifying 
milestones for payment, and generating invoices and payments, maintaining directories and distribution lists, preparing reports, creating recruitment materials and assisting with recruitment, creating and 
updating the Manual of Operations, training and certification of study personnel, organizing in- person 
meetings, and coordinating and overseeing the publication process.

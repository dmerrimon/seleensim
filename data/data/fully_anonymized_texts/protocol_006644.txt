 2 1.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   
The endothelium provides a permeability barrier for the vasculature, maintains a nonthrombogenic 
surface, regulates vascular tone and tissue flow, and inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth. In the 
presence of inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cells  are activated which facilitates leukocyte adhesion 
and migration into the vessel wall, production of prothrombotic substances, and vasoconstriction, 
thereby [CONTACT_40397] a proatherogenic and procoagulant environment. Consequently, inflammation is a key 
mediat or of a constellation of abnormalities that initiate and accelerate the progression of 
atheroscl erosis.  
HIV-specific immune dysregulation promotes endothelial and immune cell activation. Indeed, 
antiretroviral (ART) -naive HIV positive patients have higher levels of endothelial immune activation 
markers (e.g., IL -6, VICAM -1 and others) than non -HIV controls. ART -naïve HIV positive patients also 
show evidence of endothelial -cell dysfunction, as assessed by [CONTACT_295465]. Treatment with 
ART has be en shown to reduce biomarker evidence of endothelial cell activation in observational and 
randomized trials, and some of these drugs also appear to improve endothelial function. However, most  
prior evidence of the direct biologic effect of HIV viral infect ion and its changes with therapy on 
coronary vascular function has been indirect through the measurement of circulating biomarkers  or 
brachial artery reactivity.  
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows precise and reproducible quantification of 
myocardial blood flow, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a direct assessment of coronary vascular health. Coronary flow 
reserve (CFR, calculated as the ratio of peak hyperemic myocardial blood flow over that at rest) is 
emerging as a powerful quantitative prognostic imagin g marker of clinical cardiovascular risk. CFR 
provides a robust and reproducible clinical measure of the integrated  hemodynamic effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_295437] (CAD), diffuse atherosclerosis, vessel remodeling, and microvascular dysfunction 
resulting from endothelial cell dysfunction on myocardial tissue perfusion across the entire coronary 
circulation. These processes have direct relevance to the underlying vascular pathobiology in patients 
with HIV infection. Consequently, quantitative CFR p rovides a unique opportunity to examine the 
potential impact of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295438]. By [CONTACT_295466][INVESTIGATOR_295439], TAF -CFR would provide important 
mechanistic insights of the capabilities of TAF therapy to improve key determinants of clinical risk.  
 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF CFR  AS A SURROGATE MARKER OF CLINICAL RI SK 
Noninvasive quantification of coronary flow reserve improves diagn osis and risk assessment in non -
HIV patients with CAD.  Noninvasive quantification of coronary blood flow and flow reserve has been the 
research focus of our group for over [ADDRESS_360101] 
demonstrated that CFR is a quantitative unique phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_295440] -
clinical atherosclerosis which, in higher risk patients, can reveal flow -limiting c oronary artery stenosis , 
thereby [CONTACT_295467] 1-4. More recent data support the notion that coronary vascular dysfunction, as 
quantified by [CONTACT_295468], is highly prevalent among patients with known or suspected CAD2, 5, 
increases the severity of inducible myocardial ischemia (beyond the effects of upstream coronary 
obstruction)[ADDRESS_360102] 
impaired CFR to a degree directly relat ed to disease duration13. In patients with ca rdiac syndrome X 
(CSX) with exertional angina and ST -segment depression on exercise stress testing but normal luminal 
coronary angiography, only those with elevated high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP, >3 mg/L) have 
reduced CFR14. Among patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and nonobstructive CAD by 
[CONTACT_89320], reduced CFR (assessed by [CONTACT_295469]) is associated with 
higher frequency of thin -cap fibroatheroma, greater plaque burden, and  significantly higher levels of 
hsCRP, despi[INVESTIGATOR_295441]15. These res ults reinforce previous observations16-18 that inflammation is associated with 
impaired coronary vasoreactivity and, in the appropriate patient population, may be a better marker for 
poor outcomes related to diffuse and/or microvascular CAD than are conventional ischemic 
assessments.  
Anti -inflam matory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295442].  There is preliminary evidence that anti -inflammatory 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295443].  Indeed, treatment with statins in patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_295444] a way that is modified among carriers of a specific  polymorphism that reduces 
IL-1beta  expression19. Short -term inhibition of IL -[ADDRESS_360103] anakinra in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients without perfusion abnormalities has been shown to improve 
echocardiographic measures of LV myocardial deformation (by [CONTACT_295470]) and CFR (by [CONTACT_295471] (LAD))20. Finally, treatment with methotrexate led to 
reduced clinical scores of disease severity a nd improved CFR (as measured by [CONTACT_295472]) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, with no effect on common carotid intima -medial 
thickness21.  
Coronary vascular dysfunction is a powerful predictor of clinical  risk. Emerging data have consistently 
shown that CFR measurements by [CONTACT_295473], 
including cardiac death8-11. We recently reported that reduced global CFR is independently associated 
with higher rates of cardiac and all -cause mortality in a large cohort of  patients with and without DM8, 22. 
Relatively preserved CFR identifies patients with known or suspected CAD who have significantly lower 
risk of cardiac death, regardless of traditional semi -quantitative measures of stress -induced ischemia. 
Conversely, reduced CFR identifies patients at sign ificantly higher risk of cardiac death, even among 
those without objective evidence of ischemia, probably due to diffuse atherosclerosis and/or 
microvascular dysfunction. PET measures of CFR improved risk stratification beyond comprehensive 
clinical assess ment, LVEF and semi -quantitative measures of myocardial ischemia and scar, and led to 
clinically meaningful risk -reclassification of ~50% of intermediate risk patients8. Diabetics with impaired 
vs. preserved CFR experienced substantially higher cardiac mortality  (7.6%/year vs. 1.3%/year, relative 
to 4.2%/year vs. 0.4%/year in nondiabetics, respectively, both p<0.0001)22. Importantly, diabetic 
patients without known CAD and with impaired CFR experie nced a rate of cardiac death comparable to, 
and possibly higher than, that for nondiabetic patients with known CAD (Fig. 3). Measures of CFR 
integrate the hemodynamic effects of focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_267713], fluid dynamic effects of diffuse 
atheroscl erosis, and the effects of coronary microvascular dysfunction, all of which are prevalent among 
diabetics23-25, and affected by [CONTACT_295474]. These observations have implications for the 
 [ADDRESS_360104] on platelet 
aggregation, leukocyte a dhesion, and systemic inflammation48. 
 
Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_295445] 2018 for treatment of HIV. The marketed name [CONTACT_295493]. In two phase 
3 comparative clinical trials, including one with ABC/3TC/DTG, it was found to be non -inferior to 
dolutegravir -containing regimens in terms of virologic outcomes49, 50. B/F /TAF was also well tolerated, 
with few discontinuations for adverse events. As a result, B/F/TAF is an ideal non -abacavir containing 
regimen to assess the effect of removing ABC on coronary flow reserve.  
 
2.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
2.1 Hypothesis and  Objectives  
The primary hypothesis  of the B/F/ TAF-CFR study  is that reducing endothelial cell activation and 
dysfunction using bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (B/F/TAF)  in place of 
abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG)  will quantitatively improve coronary flow reserve as 
measured by [CONTACT_295475] 24 weeks, in stable higher risk asymptomatic patients with HIV.  
 
The primary objective of the B/F/ TAF-CFR study is t o test the hypothesis that in stable HIV patients 
treated with abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir STR regimens, a switch to a single tablet regimen 
(B/F/TAF) will improve coronary flow reserve and myocardial tissue perfusion, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_295476]. This is a  prospective, single arm study  in which we will  test that treatment 
B/F/TAF orally daily for 24 weeks will result in improved global coronary flow reserve in response to 
adenosine, reflecting coronary vasodilator function, as compared to baseline.   
 
 5 2.2 Primary Endpoint : 
Change (from baseline) in global coronary flow reserve, as measured by [CONTACT_295477] 24  weeks after 
initiation of B/F/TAF therapy . 
 
2.3 Secondary Endpoints : 
2.3.1.  Change (from baseline) in peak -stress global myocardial blood flow (in mL/min/g) at 24 
week s after initiation of B/F/TAF; 
2.3.2.  Change (from baseline) in peak -stress global coronary vascular resistance (in mm 
Hg/mL/min/g) at 24 weeks after initiation of B/F/TAF; 
2.3.3.  Change in serum biomarkers of inflammation (hs -CRP, IL -6, sCD163 and sCD14),  myocyte 
injury and strain (hs Troponin, NT -proBNP) at 24 weeks after initiation of B/F/TAF.

5.2.  Drug to be used  
B/F/TAF is indicated for treatment of people  with HIV -AIDS .  Patients enrolled in the study will be 
switched from a HIV regimen containing abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir to B/F/TAF  for 2 4 weeks. In a 
comparative clinical trial, B/F/TAF was non -inferior to ABC/3TC/DTG in virologic outcomes and  showed a 
significantly lower rate of patient -reported nausea. In Study GS-US-380-1489,  a double -blind, 
multicenter , active -controlled, randomized  controlled non -inferiority trial of ABC/3TC/DTG vs B/F/TAF in 
treatment naïve adults,  both regimens were well tolerated . Adverse events leading to study 
discontinuation were noted in no participants in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir 
alafenamide group and 1% of participants in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group. Adverse 
events related to  study drug were less common with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir 
alafenamide than with dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (26% [n=82] vs 40% [n=127]), the 
difference being driven by a higher incidence of drug related nausea in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and 
lamivudine group (5% [n=17] vs 17% [n=55]; p<0 .0001).  
 
5.3. Concomitant medications  
Only patients on stable HIV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295454] . Because concurrent medications can 
potentially affect coronary blood flow and flow reserve (e.g., antihypertensive and oral h ypoglycemic 
agents, statins ), only patients on stable treatment for hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_295455]. The following medications will be allowed provided they are neither initiated nor 
discontinued during the study period:   
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248];  
• Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers;  
• -blockers;  
• HMG –CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins);  
• Nitroglycerin and l ong-acting nitrates;  
• Oral anti -diabetic medications  and Insulin ; 
• Stable hormone replacement therapy  
 
5.4.  Procedures  
Positron Emission Tomography  (PET) : Regional and global myocardial blood flow will be assessed using 
PET imaging.  Clinical and research cardiac PET studies are routinely performed at BWH . The PET imaging 
team at BWH under [CONTACT_295494]’s leadership  consist of experienced  imag ing specialists  and have a track 
record in research studies using PET. Di Carli has extensive experience in performing these procedures, 
quantifying myocardial blood flow and flow reserve, has published extensively on this topic, and runs an 
active core laboratory with e xperience in multi -center trials using imaging endpoints. PET scans will be 
performed using a whole body PET/CT scanner. Study participants will be asked to refrain from drinking 
caffeine -containing beverages and taking theophylline -containing medications for 12 hours before the 
PET study.  Calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and arterial vasodilators will be withheld for 24 
hours prior to the PET scan.  Studies will be performed after 4 hours of fasting.  
 11 Assessment of myocardial blood flow and coronar y flow reserve : Regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) 
will be measured at rest and during vasodilator -stress with adenosine using 13N-ammonia as the flow 
tracer. 13N-ammonia is  used in clinical and research studies and ha s been validated for the 
quantificat ion of myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve. After transmission imaging and 
beginning with the intravenous bolus administration of 13N-ammonia  (~20 mCi), list mode images will be 
acquired for [ADDRESS_360107] infusion of adenosine (140 
mcg/kg/min) for 4 mins  or regadenoson bolus injection (0.4 mg) . Two mins into the adenosine infusion  
or one minute after the regadenoson bolus , a second dose of 13N-ammonia  will be administered, and 
PET imaging collected in the s ame manner. Heart rate, blood pressure, and 12 -lead electrocardiogram 
will be recorded at baseline, every minute during the infusion, and during 5 minutes after completion of 
the adenosine infusion  or regadenoson injection .  
Analysis of PET data : Absolute MBF (in ml/g/min) will be computed from the dynamic rest and stress 
images using commercially available software (Corridor4DM; Ann Arbor, Michigan) and previously 
validated methods 33, 34. Automated factor analysis will be used t o generate blood pool (arterial input 
function) and tissue time -activity curves. Regional and global rest and vasodilator -stress MBF will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_295481] 13N-ammonia  time -activity curves to a two -compartment tracer kinetic model as 
described p reviously 33, 34. Per -patient global coronary flow reserve (CFR) will be calculated as the ratio 
of MBF at peak vasodilator -stress over that at rest for the entire left ventricle. This method for 
quantitation of MBF is highly reproducible . In the PET core laboratory at BWH, the intra -class correlation 
coefficient for CFR among four readers is 0.94 (95%CI 0.88 -0.98), indicating excellent reproducibility5. 
 
Coordination of ancillary study and central imaging analyses . BWH will serve as the coordinating center 
and central imaging core laboratory for the proposed PET scans in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. [CONTACT_295494] runs a very 
active core laboratory and, as mentioned above, has extensive experience in mana ging multi -site 
imaging trials. In this investigator -initiated study, BWH will sub -contract all clinical centers in the 
ancillary study.  
For the central analysis of the PET images, all imaging data will be stripped of patient identifiers and 
assigned a tr ial-specific identifier to maintain compliance with US regulatory requirements regarding 
protection of patient privacy. Drs. Di Carli and Sax will organize a bi -monthly teleconference including 
investigators and research coordinators from each clinical  site to monitor, discuss, and troubleshoo t 
recruitment and other issues that may arise during the conduct of the clinical trial.  
 
5.5.  Data to be collected and timing of data collection  
At each of the study visits, a medical history with symptom assessment, medication review, vital signs, 
physical e xam, and blood samples will be obtained. As described above, additional data from the PET/CT 
scan as well as EKG assessment will be obtained at baseline and at the end of treatment period. One 
week afte r completion of the trial, telephone follow -up will be conducted to assess for any adverse 
events.   
 
Laboratory analysis :  Clinical labs will be collected at the Screening, Baseline, Day 45, and End of 
Treatment visits as follows:  
• Screening:   Comprehensive  metabolic panel, lipid panel, hs -CRP, HbA1c, CBC, HIV RNA, D -Dimer, 
Hepatitis B Surface Antigen  
• Baseline:   hs-troponin and NT -proBNP  
• Day 45:   Comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, hs -CRP, HbA1c, CBC, HIV RNA, D -Dimer  
 12 • End of Treatment:   Comprehensive  metabolic panel, lipid panel, hs -CRP, HbA1c, CBC, HIV RNA, 
D-Dimer, hs -troponin, NT -proBNP  
• In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed (for women of child -bearing potential) at 
Screening and before each PET scan.  
 
6. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
6.1.  Identification of clinical sites participating in the proposed ancillary study . BWH, MGH,  [LOCATION_011] 
Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center will participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Based on the power calculations above and assumi ng a 20% effect size, the study will need to recruit 
approximately [ADDRESS_360108] in  HIV clinical trials. Di Carli is a recognized expert in 
quantitative PET and nuclear cardiology imaging, has published widely on these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], and has 
extensive experience in conducting clinical trials using imaging endpoints51-54.  
 
6.2.  Power Analysis :  
The table below shows the sample size needed to reach 85% power for an effect size of 20 -30% relative 
improvement in coronary flow reserve from baseline using a standard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_360109] sizes were 
calculated from a baseline mean CFR of 1.74, which is a conservative value derived from our previou s 
measurement of CFR in patients with HIV referred for myocardial perfusion imaging with PET:  
 
Table 2. Power calculation  
Effect Size  Mean CFR difference  
(TAF – Baseline)  SD Total Sample Size  
(80% power)  Total Sample Size  
(85% power)  Total Sample Size  
(90% power)  
20% 0.35 0.7 23 26 30 
25% 0.43 0.7 16 18 21 
30% 0.51 0.7 12 14 15 
 
Using a total sample size of 30 evaluable patients and a two -tailed alpha of 0.05, there will be 85% 
power to detect an effect size of 20% relative improvement in coronary flow reserve from baseline, 
estimating a ~15% attrition rate between time of baseline and final PET. The 20% relative improvement 
in CFR is the effect size previously demonstrated in statin trials.  
 
6.3.  Study endpoints  
Primary Endpoint : Change (from baseline) in coronary flow reserve, as measured by [CONTACT_295477] [ADDRESS_360110] medication switch.  
Secondary Endpoints : 
(1) Change (from baseline) in peak -stress global myocardial blood flow (in mL/min/g) at 24 weeks after 
initiation of B/FTAF ; 
 13 (2) Change (from baseline) in peak -stress global coronary vascular resistance (in mm Hg/mL/min/g) at 
24 weeks after initiation of B/FTAF ; 
(3) Change in serum biomarkers of inflammation ( hs-CRP, IL-6, sCD163 and sCD14 ), myocyte injury and 
strain (hs Troponin, NT -proBNP) at 2 4 weeks after initiation of B/F/TAF.  
  
 
6.4.  Statistical methods  
To test the central hypothesis , that reducing endothelial cell activation and dysfunction by [CONTACT_191666] 
B/F/TAF for ABC/3TC/DTG  will quantitatively improve coronary flow re serve as measured by [CONTACT_295475] [ADDRESS_360111] to assess the ∆CFR between baseline and follow -up for each 
subject.   
If a significant change in CFR after the switch is observed, w e will perform secondary analyses of 
association between other markers of inflammation also implicated in atherosclerosis ( hs-CRP, IL-6, 
sCD163 and sCD14 ) with ∆CFR.  Significance of associations with other inflammatory markers and ∆CFR 
will be adjusted using the  Bonferroni correction.  
 
 
7. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
7.1.  Blood sampling and intravenous catheter  
The risks and discomforts of drawing blood from a vein include the possibility of discomfort, pain, 
redness, bruising, or bleeding at the site of the blood draw, occasional feeling of lightheadedness, and 
rarely, infection or fainting.  
 
There are minor risks and discomforts associated with placement of an intravenous line for the PET scan , 
including the possibility of bleeding, pain, inflammation (redne ss and swelling), and leaking of contrast 
agent outside of the vein at the site of the IV. These problems are usually self -limited or require only 
minor treatments, such as application of an ice -pack or slight pressure for a few minutes.  
 
7.2.  Vasodilator stress  
Vasodilator -stress with regadenoson and adenosine , as will be performed in this study, has been used 
routinely for many years for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease in conjunction 
with myocardial perfusion imaging. During the infusion  of the vasodilator stress agent , the patient may 
experience flushing, chest pain/pressure, nausea, or lightheadedness. If significant symptoms are 
present, patients will be given aminophylline (reversal agent) IV to relieve the se symptoms. There will 
be continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and [ADDRESS_360112] common side effects associated with the regadenoson 
bolus include: flushing, chest pain/pressure, shortness of brea th, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], headache, mild 
hypotension and heart block. These side effects are usually mild and self -limiting. If they are severe in 
intensity, aminophylline IV (1 mg/kg) will be given as per standard protocol.  
 [ADDRESS_360113] 
include: facial flushing, headache, sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], chest pain, hypotension, shortness of 
breath/dyspnea, chest pressure, hyperventilation, head pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness,  tingling in 
arms, numbness, apprehension, blurred vision, burning sensation, heaviness in arms, neck and back 
pain, nausea, metallic taste, tightness in throat, and pressure in groin. Adenosine is administered as a 
continuous infusion over 4 minutes and a dministered in a dose of 0.14mg/kg/min.  The half-life of 
adenosine is less than 10 seconds.  If the patient is having symptoms the infusion can be stopped, no 
further medication is administered, and the symptoms would stop within seconds because the 
medic ation would already be cleared from the heart. Therefore, no reversal medication is needed.   
Rarely, an aminophylline IV injection may be used to reverse side effects of regadenoson infusion. 
Aminophylline is generally well tolerated; possible side effect s of aminophylline may include nausea, 
headache, restlessness, convulsions, rapid breathing, a rapid heart rate, and a llergic reactions such as 
rash.  
7.3.  Radiation risk 
The estimated whole body effective radiation dose from each of the 13N-ammonia PET scan is ~[ADDRESS_360114] will undergo 2 PET studies during the trial for a total do se of ~6 -7 mSv, significantly lower 
than the average radiation exposure associated with a single conventional myocardial perfusion imaging 
study using single -photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)55. 
 
7.4.  Drug side effects and toxicities  
The most common side effects with the use of B/F/TAF are nausea, diarrhea, and headache , as 
described in Table 3 which is based on the results of the phase III trials49, 50.

7.5.  Reproductive r isks 
Pregnant or breastfeeding patients will be excluded from this study.   
 
A female is considered of child -bearing potential unless:  
• Permanently sterile (includes hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656])  
• Medically documented ovarian failure  
• Post -menopausal, defined as ≥ 60 years of age with cessation of menses for ≥ 12 months.  
7.6.  Unknown Risks:  
There may be other risks and side effects that are not known at this time.  
 
8. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
8.1.  Potential benefits to participating individuals  
There are no direct benefits for the patient from taking part in this study. The proposed study will test 
the important question of wheth er reducing endothelial cell activation and dysfunction using B/F/TAF 
will quantitatively improve coronary flow reserve, a sensitive measure of myocardial ischemia . Thus, this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_295456] (improve coronary blood flow and reduce 
ischemia ) and, in so doing, improve patient symptoms and quality of life , as well as outcomes.  
 
8.2. Potential benefits to society  
Data collected in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_295457], as well as into the pathophysiology of microvascular 
dysfunction in HIV -AIDS.  
 
9.  MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
9.1.  Safety monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_295458] d will report any adverse events  to th e 
IRB, per local institutional guidelines .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_295459]’ human 
rights, safety, and well -being are protected, that the study is properly conducted in adherence to the 
current protocol, and study data reported by [CONTACT_093]/subinvestigator are accurate, comple te 
and verifiable with study -related records such as source documents.  
 16 Safety data will be obtained at each study visit from the spontaneous reports by [CONTACT_295482], vital sign monitoring, physical examinations, 12 -lead  ECGs and clinical laboratory tests. In 
addition, telephone follow -up will be conducted to assess for any adverse events. All sa fety data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_295483] ( [CONTACT_295495] ). 
Patients with unexpected abnormalities on  the baseline PET sca n will be discussed with the patient’s 
PCP/ID physician to decide whether the patient should participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] . The findings will be 
discussed with the patient and the patient’s primary physician in order to facilitate an appropriate 
manageme nt plan. If a patient is excluded on safety grounds, we do not think that this will affect our 
ability to determine the effect of B/F/TAF on myocardial blood flow.  
The safety of B/F/TAF will be assessed with respect to the following end points: (1) death f rom any 
cause, (2) the composite of death from any cause or any cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], (3) frequency of 
symptomatic documented arrhythmia, (4) serious adverse events related to the study drug and clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities.  
 
9.2.  Treatment Compliance  
Subject compliance to treatment regimen will be assessed at each study visit by a count of remaining 
medication in each bottle .  Subjects will be asked to complete a medication diary for additional 
compliance assessment.  The diary will be compared to the drug count.  A threshold of ≥80% will be 
used to define compliance with treatment assignment. Subjects determined to be noncompli ant (<80% 
compliance) will be counseled regarding the importance of following dosing instructions but not 
withdrawn from the study.  
 
9.3.  Discontinuation criteria for individual subjects  
Discontinued subjects are those who are enrolled in the study and for w hom study treatment is 
terminated prematurely for any reason. The subject is free to withdraw from the study treatment 
and/or study for any reason and at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or 
prejudice.  The investigator is als o free to terminate a subject’s involvement in the study at any time if 
the subject’s clinical condition warrants it.  
Subjects will be discontinued if:  
• Subject experiences a serious or intolerable adverse event  
• Subject has severe disease and has to be int ervened upon based on the imaging tests  
• In the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject is non -compliant with the protocol requirements  
• Subject’s health would be jeopardized by [CONTACT_295484]  
• Subject wishes to withdraw consent  
• Investigator elects to en d the study  
 
 
9.4.  Adverse event reporting guidelines  
 
   9.4.1    Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
study drug, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including  an abnormal laboratory finding), 
 [ADDRESS_360115] (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, 
physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires active intervention  
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
• The abnormality or investigat ional value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]  
 
   9.4.2    Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life threatening (an event in which th e subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe),  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Results in congenital anomaly, or birth d efect,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_295485])  
• Other medically important events  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295460]. These events, 
including those that may result in disability, should also usually be considered serious.  
 
   9.4.3    Criteria for Causal Re lationship to the Study Drug  
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study drugs could not be ruled out."  
 
Causal relationship  
to the study drug  Criteria for causal relationship  
 
Not Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide plausible explanations.  
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable  time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
 [ADDRESS_360116] abnormality, with a  
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals,  and 
which follows a clinically reasonable response on re -administration (re -
challenge) or withdrawal (de -challenge).  
 
   9.4.[ADDRESS_360117] with 3 grades is to be used to measure the severity of adverse events, 
including abnormal clinical laboratory values.  
• Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities  
• Moderate: Affect normal daily activities  
• Severe: Inability to perform daily activities  
 
   9.4.5    Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE), the investigator should submit a report to the IRB  per 
local institutional guidelines  of the date the investigator first becomes aware of the problem as  
per Partners policy.   
 
   9.4.6    Follow -up to Adverse Events  
All adverse events occurring during the study are to be followed up until resolved or judged to be 
no longer clinically significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can be fully 
characterized.  
If during adv erse event follow -up, the adverse event progresses to an "SAE, " or if a subject 
experience  a new SAE, the investigator must immediately report the information to the sponsor.  
 
   9.4.[ADDRESS_360118] menstruation, 
estimated  fertility date, pregnancy result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus , as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE .  
When the outcome of the pregnancy falls u nder the criteria for SAEs [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly (including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAEs. Additional in formation regarding the outcome of a pregnancy (which is categorized as an 
SAE) is mentioned below:  
• "Spontaneous abortion " includes abortion and missed abortion.  
• Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study drug.  
 19 • If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a 
relationship between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as 
"possible " by [CONTACT_093].  
• In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the "normality " of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth.  "Normality " of the miscarried fetus is evaluated by [CONTACT_295486] a congenital anomaly are obtained prior to miscarriage.

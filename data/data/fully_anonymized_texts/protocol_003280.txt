Arm 1  - Ticagrelor,  90 mg twice daily  (one pi[INVESTIGATOR_627126]) + Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg/day . Ticagrelor is the test treatment.  
Arm 2 -  Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , 75 mg/day in the morning and a matching placebo  
in the evening + Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  81 mg/day . Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627127] . 
Participants (Arm1/ Arm2) are required to take the oral  treatment for a total 
of two weeks plus one half day . 
Healthy control participants will be asked to take Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice 
daily (one pi[INVESTIGATOR_627128]) and  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 
mg/day. Open label treatment.  Participants are required to take the oral 
treatment for a total of two weeks  plus one half day . 
Positive controls will not be part of the study intervention.  
Duration of administration  Participants are required to take the daily oral treatment for a total of two 
weeks  plus one half day  (Exclude positive controls) . 
Statistical Methodology  Aim 1.  We will use summary statistics to describe the distribution of the 
data. Post -treatment ADP -induced WBPA value in ohms (Ω) will be the 
primary outcome variable. We will use an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model to compare the treatment effects of ticag relor vs. 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627129]. The primary outcome 
variable will be modeled as the dependent variable. The secondary 
outcome variables, including percenta ge of inhibition in platelet 
aggregation (IPA), residual platelet aggregability ( RPA) , adverse events at 
2-weeks, 1, [ADDRESS_835762]. For 
the exploratory analyses, we will 1) compare proportions of metabolic 
phenotypes of CYP polymorphisms between groups with Fisher’s exact test, 2) correlate WBPA values with cytokines, and drug/metabolite levels, 
and 3) measure two- way interactions between the exploratory markers and 
the study drug on the primary outcome variable.  
Aim 2. Summary statistics will be used to describe data distribution. Two-
sample t-test or Mann- Whitney test will be used to compare markers 
between groups. For the primary outcome, a mixed effects linear model will 
be used to compare mean  change in WBPA  to therapy  between groups. 
The model will have group factor, treatment factor (repeated, pre vs. post), 
and interaction between group and treatment. The pair effect and subject 
effect will be random factors to control for the clustering within matched 
pairs and within each subject. Other confounders except sex and DM will 
be adjusted in the analyses. All available data will be included in the 
analyses; the mixed model can accommodate cases with missing data. 
RPA and adverse events  will be compared as Aim 1 as part of the 
secondary outcomes analyses.

3.1 Disease Background  
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at four-times higher risk of experiencing 
thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than the 
general population, and this risk increases w ith worsening kidney disease.1-4 As a result, 
one in five of the millions of CKD patients in the U.S. is prescribed aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627130] 
P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627131]) to reduce future events.5,[ADDRESS_835763] commonly used oral P2Y12 inhibitor, patients with stages 1 –3 and stages 4– 5 CKD are at, respectively, two-  and four -times higher risk of 
throm botic CV events or death than individuals without CKD.
7,8 Residual platelet 
aggregability (RPA) while on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87237], as determined by [CONTACT_627214] (ADP) induced whole blood platelet aggregation (WBPA) from 
baseline, is a novel modifiable risk factor associated with increased risk for thrombotic CV 
events or death.9,10 Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87236] a prodrug that requires metabolism by [CONTACT_9058] P450 
(CYP) enzyme to become active.9,10 We reported that a higher proportion of patients with 
stages 4– 5 non –dialysis dependent CKD (CKD -ND) demonstrated residual platelet 
aggregability on- clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627132], (56% vs. 8.3%, p=0.01), 
independent of metabolic phenotypes of CYP polymorphisms.[ADDRESS_835764] in WBPA may result from advanced kidney disease and 
may not be completely in hibited with a P2Y12 inhibitor.  Ticagrelor, a newer oral P2Y12  
inhibitor, is an active drug.12 Recent clinical trials in the general population translated this 
favorable pharmacokinetic difference into greater clinical benefit from ticagrelor than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627133] a 15% reduced risk o f future thrombotic CV events.
[ADDRESS_835765] risk for thrombotic CV events.19 Clinical practice 
guidelines remain ambiguous about identifying the preferred oral anti platelet agents (APAs)  for CKD patients but endorse ticagrelor use in “high risk” ACS patients.
20,21 As a 
result, ticagrelor  use is growing exponentially.  It is therefore imperative to establish if 
ticagrelor is able to 1) demonstrate greater antiplatelet effects  than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627134] -ND 
patients and 2) inhibit platelet function in CKD -ND as effectively as in non- CKD individuals; 
it is also important to 3) explore mechanisms to explain the poor response to APAs in CKD 
patients. We hypothesize that CKD -ND patient s treated with ticagrelor will experience 1) 
greater mean changes in platelet function (i.e., greater platelet inhibition) than when treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], but 2) lesser mean changes in platelet function (lesser platelet inhibition) 
than non- CKD control s treated with ticagrelor.  
 
Advanced kidney disease is a special clinical condition with multiple defects in the 
hemostatic pathway that raise serious concerns about the efficacy of tic agrelor in CKD -ND 
patients.
14,[ADDRESS_835766], CKD may cause alterations in platelet surface receptors and impair their 
ability to undergo conformational changes upon activation.15 Because ticagrelor binds 
reversibly to a site on the P2Y12 receptor remote from the ADP -binding site and 
subsequently blocks ADP binding to the receptor via allosteric modulation, binding of the ligand (ticagrelor) to its receptor (P2Y12) and the resultant allosteric modul ation of the 
receptor may be altered in the milieu of kidney disease. Second, ADP -induced platelet 
aggregation may be higher in CKD and may not be completely inhibited by a P2Y12 
inhibitor that acts on this pathway.
11 Finally, CKD may alter CYP enzyme function and 
result in lower levels of a drug or its active metabolite in blood.13 For these reasons, the 
differences between ticagrelor and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627135]: A Mechanistic Study with Non- Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease to Investigate Altered Platelet 
Response to Antiplatelet Therapy

Date: 02/22/2021  Page 10 of 43 CKD -ND patients comparable to those reported in the general population. The current 
proposal will fill this knowledge gap by [CONTACT_627215][INVESTIGATOR_60467] a double- blind, parallel -design randomized controlled trial ( RCT) involving 
CKD -ND patients ( Aim 1). We will also investigate if presence of kidney disease alters 
antiplatelet responses to ticagrelor in CKD -ND patients vs. non- CKD  controls (Aim 2 and 
sub-aims).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_835767] Background  
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_60451] a FDA approved drug.  Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87236] a prodrug, requiring metabolism by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 (especially CYP2C19) to become active (5- thiol metabolite) before 
irreversibly blocking ADP binding to the platelet P2Y12 receptor .23 The requirement for 
multiple steps for a drug to become active may be disadvantageous in CKD because 1) 
genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 result in high inter - and intra- individual variability in 
antiplatelet action and 2) CKD may alter the CYP450 system and affect conversion of a 
prodrug to its activ e metabolite.23,[ADDRESS_835768] -treatment platelet 
aggregability, when treated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259941].11,25 -28 Our preliminary studies 
extended these findings and demonstrated in a prospective trial that a higher proportion of 
non– dialysis dependent stages 4– 5 CKD (CKD -ND) than non- CKD patients had residual 
platelet aggregability, when treated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259941] (56% vs. 8.3%, p=0.01), 
independent of CYP2C19 polymorphisms . Our work generated the hypothesis that there 
may be a baseline defect in the ADP pathway in advanced kidney disease to potentially 
explain the poor efficacy of P2Y12 inhibitors in CKD -ND patients . 
 
Ticagrelor  is a FDA approved drug. Ticagrelor has the most desirable pharmacological 
properties am ong the oral P2Y12 inhibitors.  Ticagrelor and its metabolite AR -C124910XX 
(primarily us ing the CYP3A4) are active.29,[ADDRESS_835769] risk of 
thrombotic CV events. In the subgroup with early -stage CKD (defined as creatinine 
clearance <60 mL/min), use of ticagrelor was associated with a 23% reduction in mortality 
and future CV events.12 This subgroup analysis suggests that ticagrelor may be superior 
to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627136]. Recent studies exploring the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in CKD were limited by [CONTACT_627216], high dropout rates, or failure to enroll patient s with 
advanced CKD -ND (estima ted GFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2).  There are no controlled studies 
to compare ticagrelor and cl opi[INVESTIGATOR_627134] -ND patients.  
 
Clinical practice guidelines emphasize that providers should be aware of treatment strategies to choose newer APAs  other than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627137]. However, the 
guidelines remain ambiguous about the preferred APA in CKD -ND patients. Furthermore, 
guidelines endorse the use of the newer P2Y12 inhibitors for percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCIs ) that are “high- risk” procedures. Because PCIs in CKD -ND patients are 
considered high risk, there has been an exponential rise in ticagrelor prescriptions since 
its approval by [CONTACT_13229] 2011. Therefore, the proposed studies are critical to advancing this understudied field. A well -designed mechanistic study will be the first step to investigate 
antiplatelet efficacy of ticagrel or in these high- risk patients.

Study drug  n Adverse  events  Outcome  
Ticagrelor  [ADDRESS_835770] of the side effects reported i n the two studies may be due to : 
1) Higher doses of ticagrelor  (200 mg twic e daily or 300 mg twice daily);  
2) Prolonged period of therapy  (>14 days);  
3) Cross -over design with repeated drug exposure  (treat with ticagrelor for 10 days, 
washout period of 14 days and then treat again for 10 days).  
 Other large RCTs have reported rare side effects for the products as follows:  
 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627139], all or none of  the side- effects listed below:  
Common side effects (<10%)  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627140], which could happen if you are taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627141]. This study 
requires only  2 weeks’  treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627142].  
Rare side effects (<1%)  are ringing in the ears, breathing problems , swelling and 
allergic problems . Reye’s syndrome (fever, rash, vomiting, headaches and lethargy) 
is also reported, which however, occurs more commonly in children and those w ith 
a known allergy to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
 
 Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627143], all or none of the side- effects listed below:  
Common side effects (<10%)  of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627144] 3.5- 6.1% of 
the patients. Less common side effects are bleeding from stomach in approximately 
2% of the patients and 2.7% of the patients when combined with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. Any bleeding requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_627145] 0.8% of patients on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  
Rare side effects of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (<1%)  are low blood counts  (low white cell count , low 
red cell count, low platelets); damage to liver (hepatitis, liver failure), bleeding in 
brain; bleeding in the eyes (0.05%); breathing problems  such as  pneumonia.  
 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627146]. The risk of bleeding does increase 
minimally as compared to using either drug alone. However, the risk low do to the 
short duration of the treatment  (only 2 weeks).

 Ticagrelor  may cause some, all or none of the side effects  listed below:  
Common side effects  of ticagrelor are bleeding from any site that can occur in up to 
4% of patients. Other reported side effects seen >10% of the time is dyspnea (14%). 
Approximately 1 –10% of patients may develop ECG abnormality, dizziness, nausea, 
and increases in serum creati nine or serum uric acid levels.  
Rare side effects of ticagrelor (<1%) are angioedema, atrioventricular block, 
bradycardia, gout, hypersensitivity, and skin rash. As ticagrelor has an FDA -required 
boxed warning regarding risk factors for bleeding, we are excluding all those patients  
meeting exclusion criteria. In addition, ticagrelor and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627147] P450 liver enzymes, especially CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Therefore, we 
are excluding any patients with liver disease to minimize risks  of bleeding. Neither 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627148].  
 
Potential major drug -drug interactions of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627149] : 
• Antithrombotic drugs, like Ranolazine, Aggrenox and Cilostazol. Taking these 
medicines  with the study drugs could potentially increase risk of bleeding.  
• Non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medicines can reduce the 
function of platelets and cause bleeding complications . Subjects will be asked to do  
not tak e any NSAIDs during the study.  
• Medicines for acid reflux called Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), fish oil, Vitamin E and 
herbal supplements . 
 
Anticipated safety of controls/CKD in our study : Given above reasons, our protocol will 
use safest possible strategy  - lower dose for 14 days without cross over. We anticipate 
lower number of adverse events in the healthy volunteers and CKD . 
 
3.3 Study Rationale  
Of the nearly 13 million patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the U.S., nearly one-
third experience thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events, such as  acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS).4,35-[ADDRESS_835771] growing among chronic diseases, and the number of CKD patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) has increased by 50% in the last 
decade.
4,38 Patients experiencing ACS and/or undergoing PCIs are subsequently 
prescribed the combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 81 mg/day, and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticagrelor) to reduce future CV events. Currently, at least one in five CKD 
patients is prescribed these drugs.  Yet CKD patients continue to have thrombotic CV

involving CKD -ND patients (Aim 1). In addition, we will investigate if kidney disease alters 
the antiplatelet response to ticagrelor in CKD -ND patients vs. controls without CKD (Aim 
2). We will also measure the metabolic phenotypes of CYP2C19/CY P3A4 and drug and 
active metabolite levels, using mass spectrometry, to explore mechanisms responsibl e for 
the poor efficacy of APAs in CKD -ND patients (exploratory aim).  
 
Impact of the proposed study: In summary, the results of this study will be informative 
and move the field forward regardless of whether the hypothesis is proven to be true. 
Completion of the proposed trials will advance the understudied field of platelet dysfunction 
in CKD while elucidating novel mechanisms underlying the poor efficacy of APAs in CKD patients. Most important, it will provide urgently needed data to power future, larger trials to determine if newer P2Y12 inhibitors are efficacious and will improve outcomes in CKD -
ND patients, a group at disproportionately higher risk than the general population for CV 
events, where traditional risk factor modification interventions have f ailed to do so.  
 
4.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
4.1 Aim 1: Determine the mean changes from baseline in ADP -induced whole -blood 
platelet aggregation (WBPA) values and markers of platelet activation and 
inflammation in CKD -ND patients on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627153] -blind fashion.  
4.2 Aim 2: Determine the mean changes from baseline in ADP -induced WBPA values 
and markers of platelet activation and inflammation after treatment with ticagrelor 
plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627154] -ND patients compared with non -CKD controls.  
4.3 Primary Objectives:  
Aim 1 : To d etermine mean changes from baseline in ADP -induced whole blood 
platelet aggregation (WBPA) values and markers of platelet activation in non -
dialysis CKD patients on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627155] a double -blind fashion.  We will randomly assign 54 CKD patients (GFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73m2), stratified by [CONTACT_627219][INVESTIGATOR_248], 81 
mg/day, to receive either ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily, or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 75 mg/day, and 
placebo, for [ADDRESS_835774]-treatment 
WBPA will be the primary outcome variable.  
 
Aim 2 : To determine mean changes from baseline in WBPA values and markers of 
platelet activation and inflammation after treatment with ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627156]-dialysis CKD patients compared with non -CKD controls.  We will recruit 27 non-
CKD controls (GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and no other evidence of kidney damage). The 
post-treatment WBPA  will b e the primary outcome variable.  
 
4.4 Secondary Objectives:  
Aim 1:  The secondary outcomes will include the proportion with IPA, RPA  and 
adverse events ( i.e. bleeding, CV events, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and deaths  etc.) at 
2 weeks, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months between groups.

5.3 Accrual Goal  
Roughly, one in 5 patients with CKD is already on antiplatelet agents; therefore, 4 out of 
every 5 patients will be potential candidates. To complete recruitment of 54 subjects in 13 
months, it is necessary to randomize four subjects over each 4- week interval. If 75% of 
those who are enrolled and sign consent forms come for Visit 1, about 6 subjects need to 
be enrolled/consented every 4 weeks to qualify for randomization. Therefore, nine patients 
will need to be screened every 4 weeks to find six  not taking an oral ant iplatelet agent. If 
we assume a conservative 50% refusal rate, 18 patients will need to be screened every 4 weeks (4/week) for four to be randomized.

Positive controls will have only one visit for blood draw. They will be given $[ADDRESS_835779]  
6.1 Study Drugs  
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_60451] a FDA approved drug.  Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87236] a prodrug, requiring metabolism by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 (especially CYP2C19) to become active (5- thiol metabolite) before 
irreversibly blocking ADP binding to the platelet P2Y12 receptor . 
 
Ticagrelor  is a FDA approved drug. Ticagrelor has the most desirable pharmacological 
properties among the oral P2Y12 inhibitors. Ticagrelor and its metabolite AR -C124910XX 
(primarily using the CYP3A4) are active.  The drug reversibly blocks ADP binding to the 
P2Y12 recept or. In the general population, this pharmacokinetic difference translates into 
greater antiplatelet effects for ticagrelor than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], with reduced inter - and intra-
individual variability.  
 
6.1.1  Dispensing  
For CKD  subjects : Ticagrelor /clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]/placebo will be dispensed by [CONTACT_627223] a double- blind manner using blister pack with morning 
(AM)  and evening  (PM) dosing labels. Each subject will receive open label aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627160]. The blister pack will be labeled appropriately 
with subject ID, IR B number for the study protocol. UAMS research pharmacy will 
put the blister package in a specific second container reporting the administration 
instructio ns for the participant . The study drugs will be dispensed for [ADDRESS_835780] Jain

Intervention for CKD P articipants. Randomization, Blinding and Intervention  Aim 1 . 
Stratified randomization will be used to ensure the balance between two treatments in the 
strata defined by [CONTACT_395149].  All eligible  CKD  patients who provide written informed 
consent will be classified into a particular stratum (diabetics or non- diabetics) and then 
randomized in double- blind fashion to receive either 2 weeks of ticagrelor (90 mg twice 
daily) or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (75 mg/day in the morning, plus a matching placebo once daily at 
night) in a 1:[ADDRESS_835782] to conceal frequency of

7.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1 VISIT  1 (Consent Process and Screening  Procedures)  
7.1.1  Informed Consent (for all subjects)  
CKD subjects.  The medical records of patients will be reviewed to evaluate if they are 
eligible to be part of the study . For subjects enrolled in the study, assessments performed 
for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the assessments  were done before informed consent was obtained.  
Research staff will go over the consent process with the potential CKD subject after their clinical appointment at the renal clinic. If the subject does not have enough time to go over 
the consent process, but he/she is interested in our study, we will provide the subject with 
a printed copy of the ICF and we will perform the consent process on the phone.  
 
Heal thy c ontrol  subjects.  To minimize contact [CONTACT_447694] (COVID -19 
pandemic) , the consent  process and screening questionnaire will be performed on the 
phone. After the phone conversation, research staff will e-mail the consent  form to the 
potential subject  for review  and inform the subjects  that a printed copy of the consent form 
will be provided during the baseline visit for signature. Moreover, subject will be informed 
that during baseline we evaluate their kidney functionalit y to determine eligibility  (blood 
draw and urine collection).  
 Phone consent process will be documented in the process note. Signed consent form will 
be obtained from each subjects enrolled in the study during the screening and/or baseline 
visit.

Patients can be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their own request, 
or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or 
administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be documented and may 
include:  
• Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up permitted);   
• Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
• Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
• Patient  experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;  
• Treating physician judges that continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s 
best interest;  
• Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a serious  adverse event);

Version No.:13  IRB# 227997  
Date: 02/22/2021  Page 27 of 43 8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Definition of Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or n ot related to 
the intervention.  
 
In this study , we will monitor adverse events f rom the changes in blood laboratory 
parameters as recorded in the lab test from the final lab draw or other patient 
reported events.  We will call each subject after 7- [ADDRESS_835806] part of the treatment.  
 
8.3.2  Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of adverse events  will be graded as follows  
Mild:  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
Moderate:  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.  
Severe:  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities 
or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
 
8.3.3  Serious Adverse Events 
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical  occurrence that  meets one or more of the following criteria:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in death.  
 If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is life -threatening (the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in persistent or signi ficant disabili ty or incapacity  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is an important medical event  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment 
of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting 
as a serious adver se event . The event may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definit ion of 
“Serious Adverse Event“.

Date: 02/22/2021  Page 28 of 43 For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.  
 
8.4 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the adverse event . 
 
Step 2: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy . 
 
Attribution categories are as follows:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
Step 3: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event . 
 
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in the current known adverse events . 
 
Step 4 : Determine whether the adverse event is a Serious Adverse Event

2) Related to the research; and 
3) Involves new or increased risks to subjects or others.  
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_835808]’s safety . In most cases, 
the unblinding will be part of managing an SAE, and will be reported with the SAE, however, 
in cases where unblinding was not associated with an SAE, such actions should be 
reported in a timely manner . While there is no regulation governing this timeline, it is 
suggested to use the same timeline requirem ents for  investigator reporting of SAEs.

end of the collection period.  
 
Blood and urine samples  from participants will be transported by [CONTACT_627229] (Bio- Med II ) in [CONTACT_257510] ’s laboratory 
(room #638- 2) where they will be processed for long- term storage.  The samples will be 
transported to the Bio- Med II building using a double container system that will be labeled 
as Biohazard container. Bio- Med II building can be accessed only by [CONTACT_627230]. The freezer is locked and the key will be stored in a separate locked 
room.  
 Blood and urine samples  from participants will be centrifuged, and will be aliquoted in 
cryovials for long- term storage at -80°C. Each cryovial will be labeled only with the unique 
study number.  De-identified DNA extracted from blood sample will be frozen banked in [CONTACT_627248]’s laboratory (room #638- 2) and analyzed at the Pharmacogenomics Lab VA Little 
Rock (G-128). VA sub -award with scope of work is included in  this amendment . 
 
Only authorized staff members will be able to access the protected file that associates the 
assigned unique study number to the identifiers of the participant.  
 
8.8 Assay Methodology  
WBPA. Ten mL of whole blood will be collected in 3.2% sodium citrate (9:1 ratio) for platelet 
aggregation test by [CONTACT_627231] (WB) platelet aggregometry via a 
Chrono- log aggregometer. This instrument uses electrical impedance in whole blood. 
Blood from all subjects will be tested within [ADDRESS_835810]. Jerry Ware Platelet 
laboratory at UAMS BioMed II building, 2
nd floor. Whole blood platelet aggregation induced 
by 2 μg/ml collagen, 10 and 20 μM ADP, 0.5 and 0.25 mM arachidonic acid,  thrombin and 
ristocetin will be tested.  
 
Rationale for using whole blood aggregometry : This is a method developed [ADDRESS_835811] used in laboratory practice to assess platelet function involving 
platelet rich plasma. This method is superior to optical method: a) it is more sensitive and 
faster; b) evaluates platelets in physiological milieu in the presence of red blood cells and 
white blood cells known to affect platelet function and; c) does not require centrifugation 
which resu lts in some platelet injury. The specimen is placed in a plastic cuvette containing 
magnetic stir bar. It is incubated at 37 degree Celsius for 5 minutes in wells prior to testing. 
An AC voltage in millivolt range is applied to the circuit, which  creates s table resistance 
value during equilibrium with the formation of monolayer of platelets covering wires. After 
introducing agonists, platelets aggregate, which increases resistance to electrical flow, 
measured in ohms. ATP secretion is measured using firefly  luciferin -luciferase reaction. 
Whole blood platelet aggregometry method allows larger platelets to be present and can potentially use thrombocytopenic samples and icteric/lipemic/hemolyzed samples. 
Previous studies have used optical aggregometry or multi -plate analyzers and Platelet 
Function Analyzer (PFA) -100 which are sub- optimal for testing and the results may not be 
reproducible.  
 
P-selectin by [CONTACT_46110] : Whole citrate blood will be fixed and mixed with antibodies 
(BD Biosciences) to measure P -selectin expression on the platelet surface by [CONTACT_8315] (UAMS Flow Cytometry Core Facility). P -selectin (CD62P) is a membrane 
glycoprotein stored in platelet granules. Upon platelet activation, granules are released,

Date: 02/22/2021  Page 30 of 43 and P -selectin is expressed on the platelet surface. P -selectin by [CONTACT_329242] a classic 
and specific marker of platelet activation.  
 
Cytokines analyses : Plasma will be frozen at –80 °C. Level s of circulating cytokines will be 
measured on batched frozen samples by [CONTACT_627232] (R 
& D Systems, Catalog # ARY005B). Since studies investigating mechanisms of platelet 
aggregability in CKD patients are limited, and to not  limit our inquiry to just a few cytokines, 
we are using a commercial cytokine array kit that detects 36 human circulating cytokines, 
chemokines and acute phase reactants simultaneously. It includes, but is not limited to, 
plasma interleukin (IL) -1β, IL -6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. 
 
Rationale for Using Multiplex Cytokine Array : Platelet activation is linked to inflammation. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_627186]- 1β, IL -[ADDRESS_835812] not 
been evaluated in the CKD population. Furthermore, some of the circulating cytokines, especially, IL- 6 and TNF -α we re implicated in decreasing metabolism of certain drugs in 
CKD patients.
41 Finally, IL -6 and TNF -α were reported to be predictors of CV events in non-
dialysis CKD patients42,43 but it remains unclear if these cytokines and other unknown 
cytokines explain the poor efficacy of P2Ys in this high risk patient population. Therefore 
we decided to use the multiplex kit.  
 
Drug and metabolite levels : We will measure the trough-  and peak - drug/metabolite levels 
by [CONTACT_627233]. Due to the highly reactive nature of the active thiol 
metabolite of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], it cannot be reliably measured.  We will instead measure both the 
intact drug and the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite (Figure 1). A mixed mode solid 
phase extraction (SPE) plate will be used for processing the plasma samples. Briefly, the 
plasma samples will be diluted in an aqueous buffer and loaded onto the SPE well -plate 
and was hed with a water methanol solution, and finally eluted with 5% NH 4OH in 60:40 
IPA:ACN. The intact clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627187] 322 to 212 transition 
and its carboxylic acid metabolite will use the 308 to 198 transition, both in the positi ve ion 
mode.60 These will be measured using a Thermo Scientific Quantiva triple quadrupole 
mass spectrometer that is coupled to a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC. The system will operate 
at a flow rate of 50 ul/min using a 1mm x 10cm BEH C18 column with 1.[ADDRESS_835813] curve and validated using GLP 
standards.  
 
Rationale for Measurement of Levels of Drugs and Their Metabolites by [CONTACT_565221] : To investigate if the favorable pharmacokineti c profile of ticagrelor over 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627188] -dialysis CKD patients as in the general population, we will 
measure levels of drugs (clopi[INVESTIGATOR_43696]) and metabolites (carboxylic acid metabolite for clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627189] -C124910XX for ticagr elor) using mass spectrometry. 
Phase I and II studies of the two drugs reported achievement of steady state concentrations 
of drug and metabolite concentrations within 2 weeks regardless of loading dose.
23,44 So, 
we should be able to determine levels of drugs and metabolites in 2 weeks.  
 
Rationale for Measuring Trough and Peak Drug and Metabolite Levels : Trough drug and 
metabolite levels at 2 weeks of antiplatelet therapy are stable and accurate compared to 
their peak levels.30,45,46 Therefore, we chose to measure the trough levels. In addition, we 
will measure peak levels 3 hours after the administration of the drug at Visit 2. This will ensure unbiased results and minimize variability.

[CONTACT_2329] m/z 187- >80 and 187 ->[ADDRESS_835814] reported these uremic toxins to be pro- thrombotic,51 there are no controlled 
human studies to investigate their association with changes in platelet function and levels of drug and metabolite. This will be novel to the proposed study.  
 
CYP Polymorphims Measurement by [CONTACT_627236], storage, DNA Extraction, 
Quantification, and Quality Assessment :   
 
Sample collection : 8.5 mL of blood will be collected into PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes, 
which contain a proprietary blend of reagents that both prevents blood coagulation and stabilizes white blood cells. T hese tubes will be stored at - 70degrees C refrigerator at 
Arthur’s lab. All DNA samples will be sent to PAL, G128, Research Service, Little Rock VA 
in a batch where DNA will be  isolated from the tubes using appropriate buffers supplied in 
the PAXgene Blood  DNA Kit.  
 
For DNA isolation , the blood is transferred to processing tubes (supplied already filled 
with cell lysis buffer), and the solution is mixed to lyse red and white blood cells. Cell nuclei 
and mitochondria are pelleted by [CONTACT_7891], washed, and resuspended in digestion buffer. Protein contaminants are removed by [CONTACT_627237] a protease. DNA is 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_627191], washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 
resuspension buffer.  DNA will be extracted from whole- blood using the PAXgene Blood 
DNA System (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  Highly pure genomic  DNA will be  obtained. DNA 
quantity and quality will be ascertained by [CONTACT_627238]™ (Applied Biosystems, 
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with fluorescence detection using an ABI7 900HT Real -
Time Quantitation System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA samples are normalized to 50ng/µl and 
200ng per sample is required for analysis by [CONTACT_20483].  
 
Performing Pharmacogenetic analyses by [CONTACT_20483] :  Each DNA sample will undergo 
whole- genome amplification, enzymatic end- point fragmentation, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 
resuspension and hybridization to microarrays for 20 hours at 48°C according to the 
manufacturer’s procedures (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).  Microarrays used for 
Pharmacogenetics analyses are the Infinium® Human Gloval Screening Arrays V2  
(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) which feature more than 17,220 PGx polymorphisms 
covering all genes listed on the PharGKB and CPIC -17 websites plus 800,000 additional 
markers per sample., After single- base extension and staining, beadchips are scanned 
using the Illumina iScan system and Autoloader2.  Analysis of Pharmacogenetic data :

will not be store for future research. All genetic material will be used only for this study and any left over at the end of the study will be discharged. Banking these samples and health 
information for future use is fundamental for understanding the correlation between the 
kidney functionality and several other diseases.  We can use these samples to correlate 
kidney function/dysfunction with a broad spectrum of diseases in the future.  The plasma 
from the blood and the supernatant collected from the urine samples of the participants will 
be stored in a - 80°C  freezer in [CONTACT_257510]’s laboratory in the Biomedical Building II UAMS 
on the 6th floor.  The Bio- Med II building can be accessed onl y by [CONTACT_627239].  The freezer is locked and the key will be stored in a separate locked room. 
Future use of these samples which is not specifically described here for the current study  
will require additional approval from the IRB or designation by [CONTACT_627240]- human 
subjects research. We are planning to use these samples for research purposes until they 
are completely consumed
. Genetic tests : The DNA sample will be frozen for analyses of 
polymorphisms affecting metabolism of the study drugs.  
 Specimens will be stored indefinitely or until they are used up. If future use is denied or 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_102], best efforts will be made to stop any additional studies and to 
destroy the specimens.  
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Study  Design/Study Endpoints  
Statistical Considerations  Summary statistics will be used to describe the data 
distribution. Median (interquartile range) and mean (SD) will be reported for markers as in 
Aim 1 for both groups (CKD vs. non- CKD) pre - and post -therap y. Two -sample t -test or 
Mann- Whitney test will be used to compare markers between groups at baseline. A mixed 
effects model will be used to compare WBPA (change) to ticagrelor and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627192]. The model will have group factor, ticagrelor  treatment factor (repeated, 
pre vs. post), and interaction between group and treatment. The pair effect and subject 
effect will be random factors to control for the clustering within matched pairs and within 
each subject. Potential confounders (age and BM I) will  be adjusted in the models.  
Differential response to ticagrelor treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_627241] F -test statistics. In an exploratory 
analysis, levels of ticagrelor and  its active metabolite will be compared between groups. 
Finally, two -way interactions between the metabolic phenotypes of CYP3A4 and CKD 
group on WBPA will be investigated.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Sample- size Calculation and Power Considerations. We used baseline measurements of 
WBPA from our previous work. For CKD -ND and non- CKD patients at baseline, we 
reported mean (SD) WBPA of 11.32 (5.14) Ω and 7.67 (3.52) Ω, respectively.  We

to be 2.88 Ω and 2.77 Ω. We used the linear mixed effects model to compare between-
group (CKD vs. non- CKD) differences in ticagrelor treatment effect, where matched pair 
will be a random effect. With a fixed sample size of [ADDRESS_835817] will be 91.3%.  
 
9.3 Data Analyses Plans  
Data analyses plan for Aim 1  
Aim1 Primary Objectives  Analysis Plan . Summary statistics will be used to describe the 
distribution of the data. Median (interquartile range) and mean (plus standard deviation 
[SD]) will be reported for all variables. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be 
used in the primary analysis to compare treatment effects of  ticagrelor vs. clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627193].
[ADDRESS_835818] -treatment ADP -induced WBPA values  in ohms (Ω) will be 
modeled as the dependent variable (the primary outcome measure). Specifically, we will 
use the WBPA values drawn after 3 hours of the drug administration at Visit 2. Baseline 
measurement of WBPA, diabetic status (1-  diabetics; 0- non-diabetics) and a binary 
treatment variable (1- ticagrelor arm; 0- clopi[INVESTIGATOR_627194]) will be included as independent 
variables. The coefficient associated with the treatment variable will be the parameter of 
interest. Under the assumption that there are no signi ficant differences in baseline 
measurements between groups (due to randomization), this coefficient will reflect the mean 
difference in WBPA values (or difference in mean change from baseline) between groups. 
In the case of missing data, we will do a compl ete case analysis and compare estimates 
by [CONTACT_627242]- effects model approach. We will also 
calculate the following secondary outcome measures between the groups  and compare 
between groups by [CONTACT_177610] -square test : 
 
1) Percentage of i nhibition in platelet aggregation (IPA)  is the ratio of the difference 
in baseline and post -treatment values  divided by [CONTACT_627243].  
2) Residual platelet aggregability (RPA)  is defined as those with IPA < 75% on 
treatment.  
3) Pre-specified adverse events at 2- weeks, at 30- days, at 6- months and at 12 -
months including any bleeding (skin bruising, nose bleeds, major bleedings), CV 
events, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_627195] [ADDRESS_835819] correlations between changes in WBPA values in the 
treatment arms and levels of drug and metabolites. We will perform summary statistics of 
cytokine levels. We will correlate ch anges in levels of circulating cytokines before and after 
treatment with changes in WBPA values in the two treatment arms and drug/metabolite 
levels. In addition, we will use one- way ANOVA to analyze interaction of cytokines with 
treatment group to modify IPA. For statistical analysis, we will collapse CYP2C19 groups 
based on metabolic phenotypes based on previous published studies includi ng our 
preliminary work.  Proportions of metabolic phenotypes of CYP polymorphisms will be 
compared between groups with C hi Square or Fisher’s exact test. Two- way interactions 
between the metabolic phenotypes and the study drug on the outcome measure will be 
investigated. Specifically, we will test interaction of poor (vs. wild) and rapid (vs. wild) 
metabolic phenotype of CY P2C19 with the study drug on IPA (Visit 2 from Visit 1). We will 
conduct analyses similar to CYP2C19 for CYP3A4/5 alleles after collapsing them as binary 
variables.

Aim 2 Primary objective Analysis Plan . Summary statistics wi ll be used to describe the 
data distribution. Median (interquartile range) and mean (SD) will be reported for markers 
as in Aim 1 for both groups (CKD vs. non- CKD) pre - and post -therapy. Two- sample t -test 
or Mann- Whitney test will be used to compare marker s between groups at baseline. For 
the primary outcome measure, a mixed effects linear model will be used to compare mean 
change in WBPA to ticagrelor and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_627196]. The model will have 
group factor, ticagrelor treatment factor (repeated, pre vs. post), and interaction between 
group and treatment. The pair effect and subject effect will be random factors to control for 
the clustering within matched pairs and within each subject. Models will be adjusted for 
potential confounders (age and BMI) that  were not used in matching.  Differential response 
to ticagrelor treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_627241] F -test statistics. All available data will be included in 
the analyses; the mixed model can accommodate c ases with incomplete data. Data 
transformations will be employed if needed to meet analysis assumptions.  
 
Aim 2 Secondary Objectives Analysis Plan . Secondary outcomes will be analyzed as 
Aim 1. Summary statistics will be performed. Student’s t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will 
be used to compare continuous and Chi -Square test to compare categorical variables 
between groups. Any two- way interactions  of CYP polymorphisms (present/absent) and 
CKD status on IPA after treatment will be investigated. Similar interactions will be analyzed 
between uremic toxins and CKD status on changes in WBPA values and levels of drug/metabolite.

perform platelet function analysis along with flow cytometry to analyze platelet phenotype 
as already outlined in the protocol for the other two groups.

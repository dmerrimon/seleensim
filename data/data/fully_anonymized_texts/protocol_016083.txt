Summary of Protocol Amendment 2.0 dated 15 November  2017 to Protocol Version 2 .0 dated 9 February 2016  
Rationale for the amendment:  
 Prevent potential lost -to-follow up (LTFU) of subjects for safety collection at the end of study (EOS) visit on Day 
45 by [CONTACT_438788].  
 Increase flexibility for the timing of trial vacci ne administration.

Trial Summary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  2.1 
 Table 2 -a footnote a:  
Trial personnel  will follow U.S. Navy subjects through Day [ADDRESS_556023] early terminates (ET), Day 45 , Day 53 or Day 72 
procedures, as applicable, should be performed.  
Table 2 -a footno te d:  
After written informed consent is obtained within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 1, subse quent 
study procedures including blood draw and randomization may be done. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 
to receive NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or placebo (saline). On Day 1, the subject will receive 
the study dose he/she was randomized to receive. The study d ose will be administered IM in the middle 
1/[ADDRESS_556024] 15 minutes . If the 
investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required by [CONTACT_438789], the trial dose may be administered later during the training period. For subjects in 
Subset A,  . Tthose concomitant required vacc ines administered on Day 1 (the same day as the NoV 
GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or placebo) will b e recorded on the subject’s source documents (by 
[CONTACT_4657], lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]) and subsequently recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). For all subjects enrolled after Subset A, this information will be filed at the site as source 
documentation but not recorded in the eCRF.  
Table 2 -a footnote f:  
Blood will be collected on all subjects once within [ADDRESS_556025]-vaccination on each of Days 8 and 29 and at the end of the AGE  active surveillance period (EOS) in 
order to explore a level of protection. The EOS sera will also provide information on asymptomatic NoV 
illness for those subjects who develo p a 4 -fold or greater rise in anti -NoV antibodies between Day 29 and 
EOS.  
Table 2 -b footnote a:  
During the AGE surveillance period (Day 1 through Day 45  for U.S. Navy, Day  53 for U.S. Air Force, and 
Day 72 for U.S. Marines ), those subjects, who present w ith AGE, will be instructed to record their AGE 
symptoms on the logs and report to the medical clinic for assessment at the next trial visit . Initial AGE 
symptom logs will be given  at trial entry to record AGE symptoms. Subjects will be instructed to retur n 
any subsequent logs and the latest AGE symptom log to the medical clinic at the next trial visit.  
Table 2 -b footnote b:  
For those subjects who present with AGE, a stool specimen and a vomitus specimen (vomitus if available) 
will be collected as soon as  possible after the onset of each new epi[INVESTIGATOR_438761] -PCR testing. If no samples are provided at AGE onset, samples should be obtained as 
soon as possible thereafter. If samples at AGE onset are inadequate ie too small for b oth RT -PCR to 
NoV and co -infection tests, the sample should be prioritized for RT -PCR to NoV and a subsequent 
sample  should be obtained for co -infection testing as soon as possible thereafter. If samples become 
lost, destroyed, damaged or otherwise unavail able for use, AGE onset samples should be repeated as 
soon as possible. After the initial stool specimen is obtained at the onset of AGE; up to  three additional 
stool specimens as available (optional), will be obtained once between [ADDRESS_556026] initially presents with 
vomiting and diarrhea .

Table 2 -c footnote a:  
Trial personnel will follow U.S. Navy subjects through Day [ADDRESS_556028] early terminates (ET), Day 45, 
Day 53 or Day 72 procedures, as applicable, should be performed.  
Section  6.1 This is a Phase 2b, double blind, randomized, multi -site, placebo -controlled, efficacy trial of a 
single dose of the IM NoV vaccine combined with Al(OH) 3 adjuvant compared to a single dose 
of placebo (saline) control . Based on prior incidence rates of AGE over multiple seasons in the 
US Military training installa tions, the estimated sample size for the trial is 2800 -8700 healthy 
subjects aged 18 to 49 years who will be recruited from US military training installations. This 
trial has a case -driven design, with the primary analysis planned after ~ 30 cases of moder ate or 
severe AGE due to infection with genotype -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains represented in 
the vaccine have been confirmed (excluding co -infection with any of three bacterial pathogens, 
Salmonella, Shigella  or Campylobacter). If there are < 30 ca ses (as defined above) at the end of 
the first season  (September through May) , the trial may be continued beyond the end of  May 
the first season , may be stopped, or may be continued for a second season  (September through 
May) . If the accrual of cases (as d efined above) is slower than expected, an interim analysis 
may be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_556029] been accrued. For all enrolled subjects, accrual of additional AGE cases due to NoV 
will continue f or all enrolled subjects until the end of each respective active AGE surveillance 
period  (45 days) . Thereafter, further enrollment of new subjects will be stopped.  
Section  6.3 Trial participation is expected to be from enrollm ent through EOS (trial Day 45 for U.S. Navy 
subjects, trial Day 53 for U.S. Air Force subjects, and trial Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects ) 
Section  7.2 Criterion #15v:  
Abstinence, defined as refraining f rom heterosexual interco urse, i e sexual intercourse with 
risk of conception, during the entire study period.  
Criterion #17:  
If male and sexually active, the subject must be advised not to donate sperm from Day [ADDRESS_556030] dose of trial vaccine.  
Section  7.3 Bullet 2:  
If the investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required 
by [CONTACT_438790], the trial dose may be administered later during the training 
period.  
Section  7.4 Number 3: 
Lost to follow -up: The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact [CONTACT_438791]/or the subject graduated and left the base . Attempts to contact [CONTACT_277363].  
Section  9.1.3  Paragraph 1:  
If the subject is interested to participate, trial staff will review the informed consent form and 
will highlight the key aspects of the trial. The consenting procedure may occur in small groups 
of up to three subjects at once. Notably, this procedure will be handled by [CONTACT_105] -uniformed trial 
staff not involved in the training of the subjects to avoid any feeling of coercion, and also 
include an Ombudsman  [28].  
Section  9.1.4  Individual s who received Receipt of any vaccine s within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 
28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial with the exception of routine 
immunizations as per Military Procedures (see Appendix D). If the investigational trial dose is 
delayed beyond the day the licensed vaccines are given, the trial dose may be subsequently 
administered later during the training period.

Section  9.1.8  Paragraph 1:  
All subjects will have surveillance for AGE disease performed from Day 1 until the end of the 
active AGE disease surveillance period (Day 45 for U.S. Navy subjects, Day 53 for U.S. Air 
Force subjects, or Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects ). 
Paragraph 2:  
Subject s will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease, and a new AGE disease 
symptom log will be given to record AGE disease symptoms until they resolve. Subjects will be 
instructed to return any subsequent and the latest AGE and any subsequent  disease  symptom 
log to the medical clinic trial site at the next trial visit. A convalescent blood specimen for 
serology will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days after the onset of the AGE disease. After 
the initial stool specimen obtained at the onset of AGE d isease: as available , three additional 
stool specimens will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days, once between 21 and 29 days and 
once at end of the acute AGE surveillance period EOS . These follow -on stool specimens will be 
analyzed for NoV by [CONTACT_937] -PCR.  If an AGE event occurs within 7 days prior to the EOS visit 
(Day 45), a convalescent serum sample and a single optional stool sample should be collected 
at the EOS visit. There is no further follow -up for AGE after graduation from recruit 
training at Day 45.

the duration thereof,  taken or received by [CONTACT_177944] 3 months prior to the start of the 
trial are to be recorded on the source do cument and entered onto the Prior and Concomitant 
Medications eCRF. The use of antipyretics and/or analgesic medications within [ADDRESS_556036] be identified and the reason for their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) 
must be described i n the source documents or the eCRF.  
Section  9.1.7  A saliva specimen will be collected once during the trial (at any time pre - or post -vaccination)  
either on Day [ADDRESS_556037] atus or at any 
time (pre - or post -vaccination) during the trial.  
Section  9.1.[ADDRESS_556038] paragraph:  
All subjects will have surveillance for AGE disease performed from Day 1 until the end of the 
active AGE disease surveillance period  (Day 45 for U.S. Navy subjects, Day 53 for U.S. Air 
Force subjects, or Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects). All participants will be given an AGE 
disease symptom log and a thermometer at trial entry within 7 days prior to vaccination or on  
(Day 1 ) and instru cted to record their AGE disease symptoms and report to the medical clinic as 
soon as possible. The subjects will record in the AGE disease symptom log the onset time of 
vomiting and/or diarrhea, their temperature, the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_261635]/or  
diarrhea, and the stop time of vomiting and/or diarrhea to calculate duration of AGE. The 
subjects will also document whether the symptom(s) have had impact on their ability to train. 
The subjects will be given  instructed to use the provided thermometers to measure and record 
their temperature on the AGE disease symptom log. The subjects will be informed that the 
recommended route to take their temperature is oral and instructed to use this route.  At the 
medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to dete rmine if they have an AGE disease that meets 
the work -up definition (see Section 6.1). Subjects who meet the work -up definition will be 
assessed for disease severity and provide a stool specimen (not rectal swabs) and /or vomitus  
specimen for processing and  later detection of NoV by [CONTACT_937] -PCR. Subjects will only provide 
vomitus  specimen if actively vomiting. All initial stool samples for each new onset epi[INVESTIGATOR_438762]: Salmonella , Shigella , and 
Campyloba cter. 
2nd paragraph:  
Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease, and a new AGE disease 
symptom log will be given to record AGE disease symptoms until they resolve. Subjects will be 
instructed to return any subsequent and the latest AGE disease symptom log to the medical 
clinic at the next trial visit. A convalescent blood specimen for serology will be obtained once 
between 7 and 14 days after the onset of the AGE disease. After the initial stool specimen 
obtained at the onset of AGE disease: as available, three additional stool specimens will be 
obtained once between 7 and 14 days, once between 21 and 28 29 days and once at end of the 
acute AGE surveillance period. These follow -on stool specimens will be analyzed for NoV by 
[CONTACT_937]-PCR.  
Section  9.1.10  2nd paragraph:  
All enrolled subjects will have blood drawn once within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 
1 and once  on each of  Days 1, 8, 29 and at the EOS (end of the active AGE surveillance 
period). For thos e subjects who develop AGE during the surveillance period, a single 
convalescent serum specimen will also be obtained once between 7 to 14 days after each new 
onset AGE epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

(injection site: pain, erythema, induration and swelling) and systemic AEs (headache,  fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, vomiting, and diarrhea). In addition, other indicators of safety will be 
collected ( e.g., body temperature). Body temperature will be summarized by [CONTACT_438795].  
Section  13.[ADDRESS_556042] paragraph:  
An interim analysis will be performed on after the first 200 subjects (Subset A) have completed 
the EOS visit, and when  the assay results are completed. The anti -NoV GI.1 and GII.4 VLP 
antibody resp onses at baseline (prior to or on Day 1) and on Day s 1, 8, 29 and EOS, and the 
antibody responses at baseline (prior to or on Day 1) and  on Day s 1 and 29 to adenovirus type 
4, to meningococcal vaccine serogroup A, and to the seasonal influenza vaccine H3 s train, will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_438796]. In 
addition, all available  safety data for these subjects, including solicited AEs and unsolicited 
AEs, will be summarized and provided to the DMC for review . Spec ifically, the interim safety 
and immunogenicity for this subset may be summarized separately as the results become 
available.

Norovirus GI.1/GII.[ADDRESS_556043] the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  13.3 2nd paragraph:  
The average weekly incidence (as percentage of recruits on the base) ove r the winter NoV high 
seasons (October -May) and summer low seasons (June -September) of consultation at the 
medical stations for symptoms of AGE were evaluated for the full trial  period from September 
2011 to September 2014. The expected background rate of NoV GI.1/GII.4 was calculated 
using two three  assumptions. The incidence of NoV over the winter high season is the excess of 
AGE in the winter (first panel in Table 13-a) compared to the summer (second panel in Table 
13-a) and can thus be calculated as the  average weekly AGE incidence during the winter season 
minus the average weekly AGE incidence during the preceding  corresponding  summer season. 
This has been calculated in the last panel in Table 13-a. The second assumption is that 50% of 
the NoV cases are  due to GI.1/GII.4 which  that is compatible with the overall breakdown of the 
NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes identified by [CONTACT_438797] 2011 -2014 time period. The weekly incidence rates 
are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of training) to obtain the incidence rate over training 
and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that all subjects  reporting to the medical 
station are  all moderate or severe AGE cases  are reported to the medical station . 
3rd paragraph:  
The background incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype -specific (GI.1 
and GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co -infection with Salmonella , 
Shigella , or Campylobacter ) is as sumed to be  0.535-1.687% per subject -training period of 
observation based on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned trial sites (Table 13-a). 
Under such attack rate assumptions, approximately 2800 -8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 
ratio to NoV vaccin e and saline placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or 
severe AGE due to NoV infection by [CONTACT_7631] -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains. As this is a 
case-driven trial, subjects will continue to be enrolled and followed through the entire a ctive 
AGE surveillance period until ~ 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to genotype -specific 
(GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, excluding co -infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be 
closed to further enrollment.

Female subjects of childbearing potential ( e.g., non -sterilized, premenopausal female subjects) 
who are sexually active must use adequate contraception (as defined in the informed consent) 
from enrollment  Day [ADDRESS_556044] the choice to receive unblinded treatment information.

Name [CONTACT_790](s):  
[ADDRESS_556051] Name:  
[CONTACT_122727].1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus -Like Particle Vaccine  
Trial Title:  Phase 2b, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy  and 
Immunogenicity of the Intramuscular Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus -like Particle Vaccine in Healthy Adults 
Aged 18 - 49 Years  
IND No.:  [ADDRESS_556052] No.: Not applicable  
Study Identifier:  NOR -211 Phase:  2b Trial Blinding Schema:  Double blind  
Background and Rationale:  
Noroviruses (NoVs) cause an acute debilitating illn ess characterized by [CONTACT_438798]. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are due to NoV 
each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US). NoVs have emerged as an important cause of ou tbreaks of viral gastroenteritis 
worldwide. These outbreaks can occur in all age groups, wherever people gather, and commonly result in significant 
morbidity and mortality, particularly in the very old and very young. In addition, NoV illnesses and outbrea ks exact a 
significant socioeconomic toll on businesses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], schools and other closed settings, such as dormitories and 
military barracks.  
AGE is commonly reported within training and deployed US military populations. Viral -associated AGE is easily 
transmitted from human -to-human and can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_438763]. NoV was found to be a major cause 
of AGE outbreaks and sporadic AGE cases among US military personnel deployed during the Persian Gulf War in 
[ADDRESS_556053] been 
described in European military units deployed to these areas.  
AGE surveillance data collected over multiple seasons (2011 through 2014 ) from the Naval Health Research Center’s 
(NHRC) Enteric Disease Surveillance Program (EDSP) support that NoV was the predominant pathogen identified in 
cases of  AGE among US military  subjects at the Marine Corps Recruit  Depot (MCRD -SD) in San Diego, [LOCATION_004] , 
at the MCRD in Parris Island  (MCRD -PI), South Carolina,  and at the Naval Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes 
(NRTC‐GL), Illinois. AGE due to NoV was originally known as “winter vomiting disease”, and as expected, t he 
highest detection rate of AGE due to NoV was during the months of September to May for both Marine and Navy 
subjects. The estimated population -based inci dence of NoV illness at these training centers is 10 to 35 cases per 1000 
subjects during training (an average of 7.6 weeks) in  this high season (September -May).  
Currently, no vaccine exists for protection against AGE due to NoV. Given the disruptive effec t of AGE due to NoV 
upon military training, readiness and performance, it is important to develop an effective vaccine. [COMPANY_005] has 
conducted two proof of concept NoV vaccine and live oral challenge studies; a monovalent GI.1 VLP vaccine 
delivered as intran asal dry powder followed by [CONTACT_438799].1 oral challenge and a bivalent GI.1/GII.4 
bivalent VLP vaccine delivered by [CONTACT_33813] (IM) injection followed by [CONTACT_438800].[ADDRESS_556054] immunogenicity drove the decision to pursue the IM route of administration . 
The NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine for IM injection to be evaluated in this trial contains both NoV GI.1 an d 
NoV GII.4 VLPs as the antigens formulated with aluminum as aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH) 3) adjuvant. Aluminum 
salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety profile of over six decades. The GI.[ADDRESS_556055] s of a consensus sequence of three GII.4 strains (cVLP). NoV VLPs are non -infectious 
because they do not contain viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).  
Prior safety and immunogenicity data for the NoV vaccine given by [CONTACT_438801]  
1000 adult subjects, evaluated in five [COMPANY_005] clinical trials (LV03 -104, LV03 -105, NOR -107, NOR -201, and 
NOR -210). The NoV vaccine evaluated in these trials either contained both Al(OH) 3 plus monophosphoryl lipid A

 trial withdrawal throughout the active AGE surveillance period.  
The 200 subjects in Subset A and 200 subjects in Subset B will be evaluated for solicited local and solicited systemic 
AEs for 7 day s after dosing using diary cards returned on or after Day 8 and for unsolicited AEs for 28 days after 
dosing by [CONTACT_438802] 29.  
Surveillance for AGE:  
Each enrolled subject will have surveillance for AGE performed from Day 1 until the end of t he active AGE 
surveillance period  (Day 45). Each enrolled participant will be given an AGE symptom log at trial entry (Day 1) and 
instructed to record any AGE symptoms and report to the medical clinic as soon as possible  after onset of AGE 
symptoms . The su bjects will record on the AGE symptom log the onset time of vomiting  and/or  diarrhea, number of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_438764], and the stop time of vomiting and/or diarrhea  to calculate duration  of AGE . Other symptoms 
associated with the AGE epi[INVESTIGATOR_438765]. 
Work -up AGE in ill subjects:  
At the medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to determine if they have an AGE that meets the work -up definition:  
 1 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_53287] 24 hours judged by [CONTACT_438803] g AND/OR;  
 Any diarrhea epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] 3 or greater severity on a 5 -point scale* within 24 hours . 
* Grade 1: fully formed (normal); Grade 2: soft (normal); Grade 3: thick liquid (diarrheal); Grade 4: opaque watery 
(diarrheal); or Grade 5: Rice -water (diarrheal) . 
Subjects who meet the work -up definition will provide a fresh stool specimen and vomitus  specimen (if available) for 
processing and later detection of NoV by [CONTACT_937] -PCR  and be assessed for disease severity . Subjects will receive standard 
of care treatment f or AGE disease  from the site clinic  and additional AGE disease symptom logs will be given to 
record further AGE symptoms until resolution. Subjects will be instructed to return all subsequent AGE symptom logs 
to the trial staff at the next trial visit.  
NoV  AGE case definition in ill subjects:  
A case of NoV AGE is defined as one occurring > [ADDRESS_556056] will be 
considered NoV positive if either specimen is confirmed NoV positive by [CONTACT_937] -PCR.  
Severity of AGE is defined as follows:  
 
Mild   1 to 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128]* within 24 hours AND/OR . 
 3 unformed stools** within 24 hours   
 
Moderate   3 to 5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128]* within 24 hours AND/OR  
 4 to 5 unformed stools** within 24 hours   
 
Severe   6 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128]* within 24 hours AND/O R 
 6 or more unformed stools** within 24 hours AND/OR  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or intravenous rehydration for mild or greater AGE   
*Judged by [CONTACT_438804]; uses the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) for vomiting 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_99320]. 
**For definition purposes, unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity o f diarrhea on a 5 -point scale ( *noted  above).  
Notes : 
 “Within 24 hours” refers to a rolling time period. That is, the criteria will be considered to have been met if occurring during 
any 24 -hour period between the onset and end of AGE symptoms.  
 A new epi[INVESTIGATOR_438766] 5 minutes after the previous one.  
 A new epi[INVESTIGATOR_438767] ‘a trip to the toilet’.

 AGE were evaluated for t he period  from September 2011 to  September  2014. The expected background rate of NoV 
GI.1/GII.4 was calculated using three assumptions.  The incidence of NoV over the winter high season is the excess of 
AGE in the winter compared to the summer and can thus be calculated as the average weekly AGE incidence during 
the winter season minus the average weekly AGE incidence during the correspond ing summer season. The second 
assumption is that 50% of the NoV cases are due to GI.1/GII.4 that is compatible with the overall breakdown of the 
NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes identified by [CONTACT_438806] 2011 -2014 time period. The weekly incidence rates are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of 
training) to obtain the incidence rate over training and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that all 
subjects reporting to the  medical station are moderate or severe AGE  cases . 
The background incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype -specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV 
strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co -infection with  Salmonella , Shigella or Campylobact er) is assumed to  
be 0.5-1.7% per subject -training period of observation based on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned 
trial sites.  Under such attack rate assumptions, approximately 2800 -8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 ratio to NoV 
vaccine and sa line placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to NoV infection by 
[CONTACT_7631] -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains.  As this is a case -driven trial, subjects will continue to be enrolled and 
followed through the entire active AG E surveillance period until ~ 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to 
genotype -specific (GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, excluding co -infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be 
closed to further enrollment.  
Data Monitoring Committee:  
An overall D MC is established to evaluate overall safety of the NoV program on an ongoing basis. The DMC will 
review the safety and immunogenicity results to the NoV vaccine ( Subset A) and the results to the selected 
co-administered vaccines ( Subset A). The overall pr ogram DMC charter is a separate document.

 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background 
Nor
oviruses (NoVs) cause an acute debilitating illness characterized by [CONTACT_438798] [3]. 
Acc
ording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 million cases of acute 
gastroenteritis (AGE) are due to NoV each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US) [4, 5] . NoVs have 
e
merged as an important cause of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. These outbreaks 
can occur in all age groups, wherever people gather, and commonly result in significant morbidity 
and mortality, particularly in the very old and very young [6, 7] . In addition, NoV illnesses and 
outbre
aks exact a significant socioeconomic toll on businesses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], schools and other closed 
settings, such as dormitories and military barracks. 
AGE is commonly reported within training and deployed US military populations [8-13] . 
Viral
-associated AGE is easily transmitted from human- to-human and can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_438770]. NoV was found to be a major cause of AGE outbreaks and 
sporadic AGE cases among US military personnel deployed during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 
[13] as well as coalition forces in Gulf War II, Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in [ADDRESS_556065] been described in European military units deployed to these areas. 
AGE surveillance data collected over multiple seasons (2011 through 2014) from the Naval Health 
Re
search Center’s (NHRC) Enteric Disease Surveillance Program (EDSP) support that NoV was 
the predominant pathogen identified in cases of AGE among US military subjects at the Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD- SD) in Sa n Diego, [LOCATION_004], at the MCRD in Parris Island 
(MCRD-PI), South Carolina, and at the Naval Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes 
(NR
TC‐GL), Illinois. AGE due to NoV was originally known as “winter vomiting disease”, and as 
expected, the highest detection rate of AGE due to NoV was during the months of September to 
May for both Marine and Navy subjects. The estimated population-based incidence of NoV illness 
at these training centers is 10 to 35 cases per 1000 subjects during training (an average of 7.6 
we
eks) in this high season (September-May) [communication from NHRC-EDSP]. 
Currently, no vaccine exists for protection against AGE due to NoV
. Given the disruptive effect of 
AGE due to NoV upon military training, readiness and performance, it is important to develop an 
effective vaccine. [COMPANY_005] has conducted two proof of concept NoV vaccine and live oral challenge 
studies; a monovalent GI.1 VLP vaccine delivered as intranasal dry powder followed by [CONTACT_438812].1 oral challenge [14-18] and a bivalent GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine delivered by 
[CONTACT_438813] (IM) injection followed by [CONTACT_438800].4 oral challenge [19, 20] . Both 
tria
ls showed that the VLP based vaccines reduced severity of AGE due to the challenge viruses. 
The more robust immunogenicity drove the decision to pursue the IM route of administration. 
The NoV
 GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine for IM injection to be evaluated in this trial contains 
both NoV GI
.1 and NoV GII.4 VLPs as the antigens formulated with aluminum as aluminum 
hydroxide (Al(OH) 3) adjuvant. Aluminum salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety profile 
of over six decades [21].  The GI.1 VLP represents a single GI.1 strain and the GII.4 VLP consists

 of a consensus sequence of three GII.4 strains (cVLP). NoV VLPs are non-infectious because they 
do not contain viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). 
Prior safety and immunogenicity data for the NoV vaccine given by [CONTACT_438814] 1000 adult subjects, evaluated in five [COMPANY_005] clinical trials (LV03-104 [20] , 
LV03
-105 [19] , NOR-107, NOR-201, and NOR-210). The NoV vaccine evaluated in these trials 
e
ither contained both Al(OH) 3 plus monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants combined or the 
Al(OH) 3 a
djuvant alone. In clinical trials with the NoV vaccine, a single suspected unexpected 
serious a
dverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) was reported, and to date, no other serious adverse events 
(SAEs) related to the vaccine were reported in these trials. Trial NOR-107 conducted in adults 
aged 18-64 years, a Phase II dosage, adjuvant justification, safety, and immunogenicity trial, 
evaluated 11 vaccine formulations, and showed that the N
oV VLP vaccine adjuvanted with 
aluminum as Al(OH) 3 adjuvant was as immunogenic as the NoV VLP vaccine adjuvanted with 
Al(OH) [ADDRESS_556066] combined. 
Re
fer to the current Investigator Brochure of [COMPANY_005]’s NoV GI.1/GII.[ADDRESS_556067] information and a more detailed review of pre-clinical and clinical studies [22]. 
4.[ADDRESS_556068] demonstrated a consistently high incidence of NoV-related 
illness 
among US military subjects. Moreover, the success of a recent adenovirus vaccine efficacy 
(VE) trial in military subjects further supports the selection of the population for this trial [23]. The 
primary goal of this Phase 2b clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the NoV vaccine against 
modera
te or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV 
strains 
in 2800-[ADDRESS_556069] circulating NoV strains. Data from this trial will 
further
 inform the clinical development plan for Phase 3 of the NoV vaccine. 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International Conference on 
Harmoniza
tion and Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines, 21 Code of Federal 
Re
gulations (CFR) Part 56 & 50, and applicable regulatory requirements.

Work-up for AGE in ill subjects: 
At the medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to determine if they have an AGE that meets the 
work-up definition: 
 1 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_53287] 24 hours judged by [CONTACT_438815]/OR; 
 Any diarrhea epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on a 5-point scale* within 24 hours. 
* Grade 1: full
y formed (normal); Grade 2: soft (normal); Grade 3: thick liquid (diarrheal); 
Grade 4: opaque watery (diarrheal); or Grade 5: Rice-water (diarrheal) (Appendix E] . 
Subjects who meet the work-up definition will provide a fresh stool specimen, and vomitus  
specimen (if available) for processing and later detection of NoV by [CONTACT_937]-PCR and be assessed for 
disease
 severity. Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease from the site 
clinic and additional AGE disease symptom logs will be given to record further AGE symptoms 
until resolution. Subjects will be instructed to return all subsequent AGE symptom logs to the trial 
staff at the next trial visit.

 NoV  AGE case definition in ill subjects: 
 A case of NoV AGE is defined as one occurring > 7 days after immunization until the end 
of the
 active AGE surveillance period. 
 A NoV AGE case is defined as meeting the work-up definition plus a NoV positive stool 
sample or vomitus  sample confirmed by [CONTACT_937]-PCR. In circumstances where both stool and 
vomitus  sa
mples are obtained, the subject will be considered NoV positive if either 
spec
imen is confirmed NoV positive by [CONTACT_937]-PCR. 
Severity of AGE is defined as follows: 
Mild   1 to 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_438771] 24 hours AND/OR . 
 3 unformed stoolsb within 24 hours  
Moderate   3 to 5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_438771] 24 hours AND/OR  
 4 to 5 unformed stoolsb within 24 hours  
Severe   6 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] v omitinga within 24 hours AND/OR  
 6 or more unformed stoolsb within 24 hours AND/OR  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or intravenous rehydration for mild or greater AGE  
(a) Judged by [CONTACT_438804]; uses the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) for vomiting 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
(b) For definition purposes, unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on a 5-point scale (*noted 
above). 
Notes: “Within 24 hours” refers to a rolling time period. That is, the criteria will be considered to have been met if occurring during 
any 24-hour period between the onset and end of AGE symptoms.

Data generated to date with [COMPANY_005]’s NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccin e administered by [CONTACT_438816] I or II studies (LV03-104, NOR -107 and NOR-201) with various 
dosages of antigen (see IB), show that peak immune responses were observed [ADDRESS_556071]. Thus, a single dose 
regimen will be evaluated in the present trial. The aluminum concentration per dose was selected 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_438772] [21] . Aluminum salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety 
prof
ile of over six decades [21] . Each dose (0.5 mL) delivers 15 μg of GI.1 NoV VLP, 50 μg of 
GII.4 NoV VLP (consensus of 3 strains), and 500 μg of aluminum as Al(OH) 3). Approximately

Norovirus GI.1/GII.[ADDRESS_556073] enlisted recruits in basic 
training (Appendix D). The immunogenicity of the co-administration of those vaccines on the 
same da
y with the NoV vaccine has not previously been assessed. The collection of solicited and 
unsolicited symptoms following these vaccinations is consistent with other vaccine evaluation 
studie
s. The se data will be provided to the DMC for their review. (Refer to Section 13.2. Interim 
Anal
ysis) 
Enrollment will begin prior to or during the NoV high season (between September and May). If the 
number of AGE cases due to NoV has not been reached by [CONTACT_438818] (end of May), 
enrollment may be continued if more AGE cases are actively accruing later in the current season, 
may be stopped due to the lower incidence of NoV infection, and/or may be continued the 
following S
eptember (second season). This duration corresponds to the window of time during 
which ~ 30 AGE cases due to NoV (GI.1/GII
.4 or any NoV genogroup GI or GII strain) will occur. 
The AGE disease severity definitions are based on the proceedings of the External Clinical Expert 
meeting: NoV vaccine Phase 3 efficacy trial designs working session (internal document) and 
CTCAE 
Version 4.0 [26]. Unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on 
a

has 
been described [27] and v omitus  specimens will also be evaluated when collected in addition to 
the stool specimens.

6.4 Premature Termination or Suspension of Trial or Investigational Site 
6.4.1
 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Trial 
The
 trial will be completed as planned unless one or more of the following criteria are satisfied that 
require temporary suspension or early termination of the trial. 
 New information or other evaluation regarding the safety or efficacy of the investigational 
vaccine that indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile, such that the risk/benefit is no 
longer acceptable for subjects participating in the trial. 
 Significant deviation from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to 
a
chieve the primary trial objectives or compromises subject safety. 
6.4.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites 
A trial site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the investigator) is 
found in si
gnificant deviation from GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
ade
quate performance of the trial, or as otherwise permitted by [CONTACT_82280].

 7.3 Criteria for Delay of Vaccination and/or Blood Sampling 
After enrollment, subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that warrant a delay in the 
administration of trial vaccination. These situations are listed below. In the event that a subject 
meets a criterion for delay of vaccination, the subject may receive trial vaccination once the 
window for delay has passed as long as the subject is otherwise eligible for trial participation. 
 Subjects who have received antipyretics/analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to the 
int
ended vaccine administration. 
 If the investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required 
by [CONTACT_438790], the trial dose may be administered later during the training 
period. 
7.[ADDRESS_556083] from the trial should be 
recorded in the [electronic] case report form (eCRF) using the following categories. For screen 
failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.14 . 
1. Protocol deviation : The  subject may remain in the trial unless continuation in the trial 
jeopardizes the subject’s health, safety or rights. 
2. Adverse Event: The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because 
c
ontinued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health or the subject is 
unwilling to continue because of the AE. 
3. Lost to follow-up: The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact [CONTACT_438820] d/or the subject graduated and left the base. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_438821]. 
4. Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]: The subject wishes to withdraw from the trial. The reason for 
withdra
wal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal 
and, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded ( ie, withdrawal due 
to an AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category). 
5. Trial terminat ed by [CONTACT_3211]. 
6.
 Pregnancy: Any subject who, despi[INVESTIGATOR_177851], becomes 
pre
gnant during the trial will not receive further trial vaccines. The site should maintain contact 
[CONTACT_185684] a “Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form” as soon as possible. 
In addition, the subject should be followed-up until the birth of the child, or spontaneous or 
voluntary termination; when pregnancy outcome information becomes available, the 
information should be captured using the same form. The subject should be reported as a 
withdrawal from trial and the reason for withdrawal ( eg pregnancy) recorded in detail on the 
Trial Termination” eCRF and subject’ medical records.

trial when the subject meets the trial termination criteria described in Section 7.4. In addition, a 
subject may discontinue his or her participation without giving a reason at any time during the 
trial. Should a subject’s participation be discontinued, the primary criterion for termination must 
be recorded, if possible. Subjects who withdraw from the trial or whose participation is 
discontinue
d should be followed-up for safety. Discontinued or withdrawn subjects will not  be 
replac

site, site inventory, administration and use by [CONTACT_6992], and return to the sponsor or designee. 
Upon receipt of sponsor-supplied vaccine(s), the investigator or designee must verify the contents 
of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantity is correct, the 
trial vaccine is received within the labeled storage conditions ( ie no cold chain break has occurred 
during transit), and is in good condition. If quantity and conditions are acceptable, investigator or 
designee will acknowledge receipt of the shipment by [CONTACT_117540]. 
If 
there are any discrepancies between the packing list and the actual product received, the sponsor 
or desig
nee must be contact[CONTACT_45320]. The packing list should be filed in the 
investig
ator’s essential document file. 
The investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor-supplied vaccines (including 
placebo) received and administered during his or her entire participation in the trial. Proper 
vaccine accountability includes, but is not limited to: 
 Verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory. 

 Verifying that the log is completed for the vaccine dose identification number used to prepare 
ea

log. The following information will be recorded as a minimum: protocol number and title, name [CONTACT_39843], site identifier and number, description of sponsor-supplied vaccine(s), expi[INVESTIGATOR_438774]. The IRT will include all required information as a separate entry for each subject to 
whom sponsor-
supplied vaccine is administered. 
The investigator will be notified of any expi[INVESTIGATOR_438775]. On expi[INVESTIGATOR_4058], the 
site must complete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of expi[INVESTIGATOR_438776]. 
Prior
 to site closure or at appropriate intervals throughout the trial, before any clinical trial 
materials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction, a representative from the 
sponsor or its designee will perform clinical trial material accountability and reconciliation. The 
investigator will retain a copy of the documentation regarding clinical trial material accountability, 
return, and/or destruction, and originals will be sent to the sponsor or designee. 
The pharmacist (or designated individual) at each site will be responsible for vaccine 
accountability and will document receipt, use, return, or destruction. Vaccine accountability 
documenta
tion will be reviewed by [CONTACT_438827].

 Prior to vaccination: 

 Confirm eligibility. Refer to Sections 7.1 and 7.2;  
 Perform a urine or serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child-bearing potential. Refer to 
S
ection  9.1.13. The pregnancy test must be done within [ADDRESS_556104] be repeated by [CONTACT_142009]. 
 If the subject meets all eligibility criteria: 

 Randomize subject. Refer to Section 9.1.5;  

 Collect data on concomitant medications and vaccinations. Refer to Section  9.1.4;  
 Collect blood specimen once within [ADDRESS_556105] using an aseptic 
venipunctur
e technique. Refer to the detailed collection and handling procedures outlined 
in the Manual of Study Procedures. 
 Collect saliva specimen once at any time during the trial from subjects in Subset A. 
 Provide diary cards for subjects in Subsets A and B. 

 Careful training of the subject on how to measure local AEs and body temperature, how to 
c
omplete the diary card and how often to complete the diary card. Training of the subject 
on how to measure an injection site AE should be performed while the subject is under 
observation after vaccination. 
Diary card instructions must include the following: 
 The subject must understand that timely completion of the diary card on a daily basis is a 
c
ritical component of trial participation. The subject should also be instructed to write 
clearly and to complete the diary card in pen. Any corrections to the diary card should 
include a single strikethrough line with a brief explanation for any change and be initialed 
and dated. 
Please note: 
Diary cards will be the only source document allowed for remote collection of solicited local and 
systemic AEs (including body temperature measurements). The following additional rules apply 
to the documentation of safety information collected by [CONTACT_178007]: 
 The Diary Card should be reviewed with the subject.

  No corrections or additions to the diary card will be allowed after it is reviewed with the 
investigator/designee. 
 Any data that is identified as implausible or incorrect, and confirmed by [CONTACT_185698] a 
transcription error should be corrected by [CONTACT_178009] (the correction 
should include a single strikethrough line and should be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_423]). 
 Any blank or illegible fields on the diary card not otherwise corrected as above will be 
mi
ssing in the eCRF. 
 The site must enter all readable entries on the diary card into the eCRF. 
 Any newly described solicited safety information should be added to the diary card by [CONTACT_438832]. Any new unsolicited safety information would be recorded 
in the subject source document as a verbally reported event and therefore captured as an 
AE and recorded in the AE eCRF. 
 Starting on the day of vaccination, the subject will check for specific types of events at the 
inj
ection site (solicited local AEs), any specific generalized symptoms (solicited systemic 
AEs), body temperature (by [CONTACT_438793]), any other symptoms 
or c
hange in the subject’s health status, and any medications taken. The subjects will be 
informed that the recommended route to take their temperature is oral and will be instructed to 
use this route. These solicited AEs and body temperature will be recorded in the diary daily for 
[ADDRESS_556106] in the evening at day’s end. 
 Temperature measurement is to be performed using the thermometer provided by [CONTACT_779]. 
I
f the subject feels unusually hot or cold during the day, the subject should check their 
temperature. If the subject has fever, the highest body temperature observed that day 
should be recorded on the diary card. 
 The measurement of solicited local AEs (erythema, swelling, and induration) is to be 
pe
rformed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_779]. 
 The collection on the diary card of body temperature, solicited local AEs, and solicited 
systemic AEs will continue for a total of [ADDRESS_556107] 15 minutes. Information should be 
re
corded in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. The investigator or delegate will take the 
opportunity to remind the subject how to measure solicited AEs and body temperature as part of 
this obser
vation period. All safety data will be collected in the subject’s source documents. 
 The subject will receive a written reminder of the next planned trial activity. The subject 
will
 be reminded to complete the Diary card daily and to contact [CONTACT_185700] (or as soon as the subject is medically stable)

 10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1
 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a trial vaccine; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with trial 
vac
cine administrati
on. 
An AE
 can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of a trial 
vaccine whether or not it is considered related to the tria l vaccine. 
AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_178029]: 
Mild  Grade 1   Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities. Relieved with or without symptomatic treatment . 
Moderate  Grade 2   Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity. Only 
partially relieved with symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  Grade 3   Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents  normal everyday activities. Not relieved with symptomatic treatment  
10.1.2 Solicited Adverse Events 
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety (Table 10.a) will be measured/collected for 
subje
cts included in Subset A. These will be summarized in the final report under the category 
“soli
cited adverse events” to differentiate them from other AEs which were not solicited. Any 
solicited local or systemic AE observed as continuing on Trial Day 8 will be recorded as an AE on 
the Adve
rse Event eCRF.

that the recommended route to take their temperature is oral and will be instructed to use this route. 
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
1. Results in DEATH. 
2.
 Is LIFE THREATENING. 

 The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
ti
me of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_117495]. 
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY. 
5.
 Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT in the offspring of a subject. 
6.
 Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the following: 

 May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above. 

 May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
thre
atening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
10.2 Causality of AEs 
 Relatedness (causality) to vaccine will also be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. The relationship of 
ea
ch AE, including solicited systemic AEs (solicited local AEs are considered as related) to trial 
vaccine(s) will be assessed using the following categories: 
Related:  There is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE (without determining the extent of probability); there is a reasonable 
possibility that the trial vaccine contributed to the AE.  
Not Related:  There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE; there are other more likely causes and administration of the trial vaccine is 
not suspected to have contributed to the AE.  
10.2.1 Relationship to Trial Procedures 
Relationship (causality) to trial procedures should be determined for all AEs/SAEs. 
The re
lationship should be assessed as “Yes” if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibility that an event is due to a trial procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as “No”.

 10.2.2 Outcome of AEs 
Resolved : The subje ct has fully recovered from the event or the condition has 
returned to the level observed at baseline  
Resolving : The event is improving but the subject is still not fully recovered  
Not resolved : The event is ongoing at the time of reporting and the subje ct has still not 
recovered  
Resolved with sequelae : As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 
disability/incapacity ( eg became blind, deaf or paralysed)  
Fatal:  The subject died due to the event. If the subject died due to othe r circumstances 
than the event, the outcome of the event per se should be stated otherwise ( eg 
Not Resolved or Resolving ) 
Unknown:  If outcome is not known or not reported.  
10.[ADDRESS_556113] occurrence generally may: 
 Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition. Intermittent 
e
vents for pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered as AEs. 
 Necessitate therapeutic intervention. 
 Require an invasive diagnostic procedure. 
 Require vaccine discontinuation or a change in concomitant medication. 

 Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_109307]. 
Dia
gnoses vs. signs and symptoms: 
 Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
a
bnormal laboratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded appropriately as AEs. 
Worsening of AEs: 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after starting administration of 
the 
trial vaccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition ( eg, “worsening 
of…”). 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in trial 
va
ccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition ( eg, “worsening of…”).

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 Changes in severity of AEs: 
 If the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE, the event should be captured once with 
the ma
ximum severity recorded. 
Preplanned surgeries or procedures: 
 Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
infor
med consent are not considered AEs. Complications resulting from any planned surgery 
should be reported as AEs. 
Elec
tive surgeries or procedures: 
 Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
shoul
d not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the  subject’s source documents. 
Compl
ications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs. 
10.4 Procedures 
10.4.1
 Collection and Reporting of AEs 
Any unsolicited AEs (see Section s 9.1.12 and 10.1.1) for 28 days after the vaccination (including 
the day
 of vaccination) will be collected on or after Day [ADDRESS_556114]'s medical records. 
All AEs, whether considered related with the use of the trial vaccine or not, must be monitored 
until symptoms subside and an
y abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline, or until 
there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full 
pathol
ogist’s report should be supplied, if possible. All findings must be reported on an AE eCRF 
or SAE form, as necessary. Reporting of SAEs and AEs that led to trial withdrawal from Day 29 
onwards w
ill be spontaneous or retrospectively collected at the end of the active AGE disease 
surveillance period. 
The following information will be documented for each event: 
 Reported term for the AE. 
 Start and end  date. 
 Serious (Y/N ). 
 Severity. 
 Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_177873] (relationship) between the event and administration of 
trial 
vaccine(s) (“related” or “not related”). 
 I nvestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_177873] (relationship) to trial procedure(s), including the details 
of the suspected procedure.

  [If multiple doses] Action taken with the trial treatment (trial vaccine). 
 Outcome of event. 
10.4.2
 Collection and Reporting of Solicited AEs 
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety will be recorded on diary cards by [CONTACT_438836] A and B for 7 days after the vaccination (including the day of vaccination) and 
will be recorded on the “Local and Systemic Reactions” eCRF, as appropriate. Any solicited local 
or systemic AE observed as continuing on trial Day 8 will be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the 
AE eCRF. Any solicited local or systemic AE that resolved before Day 8 but recurred at a later 
time ( ie, is discontinuous), will be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the AE eCRF. 
Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria must be entered as an AE on the AE 
eCRF: 
 Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead the subject to withdraw from the trial. 
 Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead to the subject being withdrawn from the trial by [CONTACT_941] 
i
nvestigator. 
 Solicited local and systemic AEs that otherwise meet the definition of an SAE (see 
Section  10.1.3)  
10.4.[ADDRESS_556115] is 
administered the trial vaccine (Day 1) up to the end of the active AGE disease surveillance period 
(at Day 45). 
For all subjects, SAE reporting will be collected at the clinic visits on Days 8, 29, and EOS. Any 
ongoing SAEs at the end of the active AGE disease surveillance period will be followed in the 
electronic health databases and personnel medical records of those subjects who remain active in 
the military. 
SAEs should be reported according to the following procedure: 
A sponsor SAE form that is part of the Investigator Site File must be completed, in English,  and 
signe
d by [CONTACT_174375] [ADDRESS_556116] onset or notification of the event. 
The information should be completed as fully as possible but contain, at a minimum: 
 A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious. 

 Subject identification number. 
 Investigator’s name. 
 Name [CONTACT_178090](s) – if no unblinding is necessary, in a blinded way. 
 Causality assessment.

Norovirus GI.1/GII.[ADDRESS_556117](s) in the list provided to each site. All findings in subjects 
ex
periencing SAEs must also be reported in the subject's medical records. In case of death, a full 
pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible 
10.[ADDRESS_556118] report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should complete a follow-up SAE form or provide other written documentation and 
fax it immediately within 24 hours of receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1672] 
(eg, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the sponsor. 
All SAE
s should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or until 
otherwise
 explained. The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for 
the initial report. Ongoing SAEs at the end of trial visit will be followed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_438779]’s electronic health databases and personnel medical records. 
10.5.3 S
afety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities 
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for reporting to regulatory authorities, including 
investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) a
nd any other applicable SAEs reported up to the end of the active AGE disease 
surveillance period, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the trial is  
conduc
ted. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_556119] be reported to the sponsor. These SAEs 
will 
be processed by [CONTACT_456]’s Pharmacovigilance Department. Instructions for how to submit

 12.0 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_347328]. 
AEs, SAEs, medical history, and concurrent conditions will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (system organ class (SOC), High Level Group 
Term (
HLGT), High Level Term (HLT), Low Level Term (LLT), Preferred Term ( PT), and their 
corresponding descriptive terms). Drugs will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug Dictionary. 
12.1 Electronic CRFs (eCRF) 
C
ompleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an informed consent. 
The sponsor or its designee will supply investigative sites with access to eCRFs. The sponsor will 
make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the e CRF . These eCRFs are used to 
transmi
t the information collected in the performance of this trial to the sponsor and regulatory 
authorit
ies. eCRFs must be completed in English. 
After completion of 
the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by [CONTACT_174376] (or designees) and will be answered by [CONTACT_779]. 
Corrections to eCRFs are recorded in an audit trail that captures the old information, the new 
information, identification of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, 
and the reason for change. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_177876]. Furthermore, the investigator must retain 
full responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all data entered on the eCRFs. 
eC
RFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptability at the trial site during periodic visits by 
[CONTACT_55752]. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review a subject’s medical and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438780]. The completed eCRFs are 
the sole prop
erty of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmental health or regulatory authorities, 
without written permission of the sponsor. 
12.[ADDRESS_556120] Retention 
The
 investigator agrees to keep the records stipulated in Section 12.0  and those documents that 
include (but are not limited to) the trial-specific documents, the identification log of all 
participating subjects, medical records. Temporary media such as thermal sensitive paper should 
be c

 compatible with the overall breakdown of the NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes 
identified by [CONTACT_438838] 2011-2014 
time period. The weekly incidence rates are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of training) to 
obtain the incidence rate over training and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that 
all
 subjects reporting to the medical station are moderate or severe AGE cases. 
The ba
ckground incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype-specific (GI.1 
and GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co-infection with Salmonella , 
Shigella or Campylobacter ) is assumed to be  0.5-1.7% per subject-training period of observation 
base
d on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned trial sites. Under such attack rate 
assumptions, approximately 2800-8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 ratio to NoV vaccine and 
sa
line placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to NoV 
infec
tion by [CONTACT_7631]-specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains. As this is a case-driven trial, subjects 
will continue 
to be enrolled and followed through the entire active AGE surveillance period until ~ 
30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to genotype-specific (GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, 
excluding co-infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be closed to further enrollment.

 14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
14.1 Trial-Site Monitoring Visits 
Moni
toring visits to the trial site will be made periodically during the trial to ensure that all aspects 
of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data recorded 
on the e CRF s. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. The 
investigator and institution guarantee access to source documents by [CONTACT_3552] 
(CRO) and by [CONTACT_4186]. 
All aspects of the trial and its documentation will be subject to review by [CONTACT_36613] 
(as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s Binder, 
investigational trial dose, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, 
documentation of subject authorization to use personal health information (if separate from the 
informed consent forms), and review of e CRF s and associated source documents. It is important 
that the investigator and other trial personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
14.[ADDRESS_556124] to trial subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviation from protocol-specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the Responsible 
Medical Officer (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There 
will be no exemptions (a prospective approved deviation) from the inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
14.[ADDRESS_556125] the site in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, 
where
 the trial doses are stored and prepared, and any other facility used during the trial. In 
addit
ion, there is the possibility that this trial may be inspected by [CONTACT_17513], including 
those of for
eign governments ( eg, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the United 
Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Pharmaceuticals and 
Medical Devices Agency of Japan). If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_63224] a regulatory 
body
, the sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator and institution guarantee 
access for quality assurance auditors to all trial documents as described in Section 14.1.

Norovirus GI.1/GII.[ADDRESS_556126] for the individual participants ( ie, subje cts) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the trial according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her 
conduc
t in accordance with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in  Appendix A.  
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requirements for informed consent and investigator responsibilities. 
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval 
I
RBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable local or region al requirements of 
each participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and titles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has direct participation in this trial, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting 
must also be obtained. Those US sites unwilling to provide names and titles of all members due to 
privacy and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide Assurance 
Number or comparable number assigned by [CONTACT_9092]. 
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, a copy of 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or advertisements 
and other documents required by [CONTACT_1763], must be submitted to a 
central or local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the protocol and 
subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of the trial ( ie, before shipment of the sponsor-supplied Vaccine or trial specific 
scre
ening activity). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the trial by [CONTACT_1764], number, 
and version date; identify versions of other documents ( eg, informed consent form) reviewed; and 
state the a
pproval date. The sponsor will notify the site once the sponsor has confirmed the 
adequacy of site regulatory documentation and, when applicable, the sponsor has received 
permission from the competent authority to begin the trial. Until the site receives notification no 
protocol ac
tivities, including screening may occur. 
Sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_1765]. This may include 
notific
ation to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent 
form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by [CONTACT_1766], local safety reporting requirements, 
reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the trial at intervals specified by [CONTACT_438839], and submission of the investigator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All 
IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to the 
sponsor or its designee. 
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participation. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by [CONTACT_4197].

applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal health information for purposes of 
conducting the trial. The informed consent form and the subject information sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the trial, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the 
date informed consent are given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the 
partic
ipant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and 
without pre
judice to his or her further medical care. 
The investigator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
informed consent form and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved by [CONTACT_39821]. 
The infor
med consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_4186]. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally acceptable representative may 
provide such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
The subject must be given ample opportunity to: (1) inquire about details of the trial and (2) decide 
whether or not to participate in the trial. If the subject determines he or she will participate in the 
trial
, then the informed consent form and subject authorization form (if applicable) must be signed 
and dated by [CONTACT_185714]. The 
subje
ct should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black 
ballpoint ink. The investigator must also sign and date the informed consent form and subject 
authorization (if applicable) at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the trial ; 
however, the sponsor may allow a designee of the investigator to sign to the extent permitted by 
[CONTACT_1289]. 
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject information sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medica

by [CONTACT_1763], limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, 
and subject initials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique 
identification number. 
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requires the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives from any 
regulatory authority ( eg, FDA, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, 
Pha

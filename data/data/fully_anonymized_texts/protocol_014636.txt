I
ntroduction and Background: Laparoscopic general surgery is the mainstay of treatment for 
benign biliary disease, including symptomatic gallstones. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is 
generally considered less painful than open surgery, pain is one of the reasons for delayed discharge and overnight admission after outpatient surgery. To optimize same day discharge, patients are routinely prescribed narcotic pain medication. There has been a dramatic rise in prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_214649], with a major contributor being the diversion of excess, unused prescriptions.

uring the last two decades, there has been an increase in the implementation of Enhanced 
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways, which includes a focus on multimodal pain management. This component allows for the optimization of patient recovery and may assist with the reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_14076].  
W
e plan to assess the impact of implementing a new standardized multimodal pain care bundle 
on postoperative pain control and patient satisfaction for elective, outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures.  
P
rimary Objective: We aim to assess whether implementation of a multimodal pre -, intra-, and 
postoperative enhanced recovery bundle can result in the decrease of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_214651].  
S
econdary Objective: We will also assess patient satisfaction with the overall quality of pain 
management after the procedure and patient function in the first and second postoperative weeks. Patient -reported average pain level in the first 7 postoperative days; patient satisfaction with the 
overall quality of pain management after operation; patient ability to return to daily activities and work in the first and second postoperative weeks; phone call to clinic secondary to pain; return to the ED secondary to pain, return to the clinic secondary to pain; if prescription is filled, morphine equivalents utilized by [CONTACT_214658]: Prospective, co hort study

Met
hods : 
Patients who undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or emergent/urgent laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy discharged within 24 hours will be included. We plan to review 25 patients in the pre -intervention cohort and 100 patients for the intervention. 
 
 The intervention involves the implementation of patient education; healthcare provider education (surgeons, anesthetists, residents, nurse practitioners, and nurses); and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative multimodal analgesia with opi[INVESTIGATOR_214653]. Patients are to receive verbal and written education on expectations surrounding pain and discomfort after the procedure, instructions on optimal use of multimodal analgesic medications, and c ontact 
information of the provider team if pain is not controlled. Healthcare providers, including surgeons, anesthetists, residents, nurse practitioners, and nurses will be educated in large group formats (divisional rounds, nursing meetings) and through email. Education will focus on understanding the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_187481], multimodal analgesic strategies, and supporting patient/caregiver expectations.   Patients will receive a preoperative multimodal oral pain regimen of ibuprofen 800mg, acetaminophen 1000mg, and pregabalin 75 mg in the Short Procedure Unit (SPU) administered by [CONTACT_41207].   Intraoperatively, the anesthesiologist will minimize opi[INVESTIGATOR_214654]. We will follow along with the agreed upon PONV interventions.   The surgeon will inject local anesthesia into the trocar sites prior to insertion of the trocars. The anesthesiologist will administer ketorolac 30 mg IV at the end of the case, once confirmed with surgeon that it is appropriate based on difficulty of case .  
 In the PACU, the patient’s pain will be assessed at one hour and two hours postoperatively by [CONTACT_84768].  
 Upon discharge, patient will receive detailed instructions on how to utilize ibuprofen and acetaminophen postoperatively for [ADDRESS_257914] if the pain is not well- controlled. A 
prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg tid x 21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_214655]  1,000 mg qid x 28 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. The patient will receive a phone call at POD 1 and POD 7 from a nurse/student and a bri ef survey will be administered to assess pain, return to daily activity, and 
return to work. The patient will follow -up in the clinic at POD 14. At this time, the patient will 
complete an SF -12 assessment in the clinic waiting room and pain will be assesse d by [CONTACT_37040]. A final follow -up call will be made at 30 -days postoperatively by [CONTACT_174520]/student to 
assess pain, return to daily activity and work.  
 If patient’s pain is not well- controlled on prescribed regimen, second line treatment can be 
Tramadol 50 m g q6 hours x 8 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (40 morphine mg equivalents) or oxycodone 5 mg q8 hours x 
6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (45 morphine mg equivalents).

Women/Minorities/Children : All patients who undergo an elective laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy within the eligible time frame are to be included, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity  
 
Human Subjects : Active patient enrollment is needed. There are no risks to the patients 
included in this study.  
 Data Safety : Data input will be via a dedicated encrypted server. Only key personnel will have 
access to patient identifiers. Local patient identifiers will be stored securely. Data will only be shared via encrypted networks. This will facilitate patient data entry at different time points by [CONTACT_214660] d ifferent team members to 
ensure accuracy of data collection.  
 Statistics Analysis Plan:  
 Data Collection. Demographic, clinical, and perioperative variables were collected by [CONTACT_214661], sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, smoking status, history of substance abuse, procedure, technique (open, laparoscopic, or robotic), whether the minimally invasive inguinal repair was trans -abdominal pre -peritoneal (TA PP) or totally extra -peritoneal (TEP), length of 
procedure, estimated blood loss, total intravenous fluid given during the procedure, total local anesthetic given during the procedure, total intraoperative morphine milliequivalents administered, length of stay after procedure, and patient -reported pain scores at 1 hour after the 
procedure and at discharge. Postoperative Follow -up Visits

Outcomes. Outcome variables were obtained by [CONTACT_214662]/or by 
[CONTACT_214663] a brief telephone survey (intended for internal use only) which was administered by [CONTACT_214664] 14 days after discharge (Figure S1). Outcomes of interest included: total morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) in the post -
anesthesia care unit (PACU), patient -reported to tal MMEs after discharge, and patient -reported 
average pain scores and satisfaction scores after discharge. Satisfaction scores were on a scale of 
1 to 10 with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied. Additionally, 
number of calls t o the surgeon’s office with a complaint of pain and number of pain medication 
refills prescribed were recorded for 30 days following the procedure. For MME calculations, patients were asked how many pi[INVESTIGATOR_214657].  
 Statistical Analysis. Chi -square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to compare 
categorical and continuous variables, respectively. For all comparisons t wo-sided statistical 
significance was set a priori at p<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP 17.1 (Statacorp, College Station, TX).

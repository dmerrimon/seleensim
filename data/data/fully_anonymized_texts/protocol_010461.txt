 1.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Study Synopsis  
The purpose of the  study  is to assess the utility of combined, simultaneous  positron 
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), collectively 
called PET -MR, in assessing response to neoadjuvant radiation therapy in the 
treatment of high grade sarcomas.  Adult patients with potentially curable high 
grade sarcomas that are being treated at UNC with neoadjuvant radiation therapy 
followed by [CONTACT_756155].  Patients who are being treated for potentially curable high 
grade sarcomas with neoadjuvant radiation therapy followed by [CONTACT_756156] -treatment, mid -treatment, and post -treatment PET/MR 
and the response to treatment will be  assessed at mid -treatment and post -treatment 
time points by [CONTACT_756157] 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F -FDG)  avidity  from PET .   Patients will then underg o 
curative intent resection .  Their pathology will be  reviewed for treatment effect as  
assessed by [CONTACT_756158],  size, and  resection margins. Patients will be  
followed and assessed for recurrence.  
 
This study  is designed  to provide  preliminary  information on the  progression of 
tumor size and FDG avidity during and after treatment  in [ADDRESS_1034828] 
positive gross or microscopic margins.  Of those who are treated with complete 
resections, a large proportion will recur locally.   Radiation has been shown to 
improve the rate of complete resection, and impr ove local control rates. Neoadjuvant 
radiation has even been shown to improve 3 year overall survival in high grade extremity sarcomas. The utility of radiation in the treatment of sarcomas has been shown in multiple studies.  Still, utilization of adjuvan t and neoadjuvant radiation in 
the [LOCATION_002] remains low.   This is partially related to the large discrepancy 
within subtypes of sarcomas and varied response to radiation among different grades of sarcoma within the same subtype.  The underutilization of neoadjuvant radiation 
LCCC  XXXX  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_756143], PhD   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
6  
 is also partly in due to some controversy about which patients should undergo 
neoadjuvant radiation as opposed to adjuvant radiation versus no radiation at all.  
  PET/CT and MRI are two modalities that are utilized in the diagnosis , treatment, and 
follow up of extremity soft tissue and retroperitoneal sarcomas.   PET activity has 
been shown to correspond with treatment response in many tumor types. MR has a specific advantage in imaging of soft tissues which is especially important i n 
extremity and retroperitoneal sarcomas.   An integrated PET/MR system has the 
potential benefit of reducing patient time, and expenditures, as well as avoiding the ionizing radiation associated with CT.   Further the integrated system has the potential 
for greater anatomical detail in the context of FDG activity .  The University of North 
Carolina  leads in the utilization of neoadjuvant radiation for sarcoma and has one of 
the few combined PET -MR imaging systems in the US . 
  There exists a need to identify those patients with high grade sarcomas who will 
benefit from neoadjuvant radiation therapy.  This will enable us to focus our 
resources on delivering effective radiation therapy to those patients who will benefit from them and minimize the associated risks  and consequences of radiation in those 
patients who will not benefit from them and allow those patients to move quickly to curative intent surgery.  
 
1.3 Purpose and  Rationale  
This is a  prospective  study  of the use  of combined PET- MR [1-7] for assessment 
of response to neoadjuvant radiation therapy in high- grade sarcomas .  There are no 
prior studies evaluating combined, simultaneous PET -MR for this purpose, 
although studies indicate that PET, at a mid -treatment time point, is predictive of 
response to neoadjuva nt chemotherapy in sarcomas [ 8] and that PET and MRI, 
acquired separately, are correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a post -treatment time point [ 9].  These studies suggest our guiding hypothesis: that 
simultaneous PET and MRI, acquired a t a mid -treatment time point, provide 
image -based quantitative measures that are associated with and predict  response 
to neoadjuvant radiation therapy in high- grade sarcomas.  If so, in the future, 
application of PET -MRI at mid -treatment may be used to det ermine the course of 
treatment for patients at this stage, whether to continue neoadjuvant therapy, or to spare time, expense, and radiation dose for nonresponders.  
 
We propose that a PET/MR study at the midpoint of radiation treatment will 
accurately pred ict which patients will respond to neoadjuvant radiation 
therapy.   We will enroll patients with high -grade sarcomas as identified by 
[CONTACT_756159].   The standard of care for these patients is to receive MRI scans at pre-
treatment and post -treatment time points.  Patients in our study  will receive their 
standard pre - and post -treatment imaging in the form of PET/MR, with PET 
conducted simultaneously wit h MRI, and within the context of the study they will 
also receive one additional PET/MR at the end of the second week of 
therapy.   These patients will then receive curative intent surgery and be followed 
LCCC  XXXX

UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
7  
 in the usual fashion and assessed for local and/or distant recurrent disease.   The 
pathology will be assessed for completeness of resection and percent of necrosis.  
On the basis of pathology, patients will be classified as responsive or non-responsive to therapy.  Quantitative measures from PET and MRI wil l be 
computed: the change in PET tumor -mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and 
tumor size as assessed by [CONTACT_9268], from pre - to post -treatment, and from pre - to mid -
treatment.  The image -based quantitative measures will be correlated with the 
pathology outcome s to evaluate predictability of the image measures for treatment 
response.  Patients will be followed with the intent of further correlating image measures with clinical outcomes.

All patients will undergo a gadolinium  enhanced  MRI  with simultaneous  
acquisition  of [18F] Fludeoxyglucose Positron Emission  Tomography  (FDG  F18- 
PET) at the three time points noted.  18F- FDG  is a positron- emitting  
radiopharmaceutical used for diagnostic  purposes.   It is a glucose analog  that 
concentrates  in cells relying  upon glucose as  an energy  source 
or in cells  whose reliance  on glucose increases  under pathophysiological 
conditions.  Diabetic patients  may  need stabilization  of blood glucose levels on  
the day before  and on the day of administration  of FDG  F18. 
 
Injection  of gadolinium contrast agent  will be  performed  in the  usual  manner and  
images  simultaneously obtained wi th MRI.   Patients will have fasted  for at least [ADDRESS_1034838] an 8 ounce glass  of water  prior to drug

 administration.  Whenever  possible,  patients should take the following  precautions  
for 12 hours  after injection: used toilets should be  flushed  several  times after each 
use, and hands  should be  washed  thoroughly.   If blood, urine  or feces  soil clothing, 
the clothing  should be  washed  separately.  
 
Each patient will be imaged at three time points as noted. For each visit, patients  
will be scheduled for PET -MRI imaging at Marsico Hall and will receive imaging -
day instructions from the study coordinator.  The study coordinator will meet th e 
patient at the imaging facility and escort them to the imaging suite.   Women  of 
childbearing  potential  will undergo repeat  urine  pregnancy  test within 7 days prior  
to each  PET/MRI.  
 
Patients  will be  paid $[ADDRESS_1034839] ([ADDRESS_1034840]-treatment)  PET-MRI scan. The patient may  be withdrawn  from  the study  
prior  to this point if any  of the  following apply:  
 
• Inter-current  illness  prevents  completion of  imaging  studies  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  prevents  completion  of imaging  studies  
• Patient  decides  to withdraw from  the study, OR  
• General  or specific changes  in the  patient’s condition render  the 
patient  unacceptable for completion  of study  in the  judgment  of the 
investigator.

Emotional Distress  
Emotional distress is possible during MRI.  Technologists will ask subjects, before 
injection, if they are claustrophobic. Also, technologists will do their best to help comfort any subject who is claustrophobic but chooses to continue, by [CONTACT_2329] a cloth over their eyes or a fan  providing cool air to the subject. Technologists will hand 
subjects a squeeze ball alarm and instruct them to use it in case of any discomfort. 
The technologist will also inform the subject that he/she is free to stop at any time, 
for any reason.

 Radiati on 
Radiation: The PET/MRI scans will expose study participants to controlled 
amounts of limited radiation.  The total dose of radiation from these tests is not anticipated to cause any adverse effects of any significance over that which they may experience over their standard of care diagnostic imaging and subsequent 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   Patients enrolled in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_756145].  The amount of risk to this estimated dose will be  equated to the annual radiation exposure limit for 
radiation workers in the informed consent.  This radiation exposure involves a small risk and is necessary to obtain the information desired.  
 This research study involves exposure to radiation from radiotracer used for PET/MR scan. The radiation dose subjects will receive in this study is 1.32 rem for each scan for a total of 3.96 rem for the full set of three scans. For comparison, a person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 r em per year 
from natural background sources. The radiation dose that subjects will receive in this study is equivalent to the radiation exposure that everyone receives in 13.2 years from natural background radiation for participants completing three scans. For comparison, the people who work with radiation (radiation workers)  are 
allowed to receive a radiation dose of 5 rem per year. The amount of radiation exposure received in this study is equal to 79 % of  the annual radiation exposure 
limit for radiation  workers.  This radiation exposure involves only a small risk and 
is necessary to obtain the research information desired. The radiation exposure described here is what subjects will get from this research study only. It does not include any exposure subje cts may have received or will receive from other tests 
outside of this study that are a part of their medical care.
 
 
FDG  
Information about FDG  F18 was obtained from  the Prescribing Information  
(August  5 2004);  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/  . 
According  to this document , reviews  of the oncology  literature  did not reveal  
reported  adverse reactions  when  using  18F-FDG  as a diagnostic in conjunction with 
PET.   In a subset (n=42) of a safety  database of epi[INVESTIGATOR_188415]  (n=374), 4 patients  
had transient  hypotension, 6 had  hypo - or hyperglycemia and  3 had  transient  
increases  in alkaline  phosphatase.  
 
Gadolinium  
An extremely rare disease called Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) is associated with the use of gadolinium contrast agents in patients with chronic severe renal insufficiency or renal dysfunction due to hepato -renal syndrome or in 
the peri -operative liv er transplantation period.  Exclusion criteria for this study are 
in compliance with the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory statements, and patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min will be excluded from this study.  
 As part of the MRl procedure subjects may receive a dye called gadolinium. Gadolinium makes it easier to see details on the MRI pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. If subjects have any 
LCCC  XXXX  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_756143], PhD   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
13  
 problems with their kidneys, they may be at risk for a condition called Nephrogenic 
Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) or Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy. NSF has been reported to occur between [ADDRESS_1034843] even died from this. Signs and symptoms of NSF may include: burning, swelling, hardening  or tightening of 
the skin, blood vessels and internal organs (heart, lungs, live; yellow spots on the white part of the eyes; joint swelling and stiffness; pain in the hip bones or ribs; muscle weakness.  
 Subjects’ study doctor will check how well their k idneys work before they are given 
gadolinium. Depending on how well their kidneys work, they may be given a reduced dose or they may not be able to take gadolinium at all. NSF has not been reported in people with normal kidneys.  
 
6.3 Unanticipated  Problems  
 
6.3.1 Definition  
As defined  by [CONTACT_11604]’s  IRB, unanticipated problems involving  risks to study  subjects  
refers  to any  incident, experience,  or outcome that: 
• Is unexpected (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency)  given  (a) the 
research  procedures  that are described  in the  protocol -related documents,  
such as the IRB-approved research  protocol and informed consent  
document;  and (b) the characteristics  of the  subject population being  
studied;  
• Is related  or possibly  related to a  subject’s  participation in the research;  
and 
• Suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others at a greater  risk of  harm  
(including  physical,  psychological, economic, or social  harm)  related  to the  
research  than was  previously  known or recognized.

7.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
 
7.1 Study Design/Study  Endpoints  
The purpose of the study is to assess the utility of combined, simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), collectively called PET -MR, in assessing response to neoadjuvant radiation therapy i n the 
treatment of high grade sarcomas.   The overall design is to image patients with PET -
MR at three time points, pre -treatment, mid -treatment, and post -treatment, and 
correlate quantitative measures from imaging with results of pathology to determine if the mid -treatment PET -MR scan provides information that predicts response to 
radiation therapy.  The primary endpoint is to quantify the association between 
LCCC  XXXX  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_756143], PhD   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
14  
 pathology determination of response/nonresponse and image metrics from PET at 
midtreatment.  Exploratory aims will address the development of a prediction model for response mid -treatment change in  PET and MR, and will evaluate the use of 
combined PET and MR metrics for prediction compared to each metric alone.  
 Patients will be identified at the Multidisciplinary Sarcoma Board at UNC. Patients 
will be high -grade sarcoma patients that are to be treated with neoadjuvant radiation 
therapy followed by [CONTACT_681451].  Once patient identification occurs, the 
patient will be assessed for the  study via the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
mentioned above. The patient will then be approached by [CONTACT_21114], the sarcoma 
nurse navigator, the radiation oncologist, the surgeon, or a member of their team and the study protocol explained and all ri sks outlined. If the patient provides infor med 
consent the patient will be enrolled.  Demographic data such as patient age, gender, 
comorbidities, and previous treatments, etc. will be collected. Tumor characteristics such as tumor subtype, grade, Ki -[ADDRESS_1034845] protected, secured 
server, and all physical documentation will be stored in a locked cabinet.  All data 
will be collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators.  
 
Patient s will then be scheduled for a pre -treatment PET/MR and proceed to 
neoadjuvant radiation therapy per the direction of the radiation oncologist.  At the 
end of the second week of radiation therapy the patient will undergo a mid- treatment 
PET/MR. The patient will the complete their radiation therapy.   Four weeks after 
radiation therapy the patient will undergo a post -treatment PET/MR, and proceed for 
curative intent surgery at [ADDRESS_1034846] sequences, and the Dixon PET -MR attenuation -correction 
sequence.  
 
The PET/MRs at each time point will be evaluated by [CONTACT_756160], the FDG activity as measured by [CONTACT_20150] -maximum and tumor -mean 
standard uptake values (SUVs), the presence or absence of invasion to adjacent organs, and the presence or absence of metastatic o r multifocal disease.   PET images 
will be evaluated with aligned anatomical MRI for guidance as well as determination of the tumor margins for computation of tumor -mean SUV.  
 
The UNC surgeons will record the resectability of the tumor, and the gross 
appear ance of the resection (R0 -grossly negative, R2- grossly positive), as well as 
any evidence of metastatic disease, presence or absence of invasion to surrounding organs, or multifocal disease.  The PET/MRs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_756161], the FDG activity as measured by [CONTACT_756162], 
LCCC  XXXX  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_756143], PhD   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
[ADDRESS_1034847] specialized in sarcoma as to the degree of necrosis (none, <10%, 10-50%, 51- 90%, >90%, 100%), status of margins (R0- negative margins, R1 - 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_756146], R2 – grossly positive margins), the presence and 
absence and number of affected lymp h node involvement if applicable, and presence 
or absence of invasion to adjacent organs.  Again, all data will be stored on a secured, 
password protected server. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1034848] for 
a difference in change scores between response groups at a given time point (for example, 
mid-treatment change from pre- treatment) we will utilize the non -parametric Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum test.  An advantage of using this nonparamet ric method is that the effect size is expressed 
in probabilistic terms, since the difference scores have been transformed into ranks, the 
statistical comparisons take place in this space, and the magnitude and variability of the 
difference scores are not n eeded. This means the power and sample si ze for each  time point’s 
difference scores will be the same.  
 
 Let X = x 1, x2, …. x n represent a sample of size n difference scores  for 
responders  and Y = y 1, y2, …. Y n represent a sample of size n difference scores  
non-responders . Now let p  = P(X>Y ), or the probability that a di fference score in

Please note that we could just as easily frame the probability p = P(Y>X).  
Intuitivel y, one can see that a p=0.5 would mean that either X>Y and Y > X would 
be equally likely. This p would be the measure of the nonparametric or distribution-
free effect size. The Wilcoxon signed -rank method tes ts the null hypothesis that the 
distributions of  the two samples are equal  , which corresponds to a p=0.5.

 volume) will be compounded for all patients.  Differen ce scores including the 
fractional change from pre- treatment to mid -treatment (early response) and the 
fractional change from pre- treatment to post- treatment (late response) will be 
computed for all quantities.  Subjects will be classified into responders and non-
responders on the basis of degree of necrosis (>90% necrosis = good response; 
<90% necrosis = poor response).  Median, range, mean, and variance of each image measure will be computed for each response group.  Differences in all quantitative 
measures between  the response groups will be assessed with the non- parametric 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and correlations between quantitative measures will be determined using the non- parametric Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and 
Pearson product -moment correlation coefficient.   To develop a predictive model  
for early response , we will train a logistic regression classifier on the binary 
response data utilizing various PET SUV and MRI -based imaging measures (in 
terms of change from pre -treatment to mid -treatment) as covariates.  A ll subsets 
selection with BIC will be used to determine the best combination of PET and MRI imaging measures to predict binary response, and empi[INVESTIGATOR_756147]- one-out cross validation and Receiver -Oper ating -
Characteristic (ROC) curves ,(evaluated as to the area under the ROC curve) will be computed.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1034853]  (IRB)  Approval  and Consent  
It is expected  that the IRB will have the proper  representation  and function in 
accordance with federally  mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the  
consent  form  and protocol. 
 
In obtaining  and documenting  informed consent, the investigator  should comply  
with the  applicable regulatory  requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical  
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles  that have their origin  in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki.  
 
Before  recruitment  and enrollment onto this study,  the patient will be given  a full 
explanation of the study  and will be  given  the opportunity  to review  the consent  
form.  Each  consent  form  must include  all the relevant  elements  currently  required  
by [CONTACT_756163].  Once this essential  
information  has been  provided to the patient  and the  investigator  is assured  that the 
LCCC  XXXX

 patient  understands  the implications  of participating  in the  study, the patient  will 
be asked  to give  consent to participate in the  study  by [CONTACT_2960]  a IRB-appro ved 
consent  form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s  participation in the  trial, the written  informed consent  form  
should be  signed and personally  dated  by [CONTACT_756164].

used throughout  the study  in the data analysis .  The study coordinator will have the 
key to relate the patient’s true name [CONTACT_756169], and will coordinate the 
acquisition and de -identification of relevant clinical patient data so that study 
personnel not directly involved in patient care will not have access to any personally identifiable information.  The study coordinator will secure all information related to pa tient identifiers on a restricted -access, password -protected computer.  
 
All patients must be registered  with a study  coordinator  at the University  of North  
Carolina  Biomedical Research Imaging Center  before  enrollment  in the  study.  The 
Study Coordinator will verify that the patient meets all criteria to participate in the 
study before registration.

 8.4.2 Single Patient/Subject  Exceptions  
Any request  to enroll a  single  subject who does  not meet  all the  eligibility  criteria  
of this study  requires  the approval  of the  UNC  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_756149].  
 
8.4.3 Other  Protocol  Deviations/Violations  
According  to UNC’s  IRB, a protocol  deviation is any unplanned variance  from  an 
IRB approved protocol  that: 
• Is generally  noted or recognized  after  it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect  on the risks  to research  participants  
• Has no substantive effect  on the scientific integrity  of the research  plan 
or the value  of the data  collected  
• Did not result  from  willful or knowing  misconduct on the  part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol  variance is considered a violation  if the variance meets  
any of the following  criteria:  
• Has harmed  or increased  the risk of harm  to one  or more  research  
participants.  
• Has damaged  the scientific integrity  of the  data collected  for the study.  
• Results  from  willful or knowing  misconduct  on the  part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates  serious or  continuing  noncompliance  with federal  
regulations,  State  laws,  or University  policies.  
 
If a deviation or  violation  occurs  please follow the  guidelines  below:  
 
Protocol  Deviations: UNC personnel  will record  the deviation  in OnCore®  (or 
other  appropriate  database set up for  the study), and report  to any sponsor or data 
and safety  monitoring  committee  in accordance with their  policies.  Deviations  
should be  summarized  and reported to the  IRB at the time of  continuing  review.  
 
Protocol  Violations: Violations should be  reported  by [CONTACT_756166]  
(1) week  of the  investigator becoming  aware of the event  using  the same IRB online  
mechanism  used to report  Unanticipated  Problems.  
 
Unanticipated  Problems:  
Any events  that meet  the criteria  for “Unanticipated  Problems”  as defined  by 
[CONTACT_11604]’s  IRB (see section  6.3.1)  must be  reported  by [CONTACT_756167]’s  web -based reporting  system.

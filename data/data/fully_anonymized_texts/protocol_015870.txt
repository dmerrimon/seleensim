Background  
In the next decade, there will be a doubling of older Veterans for whom the VA has a 
requirement to provide long -term care. The Veteran’s Health Administration Office of 
Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) is seeking to preserve Veteran independence in the 
community through the Veteran -Directed Home and Community -Based Services Program 
(VD-HCBS) . VD-HCBS is a person -centered consume r-directed program that provides 
Veterans the opportunity to self -direct their long -term services and supports (LTSS) and 
continue to live independently at home. GEC is planning to expand VD -HCBS to an 
additional [ADDRESS_1236147] a mixed -method s 
evaluation of the Veteran and Caregiver experience with the VD -HCBS program, and 
identify implementation factors that help facilitate successful program rollout and 
administration.   
 
Objectives  
This study will  1) examine the  Veteran experience with VD -HCBS by [CONTACT_883555], unmet needs, and quality of life and b) interviewing Veterans to 
capture the experience in their own words; 2) Understand the effect of VD -HCBS on 
Caregiver wellbeing  through phone surveys aligned with the Caregiver Support Program 
and 3) improve the process of future VD -HCBS implementation by [CONTACT_883556] -HCBS.    
 
Methods  
There are three primary methods for this proposal request:  a secondary analysis of 
operations data related to VD -HCBS, a telephone survey with VD -HCBS caregivers  and 
semi -structured qualitative interviews with Veterans  or Caregivers  and VD -HCBS program 
coordinators. For the secondary data an alyses, we will obtain survey data from Veterans 
through a Data Use Agreement with the VA Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC).  
This operational data  set is collected through the VD -HCBS program and the VA -CARES 
program as part of routine care. Th is data will allow us to conduct analyses on Veteran 
satisfaction, needs (met and unmet) and quality of life .. A telephone survey will be 
conducted with VD -HCBS caregivers to understand their experience as a car egiver in the 
VD-HCBS program. Additionally, qualitative interviews will be conducted with Veterans 
selected at random regarding their experience with the VD -HCBS program and how the 
program is meeting their needs. In addition, qualitative interviews will be conducted  with 
VA based and ADNA based coo rdinators of the VD -HCBS program  to gain insight into th e 
implementation of the program and will help identify facilitators and barriers  that impact 
implementation of VD -HCBS for VAMCs and ADNAs . 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236148] of the VD-HCBS program  and provide  key insights into 
the implementation and effectiveness of this program. This evaluation may provide 
insight to VA policymakers and VA care providers  that helps them  ensure that community 
based LTSS options are adequately adminis tered  and help refine policies regarding the 
mission and operations of VD -HCBS to align with VHA and GEC goals.

2.0 Introduction  
 
In the next decade, the number of older high priority (P1a) Veterans will double. The VA has a 
statutory obligation to purchase or provide institutional care to all P1a Veterans1. At a cost of 
$110,000 per Veteran per year for institutional care, the ability of the VA system to honor its 
statutory obligations will be challenged with current re sources. As stated by [CONTACT_941] 2013 Office of 
the Inspector General report, 2 there is a rapid need to rebalance the focus from institutional 
programs to non -institutional programs. In FY1 4, VA’s Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care 
(GEC) spent 74% of its bud get on institutional care and 26% on non -institutional long -term 
services and supports (LTSS).3 For comparison, state Medicaid programs, which are under a 
statutory obligation to provide institutional care, devote the majority (51%) of LTSS spending to 
non-institutional care.[ADDRESS_1236150] developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dynamic system of LTSS that shifts the delivery of long -term care (LTC) 
from institutions to the community.  
 
As part of this rebalancing plan, GEC ha s implemented many innovative programs to postpone 
or prevent institutionalization.5,6 Recognizing the need to increase home and community -based 
services (HCBS) utilization for high -need Veterans and following the reported success of the 
Cash and Counselin g Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE),7,8 GEC leadership implemented a 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236151] their care thereby [CONTACT_883557]: Veteran -Directed Home and Community Based 
Services ( VD-HCBS). In 2008, a partnership was formed between VA and the Administration for 
Community Living (ACL) to implement the VD -HCBS program, capi[INVESTIGATOR_883534]’s Aging and Disability Network Agencies ( ADNAs) 
and the VHA’s commitment and resources. Through this partnership, VAMCs purchase VD -HCBS 
care management from ADNAs on behalf of Veterans. GEC is planning an expansion of VD -HCBS 
to an additional [ADDRESS_1236152] described in the protocol  is an evaluation of the VD -HCBS program. Like 
the participant -directed programs developed for Medicaid programs  (i.e. Money follows the 
Patient, or Cash and Counseling) , 8,[ADDRESS_1236153] to stay 
out of the workforce to care for the Veteran. Allotted funds may also be spent on supplies, 
home modifications, and/or adaptive equipment not available through other VA programs.  
 
ADNAs  play a key role in identifying Veteran’s needs, coordinati ng Veteran services, financial 
reporting, and coordinating with VA. An ADNA coordinator works with the Veteran to 1) 
develop a person -centered plan for the Veteran’s care, 2) identify risks to Veterans’ health and 
safety and include in the plan how Veterans and their caregivers can mitigate those risks, 3) 
monitor spending and service utilization and 4) provide ongoing options counseling and support 
to Veterans. In addition, the Veteran (or appointed representative) an d the ADNA 
representative work closely with a Financial Management Service (FMS) to ma nage 
employment taxes and insurance and process payroll and timesheets. The ADNA bills the VA for 
their services and oversight of VD -HCBS recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
Previous VD -HCBS E valuations.  
In an evaluation of the VD -HCBS conducted by [CONTACT_883558]’s National Resource Center for 
Participant -Directed Services (NRCPDS), survey responses from VD -HCBS Coordinators at 
VAMCs indicated that VD -HCBS is filling a niche for Veterans at ri sk of nursing home 
placement.10 The survey results further pointed out that, for many, collaboration between 
VAMCs and ADNAs has been enhanced by [CONTACT_883559]; but in some cases, these 
partnerships were complicated and difficult. The evaluation report su ggests that role 
clarification and coordination efforts were critical to maximize the roles of the VA and ADNA. In 
complementary work conducted by [CONTACT_883560] (LTSS COIN), the majority of VD -HCBS coord inators at ADNAs interviewed suggest that 
the experience of collaborating with VAMCs was positive and interviews identified several key 
mechanisms for facilitating a successful partnership (e.g., including frequent communication, 
training, designated VAMC staff personnel, and active involvement of the VAMC).11 Veterans 
Version 04/23/2018  
 7 currently enrolled in VD -HCBS who participated in the NRCPDS’ qualitative “Voice of Veterans” 
study called the program “life changing.” While the Veterans interviewed said they would 
recommen d VD -HCBS, they also made a number of suggestions to improve the program. 
Preliminary analysis of these data reveals program implementation issues from the perspective 
of users, as well as concern about consistency across programs, access for more Veterans , and 
sustainability of VD -HCBS.  
 
Importance of Caregiving in maintaining Veteran Independence.  Because Veterans eligible for 
VD-HCBS are vulnerable with functional deficits and significant caregiving needs, the caregiver 
is an indispensable partner in mai ntaining community independence. The emotional, physical, 
and financial tolls of informal caregiving are well documented in the civilian12-[ADDRESS_1236154] of VD -HCBS on Caregivers merits attention. 
Previous literature has suggested that consumer directed programs like VD -HCBS benefits 
consumers (see, for example, Tilly, et al.19) and Careg ivers.20-22 Caregiver benefits include 
decreased worry, physical, and financial strain, along with the ability to enjoy respi[INVESTIGATOR_883535].23, 24 
Focus groups with 23 Caregivers of Veterans enrolled in VD -HCBS were conducted by [CONTACT_883561]. Analysis of these focus groups 
revealed major sources of stress and elucidated mechanisms behind stress relief and support 
experienced in VD -HCBS. For example, participants commented on the program’s ability to 
enable Vetera ns to remain home, provide stress relief, and afford spousal Caregivers more time 
with their Veteran loved one spent as a “couple” resulting in reciprocal, mutual benefits. While 
the Voices of Veterans study was the first to include VD -HCBS Caregivers, the re has been no 
other work, to date, that has specifically evaluated the impact of the VD -HCBS program on 
Caregivers as measured by [CONTACT_883562] -being.  
 
SIGNIFICANCE  
Knowledge to be gained.  Proponents of VD -HCBS suggest that expansion of this program could 
be one promising solution to meet the increased need for LTSS while containing costs and 
promoting Veteran -centered care. In addition, it provides an innovative approach to HCBS 
delivery t o Veterans living in rural areas or  far from VAMCs. Several VAMCs have documented 
the success of their programs both in terms of Veterans’ satisfaction and reduced NH 
utilization, 25-27 However, uptake of the program varies greatly across the country: only  51 
VAMCs offer VD -HCBS and the numbers of Veterans enrolled at each site range from one to 
100+. There has been no formal evaluation of implementation or effectiveness of the program 
and therefore the evaluation we are proposing is significant because it will be the first major 
evaluation of the effect and implementation of the VD -HCBS program.  
 
Impact on Veterans and the VA.  Veterans enrolled in VD -HCBS represent a vulnerable 
population, with most having functional or cognitive deficits, needing >[ADDRESS_1236155] of $110,000 per Veteran per year for long -
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236156] in preserving V eteran independence in the community. As 
a result, VD -HCBS has tremendous opportunity to improve the fiscal outlook of GEC’s LTSS 
while delivering the highest level of Veteran -centered care. This proposed VD -HCBS evaluation 
leverages the utilization analys is of PEPReC, by [CONTACT_883563] a comprehensive view of the value of VD -HCBS to all 
stakeholders.  
 
Alignment with VA Priorities.  VD-HCBS expansion is consistent with the VA and GEC Mission 
and V ision. Importantly, VD -HCBS highlights the efforts of GEC to rebalance toward home and 
community -based services (HCBS) as required by [CONTACT_883564]. Access to HCBS is the priority goal of 
both the VA Secretary and the VA Undersecretary for Health (USH). Because VD-HCBS is built on 
a participant -directed, patient -centered framework, the program is consistent with improving 
the Veteran Experience (VA Secretary Priority #1; USH Priority #2). The expansion of VD -HCBS, a 
best practice in HCBS (USH Priority #3), enhanc es strategic partnerships (VA Secretary Priority 
#5 & USH Priority #4) and builds a culture of improvement (VA Secretary Priority #4) in a high 
performing network (VA USH Priority #4). Evaluation of VD -HCBS aligns with the “MyVA” 
initiative which is Vetera n-centric and objectives to provide access to consistent programs 
throughout the VHA system.28 
 
INNOVATION  
The large -scale expansion of VD -HCBS presents an unparalleled opportunity to understand and 
measure change in the VA. In concert with the outcomes of VD -HCBS, our implementation 
evaluation will provide insight into GEC programs at VAMCs (educating GEC lead ers), but also 
other VACO program offices looking at implementation . With the diverse team assembled and 
the comprehensive evaluation proposed, we will produce evidence to inform VA program 
implementation and dissemination, a critical component of the VA’s  priorities to develop high -
performing, highly -reliable, and consistent networks. Through collaborations with GEC, PEPReC, 
ACL, and NRCPDS, we seek to leverage the investment in VD -HCBS to describe the value of 
participant -based programming within VA and t he nation. The findings from this study will have 
implications for future VA -Community partnerships, and can be informative for the 
organizations providing this contracting service as well as for the providers enrolling in the 
network.  
 
The individual comp onents of our evaluation are innovative. Large scale measurement of 
Veteran independence, unmet needs, and satisfaction of a large program is unique in the VA. 
Additionally, including mixed methods will allow a comprehensive understanding of how 
Veterans a re impacted by [CONTACT_883565] -HCBS. The inclusion of the Caregiver survey results will provide a 
first look at how this program may enable Veterans to remain in their homes through improving 
Caregiver well -being.  
 
3.0 Objectives  
 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236157] of the VD -HCBS program on Veterans and their 
Caregivers while simultaneously gathering information on its delivery and implementation.  
 
Specific  Objectives:  
 
 
Objective 1 : To describe the impact of VD -HCBS on Veterans’ satisfaction, unmet need 
for services, quality of life, and independence. Using mixed methods, this objective will 
provide a comprehensive view of the value of the VD -HCBS program to vulnerable 
Veterans and c reate a model system for describing the value of GEC programs.   
 
Hypothesis: Our working hypothesis is that Veterans participating in the VD -
HCBS program will experience improvements in satisfaction, unmet need for 
services, quality of life, and feelings of independence compared to before their 
participation in the program.   
 
Objective 2:  To understand the effect of VD -HCBS on Caregivers’ well -being. As Veterans 
lose function, Caregivers are critical to community living. We will condu ct a telephone 
survey with VD -HCBS cargivers to compare Caregivers’ financial strain, depressive 
symptoms, caregiving stress, health status, and positive caregiver experiences to a 
propensity matched population to determine the impact of the VD -HCBS program on 
Caregivers.  
  
Hypothesis: Our working hypothesis is that Caregivers of Veterans participating 
in VD -HCBS will experience reductions in financial strain, depressive symptoms 
and caregiving stress, and overall improvements in their health and caregiver 
experiences.  
 
Objecti ve 3 : To examine the implementation of the VD -HCBS program expansion. VD -
HCBS is a complex program in a complex VAMC environment. Utilizing constructs from 
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and a published 
typology from the Expe rt Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC)  project , 
we will interview VA and ADNA VD -HCBS coordinators to systematically identify 
common contextual factors and implementation strategies.   
 
This proposed VD -HCBS evaluation leverages the information that will be obtained by [CONTACT_883566] a 
comprehensive view of the value of VD -HCBS. Additionally, the large -scale expansion of VD -
HCBS presents an unparalleled opportun ity to understand and measure change in the VA. In 
concert with the outcomes of VD -HCBS, our implementation evaluation will be critical to 
determining how the program was executed. With the diverse team assembled and the 
comprehensive evaluation proposed, we will produce evidence to inform VA program 
implementation and dissemination, a critical component of the VA’s priorities to develop high -
performing, highly -reliable, and consistent networks. Through collaborations with our 
Version 04/23/2018  
 10 operation partners we seek to leverage the investment in VD -HCBS to describe the value of 
participant -based programming within VA and the nation.

5.0 Study Procedures  
 
Objective 1 –  
The purpose of Objective [ADDRESS_1236160] of the VD -HCBS program on 
similar outcomes for Veterans using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method 
design30. The quantitative methodology (Objective 1 a) will be a secondary data analysis 
of the  ADNA assessments . These data will  be obtained via a Data Use Agreement (DUA) 
with the VHA Office of Ge riatrics and Extended Care. These assessments contain surveys 
that are administered at each Veteran’s initial in -home visit, and quarterly thereafter as 
part of the  national roll -out and operation of the VD -HCBS program . PHI is included in 
this data set in cluding  name, social security numbe r, and  date of birth ., address, phone 
number, email (if available), and caregiver contact [CONTACT_3031].  All secondary survey 
data will be stored on the restricted access Providence VA research server, in a 
restricted folder in accordance with VA policy.   
For t he qualitative aim (Objective 1 b), we will be conducting semi -structured telephone 
interviews with a random sample of Ve terans (n=64)  newly enrolled to VD HCBS (to 
include the sites involved in the roll out and all other sites with VD HCBS) to gain further 
insight into the ways in which the VD -HCBS program has impacted their lives. Veterans 
will be interviewed at two time points  in [ADDRESS_1236161]  their caregiver and invite them to share their own experiences with the 
program.  These interviews will be recorded for transcription purposes. Participants will 
be sent an information consent sheet, however c onsent for the interviews and the 
recording wi ll be acquired verbally  as detailed in the interview guides . Following the 
completion of the interviews and the transcription, the interviews  will be coded  as 
described in the data analysis section.    
Recruitment Methods :  
All quantitative data will be obtained from the data owner s (VHA Office  of GEC) , 
following an approved Data Use Agreement in accordance with VHA policy.   As 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236162] operations , the ADNA meets with the Veteran initially and every 
90 days thereafter.  During these meetings it is customary for the ADNA to ask 
about current services, as well as, unmet needs and satisfaction with the 
program.   
The VD -HCBS program currently enrolls ~825 new Veterans annually at existing 
sites.  At newly opened sites, there is a period between readiness review and 
enrolling Veterans that delays early recruitment.  As a result, we anticipate that 
~[ADDRESS_1236163] to receive up to 6,600 surveys.  
A total of 64  respondents consisting of  Veterans  or Caregivers  will be recruited 
for qualitative portion of this objective.  Recruitment packets will initially be sent 
using via US Mail to the Veterans’ listed residence s in the ADNA assessment data  
or should the addresses not be listed, by [CONTACT_883568] (EHR) by [CONTACT_883569]/ VistAWeb and/or JLV . We will randomly select four Veterans enrolled in 
VD-HCBS from each of the [ADDRESS_1236164] the Veteran’s Caregiver as listed  in the ADNA survey. At this 
point, a packet including the introduction letter, refusal postcard, and  the CIRB 
approved Caregiver information consent sheet will be sent to the named 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236165] with the Veteran or Caregiver, a new Veteran will be  randomly selected 
and the recruitment process will repeat.  
 
Informed Consent Procedures:  
For Objective 1a,  the secondary data analys is portion of this aim, we are 
requesting waiver of informed consent  and a HIPAA waiver  
For Objective 1b, the Veteran  or Caregiver Interviews  portion of this objective, a 
CIRB approved information consent sheet  appropriate for the respondent  will be 
mailed to the Veterans with the recruitment  packet described above , or as 
described  above to the Caregiver . A waiver of written consent will be requested 
for all interviews because interviews will be conducted over the phone and are 
considered minimal risk. Verbal informed consent will be obtained in 
conformation with the policies established by [CONTACT_883570] (45 CFR 46.116). The 
verbal consenting procedure is detailed in each of the interview guides.  
  
Privacy and Confide ntiality:  
All secondary data records and all data containing PHI  will be stored exclusively 
on the Providence Research APP26 server.  Please see the Data Assurances 
section of the protocol for a description of the security measures in place for all 
electro nic data.  
To help mitigate the risks to Veteran interviewees in Objective [ADDRESS_1236166] team . At no time will any 
content of interviews be discussed with or released to clinicians of Veterans , or 
ADNA program coordinator s.  
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236167] of the VD -HCBS program on 
Caregivers’ well -being. This will be done using telephone surveys with  caregivers.  Each  
Caregiver will participate in two [ADDRESS_1236168] for 
Veterans. When the proposed studies from this objective are completed, it is our expectation 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236169] of the VD -HCBS program on Veteran s’ Caregivers will be better understood.  
Our proposal for analysis of the Caregiver Survey Data is describe in Section 6.0 (objective 2) . 
 
Recruitment Methods : 
This objective will be completed in two separate stages. The first stage will be 
data collection of caregiver Survey data via telephone surveys.  Caregivers of 
Veterans receiving VD -HCBS will be given a sealed packet  during the ADNA ’s 
initial  visit or will be placed within the Veteran int erview packet to be mailed as 
described above.  The sealed packet will be labeled “To the Veteran Caregiver” 
and will include   information  about the project, the phone survey, the goal of the 
project, and provide contact [CONTACT_21115] a Providence -based pr oject staff 
member to address any questions or concerns they may have prior to 
participating. Also included in these letters will be a copy of the informed 
consent sheet for caregivers to keep and will contain contact [CONTACT_883571] . In addition, within this 
introductory packet will  be an opt -in postcard that caregivers will be asked to 
complete and return if they wish to participate or be contact[CONTACT_883572]. A draft of this opt-in postcard is included in the application (Opt -in 
Postcard included in submission ). . Data for the outcomes for caregivers of 
Veterans enrolled in the VD -HCBS program will be obtained from the VHA Office 
of Geriatrics and Extended care following an approved Data Use Agreement in 
accordance with VA Policy. We estimate that there will be approximately 4500 
Caregivers’  data included in this data set. Data for the control group will be 
obtained from the VHA Caregiver  Support Program  following an approved Data 
Use Agreement in accordance with VA Policy. We estimate that there will be 
approximately 158 Caregivers  (92 approv ed for the Caregiver Support Program 
and 66 not approved) with pre and post survey  data included in this data set.  
 
Informed Consent Procedures:  
 
The control group data used for this   objective is  will be obtained through a DUA 
for existing data .  We are  requesting waiver of informed consent  for the control 
group and a HIPAA waiver  for this objective .  
For the Caregive r telephone survey, a  CIRB approved information consent sheet  
will be included in the recruitment packet left with the Veteran and Caregiver as 
detailed above. A waiver of written consent will be requested for the survey 
because the survey  will be conducted over the phone and are considered 
minimal risk. Verbal info rmed consent will be obtained in conformation with the 
policies established by [CONTACT_883573] 04/23/2018  
 17 protection of human subjects (45 CFR 46.116). The ve rbal consenting procedure 
is detailed in the survey document.

Objective 3  
 
In Objective 3 we will identify factors impacting VD -HCBS program implementation activities 
from multiple stakeholder vantage points (VA and ADNA) and throughout the implementation 
process by [CONTACT_883574] n within a range 
of contexts. Therefore, we will:  
 
Objective 3a) elicit implementation strategies used based on a compi[INVESTIGATOR_883539];  
 
Objective 3b) examine how contextual factors impact implementation using the 
Consolidated Framework for Im plementation Research;  
 
Objective 3c) examine the relationship between implementation strategies, contextual 
factors and outcomes at individual and institutional levels.   
 
As part of this objective, we will conduct individual interviews with VA and ADNA coordinators 
from 16  purposefully  selected  VA medical centers with recently established  and existing   VD-
HCBS programs. The 32 coordinators  will include 16 ADNA Coordinators and 16 VA coordinators  
from 16 VD -HCBS program sites .  Whenever possible,  each coo rdinator  will be interviewed at 
two time points  (64 total interviews) . The first set of interviews with the coordinators, will be  2 
to 4 months after  GEC allows the program to begin enrolling Veterans  (completion of the Lewin 
Group readiness review). The second set of  interview s will be 6 months after the initial 
interview to obtain follow -up data about implementation process, compared to the initial start -
up time, implementation strategies that they hav e employed, and their evaluation of 
implementation success (See Interview Guides).  If it is not possible to interview sites at 2 -
months after GEC allowed to begin enrolling Veterans (completion of the Lewin Group 
readiness review), we will conduct one int erview at least [ADDRESS_1236170] a local VAMC leader (n=16) and a  VISN GEC leader 
(n=16) for one -time interviews  (32 interviews) . Additionally, we will ask the  GEC VISN leads 
when we interview th em to recommend  local GEC contacts . 
 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236171] 16 program sites, with participation 
from both the VA and ADNA  coordinators .  We anticipate dropout of 25% in the pairwise 
analysis and are requesting permission to perform additional interviews at 4 sites (8 intervie ws) 
 
Including the additional interviews to allow for the projected drop out rate, we estimate that a 
Total of 104 interviews will be conducted with a total of 72 individuals.  
 
Recruitment Methods : 
We will purposefully select [ADDRESS_1236172] prior to participating  or to 
schedule an interview, and that unless a refusal is received they will be contact[CONTACT_883575] a week aft er the email is sent to schedule an interview . 
Participants will also be informed that they may be required to do this interview on off -
duty time unless their supervisor approves on -duty time. If they are willing to 
participate, a phone call will be schedu led.  
 
Informed Consent Procedures:  
When Coordinators or key informants respond to the invitation letter  or 
subsequent recruitment phone call and state that they want to participate , a 
member of the project team  will send them a CIRB approved information 
consent  sheet about the interview. This information consent sheet will include  
information about their rights as study participants .  At the time of the interview, 
the interviewer will confirm that the participant received the written information 
about the study and consent process. Then the interviewer will reiterate key 
parts of the informed consent information that were sent via ema il when the 
interview was scheduled, including the purpose of the study, the key informant’s 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236173] the interview  for transcription 
purposes.  If the participant verbally consents, the interview can be conducted. 
Interviewers will keep a ver bal consent log.    
We are requesting a waiver of documentation of consent for these telephone 
interviews.  
Privacy and Confidentiality:  
To help mitigate the risks to interviewees in Objective  3 telephone interviews 
will be conducted in private settings as  one-on-one interviews with the 
interviewer.  A research associate may be present as well to take notes, and this 
individual will be identified and introduced to the respondent.  The information 
gained during the interviews will not be used to evaluate quali ty of care. Neither 
the employee’s  supervisors nor peers nor the clients  will have access to the data. 
Data will remain confidential.  Identifiers, including first and last name [CONTACT_883589], will not be elicited from interview resp ondents 
during interview recordings. After transcription, the transcripts will be read by a 
project team member to ensure that any identifiable or sensitive data that 
participants volunteer during the interview s is removed  prior to analysis . 
Interview responses will be aggregated so individual sites and interviewees 
cannot be identified.  No individually identifiable information will be published or 
disclosed, unless required by [CONTACT_2371].   
To protect participants against risk aft er interview data have been collected, we 
will take a variety of measures to ensure confidentiality. In all records, 
participants will be assigned unique identifiers. The crosswalk  linking unique 
identifiers to participants, the verbal consent log, as well  as all interview 
recordings and transcripts will be stored electronically in a password protected, 
restricted -use folder on a  Providence  VA server  in a restricted access service 
directory, in a restricted folder with access limited to project staff. Any hard

locked office of study personnel.  When the data are reported, neither VAMCs 
nor interviewees will be identified in any way, to preserve anonymity of 
respondents.

7.0 Data Analysis  
Objective 1: 
Quantitative Analysis  of Veteran Survey Data  -  We will analyze the quantitative data from 
the Veteran Assessment  survey  data by [CONTACT_883576]. We will compare the responses at baseline to responses at [ADDRESS_1236175] similar trends in outcomes. Finite mixture models are clustering methods based upon 
a statistical model with stochastic elements.32 Formally, they can be written as 𝑝(𝑌𝑖)=
∑𝜋𝑗𝐹(𝑌|𝐺𝑖=𝑗)𝐽
𝑗=1, where Y i is a vector of outcomes for Veteran i, π j is the proportion of 
subgroups j among Veterans, G i is an unknown group classification for Veteran i, F is the 
distribution of the outcome at the that subpopulation, and J are the number of 
subpopulations. We will examine different possible values for the number of subgroups, 
and select the number with the highest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).33 Our initial 
model for F will be multivariate Gaussian distribution, which may require appropriate 
transformations of some of the outcomes (e.g., log). If the Gaussian model will not provide 
a good fit for the data, we will examine other possible models such as a mixture  of t 
distributions, or a mixture of skewed -Normal distributions. After the model identifies the 
possible subgroups, we will attempt to describe them by [CONTACT_883577] (e.g., Veterans with increasing outcome trends overall, p atients with 
moderately increasing outcomes at 3 weeks but stable at 12 months). These subgroups will 
enable us to identify the possible patterns that exist among Veterans exposed to the VD -
HCBS program. Following this identification, we will examine quali tative (see below) or 
quantitative variables that are possibly associated with these patterns, so that we could 
provide further understanding on the possible effectiveness of the program.  
 
Qualitative Analysis -  The team will read interview transcripts m ultiple times and 
independently make initial codes, then resolve coding differences through a process of 
deliberation and consensus.[ADDRESS_1236176] common codes and 
themes across Veterans and VAMCs. In the search for alternative interpretations and to 
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236177] of the VD -HCBS program on 
Veterans. We will analyze the quantitative and qualitative data separately and then 
integrate the results to present a comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_883542], both in terms of satisfaction and their life  experience.37 Specifically, we will use 
our qualitative findings to provide depth of understanding and quantitative data to provide 
breadth of understanding Veterans’ experiences with the VD -HCBS program. With this 
parallel mixed method design, we will be  able to provide explanation and description of 
Veterans’ experiences and the ways by [CONTACT_883578] -HCBS program impacts their lives.  
 
Please see the Data Assurances section of the protocol for a description of the 
security measures in place for all data.  
 
Objective 2 : 
Quantitative Analysis of Caregiver Survey Data  -  The primary comparison of interest will be 
the change in outcomes from the baseline survey to the follow survey between VD -HCBS 
Caregivers and VA CARES participants. Before testing for c hange over time, we will examine 
the frequency distributions for all study variables and appropriate transformations will be 
carried out whenever violations of normality are determined. Descriptive statistics and 
bivariate correlations will be computed. Ea ch variable will be tested for leptokurtosis to 
ensure that there is a sufficient range of scores. Variables found to be significantly 
leptokurtic will be converted into dichotomous outcomes.  
 
An important issue for longitudinal follow -up analyses is the problem of missing data. Data 
may be missing for one of two reasons: 1) the Veteran of a Caregiver who participated in 
baseline is no longer receiving VD -HCBS at the 6 -month follow -up period; 2) a Caregiver 
participant is lost to follow -up because of non -participation. In order to avoid biasing the 
result by [CONTACT_883579], we will first examine 
whether there are indications that the data are missing completely at random. Specifically, 
we will compare baseline scores for  Caregivers that complete both surveys to those that did 
not complete the follow -up survey. If no significant differences are observed between 
completers and those that “dropped out” on the baseline variables, then we will proceed 
with data analysis of the  Caregivers who completed both rounds of the survey. However, if 
we determine that the data are missing at random, then we will impute the missing data 
using a multiple imputation technique. If necessary, we will perform sensitivity analysis to 
examine the  plausibility of the missing at random assumption using a pattern mixture 
approach.38  
 
Version 04/23/2018  
 22 In order to compare the VD -HCBS Caregivers to the control group of Caregivers from the VA 
CARES evaluation (non -approved Caregivers, n=66), we will attempt to identify VD -HCBS 
Caregivers that are similar to the control group participants in terms of baseline survey 
variables. Identifying matching individuals on the entire set of covariates may be complex, 
so we will rely on the propensity score,[ADDRESS_1236178] a matching VA CARES within a 
caliper will be removed from the analysis, because the positivity assumption does not seem 
to be valid for them. This procedure w ill include many Caregivers in VD -HCBS, which will 
improve the precision of point estimates in this group while maintaining only VD -HCBS 
Caregivers that are relatively similar to control Caregivers. Having a large number of 
Caregivers from VD -HCBS increase s the power of the study, but it is dominated by [CONTACT_883580]. To estimate the propensity score, we will use a logistic 
regression model  𝑃(𝐶𝑖|𝑋𝑖)=exp⁡(𝛽′𝑋𝑖)
1+exp⁡(𝛽′𝑋𝑖), where C i is indicator variable for whether 
Caregiver i i s from the VD -HCBS program or the control group, and X i are the set of baseline 
covariates for caregiver i. Following the propensity score calculation, we will match 
Caregivers in the control group to VD-HCBS  Caregivers using the estimated propensity 
score s. We will then examine whether the distributions of the baseline covariates and 
second order interactions are similar across the two groups. Differences in distributions will 
be examined graphically and via appropriate statistical tests. If some variables  are found to 
differ between groups, we will update the propensity score model with higher order 
interactions. We will repeat this procedure until balance is obtained on all baseline variables 
and their interactions. [ADDRESS_1236179], there might be minor imbalances between the 
covariates among Caregivers in VD -HCBS and the control group. To address these minor 
imbalances, we will rely on general linear regression models to estimate differences in the 
outcomes between Caregivers who are participating in the VD -HCBS program and those 
who were part of the VA -CARES evaluation. For continuous outcomes, we will use multiple 
linear regression 𝑌𝑖=𝑋𝑖𝛽+𝜏𝐶𝑖+𝜀𝑖, where Y i is the outcome for Caregiver i, X i are the 
covariates, C i is an indicator variable for Control/VD -HDBS, τ is the treatment effect and 
𝜀𝑖~𝑁(0,𝜎2). For the ordinal variable, we will use the proportional odds model 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌𝑖<
𝑗)=𝛼𝑗+𝑋𝑖𝛽+𝜏𝐶𝑖, where α j is the log -odds of the out come variable j, and the rest of the 
variables are as previously described. To obtain interval estimates we will use either the 
variance estimates provided by [CONTACT_883581] & Imbens41 or the bootstrap procedure.42  
 
Dependent Variables – We will examine C aregiver s’ perceived financial strain, CESD -10 
score (screener for depressive symptoms), burden, self -reported health, and positive 
aspects of caregiving as described in the table below.  
 
Dependent Variables for Objective 2  
Measures of Measurement  
Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236180] of these 
characteristics will be 
measured during 
baseline surveys of 
Caregivers and a few will be drawn from the Veteran  Assessment Data.  For example, the 
models will include Veterans’ demographic and health/function characteris tics, month of 
enrollment, and the Veterans’ monthly budget amount. We will also examine Caregiver 
characteristics such as their relationship with the Veteran, whether or not the Caregiver was 
employed, lived with the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], as well as their age, sex, race, education, marital 
status, and whether or not there are dependent children in the household.  
 
 
Power -  
 
Without any adjustment for covariates and assuming that the standard error is equal to 
10 (the observed standard deviation on 
the Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale in 
the non -approved “control group” from 
the VA Cares evaluation, n=55 
respondents for this scale), we should 
have over 80% power to identify a 
difference of 4 points on the Positive 
Aspects of Caregiving Scale (range 9 -45) 
with approximat ely 1,000 Caregivers in 
VD-HCBS (see Table 4). If we used a 
different control group, (i.e., the approved Caregivers in the VA CARES evaluation, n= 92 
respondents), we can identify a 3.[ADDRESS_1236181]

Version 04/23/[ADDRESS_1236185], open -ended data from the interviews will be reviewed and coded by a team 
of two researchers. They will code transcribed data according to CFIR and ERIC constructs 
using directed content analysis,44 in which codes are  developed a priori ; additional data 
derived codes will be established for text that cannot be coded with the a priori  codes. 
Thus, this will be primarily a deductive approach, and we will additionally create codes that 
are inductively derived from data. T he researchers will first independently read through a 
subset of interviews (about three to five) to apply initial codes and then come together to 
compare codes and arrive at agreement through deliberation and consensus.[ADDRESS_1236186] as facilitators or barriers, 
researchers  will independently rate coded text according to strength and valence on a 5 
point scale, with -2 reflecting a statement about a strong barrier to +[ADDRESS_1236187]. The memos will also include a summary stateme nt 
to describe what was coded (e.g., how did key informants describe the innovation source) 
and whether implementation context or strategy can be ascribed to a specific entity (i.e., 
solely VA or ADNA) or if it is a shared strategy, and they will include a  rationale for ratings 
(e.g., the program was mandated without buy -in from local entities, thus a strong negative 
rating). We will build on the case memos developed during the first data collection period 
with data from the second to describe implementatio n strategies and any updates from the 
first interview  for cases that have two interviews.  
 
Qualitative Comparative Analysis  -  The objective of this stage will be to consolidate 
collected implementation data to assess how combinations of strategies and bar riers relate 
to outcomes using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).[ADDRESS_1236188] 
presence or absence of these values. At the institutional level, outcomes will be the number 
of Veterans receiving care through VDHCBS as a proportion of the total number of Veterans 
receiving Home and Community Based Care one year after program start . QCA is a 
Version 04/23/2018  
 25 quantitative, case -oriented method that uses applied set theory and Boolean algebra to 
examine multifactorial causality (i.e., when several variables together have a joint effect on 
an outcome). In essence, it offers a systema tic way to compare cases for factors related to 
success of an outcome, distinguishing between necessary and sufficient conditions, in 
projects with small or medium -N. It is a well -established quantitative approach that has 
been in use since the 1980s, espe cially in political science, to answer research questions like 
"What combinations of conditions are directly connected to the outcome of interest, such 
that cases with those specific combinations also always had the outcome present?" 
Although quantitative,  QCA is a form of case -oriented research that requires close 
familiarity with the qualitative dataset of interest and theoretical framework to interpret 
results. As Baptist and Befani say in their primer on QCA, “Put simply, QCA allows evaluators 
to answer  the question ‘what works best, why, and under what circumstances’ quite 
literally, in a way that emerges directly from other empi[INVESTIGATOR_578498]; that can be replicated 
by [CONTACT_29091], and is generalizable to other contexts.”[ADDRESS_1236189] Data  
Overview of Risks - The primary risk in this study is a breach of confidentiality.  In the case  of 
Veterans and Veterans’ Caregivers, a breach of confidentiality could cause an unauthorized 
release of protected health information . In the case of VA Employees and ADNA 
coordinators , a breach in co nfidentiality could affect their employment. The project staff 
are aware of these risks and have outlined precautionary measures to reduce this risk as 
much as possible in the project.  
 
Data Assurances - All study staff will be monitored by [CONTACT_60306]. Rudolph  and Local  Site PIs for 
consenting, protocol, and information security adherence. Intensive training (including all 
VHA mandated trainings) at study initialization will be conducted along with annual 
refresher courses. Training certificates for all study s taff members will be kept on file with 
the PVAMC Research Office.  [CONTACT_883590] will terminate access to study records when a user 
no longer requires access to them . 
 
If there is a theft, loss, or other unauthorized access of study data or storage devices 
associated with this study, this will be reported according to VA regulations. The local 
ISO/PO will be informed if there is any theft, loss, or other unauthorized access of sensitive 
data or storage devices and non -compliance with security controls.  
 
Electr onic Health Data/Secondary Data Storage  (Obtained through DUAs)  
 
All electronic health data , including all Pers onal health information and HIPA A identifiers 
from the secondary data  used in objectives 1 and 2 will be stored and accessed exclusively

Qualitative Interview Data  Storage : 
 
There are two types of qualitative interview data to be collected as a part of this project. 
These are led by [CONTACT_883585] u se diff erent data collection methods.  
 
The list of interview participants for Objective 1 and 3 will be maintained exclusively on the 
Providence VA server in a folder 
(\\R04pronas21.v01.med.va.gov \RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS \Rudolph \VD-HCBS -R ) with access 
restrict ed to project team members. The Providence VA server  complies with all VA Data 
Security regulations. Only research team members with the proper permissions will have 
access to this list. Hard copy and electronic interview notes will be labeled only with a

Description of Providence Research Computing Infrastructure : 
 
The VA Providence computer system is highly secure, and accessible only to authorized users. The 
Providence research  computing infrastructure consists of a Windows server accessed via 
remote desktop sessions and client Windows PCs. Network security is provided by a 
combination of VA firewalls, local network access controls, and continuous auditing and 
monitoring  for security breaches. Access from systems external to the VA’s intranet and 
COIN server is limited to encrypted channels, e.g. VPN. Person -identifiable as well as 
partially -de-identified data housed on the Providence research server are restricted to the  
system analyst at IRM and to the project’s approved staff and investigators. No data are 
allowed to be transferred to other computers (desktops or laptops) unless they are stripped 
of all identification information. VA employees have signed a VA privacy a greement to

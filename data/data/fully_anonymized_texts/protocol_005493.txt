ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE The study will comprise 8 on-site visits AND 4 phone calls: 
• Visits: 
- V1 (screening visit) between Day -28 and Day -1. 
- V2 (baseline visit) at Day 1 (first dosing). 
- Treatment period*: V3 at Week 2, V4 at Week 4, V5 at 
Week 8, V6 at Week 12, V7 at Week 24. 
- V8 (End-of-Study [EOS] visit) at Week 35. 
- A time window of ±2 days will be allowed for each visit. 
• Phone calls: - For safety considerations phone calls will be made at 
Week 6, 16 and 20 during the treatment period, and at 
Week 30 during the follow-up period. 
*IMP administration given qw starting at V2 with the last dose given at 
Week 23. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: 
Ninety-four (94) patients (47 patients per group) will yield 80% 
power to detect a difference versus placebo group of 3.[ADDRESS_1238650] deviation (SD) of 7 and using a 1-sided alpha of 5% 
(type I error). 
The impact of treatment discontinuations in the context of an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis where all mRSS data will be included in 
the analysis (regardless of adherence to treatment) was evaluated. 
Assuming that 10% of patients will discontinue the treatment, the 
estimated treatment effect at 24 weeks will be decreased from 4 
(targeted treatment effect if all patients adhered to treatment) to 3.6 
(targeted treatment effect in all randomized patients). 
Analysis population: 
The efficacy population will be the ITT population, which includes all 
randomized patients. 
Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the 
(electronic

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol NO. 01  09-Aug-2017 
SAR156597-ACT14604 Version number: [ADDRESS_1238651] 1 dose or part of a dose of the IMP. 
Patients in the safety population will be analyzed in the treatment 
group as actually received. Patients receiving more than 1 study 
treatment during the trial will be analyzed in the treatment group 
from which they received the majority of injections. 
Primary efficacy analysis: 
All measurements are assigned to analysis windows in order to 
provide an assessment for Week [ADDRESS_1238652] 
model with repeated measures (MMR M) approach. All post-baseline 
data available from Week 4 to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data will be accounted for by [CONTACT_757426]. The model includes the fixed categorical effects of treatment group, 
randomization strata, time poi nts (Week 4 to Week 24), 
randomization strata-by-time point interaction and treatment-by-time 
point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline mRSS value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. 
This model will provide baseline adjusted least-squares means 
(LSmeans) estimates at Week 24 fo r both treatment groups with their 
corresponding 95% confidence interval. To compare SAR156597 to 
the placebo group, an appropriate statement will be used to test the 
differences of these estimates at the 5% one sided alpha level. The 
95% and 90% confidence intervals of the difference will be provided. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints:  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the 
same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint with the continuous 
fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline 
value-by-time point interaction. 
Safety: 
Safety analyses will be descriptive, based on the safety population. 
The safety analysis will focus on t he TEAE period. This period is 
defined as the time from the first administration of the IMP to the last administration of the IMP + 12 weeks. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient) The study can last up to 39 weeks per patient as follows: 
• 4 weeks of screening. 
• 24 weeks of study treatment. 
• 11 weeks of follow-up with no study treatment.

Systemic sclerosis (or scleroderma) is a chronic disabling condition characterized by [CONTACT_885392][INVESTIGATOR_885367]: immune dysregulation, small vessel vasculopathy, and fibrosis. There are two major 
subgroups in the commonly accepted classifica tion of SSc: limited cuta neous SSc (lcSSc) and 
diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) ( 1). In lcSSc, fibrosis is restricted to the distal upper and lower 
extremities, with possible facial involvement. While the fibrosis will tend to stabilize within the first several years of development, the condition may continue to evolve in the internal organs particularly in the lungs resulting in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) which is the leading cause of mortality associated with lcSSc in its later stages. In contrast, dcSSc is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_885368] a larger area of the skin beyond the limited form with truncal manifestation likely. These patients will often ha ve early internal organ involvement and more 
significant systemic symptoms such as arthralg ia, tendon friction rubs an d weight loss. Although 
skin fibrosis is the distinguishing hallmark, the pathological changes in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys and heart ultimately determine the clinical outcome. The extent of skin i nvolvement 
and its rate of progression, however, may reflect th e severity of the visceral organ complications 
(2), outcome and survival (3 ). Survival in patients with dcSSc  has improved over the last several 
decades; currently the average 10-year survival is es timated to be approximately 70% to 80%. 
Mortality associated with renal crisis has significantly declined during the last couple of decades with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (A CE) inhibitors while pulmonary involvement is 
the leading cause of death in these patients ( 4, 5, 6 , 7). 
The prevalence of SSc in 2014 is estimated to be around 120 000 persons in the US and EU5 nations combined with over 60% of the cases being of the diffuse form. The prevalence may 
increase by [CONTACT_45848] 20% in the future using the new ACR/EULAR 2013 ( 8) classification 
criteria which is more sensitive than the previous  ACR 1980 criteria. Overall, the disease is more 
frequent in women (3-6:1) and in certain races (eg, black). 
Currently, there is no approved therapy for SSc. Th e general therapeutic strategy is to address 
specific SSc manifestations (eg, Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital ulcers, gastrointestinal 
involvement, PAH) while controlling any underlying inflammatory process of the skin or internal 
organs with the use of potent immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexa te, rituximab). Because these immunosuppressive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885369], they are not particularly 
effective and are often fraught with significant side effects. Thus, there is an unmet need to find effective targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885370]. 
T helper type 2 (TH2) cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), have prominent roles in the pathogenesis of SSc and ar e promising targets. The levels of TH2 cytokines 
are increased in the serum and fibrotic tissues, and they stimulate fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis in cell cultures ( 9). These findings are supported by [CONTACT_885393], as illustrated by [CONTACT_885394]-13, 
whereas targeted overexpression of IL -13 results in pulmonary fibrosis ( 10). Similarly, increased

SAR156597 groups). SAR156597 was generally safe  and well tolerated. The most commonly 
reported AEs were infections with a comparable  incidence across treatment groups. No significant 
emergent ADA reactivity developed as a conseq uence of treatment with SAR156597. Steady state 
of SAR156597 was achieved on Day 43 for all doses . The results of pharmacodynamic data 
showed that SAR156597 reduced, in an apparent  dose-dependent manner from 50 to 200 mg once 
a week, the plasma level of TARC (or CCL17), a protein directly induced by [CONTACT_8668]-4 and IL-13 
receptor activation. SAR156597 is currently in Phas e 2b of clinical develo pment for the treatment 
of IPF.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
A complete description of the IMP and its proper handling will be provided in a pharmacy 
manual. 
8.1.1 Pharmaceutical Form 
• SAR156597 solution for injection at 100 mg/mL: SAR156597 is supplied as a sterile freeze-dried powder for solution for injection, in  a glass vial. Each vial is filled with 
125 mg of SAR156597 freeze-dried powder, and th e final solution for injection is obtained 
by [CONTACT_885395] 1.1 mL of sterile water for injection, 
leading to an amount of 125 mg of SAR156597 drug substance in a total volume of 
1.25 mL equating to a concentration of 100 mg/mL of SAR156597 solution. One (1) mL of this 100 mg/mL SAR156597 solution can then  be withdrawn for dose administration. 
Two (2) drug product vials are thus needed to reach a 200 mg dose and to prepare a 2 mL SAR156597 solution syringe. 
• Placebo in lyophilized form: each vial containing  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], is to be reconstituted with 
1.1 mL of sterile water resulting in a total volume of 1.25 mL. Two (2) placebo product vials are required with 1 mL to be taken from each vial to prepare a 2 mL placebo solution 
syringe. 
8.1.2 Dose of drug per administration 
• SAR156597 group: 1 injection of SAR156597 200 mg administered subcutaneously qw. 
• Placebo group: [ADDRESS_1238677] be done by [CONTACT_885396] (eg, pharmacist) other than those administering the drug 
and making clinical observations (Refer to Section  8.3). 
At the patient’s home, reconstitution must be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_129000] (eg, visiting nurse). 
The IMP should be reconstituted the day of dosing ( no more than 3 hours prior to SC injection), at 
room temperature.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   Page 32  8.1.4 Route and method of administration  
The route and method of administration are SC in the abdomen. SC injection sites should be 
alternated between the 4 quadrants of the abdomen  (avoiding navel and waist areas) so that the 
same site is not injected for two consecutive weeks. The exact site of each injection will be 
documented on the source document. It is recommended that the injection occur at a site free of SSc involvement, if possible. 
The IMP is administered every 7 days ±2 days from initial IMP administration. This window is 
permitted per protocol to accomm odate various circumstances (eg, pending laboratory results, 
management of AE, visit schedu ling difficulty). The IMP administration should be performed by 
[CONTACT_885397], blinded from the person in ch arge of the preparation of the solutions and 
syringes. 
If IMP administration is missed or temporarily discontinued, the initial schedule of injections may 
be resumed upon the investigator’s medical judgme nt and discretion while the missed dose(s) will 
not be administered. This does not apply to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
On days when the patient has a study visit, the IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_885398]. 
For doses not administered at the study site, the IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_885399] /or healthcare professi onals (eg, visiting nurse service). 
Patients should be monitored by [CONTACT_8786]/visiting nurse for at least [ADDRESS_1238678] 
information related to the injections; this booklet  will be completed by [CONTACT_728002]’s study file. Patients will be instructed 
to bring the booklet back at the subsequent  site visit for Investigator’s review. 
Between the protocol-scheduled on-site visits, inte rim visits to the site may be required for IMP 
dispensing. As an alternative to these visits, the IMP may be supplied from the site to the patient 
via a Sponsor-approved courier company where allo wed by [CONTACT_728005].

SAR156597-ACT14604 Version number: [ADDRESS_1238680] will be generated by [CONTACT_3433] e interactive voice response system 
(IVRS). Both the randomization and treatment  kit lists will be loaded into IVRS. 
In accordance with the double-blind design, study pa tients, Investigators, and study site personnel 
(except the personnel who conduct the reconstitution of the IMP and preparation of syringes for 
injection) will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to the randomization 
code except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
Before the reconstitution, the lyophilized SAR 156597 and lyophilized placebo are similar. Once 
reconstituted, the active solution differs subtly in its appearance from the placebo solution. In order to maintain blinding conditions, the pers onnel involved with dose and syringe preparation 
will be required not to reveal to other study personnel the type or characteristics of IMP solution (SAR156597 versus placebo) in the vials and syringes. 
Please refer to Section  10.4 for unblinding by [CONTACT_885400]. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an AE, the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is 
required for treating the patient.  Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_885401]/or by 
[CONTACT_400319] S ponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, 
the Investigator should document the date, time of the day, and reason for code breaking.  
If the blind is broken by [CONTACT_737], th e patient must withdraw from IMP administration. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
Patient will be randomized following a 1:1 ratio  to one of the two treatment groups via a 
centralized randomization system using IVRS. 
Randomization will be stra tified based upon the patient s’ medical history of SSc-ILD (yes or no). 
A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by [CONTACT_13225]. The IMP 
(SAR156597 or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list. 
At Visit 1 (screening), the study staff will contact [CONTACT_885402] a patient number for each 
patient who signs the informed consent. Each patient will be allocated a patient number associated with the center and allocated in chronological order in each site.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   Page 34  At Visit 2 (baseline), after confirming that the patient is eligible for entry into the treatment 
period, the site coordinator will contact [CONTACT_885403]. Patients will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups at the ratio of 1:1. At 
subsequent visits during the treatment period, the site coordinator will call IV RS to obtain the next 
treatment kit numbers. A confirmation fax/e-mail will be sent to the site after each assignment. 
A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the clinical trial.  Patients who meet exclusion criteria may be resc reened once during the open screening period of 
study; a different patient number will be assigned by [CONTACT_54537]. Re-screening is not permitted if the 
patient fails to meet inclusion criteria. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the 
screen failure date and the re-screen date. The IVRS report will flag re-screened patients. Patients who are re-screened must sign a new informed consent and all Visit [ADDRESS_1238681] be 
repeated.  
One (1) treatment kit is sufficient for 1 week of treatment. As the treatment duration is 24 weeks, 
a patient will be allocated by [CONTACT_885404]. 
The details of the centralized randomization pr ocedure and IVRS are provided in a separate 
manual. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
SAR156597 and placebo will be supplied in a 1 week treatment kit containing 2 vials per kit. Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
All IMPs should be stored between 2°C and 8°C ( 36°F and 46°F), and should be kept upright. The 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, phar macists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specif ications, policies, and 
procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperatur e (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructi ons for handling the [COMPANY_011] compound should be 
managed according to the rules provided by [CONTACT_1034]. At home, the treatment kits will be stored by [CONTACT_90227] a refrigerator in accordance with the 
storage conditions indicated on the label of the IMPs. 
After the supply of IMP kits are dispensed to the patients at the study s ite visits, appropriate 
provisions will be in place for transportation of th e IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s 
refrigerator, if home injections are permitted under lo cal laws and regulations. As an alternative to

IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by [CONTACT_328730]. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly reported to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to reca ll the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for duties and taxes paid [DTP] shipment, for which a courie r company has been approved by [CONTACT_1034]), 
allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_885405], or dispose of IMP in 
any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
The patient will be injected the study drug subcutaneously once a week during the treatment period. The patient will be injected the study drug at the trial site on the scheduled visits, and at 
weekly intervals in between scheduled visits. A home visiting nurse will administer the study drug at the patient’s place during the inter-visit pe riod, should the patient choose this option and if 
permitted by [CONTACT_10976].  
Measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance and IMPs accountability include: 
• Proper recording of treatment kit number or packaging number as required on appropriate 
electronic case report form (e-CRF) page for accounting purposes. 
• All medication treatment kits (whether empty or unused) are returned by [CONTACT_181261] a treatment dispensing is planned or it is the End of Treatment visit. In 
case of Direct-To-Patient process, the treatment units can be returned by [CONTACT_21440] (if defined in the contract). 
• The site personnel tracks trea tment accountability/complian ce comparing the treatment 
number recorded on the patient booklet with the treatment number of returned treatment 
kits (whether empty or unused) and fills in the patient treatment log.

9.1.4 Assessment methods and activity parameters 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified Rodnan Skin Score  
The fibrosis of the skin will be  assessed using the mRSS which is  conducted by [CONTACT_885406] 17 areas of the body (fingers, hands, forearms, arms, feet, legs and thighs, face, chest and 
abdomen) using a 0–3 scale, where 0 = normal, 1 = mild thickness, 2 = m oderate thickness and 
3 = severe thickness. Total skin score can range fr om 0 (no thickening) to 51 (severe thickening in 
all 17 areas). Only those physicians or qua lified medical personnel who have undergone a 
standardized training will be permitted to evaluate the skin thickening. Every effort will be undertaken for the same medical personnel to evaluate a given patient from baseline to EOS 
participation in order to minimize any inter-rater variability. In the unlikely event of the evaluation being carried out by [CONTACT_885407], the reason will be documented. The baseline and Week 24/Visit [ADDRESS_1238684] be  conducted by [CONTACT_885408]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_885374] a secondary endpoint that will a ssess the change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_885375] (corrected for hemoglobin) from 
baseline to Week 24. The absolute change in obs erved and % predicted change in FVC and DLco 
from baseline to Week 24 and/or Week 35 will al so be assessed as exploratory endpoints. The 
manual correction of DLco for hemoglobin will be  based upon the following equation unless it is 
automatically corrected during measurement: 
1. For male patients: DLco observed /(factor), where factor is = (1.7 x Hb)/(10.22 + Hb) 
2. For female patients: DLco observed /(factor), where factor is  = (1.7 x Hb)/(9.38 + Hb) 
Note: Hb = Hemoglobin. The value of hemoglobin will be taken from the same visit where the DLco is conducted. 
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_885376] 2005 ATS/ERS guideline ( 13) while 
the DLco should be performed in compliance with standard guidance ( 14). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Manifestations  
The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 instrument is a validated self-reported questionnaire used to assess QOL related to gastrointestinal function in patients with SSc ( 15). It employs a 7-multi-item scale 
with areas of reflux, distention/bloating, diarrhea, fecal soilage, constipation, emotional well-being, and social functioning. This will be captured at all visits except V1 and V3.

The digital ulcer count captures the number of act ive open sores (or digital ulcers) on fingertips 
secondary to SSc (and not secondary to localized tr auma or injury). Cracks, fissures or even skin 
breakdown related to calcinosis s hould not be included. The digita l ulcer count will be conducted 
at all visits except V1 and V3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire 
The SHAQ, which includes the standard HAQ-DI  to measure the functional disability and 
5 SSc-specific VAS assessments will be complete d by [CONTACT_885410], except V1 and V3 ( 16). The SHAQ is the standard, validated, and accepted health 
assessment questionnaire in patients with SSc to assess the phys ical/functional disa bility related to 
skin and systemic fibrosis. 
The HAQ DI contains 8 domains of activity (dressin g, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, 
grip, and common daily activities) each of which ha s at least 2 questions, for a total of 20 items. 
For each item, patients report the amount of difficulty experienced performing the activity. There 
are 4 possible responses for each item ranging from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). 
For each of the [ADDRESS_1238685] score is 0 or 1, then 
the score is raised to 2; if the highest score is 2 or 3, the score is kept as it is. The HAQ-DI composite score is then calculated as the average of  the scores of the 8 domains. If 1 or 2 of the

the HAQ-DI composite score is missing. The compos ite score is reported, falling between 0 and 3 
on an ordinal scale. The scores are interpreted as 0 (no impairment in function) to 3 (maximal 
impairment of function). 
The HAQ-DI also contains a VAS that patients us e to report the amount of pain experienced in 
the past week. The VAS is a 10-cm  line that is converted to a c ontinuous scale from 0 to 3 where 
1 cm is equivalent to 0.3 points. The anchors of the VAS are 0 (no pain) to 100 (very severe pain). 
To obtain the patient score, a metric ruler is used to measure the distance in centimeters from the 
left anchor to the patient’s mark, and then multiplied by 0.3. The VAS pain score is not 
incorporated into the HAQ DI composite score.  
For the other 5 VAS, the patients will rate br eathing, vascular (Raynaud’s phenomenon), 
gastrointestinal function, digital ulcers, and global assessment. They will be asked to make a mark 
on a [ADDRESS_1238686] severity. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Euro-QOL-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a standardized meas ure of health status developed by [CONTACT_185250] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. 
The EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by [CONTACT_1962]. 
The EQ-5D comprises 2 discrete scales: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system has 5 items, each me asuring one dimension of health: mobility, 
self-care, usual activitie s, pain/discomfort and anxiety/de pression. Each dimension/item has a 
5 level Likert-type response scale: no problems,  slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems. Responses for the 5 dimensions can be combined in a single 5-digit number describing the respondent’s health profile and can be converted into a single index value for the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions. The EQ VAS provides a quantitative measure of health as judged by [CONTACT_885412] a ver tical visual analogue scale. The EQ VAS ‘thermometer’ has 
endpoints of 100 (“The best health you can imagine”) at the top and 0 (“The worst health you can imagine”) at the bottom. 
In the analysis the index value will be considered as a continuous variable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Composite response index in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis 
The CRISS tool summarizes the changes in the clinical and patient-reported outcomes using a 
single composite score that reflects the probability that the patient with dcSSc has improved ( 17). 
For an effective therapeutic agent of dcSSc, CRISS will be able to summarize the higher 
probability of improvement in a subject treated with the IMP versus an ineffective agent (or placebo). 
CRISS is a 2-step process as described below.

to SSc are considered as not improved (irrespec tive of improvement in other core items) and 
assigned a probability of improving equal to 0.0. Specifically if a subject  develops any of the 
following: 
• New scleroderma renal crisis 
• Decline in FVC % predicted ≥15% (relative), confirmed by  [CONTACT_546850]% within a 
month, high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) to confirm ILD (if previous HRCT 
of chest did not show ILD) and FV C % predicted below 80% predicted*  
• New onset of left ventricular failure (def ined as left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45%)

Step 2: For the remaining patients, Step [ADDRESS_1238688] using the following equation (equation to derive predicted probabilities from a logistic regression model): 
 
 
∆mRSS indicates the change in mRSS from baseline, ∆FVC denotes the change in FVC% predicted from 
baseline, ∆Pt-glob indicates the change in patient global assessment, ∆MD-glob denotes the change in 
physician global assessment, and ∆HAQ-DI is the change in HAQ-DI. All changes are absolute change 
(Time 2–Time baseline ). 
Patient and physician global assessments of overall health will be used in the Step 2 calculation of 
CRISS. These two assessments are based upon a Likert scale ranging from 0 (Excellent) to 10 (Extremely Poor) (see Appendix E) (17). 
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
The same safety assessments will be applied across all phases of the study and across both treatment groups. Adverse events, including serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of 
special interest (AESI), will be collected at every visit. The Investigator will ask the patient how he/she has felt since the last study visit. The st udy specific and general safety criteria are detailed 
in Section  10.4.1. To ensure the continuing safety of pa tients in this study, an independent DMC 
will be responsible for reviewing the safety data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the 
study as outlined in Section  6.4.

All plasma samples to be tested for SAR156597 samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_700056] 
(Saclay, [LOCATION_009]) 
A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used for the quantification of 
SAR156597 in human plasma. Biotinylated IL-[ADDRESS_1238691] SAR156597 with an LLOQ of 0.05 µg/mL. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Anti-drug antibodies 
All ADA samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_885415] ([LOCATION_009]). 
For the analysis of potential ADAs in human plasma, a validated bridging qualitative ELISA 
using electrochemiluminescence detection will be used. Positive samples in screening assay will then be tested in a confirmatory assay (competition with 
SAR156597) in order to demonstrate the presence of antibodies and eliminate false positive results generated from the initial screening assay. 
Interference of SAR156597 in the ADA assay will  be documented so that the highest drug 
concentration that does not affect the limit of ADA detection is known, and the interpretation of 
immunogenicity takes into account this parameter. 
Additional information on the bioa nalytical method for ADAs will be provided in the Laboratory 
Manual. Samples that are ADA positive will be further evaluated for their potential neutralizing activity 
with an assay currently in development. 
Placebo samples will only be analyzed at baseline, and will continue to be followed if the baseline 
time point results positive for ADA.

9.3.2 Resource utilization 
To assess the economic benef it of SAR156597, health care resources will be collected 
retrospectively at baseline, Week 12, Week 24 and Week 35. These resources will include the 
following information: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (reason, number of days per ward, date of entry, date of discharge from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
• Number of out-patients visits by [CONTACT_24975] (gas troenterologist, pulmonologist, occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], psychiatrist , physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], other) 
• Sick leaves (number of day off from work) 
• Caregiver support (time spent per day to care of the patient, number of days off from work 
to take care of the patient). 
9.3.3 Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected for protein biomarker analyses. There will be measurement of protein biomarkers associated with the activity of the disease (COMP, CCL2) and the IL-4/IL-[ADDRESS_1238692] (TARC, periostin, and eotaxin-3). 
Additionally, archived blood samples may be us ed for future assays of protein and mRNA 
biomarkers related to the disease and the respons e to therapy. Participa tion is voluntary and will

This is a voluntary procedure which requires the patient to sign a separate informed consent 
document should he/she agree to participate. If ag reed to participate, th e patient will have blood 
samples collected at Visit 2, Visit 6 and Visit 8. The archived samples may be used to potentially 
assess for protein and mRNA biomarkers  in the future. Additionally,  
• Stored samples may also be used to explore sa fety concerns that may have arisen during or 
after study completion 
• Stored samples may also be used for other re search purposes (excluding genetic analysis) 
related to SSc than those defined in the pr esent protocol. These other research purposes 
will help to understand either disease subtypes  or drug response, or to develop and/or 
validate a bioassay method, or to identif y new drug targets or biomarkers. 
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers used during the study (ie, subject ID). They will be transferred to a [COMPANY_011] site (or a subcontractor site) which can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting 
subject confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and Section  14.5). 
9.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
The primary endpoint will be the change in mRSS from baseline to Week 24. The mRSS is a 
widely used endpoint in SSc clin ical trials as it is the only validated measure of cutaneous 
involvement in patients w ith SSc and it correlates with patient function and mortality. Because of 
the challenges related to inter-rate r variability, it is imperative that all raters are to be trained and 
certified and one rater is to be us ed to assess the same patient throughout the course of the study. 
The secondary endpoints will assess the change from baseline to Week 24 in HAQ-DI and in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_885378] (corrected for 
hemoglobin). Both the FVC and DLco are widely used measures of pulmonary function particularly related to the disease status of an underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). Lastly, because it is a multisystem disease, SSc can sign ificantly impact a patient’s function and quality 
of life. Thus, patient reported outcomes (PRO s) such as HAQ-DI (assessed with the SHAQ) 
which is both reliable and validated are vital information to be captured in this study ( 19).

required. 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (rela tive to randomization da te), as scheduled. The 
visit schedule should be adhered to within the ±2 day visit window. If a patient is prematurely discontinued from treatment, all assessments planned at the End of 
Treatment visit should be performed. Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
informed consent form (including voluntary participa tion in future use of samples) must be signed 
and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of a single visit 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perf ormed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as 
long as the screening visit window prior to Da y 1 is respected. Patients who fail screening for 
certain exclusion criteria (eg, concomitant medications, required drug-specific discontinuation 
periods or laboratory tests), may be rescreened for study eligibility 1 additional time (refer to Section  8.4 for further instructions related to rescreening). 
In general, PRO assessments should be completed at the study site as part of the visit (per study 
flow chart) but prior to any meaningful communi cation with a health ca re professional or any 
other study procedures, unless noted otherwise in the suggested order of the study procedures for 
each individual visit described below.

All evaluations that are reported in the e-CRF and in the patient booklet (com pleted by [CONTACT_46566]) 
must be supported by [CONTACT_728017]. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop is temporary; perm anent IMP discontinuation should be considered 
as the last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, 
the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal products 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_885419](s). Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP will be considered with close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring after the Investigator has determined according to his/her best medical judgment that the causality of the event was unlikely related to the IMP(s) and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
For example, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_885379] a temporary discontinuation to allow for a 
thorough diagnostic work-up and evaluation. 
A discontinuation of IMP greater than [ADDRESS_1238701](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investig ator, Sponsor or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the 
IMP at any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1238702] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may decide to permanently withdraw from treatment with the IMP at any time and 
for any reason; this decision may also rest with the Investigator or Sponsor. All efforts should be made to document the reason(s) for tr eatment discontinuation in the e-CRF. 
IMP will be permanently discontinued in case of the following events (refer to Section  10.6 for 
details). The list is a guide and not intended to be exhaustive: 
•  
• Symptoms of severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions (see Appendix I  for 
definition) 
• Severe skin reactions local to the site of IMP injection (see Appendix J )

• Any AEs, per Investigator’s judgment, that may jeopardize the patient’s safety 
• Any code breaking requested by [CONTACT_328745]. 
• Any laboratory abnormalitie s per the algorithms of Appendix K  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG para meter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a d ecision regarding of possible pe rmanent IMP discontinuation for 
the concerned patient. All efforts should be made to reassess in a clinically relevant timeframe 
(using either local or central lab), the clini cal significance of lab abnormalities and corrective 
actions before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1238703]. 
After permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients will be assessed using the procedures normally planned for EOT visit/Visit 7 (labeled as Premature/Early EOT in the e-CRF), and then will be asked to come for the remaining on-site visits per schedule (including Visit 7 at Week 24 and EOS at Week 35 for safety monitoring and efficacy assessments, particularly mRSS, SHAQ, 
FVC and DLco (corrected for hemoglobin) up to Week [ADDRESS_1238704] follow-up (e g, medical records check). Patients requesting 
withdrawal of consent for ongoing study partic ipation with follow-up may jeopardize the public 
health value of the study. 
If possible, and prior to the withdrawal of c onsent for ongoing study participation, the patients 
will be assessed using the procedure normally planned for the EOS visit (Visit 8). Then, patients 
will receive a phone call from Investigators at Week 30 for vital status assessment.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   Page 62  Patients who withdraw from the study should be explicitly asked about the reason and the 
contribution of any possible AE(s) that led to their decision, and any AE information elicited should be documented. The patient may withdraw consent verbally or in writing. If the consent is withdrawn verbally, the site should document it appropriately. Preferab ly the patient should 
withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s  representative refuses or is 
physically unavailable, the site should document a nd sign the reason for the patient’s failure to 
withdraw consent in writing. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_56479]

at least the date of the withdrawal  and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who did not withdraw consent for ongoin g study participation but fail to return to the 
site, the Investigator should make the best effort  to contact [CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s 
family or private physician, reviewing available re gistries or health ca re databases), and to 
determine his/her health status, particularly vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_101876]’s records (eg, number of attempts and dates of attempted telephone 
contact [CONTACT_572307] a registered letter). The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused. 
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Intensity of an AE is defined as: 
• Mild: no modification of daily activities and does not require mandatory 
corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Moderate: hinders normal daily activities and/or requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Severe: prevents daily activities and requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   Page 63  [IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific j udgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to  be considered a medically important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an ER or at home for: 
- Severe hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis, allergic bronchospasm [see  
Appendix I  for the clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis]) 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
• ALT >[ADDRESS_1238705] + TBILI >[ADDRESS_1238706] or asymptomatic ALT increase >[ADDRESS_1238707]. See Appendix K . 
• Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality. 
• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions. 
• Cancers diagnosed during the study or recurs during the study 
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by [CONTACT_759827] a study drug on these diseases).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_125478]. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548].  
• Pregnancy of a female subject entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a female partner of a male subject entered in a study with IMP.  
Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued. 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female partic ipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP: 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_885420] e patient and defined as at least twice the 
intended dose given during a [ADDRESS_1238708] AE. 
• ALT > [ADDRESS_1238709]:   If increase in ALT >[ADDRESS_1238710], see the “Increase in ALT” flow chart in 
Appendix K  of the protocol.   
- However, if the increase in ALT is ≥ 2 x the baseline value (with baseline ALT ≥ 
ULN) but ≤  [ADDRESS_1238711] value meets the AESI criterion of ALT > [ADDRESS_1238712]. If so, proceed as above and follow the guidelines of  Appendix K . If not, monitoring of the 
laboratory findings will be up to the medical judgment of the Investigator. 
• Other project specific AESI(s): 
- 
- Anaphylactic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate treatment 
(refer to Appendix I  for definition of Anaphylaxis) 
- Severe injection site reactions (see Appendix J )  
- Tuberculosis or initiation of medications for suspected tuberculosis 
- Acute renal failure (see Appendix K ).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   Page 65  10.4.2 Serious adverse events waived from expedited regulatory reporting to regulatory 
authorities 
Disease progression is anticipated for the disease being treated (ie, dcSSc) and will be considered 
expected for the purpose of regulatory reporting.  Conversely, an event more severe than the 
anticipated course of usual disease progression is to be considered unexpected and should be 
reported. 
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the drug and the event (S[LOCATION_003]R ), the event must be reported, even if it is a 
component of the study endpoint. 
10.4.3 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relations hip to IMP, spanning from the signature [CONTACT_587773] [CONTACT_587762], are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_179646](s).  
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_400335].  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485].

[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis 
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Acute allergic reactions may be defined as a llergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms 
experienced by [CONTACT_728019]. 
These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, 
hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticar ial/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. 
Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may 
begin within few hours and persist up to [ADDRESS_1238716] dosing. Refer to Appendix I "Definition of 
anaphylaxis", which describes the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
Patients should be monitored by s ite personnel or visiting nurse (i f injection is performed at the 
patient's home) for at least [ADDRESS_1238717] for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity 
reaction. 
Patients should be treated as me dically appropriate if any AEs are observed. General Allergic 
Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form will have to be completed. Sometimes transient injection s ite reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. Th ese reactions would not be considered to be 
allergic reactions, and should only be record ed on the Local Injection Site Reaction 
Complementary Form. The IMP should be temporarily di scontinued immediately if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_885381]. Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for hypersensitivity reactions to be reported as 
AESIs, and to Section  10.3 for hypersensitivity reactions requiring permanent treatment 
discontinuation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Allergic AEs with cutaneous involvement or injection site r eactions that progress (expand, 
worsen, etc.) should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon as possible, and preferably within 
[ADDRESS_1238718] becoming aware of the event. The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (eg, new medications) and 
extra-cutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled Central Laboratory assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver panel, PK, and ADA should be obtained. If at all possible, the site will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_885382]. If the photos are taken, then the copi[INVESTIGATOR_885383]

case, reason for consultation, and information bein g requested to the consulting dermatologist. 
A full consultation report should be sent by [CONTACT_56488]. The full report should contain, at a minimum, a detailed descripti on of the skin reaction (such as the morphology 
[lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [eg, scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency and presence of pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs). If a skin biopsy is done based on the dermatologist's or Investigator's medical judgment, the results of this investigation (including hi stopathology and immunofluorescence), should be 
reported. The Investigator will email or fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.

The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_179650]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The duration of IMP exposure in weeks is defined as: (last dose date + 7 – first dose date)/7, regardless of intermittent discontinuations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Compliance 
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by [CONTACT_760]. No imputation will be made for patients with missing or incomplete data. 
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Median, Min, a nd Max). The percentage of patients with 
compliance <80% will be summarized. In addition, number and percentage of patients with at

of patients with 0, (0, 20%), and >20%  under-planned dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoints 
The change in mRSS from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1238726]-baselin e data available from Week 4 to Week 24 analysis windows 
will be included in the analysis, regardless of adherence to treatment. Missing data will be accounted for by [CONTACT_757426]. The model includes th e fixed categorical effects of treatment group 
(placebo, SAR156597), randomization strata (SSc-ILD: Yes/No), time point (Week 4, Week 8, 
Week 12, Week 24), randomization strata-by-time point interaction and treatment-by-time point 
interaction, as well as the continuous fixed c ovariates of baseline mRSS value and baseline 
value-by-time point interaction. Model assumptions for normality w ill be explored prior to the 
analysis testing.  
The repeated-measures analysis will be base d on the restricted maximum likelihood method 
assuming an unstructured correlation matrix to model the within-patient errors. Denominator 
degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward-Roger approximation. This model will 
provide baseline adjusted LSmeans estimates at Week 24 for both treatment groups with their 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. To  compare SAR156597 to the placebo group, an 
appropriate contrast statement will be used to test the difference of these estimates at the 5% one-sided alpha level. The 95% and 90% confidence intervals of the difference will be provided.

As a sensitivity analysis, the change in mRSS from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1238727]-baseline data measured during the TEAE period. 
Please refer to Section  9.1.1 for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT population. Change in continuous secondary efficacy e ndpoints (HAQ-DI, observed FVC, observed DLco 
[corrected for hemoglobin]) from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1238728] rata, time point (Week 4 to Week 24), randomization 
strata-by-time point interaction a nd treatment-by-time point inter action, as well as the continuous 
fixed covariates of corresponding baseline valu e and baseline-by-time point interaction. This 
model will provide baseline adjusted LSmeans estimates at Week 24 for both treatment groups with their corresponding 95% confidence inte rvals. The SAR156597 to placebo difference of 
these estimates will be provided with its corresponding 95% and 90% confidence intervals and p-value.  
Exploratory endpoints Responder rates (proportion of patie nts with an improvement from baseline in mRSS of at least 
20%, 40% and 60%) at Week 24 and Week 35 will be analyzed using a logistic regression with 
the categorical effects of treatment group and rand omization strata and the continuous covariate of 
corresponding baseline value. This model w ill provide the SAR156597 to placebo odds ratio 
estimate and its 95% and 90% confidence intervals. The p-value will be obtained from the Wald Chi-square test. Pa tients with missing value at Week 24, re spectively Week 35, will be considered 
as non-responders.  
Change in continuous efficacy endpoints from ba seline to Week 24 (VAS from SHAQ, UCLA 
SCTC GIT 2.0, TJC28, digital ulcer count, EQ-5D-5L index) and from baseline to Week 35 
(mRSS, HAQ-DI, VAS from SHAQ, observed FVC, observed DLco [corrected for hemoglobin], 
UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0, TJC28, digital ulcer count, EQ -5D-5L index) will be analyzed using the 
same MMRM model as for the primary and continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Due to the non-normality of the distribution of % predicted FVC and % predicted DLco 
(corrected for hemoglobin), their change from baseline at Week 24 and Week 35 will be analyzed using a rank-based analysis of covariance (rank analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]) model adjusted for baseline.

and Week 35 will be compared between SAR156597 and the placebo group using a Van Elteren’s 
test stratified on randomiz ation strata. Methods to handle missi ng data will be described in the 
SAP. In addition, rate of  patients for whom the predicted pr obability of improving obtained using 
the CRISS at Week 24 and Week 35 is ≥60% will be provided. To assist in interpreting the 
clinical meaningfulness of any differences in group-level mean change for SHAQ (HAQ-DI and 
VAS) and EQ-5D-5L (index value and VAS), individual-level change will be assessed. For this, patients will be categorized as “responders” and “ non-responders” according to whether they have 
achieved a threshold of change c onsidered to be meaningful (the MIC). Patients who improve 
by ≥ the MIC will be considered as clinically impor tant responders (CIRs). As there is little data 
to support an accepted MIC value for HAQ-DI ( 20) and the SHAQ VAS assessments in dcSSc, 
estimates will be empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-derived from within this study using both distribution-based and anchor-based methods. Distribution-based methods will include one-half a SD and [ADDRESS_1238729] error of measurement (SEM) of the baseline score ( 22, 23, 24). Anchor-based methods will use 
the EQ-5D index value in which the magnitude of change in the HAQ-DI and the SHAQ VASs among patients who noted at least a 0.08 improvement in their current health  status (0-1 scale) 
will define the MIC ( 25, 26, 27). 
For the EQ-5D-5L, CIRs will be defined by [CONTACT_885422] ≥0.08 in the index value. CIRs on the 
EQ-5D VAS will be defined using the same methods as for the HAQ-DI and SHAQ VASs 
(ie, 0.5SD, 1SEM, EQ-5D index value as an anchor). 
The proportion of patients classified as CIRs w ill be assessed within th e ITT sample. Patients 
without data at the relevant time point will be classified as  non-responders. Comparison between 
groups on responder rates will be performed as described above using a logistic regression.

Acceptable forms of effective contraception include: 
• Established use of oral, intravaginal, or tr ansdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen 
containing) hormonal contraception asso ciated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Established use of oral, injectable, or implantable proge stogen-only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Male sterilisation (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of 
childbearing potential study participant and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success) 
• True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulati on, symptothermal, post- ovulation methods] and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network 
symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006 Feb;117(2):391-7. 
 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any on e of the following 3 criteria are fullfilled:  
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, prur itus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
A) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wh eeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
B) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence) 
Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours): 
A) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue eg, gene ralized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula 
B) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wh eeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
C) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
D) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy, abdominal pain, vomiting) 
Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
A) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP* 
B) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or  greater than 30% decrease from that person's 
baseline 
. 
Abbreviations: PEF = peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]; BP = blood pressure 
*Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from  1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg = [2 x age]) from 1 t o 10 years and 
less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

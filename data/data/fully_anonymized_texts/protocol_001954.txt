The formation of wrinkles at the corners of  the eyes, which are referred to as crow’s feet lines or 
LCLs, are one of the primary signs of aging that can negatively impact the assessment of a 
person’s age. The se dynamic lines appear during facial muscle contractions, like smiling, and 
over time can become permanent or static, meaning that they are still visible wh en without 
muscle contraction ( Kane , 2015).  
Minimally -invasive injectable treatments have become the most common aesthetic procedure 
worldwide (Bauma nn, 2016) with an increase  in frequency over the last decade since the first 
approval of botulinum neurotoxin Type A (OnabotulinumtoxinA; BOTOX® Cosmetic; [package 
insert]. Allergan, Inc. , 2017 ). This is largely the result of an exceptional safety profile, as well as 
the ability of  botulinum neurotoxin Type A to rejuvenate and enhance the facial area when 
compared with more invasive cosmetic procedures.  
Botulinum neurotoxin is produced by [CONTACT_78622] , which is a gram -positive, spore -
forming, anaerobic bacterium ( Carruther s, 2015 a). There are [ADDRESS_85930] types (A -G), only types A 
and B have established clinical uses due to a longer duration of action compared to the other 
types (De Boulle , 2007). Botulinum neurotoxin Type A blocks acetylcholine release into the 
neuromuscular  junction, which prevents muscle contractions in the injected  area. The onset of 
muscle weakening  typi[INVESTIGATOR_34521] [ADDRESS_85931] reported shorter or longer durations (N estor , 2017; 
Carruthers , 2015; De Boulle , 2007).  
The presence of facial  lines at rest result from a combination of factors, including repeated facial 
muscle contractions,  structural skin remodeling that occurs with aging , and damage from 
excessive sun exposure (Carruthers , 2016). Carruthers, et.al., identified [ADDRESS_85932] patterns for 
lateral canthal lines: full -fan, lower -fan, central -fan, and upper -fan. The description of these lines 
emphasizes the orientation of the lines in the lateral canthal area a nd nearby [CONTACT_78623]. As 
the dynamic patterns for LCL are further elucidated, it has become possible  for experienced 
practitioners  to customize treatment of the lateral canthal region to match the pattern of a 
patient’s lateral canthal lines.  
The effi cacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of LCL has been evaluated in a 
large -scale clinical development program consisting of 3 phase 3 studies (Carruthers , 2015b ). 
Study 1 evaluated onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of LCL alone . A tota l of 445 subjects 
with moderate to severe LCL were randomized to receive  either onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U 
(N=222) or placebo  (N=223) (Baumann, 2016) . At baseline, 60.5% of subjects had severe LCL. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator -assessed respo nse of LCL at maximum smile on 
the Facial Wrinkle Severity  (FWS)  scale at Day 30. Responder rates were significantly higher in 
the onabotulinumtoxinA -treated groups when compared with placebo. Composite investigator - 
and subject -assessed improvement of at least 2 grades from baseline scores  on the FWS at 
Day 30 were higher for the onabotulinumtoxinA -treated group (26.1%) when compared with 
placebo (1.3%) (Carruthers , 2015b).  
Study 2 was a 7 -month, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study with 
2 treatment cycles  of onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo.  A total of 917 subjects were enrolled: 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85933]  2019  23  305 subjects received onabotulinumtoxinA 44U  (24 U to LCL area and 20 U to GL area) , 
306 subjects received onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U  (12 U to LCL Area and 0 U to GL area) , and 
306 subjects received placebo  (Moers -Carpi , 2015) . The primary e fficacy outcome was based on 
investigator and subject assessments of LCL severity at maximum smile  at Day [ADDRESS_85934] 2 grades from baseline scores on the 
FWS at Day  30. For this endpoint scores were significantly higher f or the LCL -treated group 
(20.3%), and the LCL and GL treated group (21.3%) when compared with placebo (0%) . The 
proportion of responders achieving a score of 0 (none) or 1 (mild) on the FWS for LCL was 
significantly higher (as rated by [CONTACT_18003] ) at Day 30  (p <0.001) for 
the onabotulinumtoxinA group compared with the placebo group. Investigator -assessed 
responder rates were 59.0% and 54.9% in the onabotulinumtoxinA [ADDRESS_85935] responder rates at Day 30 were similar in the ona botulinumtoxinA -treated 
groups at 48.5% and 45.8%, respectively  (Moers -Carpi , 2015). In general, when GL and LCL 
were treated simultaneously, responder rates were higher than those for LCL treatment alone.  
The reported AEs for both Study 1 and Study 2 wer e mild or moderate in severity, with 58.1% of 
subjects reporting at least [ADDRESS_85936] 
frequently reported treatment -related AEs included injection site hematoma (including bruises), 
headache, and inj ection site hemorrhage, all of which occurred at a frequency of ≤3.1% in each 
of the 4 treatment cycles. Further, the incidence of treatment -related AEs tended to decline with 
repeated treatment. None of the subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE or SAE 
(Carruthers, 2015b).  
Study 3 was a 5 -month, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo -controlled extension 
study of the subjects who completed Study 2. Subjects who previously received 
onabotulinumtoxinA were eligible to receive the same dose i n this study, while subjects who 
previously received placebo were randomized in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 2 treatment arms 
to receive either onabotulinumtoxinA 44 U or placebo. In this extension study, subjects were 
eligible to receive up to 2 additio nal treatment cycles. The endpoints were similar to  Study 2 
with the primary response being the proportion of subjects achieving a score of 0 or 1 on the 
FWS at Day 30. A total of 684 subjects were enrolled: 260 to the 44 U onabotulinumtoxinA 
group, 227 to  the onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U, 101 subjects who previously received placebo and 
were randomized to the onabotulinumtoxinA 44 U group, and 96 subjects who previously 
received placebo and were randomized to the placebo group. Results were consistent with  Study 
2 with responder rates significantly higher in the onabotuli numtoxinA -treated groups at Day  30 
and at all other timepoints in cycles 3 and 4 when compared with placebo. During the 1 -year 
assessment period, 58.2% of subjects experienced at least 1 AE; however, most were mild in 
intensity. Notably, the incidence of treatment -related AEs appeared to  decline with repeated 
treatments. Treatment -related AEs, all occurring in <3.1% of subjects in each treatment cycle, 
included site hematoma, headache, and injection site hemorrhage.  
As minimally -invasive treatment becomes more widely used and accepted , and both men and 
women gain increase d awareness  of the recognition o f facial aging and the aesthetic treatm ent 
options available, it is important to  continue examining  the potenti al benefits of such treatments 
in the context of unmet clinical need , improved  self-satisfaction,  and increased demand.  
Aesthetic products and procedures, while not medically necessary, can significantly improve

5.3. Informed Consent and Authorization to Release Health Information  
Written in formed consent will be obtained from all subjects before any study -related procedures 
(including any screening procedures) are performed. The i nvestigator may discuss the study  and 
the possibility for entry with a potential subject without first obtaining consent. However, a 
subject wishing to participate must give written informed consent prior to any study -related 
procedures being conducted, including those performed solely for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for study participation, including with drawal from current medication (if required prior 
to study e ntry). The i nvestigator has both the ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each 
subject being considered for inclusion in this study  has been given a full explanation of the 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85952] will sign the consent form that has been approved by [CONTACT_78626]/IEC that was 
responsible f or protocol approval. Each informed consent document must adhere to the ethical 
principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and will include the elements required by [CONTACT_78627] [ADDRESS_85953]’s records and medical history for study rel ated purposes.  
Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subject and fully explained 
by [CONTACT_093] (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject understands the 
implications and risks of participating in the study, the IRB/IEC approved consent document 
shall be signed and dated by [CONTACT_78628] (i nvestigator or 
designee), and by [CONTACT_78629]/IEC or other regulatory authorities. The 
subject will be given a copy of the signed informed consent document with the original kept on 
file by [CONTACT_737]. All of the above activities must be completed before any study related 
procedures are conducted (including any screening study procedures).  
5.4. Lifestyle Consid erations  
While enrolled in this study, subjects must agree to refrain from receiving non -ablative laser or 
light treatments, microdermabrasion, or chemical peels (medium depth or deeper , for example 
TCA or phenol ) in the treatment areas within [ADDRESS_85954] requires immediate intervention, 
based on the judgment of the investigator (or a responsible, appropriately tra ined professional). 
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emerge ncy, accident, or 
mistake, the i nvestigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_78630] . This will allow an early join t decision regarding the subject’s continuation 
in the study . This deci sion will be documented by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and Revance or designee . 
5.6. Pregnancy  
All WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study  (e.g.,  
oral contrac eptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], injection, implant, patch, vaginal ring, intrauterine coil, intrauterine 
device, tubal ligation, barrier method ) used WITH  an additional form of contraception (e.g., 
sponge, spermicide or condom) ; abstinence ; no heterosexual inter course;  or ha s a vasectomized 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85955] -menopausal 
(no menses for 12 consecutive months) or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.  
Before enrolling WOCBP in this study, investigators must review gu idelines  with the subject  
about study participation for WOCBP with the subject. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:  
• Informed consent document  
• Pregnancy prevention information  
• Risks to unborn child (ren) 
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional  pregnancy. 
The subject must sign the informed consent document stating that the risk factors for 
unintentional pregnancy and the consequences were discussed with her.  
During the study , all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_26819]  
(within 24  hours) if pregnancy is suspected (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The 
investigator, or qualified designee, must immediately notify Revance or designee of any female 
subject who becomes pregnant any time during study participation, record  the information on 
Revance or designee Pregnancy Notification Form  and send the form to Revance or designee. 
The investigator will be asked to follow -up with the subject periodically during the pregnancy 
for ongoing health and safety information through t erm, as applicable.  
 
If an SAE  occurs in conjunction with the pregnancy such as untoward outcome of the pregnancy 
or of the offspring (spontaneous abortion, or abnormality in the offspring) then the reporting time 
frame for an SAE must be met and SAE reporting procedures followed. In the event of a normal 
birth, follow -up with the subject will occur with a phone call until the first well visit, a t which 
time, active follow -up to the pregnancy will cease.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85956]  2019  36  6. STUDY INTERVENTION  
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, daxibotulinumtoxinA, is a purified 150 kilodalton (kDa) 
botulinum neurotoxin type A, derived from the Hall strain C. botulinum . Produced by C. 
botulinum  as a single inactive polypeptide chain of 150 kDa, daxibotulinumtoxinA undergoes 
proteolytic cleavage by [CONTACT_78631] t he fermentation culture to yield the active di -chain 
molecule comprised of a 100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain linked via both 
non-covalent interactions and a disulfide bond (Aoki , 2001). The heavy chain plays a role in 
binding, internalization,  and translocation of daxibotulinumtoxinA into neuronal  cells. The light 
chain acts as a site -specific metalloprotease causing selective clea vage and inactivation of the 
25 kDa synaptosome associated protein (SNAP -25), which is a cell membrane localized 
component of the vesicular release machinery. This cleavage of SNAP -25 by [CONTACT_78632] A blocks the synaptic vesicle exocytosis and subsequent release of 
acetylcholine , thus leading to a dose -dependent weakening of the target muscl e. 
6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered  
This is an open -label, nonrandomized study  for the treatment of moderate or severe LCL . 
Subjects will be sequentially enrolled by [CONTACT_9084]. All subjects will receive DAXI for injection  on 
Day 1 according to their assigned cohort.

Subjects will receive a single dose (consisting of 3 variable volume injections) according to 
assigned dose cohort  in this study. The DRC will convene to review available data (including 
safety and photographs/videos)  for Cohorts 1 and 2  prior to making a decision about the 
treatment of Cohort 3 . The DRC will also convene to review applicable data (safety and 
photogra phs/video) prior to making a decision about the treatment of Cohort 4.  

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85961]  DISCONTINUATION/WIT HDRAWAL  
7.1. Subject Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participatio n at any time. If the subject 
withdraws consent and discontinues from the study , the Investigator will attempt to determine 
the reason for discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s study  records and on the 
eCRF . If a subject withdraws consent because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the 
reason for withdrawal. In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to the Final Evaluation) 
and consent is withdrawn , the subject should be asked to return to the study  center to complete 
the assessments specified in the Final Evaluation Visit. Subjects who withdraw from the study  
will not be replaced . Subjects who withdraw from the study, but agree to continued follow -up, 
must be reconsented by [CONTACT_78634] (unless this 
situation was adequately described in the original informed consent form  [ICF] ). 
If at any time during the study , the Investigator determines that it is no t in the best interest of the 
subject to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation. The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject from study participation at any time if medically necessary or if the subject 
has failed to follow study  procedures or to keep follow -up appointments. Appropriate 
documentation in the subject’s study  record and eCRF regarding the reason for discontinuation 
must be completed. Prior to discontinuing a subject from study participation, the Investigator 
will discuss his/her intentions with the Medical Monitor or designee.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study  center for the required follow -up visits will be 
contact[CONTACT_78635](s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary 
visit or  elected to discontinue from the study . If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a 
minimum of 2 documented attempts ( 1 attempt on 2 different days), a registered letter will be 
sent requesting that contact [CONTACT_78636].  
Revance has the right to terminate or to stop the study  at any time. Should this be necessary, both 
Revance and the Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are 
completed.  
7.2. Lost to Follow -up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_78637] . 
Before a subject is deemed lost -to-follow -up, the study center  should make every effort to 
contact [CONTACT_423] (refer to  Section 7.1) and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The 
subject should be counseled on the importance of visit compliance and should be questioned as  
to whether he or she wishes to continue in the study.  
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85962] (refer to Section 5.3). 
8.2. Schedule of Visits and Proc edures  
It is recommended that study  visits be scheduled at approximately the same time of day 
throughout the study . The IGA -LCWS and Investigator GAIS should be performed by [CONTACT_78638]. If it is not possible t o use the same evaluator

*If positive at timepoints after study treatment, confirm by [CONTACT_78647]’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available. For each laboratory test result outside the reference range, the investigator must 
ascertain if the abnormal lab result is a clin ically significant result for that individual subject. 
Likewise, if laboratory tests are taken at follow -up visits, the investigator must ascertain if this is 
an abnormal and clinically significant change from pretreatment for that individual subject. The 
investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the 
original laboratory test.  
The investigator must sign and date all written laboratory results ( e.g., urinalys is, hematology, 
chemistry, PT, and pregnancy tests ) and note Not Clinically Significant or Clinically Significant 
for each out of range laboratory value. If a laboratory value is determined to be a clinically 
significant result for that subject , this may b e considered an AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85987]  2019  56  8.5. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.5.1.  Evaluation of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
For this protocol, an adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, 
symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically signific ant abnormal laboratory 
finding, injury or accident) that emerges or worsens following administration of investigational 
product and until the end of study  participation that  may not necessarily have a causal 
relationship to the administration of the inves tigational product. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
result), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not consider ed related to the investigational product. A treatment -emergent AE is one 
that occurs after any period of exposure to treatment.  
Pre-existing condition s, which increase in frequency or severity or a change in nature as a 
consequence of an investigational product use will also be considered an adverse event.  
An unexpected AE is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the a pplicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved 
product).  
Any change  in the study  safety evaluations, (e.g., vital signs, injection site evaluation,  
) post -treatment  determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_78648].  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes : 
• Death  
• Life-threatening, (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the subject’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] (i.e., a prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78612]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78613]/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check -ups are not SAEs by 
[CONTACT_44134])  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to the mo lecule or investigational product before conception or during 
pregnancy)  
• Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but based upon appropriate medical 
judgement may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is a significant or important medical event)  

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85988]-treatment and at each subsequent study  visit for the 
occurrence of AEs. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following 
non-leading question: “How have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and non -
serious)  will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the Final Evaluation Visit. Any AE  
reported  by [CONTACT_78649].  
All AEs will be collected from Day 1 until Week 36 or the Final Evaluation Visit at all 
timepoints as specified in the SOA (Section 1.3). Medical occurrences that begin before the start 
of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded as well . 
 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Revan ce or designee immediately within 24 hours of 
their awareness of the event. All fatal or life -threatening SAEs should be telephoned to Revance 
or the designee’s authorized representative as soon as the investigator learns of the event.  
8.5.3.  Serious Adverse Events  
The investig ator must report an SAE to Revance or the designee’s  authorized representative 
within 24 hours of their awareness of the event:  
 Complete and return an SAE Form with all information known to date; including the 
investi gator’s assessment of causality  
 Contact  [CONTACT_78650] a fatal or life -threatening event as 
soon as the investigator or study staff are aware of the event  
 Obtain  and maintain  all pertinent medical records ( e.g., discharge summary, autopsy 
report) and medical judgme nts of medical personnel who assisted in su bject’s treatment 
and follow -up 
 Provide follow -up information to Revance o r designee within 24 hours of awareness  
Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/  IECs, and i nvestigators will be notified of SAEs in accordance 
with a pplicable regulations and requirements (e.g., ICH-GCP, national regulations and local 
requirements).  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85989]  2019  58   
 
 
 
 
 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85990] scheduled study  visit (or the Final Evaluation Visit, if 
applicable ) must be recorded on the AE eCRF as ongoing.  
Any clinically significant abnormal test results, (e.g., laboratory findings ), at the final assessment  
should be followed to resolution or until determined by [CONTACT_74089]. Repeat 
tests may be indicated to establish this.  
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the end of the study , the 
Medical Monit or should be notified and every effort made by [CONTACT_78651] -
up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities  unless the 
Medical Monitor determines that follow -up is sufficient . 
8.5.6.  Follow -up of Post -Stud y Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact (or at early discontinuation, if 
applicable) must be recorded on the AE eCRF and reported to  Revance  or designee  according to 
the reporting procedures outlined in Section  8.5.[ADDRESS_85991]-to-follow -up. The investigator should continue to report any 
significant follow -up information to the Medical Monitor, Revance  or designee  and the IRB/IEC 
up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject has returned to the 
baseline state of health, or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the subject’s condition.  
Any new SAEs repor ted by [CONTACT_78652] i nvestigator that occur after the last scheduled 
contact [CONTACT_78653]/I EC. 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85992] will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the administration  of investigational p roduct; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product and/or recurs with re -administration of investigational product  
• Probable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the administration  of investiga tional product; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_78654]/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures  
• Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset 
of the AE and the administration  of investigational pro duct and a cause cannot be ruled 
out 
• Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to investigational product 
administration  
The investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event. 
Severity will be cate gorized as mild, moderate or severe according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually 
does not require intervention  
• Moderate:  Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject u ncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; 
subject may not be able to continue in the study ; treatment or other intervent ion usually 
needed

rate.  That is,  
H0: r1 = r2 =  r 3 = r4 = r5    versus  
Ha: ri ≠ rj for at least a pair of dose groups (i, j), i=1, 2, 3 or 4 and j=i+1 to 5,  
Where r i is the r esponse rate for dose group i.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size is not determined by [CONTACT_78655].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
9.3. Populations for Ana lyses  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined and the summary groups for 
analysis will be based on the actual dose for LCL  received (which is expected to be consistent 
with the enrollment cohorts):  
Population  Description  
Enrolled  All subjects  who receive the LCL treatment  
LCL -Evaluable  All enrolled subjects  who have any post -LCL  treatment 
assessment of IGA -LCWS at maximum smile   
Safety  All enrolled subjects  
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock and will 
describe the detailed methods of analysis, the subject  populations to be included in the analyses, 
and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious d ata. This section is a summary 
of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints . 
In general, desc riptive summaries will include means, standard deviations, and range for 
continuous variables , and counts  and proport ions for categor ical measures. Unless otherwise 

CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85994]  2019  62  stated otherwise, a 95% confidence interval will be provi ded for means and proportions. No 
formal hypothesis tests are planned, but group comparisons may be perf ormed as exploratory 
analyses. No multiplicity adjustments or i mputation of missing data are planned.  
9.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
Unless otherwise noted, baseline for all efficacy assessments refers to the last available 
assessment prior to LCL treatment. Efficacy outcomes will be summarized. Descriptive statistics 
will be prov ided for all efficacy variables at all timepoints.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects achieving a score or 0 or 1 
(none or mild) in LCL severity assessed by [CONTACT_78442] -LCWS at maximum smile.  The LCLs will be 
evaluated on both sides of the face and both scores will be recorded. If different ratings are 
obtained from the left and the right sides of the face, subjects will be scored using the higher 
(i.e., more severe) rating. The dose response in the proportion of responders at Week 4 will be 
explored using the logistic regression stratified by [CONTACT_78656]. 
Additional measures to assess the effectiveness outcomes will include the investigator GAIS 
evaluated at maximum  smile at each visit. Various responder endpoints associated with the 
LCWS, such as achieving certain status or certain magnitude of improvement from baseline, will 
be derived from these effectiv eness outcomes for each visit. These responder endpoints will  be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_78657].  
Duration of response will be evaluated by [CONTACT_78658] -to-event endpoints. Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
curves will be plotted by [CONTACT_78659] -to-event endpoint.  
Responder and t ime-event endpoints defined based on subject assessments for LCL wrinkle 
severity (such as PLCWS and the subject GAIS for LCL) will be summarized in the same way as 
those by [CONTACT_78660]. Similarly, the endpoints defined based on scores assesse d at 
rest will be summarized in the same way as those on scores assessed at maximum smile.  
9.4.2.  Safety Analyses  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified according to MedDRA 
terminology. Those occurring during or after treatment are co nsidered as treatment -emergent. All 
reported TEAEs will be summarized, in terms of the number of subjects reporting events, system 
organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness. For 
summarization of event causality and seriousness, subjects will be counted only once within a 
system organ class or preferred term using the event with the event with the greatest relationship 
for causality and the event with the highest severity. A summary of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation  will also be provided.  
A by -subject listing of any SAEs will be provided and all SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_78661].  
Clinical laboratory test results will be summarized by [CONTACT_78662] a shift table will be  
used to evaluate the shift in status from baseline at each visit.  
9.5. Interim Analyses  
A formal interim analysis of the data will be performed [ADDRESS_85995]  LCL treatment.

Cohor ts [ADDRESS_85997] subjec t in Cohort 3 reaches the Week 4 Visit.  Safety data will be monitored 
throughout the study by [CONTACT_78663].  
Dose escalation for LCL may be stopped at the discretion of the DRC as outlined in the DRC 
Charter.  
The full details for the roles and responsibilities of the DRC will be detailed in the study -specific 
DRC charter.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85998]’s completion of the study , the 
investigator will sign a statement indicating that all pages of the subject’s case report have been 
reviewed. Signature [CONTACT_78670] “per signatures” are not acceptable.  
It is Revance’s policy that the study  data be verifiable with the source data which  necessitates 
access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and other records for each sub ject. The 
investigator must, therefore, agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source data must be 
made available for all study  data. Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also allow access 
to their medical records. Subjects will be infor med of the importance of increased record access 
and permission granted by [CONTACT_78664].  
Checks will be performed to ensure the quality, consistency, and completeness of the data. 
Instances of  missing or un -interpretable data will be res olved with the investigator or study 
coordinator. Data queries will be sent to the study center. Site personnel will be responsible for 
providing resolutions to the data queries and for correcting the eCRFs, as appropriate. All unused 
Revance or designee study materials and binders must be returned to Revance or designee upon 
completion of the study . 
The investigator must keep written or electronic source documents for every subject participating 
in the clinical study . The subject file that identifies the study in which the subject is participating 
must include the subject’s available demographic and medical information including:  
• Name  
• Contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Medical history  
• Concomitant diseases  
• Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/medication  
• Study visit dates  
• Performed examinations, evaluations, and clinical findings  
• Investigational product administration  
• AEs, SAEs, or pregnancy (as applicable)  
Additionally, any other documents with source data, especially origina l printouts of data that 
were generated by [CONTACT_78665]’s source document (e.g., 
laboratory value listings). All these documents must have at least the subject’s initials, study 
number, and the date of the evaluation.   
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol    1820205 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_85999]  2019  65  The data recorded during the study will be documented in the eCRF and/or the study -specific 
forms. Before or at study termination, all data must be forwarded to Revance or designee. The 
data will be recorded, evaluated, and stored in anonymous form in accordance with data -
protection regulations.  
Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information (PHI) during the informed 
consent process in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements. Subjects who deny 
permission to use and dis close PHI will not be eligible to participate in the study . The 
investigator will ensure that the study documents forwarded to Revance or their designee, and 
any other documents, contain no subject names or other PHI, such as medical record number or 
date of birth.  
Any amendments and corrections necessary will be undertaken in both the source documents and 
eCRFs (as appropriate) and countersigned by [CONTACT_093], or documented designee, stating 
the date of the amendment/correction. Errors must remain le gible and may not be deleted with 
correction aids. The investigator must state his/her reason for the correction of any data. In the 
case of missing data/remarks, the entry spaces provided in the eCRF should be cancelled out to 
avoid unnecessary follow -up inquiries.  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC and/or Revance’s Quality Assurance department (or 
designee) may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for 
on-site audit or inspection. The investigator must guarantee di rect access to these documents. 
eCRFs will be kept by [CONTACT_78666] a secured area. Clinical data will be recorded in a 
computer format for subsequent statistical analyses. Data files will be stored on electronic media 
with a final master data file  kept by [CONTACT_78667].  
10.2. File Management at the Study  Center  
It is the responsibility of the investigator  to ensure that the study  center maintains all source  and 
essential documents  in accordance with ICH Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guidance, Section 8 – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Study.  
10.3. Records Retention at the Study Center  
It is a Revance requirement t hat all investigators  participating in clinical studies maintain 
detailed clinical data for one of the following periods:  
• Country -specific requirements, or  
• A period of at least [ADDRESS_86000] approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Re gulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or

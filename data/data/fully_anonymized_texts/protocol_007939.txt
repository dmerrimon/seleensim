Protocol titl e: Reactive Balance Training Targeting Both Slip - and Trip- Induced Falls  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Document date: 0 5/31/[ADDRESS_1264579] a ssigned  to either the reactive balance training ( RBT ) or control  
intervention using minimization to balance groups with respect to age, sex, and physical activity 
level.   During a baseline assessment session, participants were exposed to an unexpected 
laboratory -induced slip or trip based upon random assignment.  Starting approximately one week 
later, p articipants completed four sessions of their assigned intervention, with these sessions 
schedule d twice a week for two weeks . The post -intervention assessment occurred the following 
week , during which participant s were exposed to the other  perturbation (slip or trip) that they did 
not experience during the baseline assessment. As such, e ach participant  was exposed to one 
laboratory -induced slip and one laboratory -induced trip during the study, with one occurring 
during the  baseline assessment before intervention, and the other  during the post -assessment  
after intervention . This design was selected to evaluate gait and reactive balance prior to any 
training intervention, and to avoid any unintended training effects induced by [CONTACT_901430] s to the same perturbation more than once .   
 
Baseline and post -control/post -RBT assessments included  reactive balance tests .  Reactive 
balance was assessed in response to an unexpected laboratory -induced slip or trip while walking. 
Participant s were instructed to walk along a [ADDRESS_1264580] at a self -selected pace “as if 
you have somewhere to go” and, if slipped or tripped, to recover balance and continue walking. 
After initial walking trials to determine a self -selected gait speed, subsequent trials were 
constrained to within 0.1 m/s of this speed using verbal feedback to participants after each trial . 
After a minimum of 10 trials, participant s were exposed to a slip or trip. In brief , slips were 
induced by [CONTACT_294723] a thin layer of vegetable oil over a 0.9 ×  0.[ADDRESS_1264581] was set s o that the 
distance between the  participant ’s knee and the floor when kneeling  in the harness  was 
approximately 20 cm .  
 
Both interventions (RBT and control) involved a total of four training sessions conducted twice 
per week for t wo weeks , and in groups of 1- [ADDRESS_1264582] two training sessions involved only slip 
training, while the other involved only trip training, with the order of presentation 
counterbalanced within each particip ant group.  The subsequent  two training session s involved 
equal proportions of both slip and trip training .  For both slip and trip training , perturbation 
magnitudes were individualized to participant  capabilities, and varied in magnitude, direction, 
and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_901409]. To prevent falls, the fall protection harness was 
 
 
 
 worn during all RBT sessions.  Participant s wore their own walking or athletic shoes during 
training.  
 
RBT fo r slip training  involved participants repeatedly stepped onto a low -friction interface 
(nylon fabric placed over a 0.9 × 0.9 meter polycarbonate sheet ) while practicing 
controlling/decelerating the slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901410]- slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901411].  Both of these actions are critical to prevent a fall after slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901412].  
Training was individualized to participant capability , beginning  with a single step onto the fabric 
to induce short, slow, self -initiated slips , and progressing to walking several steps then onto the 
fabric to induce longer, faster slips , with the goal  of simulating  slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901413] . Participants 
completed 60- [ADDRESS_1264583] losses of balance ( induced by [CONTACT_901431])  were pseudo- randomly 
interspersed throughout training. Participants completed 30 trip -like perturbations during each  
training session dedicated solely to trip training, and 20 trip -like perturbations during each 
training session also involving slip training.   
 
The control intervention involved general balance exercises adapted from the Otago Exercise 
program. Briefly, al l four sessions involved balance exercises and strength exercises using ankle 
weights , and were progressive ly increased  as performance improved by [CONTACT_901432] (e.g. , not holding onto a wall or support ). 
 
  
 
 
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Separate statistical analyses were completed for slips and trips, with each analysis involving 
comparisons between three groups: 1) baseline participants exposed to a slip (or trip) during the 
baseline assessment, 2) post -control participants exposed to a slip (or trip) after the control 
intervention, and 3) post -RBT participants exposed to a slip (or trip) after RBT.  I n each analysis 
(slips or trip s), the three groups involve d were mutually exclusive.  Significant differences 
between baseline participants and post -RBT participants would provide evidence of efficacy 
based upon RBT -induced changes in fall incidence and reactive balance, while differences 
between post -control participants and post -RBT participants would provide stronger evidence for 
efficacy based upon RBT -induced changes compared to a control intervention.   
 
The primary outcome measures were peak slip speed for the slip analysis, and trunk angle at 
touchdown for the trip analysis.  Welch’s a nalysis of v ariance was used to compare continuous 
measures  between the three groups to accommodate  heterogeneity of variances  between groups. 
Whe n one group exhibited no variability, the nonparametric Kruskal -Wallis test was used. 
Where relevant, pairwise comparisons  were performed using  the Games -Howell Test , or 
nonparametric Wilcoxon test .  Fisher’s Exact test was used to compare fall incidence between 
the three groups, as well as other nominal measures.  All statistical analyses were performed 
using JMP Pro 12 (SAS  Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and a significance level of  p ≤  .05.

Section 2: Justification  
 
2.1 DESCRIBE THE BACKGROUND, PURPOSE, AND ANTICIPATED FINDINGS OF THIS 
STUDY:  
 
Falls are the leading cause of injuries among adults age [ADDRESS_1264586] fall prevention, highlight the need for more effective 
methods to reduce falls.   
 
Improved clinical evaluations are needed to identify indi viduals at an increased fall risk so that fall 
prevention interventions can be prescribed.  While general clinical tests of balance and mobility are 
available that associate with fall risk, these tests do not provide mechanistic information on specific 
pathologies, and their association with types or falls (slips or trips).  A better understanding of the 
relationship between specific pathologies and types of falls would allow more targeted, and likely more 
effective, fall prevention interventions to be pres cribed.  Common musculoskeletal pathologies 
encountered in clinical practice include joint pain, soft tissue pain, neuromuscular control limitations, and 
bone pain.  These pathologies can result in gait alterations that increase fall risk such as asymmetry , 
lower foot clearance during swing (which increases trip risk), or higher shear forces between the shoes 
and ground (which increases slip risk).  A standard osteopathic structural and postural evaluation is 
commonly used to characterize these pathologies.   However, the ability to use an osteopathic evaluation 
to identify individuals with alterations in gait that increase fall risk has not been determined.  This ability 
would increase the clinical utility of osteopathic evaluations in identifying individual s needing 
interventions to reduce fall risk, and provide information on the likely type of fall for this individual.  
 
Improved methods to train and improve balance to reduce fall risk are also needed. Task -specific, reactive 
balance training is a novel ta rgeted approach to fall prevention that has the potential to substantially 
reduce the number of falls.  Based on well -established motor learning principles, this type of balance 
training involves repeatedly exposing individuals to realistic slip -like or tr ip-like perturbations in a safe, 
controlled manner. Through repetition, this task -specific, or targeted, training can improve reactive 
balance after slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901414].  This work targets slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901415] e they are the most common causes of falls among older adults and in the workplace.  For 
example, slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901416] 25- 40% of falls among older adults, and 40 -50% of all fall -related injuries in 
the workplace, while trippi[INVESTIGATOR_901417] 50% of falls amon g older adults, and 23 -32% of falls among 
workers.   
 
While task- specific, reactive balance training shows promise in reducing fall risk, current methods to 
administer this training have important limitations. First, current methods require significant equ ipment 
and space resources, which severely limits their feasibility for use outside of the research setting.  
Second, current methods only attempted to train reactive balance after slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901418], but not 
both.  The high prevalence of these typ es of falls warrants efforts to reduce both while not increasing the 
risk of either type of fall.  Thus, methods are needed to train reactive balance after both slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901419], and do so in a manner that is low -cost and requires manageable space resources to facilitate its 
use outside the lab.  
  
We have two research objectives.  First, we aim to explore the relationship between standard osteopathic 
musculoskeletal evaluation and lab -based gait measures associated with fall risk.  Second, we aim to 
evaluate the efficacy of the Virginia Tech Balance Training System (System) on improving reactive 
balance and fall rates after lab -induced slips and trips.  No studies have attempted low -cost and low -tech 
reactive balance training that would make it feasible  outside of the lab, and simultaneously train reactive 
balance after slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901420].  Thus, the proposed work will address an important barrier to 
progress in balance training, and help secure Virginia Tech’s position as a world -leader in state- of-the-art 
balance training for fall prevention.  
 
Our anticipated findings are that 1) an osteopathic musculoskeletal evaluation will be predictive of lab -
based gait measures associated with fall risk; 2) the System will improve reactive balance and fall rates 
after lab -induced slip and trips.  This latter is based upon our work showing i mproved reactive responses 
trippi[INVESTIGATOR_901421], and improved reactive response after slip training among 
young adults.

Section 3: Recruitment  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1264587] POOL, INCLUDING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
AND NUMBER OF SUBJECTS:  
Examples of inclusion/exclusion criteria -  gender, age, health status, ethnicity  
 
Subjects will include [ADDRESS_1264588] be 1) age 50- 75, 2) able to stand 
and/or walk for 30 minutes without pain or any mobility aid, 3) not have  experienced a fragility fracture 
within the last 10 years, 4) not currently smoke, or 5) not currently receive physical therapy.   
 
After passing this questionnaire, a DXA scan (in the Human Integrative Physiology Lab  on the VT campus) 
will be performed to exclude individuals with a proximal femur t- score < -2.0.   
 
After passing the DXA scan, the medical screening will be performed, and will include a history and 
osteopathic evaluation.  The goal of this history and osteopathic evaluation is  two-fold:  First, it will 
exclude from futher testing adults who may be at an increased risk for medical harm during our balance 
testing  and training  protocol described below .  It will exclude adults with major unstable cardiopulmonary 
disease, or evidence of any progressive or unstable medical condition that could account for possible 
imbalance and falls (i.e. history of cerebrovascular event, Parkinsons, transient ischemic attack, serious 
uncorrected visual or somatosensory impairment).  Second, the data  from the osteopathic evalution will 
be used to explore its relationship with balance testing described below .   
 
Medical screenings, as well as adjudication for participation in subsequent balance testing and training,  
will be performed by [CONTACT_6283]. Woodson or  Brolinson.

Section 5: Procedures  
 
5.1 PROVIDE A STEP -BY-STEP THOROUGH EXPLANATION OF ALL STUDY PROCEDURES 
EXPECTED FROM STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING TIME COMMITMENT & 
LOCATION:  
 
Screening questionnaire  
Subjects will first be required to pass a questionnaire, over the phone or in person, to ensure the 
prospective subject meets the eligibility requirements.  Subjects must be 1) age 50 -75, 2) able to stand 
and/or walk for 30 minutes without pain or any mobi lity aid, 3) not have experienced a fragility fracture 
within the last 10 years, 4) not currently smoke, or 5) not currently receive physical therapy.  (5 minutes) 
 
DXA Scan  
Subjects will be required to pass a DXA scan (in the Human Integrative Physiology Lab on the VT campus) 
to exclude individuals with a proximal femur t- score < - 2.0.  (30 minutes)  
 
Medical History and Osteopathic Evaluation  
A medical history and standard osteopathic musculoskeletal evaluation will be performed at the Virginia 
College of Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM) .  The osteopathic evaluation will involve  appendicular palpation  
and evaluation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_901423], somatic dysfunction, reflexes, and motor activity.  (30 minutes)  
 
Pre-Intervention Evaluation  
Gait and reactive balance after slippi[INVESTIGATOR_901424].  These sessions will take place in the 
laboratory (556 Whittemore Hall).   Subjects will be instructed to walk repeatedly back- and-forth along a 
10-m long walkway and, if slipped or tripped,  recover balance naturally and continue walking.  Walking 
speed will be constrained to 1.3 ± 0.1 m/s.  Subjects will initially perform a minimum of 20 walking trials to 
familiarize themselves with the experimental setup.  After complet ing these walking tri als, subjects will be 
slipped or tripped.  Slips will be induced by [CONTACT_294723] a thin layer of oil -based lubricant over a 1 m^[ADDRESS_1264591]. All subjects will wear 
the same model of shoes  during slip and trip trials .  (1.5 hours)  
 
Intervention  session :  The intervention will involve four [ADDRESS_1264592] in the laboratory (556 Whittemore Hall) . Half of each 
training session will involve repeatedly e xposing subjects to slip -like perturbations using a protocol 
developed by [CONTACT_862331] p. During slip training,  subjects step onto a low -friction interface to induce a "slip" 
and practice slip -recovery responses.  The other half of each training session will inv olve repeatedly 
exposing subjects to trip -like perturbations. Half of subjects will experience trip -like perturbations 
induced by a modified treadmill, while the other half will experience trip -like perturbations induced by 
[CONTACT_901433] a static forward le an. The modified treadmill induces trip -like perturbations by [CONTACT_901434] a prescribed speed, causing a forward loss of balance and requiring steps to 
recover balance. Release from a static forward lean involves holding subjects at a prescribed forward lean 
angle using a belt that is tethered to a wall. Release of the tether causes a forward loss of balance and 
 [ADDRESS_1264593] 
capabilities, and be varied to improve motor learning.  (each of these sessions will be 45 minutes)  
 
Post -Intervention Evaluation  
The same protocol as during the Pre -Intervention Evaluation will be repeated.  (1.5 hours)  
 
5.2 DESCRIBE HOW DATA WILL BE COLLECTED AND RECORDED:  
 
The data that will be recorded for further analysis will be obtained during: 1) the osteopathic evaluation, 2) 
the pre -intervention evaluation, and 3) the post- intervention evaluation.   
 
Data from the osteopathic evaluation will include paper forms completed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] s. Woodson or Brolinson 
during these evaluations.  Data during the pre -intervention and post- intervention evaluations will include  
non-invasive measurements of movement during walking trials, slippi[INVESTIGATOR_562427], and trippi[INVESTIGATOR_562427].  Non-
invasive measurements  of movement will be obtained using a motion capture system,  interial 
measurement unit,  electromyography, and force platforms embedded in a  walkway.  These data will be 
saved on a limited -access computer network .

Section 6: Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS (E.G., EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL, 
ECONOMIC, OR DIGNITY) TO STUDY PARTICIPANTS?  
 
There are potential risks for subjects in the proposed work. As with any physical activity, there is the 
potential for subj ects to experience musculoskeletal soreness after testing or training.  During testing and 
training, there is the potential for muscle strains, joint strains, other soft tissue injury, or broken bones.   
 
 7 6.2 EXPLAIN THE STUDY’S EFFORTS TO REDUCE POTENTIAL RISKS TO SUBJECTS:  
 
Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_2329] a medical screening to exclude individuals at an increased risk of injury, 
experienced personnel and safe research practices, an d a fall prevention harness system to prevent 
impact with the foot in the event of a fall.  The fall prevention harness will be worn during all gait trials, 
balance training , and trials that may involve a slip and  trip. The harness will be adjusted such that, in the 
event of an unsuccessful balance recovery, neither the fingertips or knees will be able to touch  the floor.  
 
To prevent injury or discomfort to the toe  during trials that my involve a slip or trip , sub jects will wear 
sneakers with a stiff toe.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1264595] ANTICIPATED BENEFITS TO STUDY 
PARTICIPANTS AND/OR SOCIETY?  
 
Subjects  may benefit from training by [CONTACT_901436][INVESTIGATOR_901425] .  Subjects may also benefit from the medical screening and DXA.  For example, in prior work 
requiring DXA, we were able to diagnose individuals with osteoporosis who did not realize they  had it.  
 
 
The benefit to society would be an improved understanding of how  osteopathic assessments can be used 
to evaluate fall risk, and further development of the Virginia Tech Balance Training System  that can be 
used to help prevent slip and trip -induc ed falls in subsequent work.

Criteria A - The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects:        
Criteria B -  The alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects:        
Criteria C - The research could not practicably be carried out without the alteration:        
Criteria D -  (Optional) Subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after  participation 
(i.e., debriefing for studies involving deception):        
 
By [CONTACT_6073], studies involving deception cannot provide subjects with a complete description of the study during 
the consent process; therefore, the IRB must allow (by [CONTACT_55938]) a consent process 
which does not include, or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent.  
 
The IRB requests that the researcher use the titl e “Information Sheet” instead of “Consent Form” on the 
document used to obtain subjects’ signatures to participate in the research. This will adequately reflect the fact 
that the subject cannot fully consent to the research without the researcher fully dis closing the true intent of 
the research.

 2 Template Version Date: 1/16/2018  How long will I be in this research?  
 
We expect that your ta king part in this research will last about four weeks.  This includes a two-
stage medical screening, and a total of six experimental sessions: two [ADDRESS_1264609] on the Virginia Tech campus.  
 
What happens to me if I agree to take part in this research?  
 
You will be asked to first pass a two -stage medical screening.  The screening is used to exclude 
individuals who are at an eleva ted risk of injury during the study.  The first stage will involve a 
bone -density scan to ensure that you do not have osteoporosis.  This will be accomplished by 
[CONTACT_41680] a low -dosage x -ray (dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry) of your hip bone.  This x -ray 
applies the same approximate dosage of radiation as flying across the country in an airplane.  
The second stage will involve a medical history and osteopathic evaluation performed by a 
physician.  
 
For subjects who pass the medical screening, participation in volves six experimental sessions: 
two [ADDRESS_1264610].  During all trials, you will wear a full -body safety harness to 
keep you safe and prevent a fall t o the floor.  
 
The 45 -minute balance training sessions will involve the Virginia Tech Balance Training 
System, which includes balance training exercises. During training, you will also wear a full -
body safety harness to keep you safe and prevent a fall to t he floor.   
 
What are my responsibilities if I take part in this research?  
 
If you take part in this research, you will be responsible to:   
 Answer questions truthfully during the screening process.  
 Follow the instructions of the investigator(s).

Welcome to BRANY IRB! This serves as notice that BRANY IRB oversight for the above 
referenced study is effective 5/31/2019. An assessment of the records provided to BRANY IRB 
for the study is in progress. The records will now reside in BRANY’s IRBManager system, and are 
being evaluated for completeness. You will be notified once the record evaluation is complete.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you! Next Steps:
Notify study subjects of the change in IRB oversight using one of the forms attached.
Use the Consent Form Addendum for your study if you will continue to have in-person 
encounters with the subjects. Subjects may sign the addendum at the next study visit.
Use the Letter to Subjects for your study if no in-person subject encounters remain 
(e.g., subjects are in long-term follow-up). You should mail the letter to these subjects as 
soon as possible, but no later than within the next 30 days.

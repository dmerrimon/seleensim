Brief overview: This phase II trial is studying risk -directed therapy (standard and high risk 
participants will receive different therapy) for precursor B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or 
lymphoma in first relapse.  
Interventions:  
Biologicals : rituximab, Interleukin -2 
Drugs : vincristine, dexamethasone, clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, PEG - 
asparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, leucovorin, cytarabine, 
mitoxantrone, teniposide, vinblastine, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib  
Device : Clini MACS™ System  
Procedure : Intrathecal chemotherapy (ITMHA), NK cell infusions, allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT)  
Other : CNS irradiation, testicular irradiation  
Brief outline of treatment plan: The general treatment plan will consist of chemotherapy for 
standard -risk participants and chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_794457] B -precursor ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Remission induction for all 
participants cons ists of three blocks of therapy, wherein the first block is a novel 
immunotherapy regimen that includes cytotoxic chemotherapy, rituximab and infusion of 
haploidentical NK cells. Standard -risk patients will continue to receive chemotherapy for a total 
duration of approximately [ADDRESS_1095509].  
Study design: Phase II multi -center, non -randomized trial. Primary outcome m easure is 3 - 
year survival rate.  
Sample size: 40 evaluable participants over 6 years.  
Data management: Data management and statistical analysis will be provided locally by  [CONTACT_794458], Leukemia/Lymphoma Division 
and Biostatistics Department at St. Jude Children’s Research  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Human subjects: The primary risk to participants in this research study is toxicity from the 
multi -modality therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For patients with relapsed ALL, there is no salvage regimen that offers 
a good cure rate. The current standard of care is intensive chemotherapy using di fferent 
regimens, and allogeneic transplant for those who have a suitable donor. The primary objective 
of this study is to increase the [ADDRESS_1095510]. Jude

1.3.[ADDRESS_1095521] Jude Total XV study, the estimated 5 -year event -free survival 
(EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all 498 patients were 85.6% and 93.5% 
respectively.1 On the other hand, for children who relapse outcome is generally poor 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_794363].2 In particular, outcome for those who relapse while still 
on therapy is dismal across multiple co -operative group and single institution studies 
(5-year OS between 11% and 29%).3,[ADDRESS_1095522] Jude ALLR16 
study, which utilized an upfront topotecan window treatment followed by [CONTACT_794460] -agent c hemotherapy, demonstrated a 5 -year OS of 40% while in the subsequent 
ALLR17 study with an etoposide and teniposide based regimen 3 -year OS estimate is 
49% for all patients. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. The 
outcome for patients w ith primary induction failure is also poor .5 The 10 -year 
survival rate is estimated at 32%. Thus, these patients will be eligible for  ALLR18.  
An exception is children < 6 years of age with induction failure and favorable 
cytogenetics (hyperdiploidy or ETV6 -RUNX1). This group of patients has a higher 
survival rate of approximately 72% with chemotherapy alone and will be excluded 
from ALLR18.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1095523] is an excellent surrogate marker for relapse free survival .4 Interim analyses of 
ALLR17 revealed that 71% of participants continue to be MRD positive at the end 
of remission induction therapy and the out come of these participants is poor.  
Similar results have been reported by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group.[ADDRESS_1095524] positivity by [CONTACT_14662] a 
novel immunotherapy regimen of rituximab, cytotoxic chemotherapy and  
haploidentical NK cells. The hypotheses for the induction regimen in ALLR18 are:  
 
1) Immunotherapy with the anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab can 
be given safely in children with relapsed precursor B -cell ALL in 
combination with cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  
2) Pre-treatment with dexamethasone will cause up -regulation of CD20 
expression in relapsed ALL blasts leading to increased rituximab mediated 
cell kill.

3) NK cell infusions from a haploidentical donor in addition to direct anti- 
leukemia effects  will enhance efficacy of  rituximab.  
4) Cytotoxic chemotherapy will be synergistic with rituximab and will also 
augment NK cell function by [CONTACT_794461].  
5) This strategy will lower MRD levels, improve complete remission (CR) 
rates and ultimately event free  survival.  
 
2.1.1 Rationale for ritu ximab  
 
The CD20 antigen is a B -cell specific marker which is expressed on the surface of 
B-lymphocytes from the pre B -cell stage through the memory cell stage.  
Rituximab, a chimeric anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody is approved by [CONTACT_794462] -Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia. In the pediatric setting, rituximab is shown to be safe and 
efficacious in immune mediated disorders and non -Hodgkin ly mphoma.6-8 Though 
all its mechanisms of action are not completely understood, rituximab’s anti -tumor 
effects are attributed to direct inhibition of signaling pathways, complement 
mediated cytotoxicity and antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) .[ADDRESS_1095526] also demonstrated synergy with cytotoxic chemotherapy.9 Rituximab 
has been extensively used for the treatment of lymphomas but its use in ALL is 
limited. Nevertheless, a recent study in adult patients with ALL incorpora ted 
rituximab in a backbone of multi -agent chemotherapy (HyperCVAD) and 
demonstrated a survival benefit in patients less than 60 years (3 -year overall 
survival rates of 75% versus 47% with standard HyperCVAD alone).[ADDRESS_1095527] 
in this agent was ignited by a study showing that pretreatment of leukemic blasts 
with steroids either in vitro or in vivo caused up -regulation of CD20 and increased 
their su sceptibility to rituximab in vitro .11 At diagnosis, 52% of patients expressed 
CD20 on their peripheral blood blasts while on Day 8 of therapy, CD20 expression 
was noted in 75% of patients. These finding, which we have confir med in 
preliminary results at St Jude, suggest that rituximab therapy could be  incorporated 
in the treatment of ALL and can potentially augment leukemic cell  kill. 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1095528] induction  block  
 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy will include clofarabine, a highly active nucleoside 
analog approved by [CONTACT_794463]/refractory ALL.12,13 
Clofarabine was rationally designed as a hybrid molecule to improve the activity 
and overcome the toxicities associated with fludarabine and cladribine. The 
cytotoxic effects of clofarabine are due to its inhibition of DNA synthesis and 
repair, induction of apoptosis and possibly other mechanisms .14 In the pediatric 
phase 1 study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 52 
mg/m2/day for 5 days. Of the 17 ALL patients enrolled, 4 achieved CR and one 
PR, resulting in an overall response rate of 29%.12 Dose limiting toxicities were 
reversible elevations in transaminases and skin rash. In the pediatric phase II 
study, 61 patients with ALL were enrolled and the overall response rate was

30%.[ADDRESS_1095530] demonstrated synergy between clofarabine and the 
alkylator cyclophosphamide .16 Cells treated with clofarabine impede repair of 
cyclophosphamide induced DNA damage. In the multicenter pedia tric phase I 
CLO -218 study, clofarabine was given in combination with cyclophosphamide 
and etoposide.17 Dose escalation was performed for all three drugs. An MTD was 
not reached, but the recommended phase II doses for the th ree agents were 40, 
440 and 100 mg/m2/day respectively for 5 consecutive days. The overall response 
rate for the 20 ALL patients enrolled was 55% (9 CR and 2 CRp). Treatment 
related toxicities were mainly infectious with documented infections in 72% of 
patients. Elevation in transaminases was commonly noted. This combination of 
agents has been subsequently used for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL 
by [CONTACT_794464]. Three reports are available: a study of [ADDRESS_1095531] infectious agents (bacterial and fungal) will be 
required. Due to anticipated risk of increased hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression 
and infections  in patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant, these 
patients will be evaluated in a separate stratum for toxicity.  
 
2.1.3 Rationale for the addition of NK  cells 
 
NK cells are normal lymphocytes that can kill target cells without the need for 
prior sensitization or activation. The ability of NK cells to perceive alterations in 
target cells is mediated by a balance of signals through many surface receptors 
including KIRs and activating receptors such as CD16a. CD16a is a low -affinity 
transmembrane Fragment c gamma receptor IIIA (FcγRIIIA) found predominantly 
in NK cells and is essential for ADCC .21 The FcγRIIIA binds clustered IgG 
molec ules bound to antigens on the cell surface of target cells and does not bind 
circulating monomeric IgG. Therefore, ADCC is highly specific and occurs only 
when the target cells are coated with antibody. The CD16b (FcγRIIIB) GPI -linked 
form on neutrophils b inds to IgG but is inefficient in inducing any signal or 
functional effect.[ADDRESS_1095532] is to adoptively 
transfer normal NK cells from a healthy donor to the patients. This is particularly 
important in this protocol, as the patient’s NK cell number and function are

of KIRs, adhesion molecules, intracellular cytokines, perforin, and granzyme B in 
NK cells was not significantly different before and after cell purification. Extensive 
proliferative capacity and potent antitumor activity of the NK cells were 
demonstrated  by [CONTACT_794466] .[ADDRESS_1095535] cohort of 10 patients from the NKAML protocol (FDA IDE [ZIP_CODE]) 
were published recently.24 This study demonstrated that haploidentical NK cell 
infusions were safe, feasible, and efficacious. The conditioning, IL -2, and NK cell 
transplantation were all well tolerated. The median NK cell dose was 27 x 106/kg 
(range, 5 to 80 x 106/kg). The average hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794365] [ADDRESS_1095536] K562 cells normalized in all 
patients by [CONTACT_2006] 7 after NK cell transplantation. Importantly, there was a 
significant expansion of KIR mismatched cells in the blood, from a median of 
only 210/ml on Day 2 to a median of 5,800/ml on day 14.  
 
The secon d strategy to optimize NK cell therapy in this protocol is the use of 
chemotherapy that is efficacious in ALL to induce cytopenia and to up -regulate 
stress ligand expression before rituximab and NK cell administration. We have 
shown that T cell activity ma y dominate NK cell activity; thus, T -cell 
lymphopenia may facilitate NK cell function .25,[ADDRESS_1095537]. Jude in selecting an optimal KIR mismatched donor .29

2.1.4 Induction Block  II 
 
Two doses of HDMTX 5 g/m2 will be given a week apart together with 6MP. This 
regimen was used in Total XIV and will provide good CNS coverage. The second 
dose of methotrexate will be targeted to achieve a steady -state plasma 
concentration of 65 µM as has been done in our frontline studies since Total XV. 
Our goals are to continue to avoid unacceptably low concentrations (albeit in a 
small % of courses), minimize unacceptably high concentrations and avoid GI 
toxicity. Using this approach, we had only 5.1% of courses with grade 3 -4 
mucositis (compared to as high as 44% of courses with BFM’s administration of 5 
g/m2 without targeting). In patients who have experienced renal dysfunction, 
require concurrent drugs that might affect MTX clearance, or who are otherwise 
unstable, we will empl oy intra -course targeting of HDMTX.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/18/2019  Protocol document date: [ADDRESS_1095544] of giving oral 
mercaptopurine (MP) with food or with dairy produc ts, or giving 6MP at different 
times of day have produced variable results. All of the early studies32-34 enrolled 
small numbers of patients and revealed trends in differences in peak plasma 
concentrations of parent drug or plasma area -under -the-concentration -time curve 
(AUC), but these results were not statistically significant. Other studies35,36 reported 
statistically significant differences in time of maximum  drug concentration in 
plasma (tmax) and AUC in the fasting state of parent drug35 or changes in ALL 
disease free survival36 associated with time of day of oral 6MP administration (with 
better  results reported for nighttime drug administration in that the risk of relapse 
was 4.6 times greater with the morning administration schedule).  
 
However, these older studies did not assess these variables in the context of 
treatment protocols that utilize  erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) levels 
to guide therapy adjustments, nor did they include thiopurine dosing as part of 
multivariate analyses for outcome predictors. A more recent study of 532 patients 
by [CONTACT_158043] (2014) used a Cox multivariat e model to show that the circadian 
schedule (morning vs. evening vs. mixed) of MTX/6MP was not of prognostic 
significance for the risk of relapse, and the 10 -year cumulative relapse risk was 
below 20% in all groups.37 
 
A separate recent study assessed the effects of “pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking” habits on treatment 
adherence, erythrocyte TGN levels & relapse risk in 441 children enrolled on the 
COG AALL03N1 study.38 This study reported no association between relapse risk 
and whether 6MP was taken with food (p=0.5), with dairy (p=0.2), whether tablets 
were swallowed whole vs. crushing/chewing (p=0.7); IV), or time of day: 
evening/night vs. morning/mid -day (p=0.9), vary ing times vs. non -varying times 
(p=0.9). The 6MP taking habits were also not associated with DI - and age -adjusted 
TGN levels. The authors concluded that the commonly practiced restrictions 
concerning administration with food or at bedtime did not significa ntly influence 
outcome in their protocol and patient cohort.  
 
Based on these larger and newer studies, that include more careful attention to 
6MP dosing than was true in the earlier studies, and on the fact that 6MP dose is 
adjusted to desired blood counts , we propose to lift the restrictions concerning 
administering MP at bedtime and on an empty stomach to allow patients to take 
6MP at a time of day which is most likely to yield full adherence to the prescribed 
daily dosing of 6MP. As for any daily drug, w e recommend that parents 
administer and/or patients take 6MP at a consistent time every day. We also 
strongly recommend that erythrocyte TGN levels continue to be monitored to 
guide 6MP therapy (detect non -adherence and/or inappropriate dosing). Likewise, 
TPMT phenotype/genotype should continue to be assessed for each patient to 
guide the selection of optimal 6MP dosages for each patient. Finally, ALL 
continuation therapy should continue to be guided by [CONTACT_794467], with dosage adj usted made as stipulated in the primary ALL 
treatment protocol.32-40

overall survival was 69% in patients who received mitoxantrone in induction 
versus 45.2% in patients randomized to receive idarubicin. In addition, patients 
are not exposed to mitoxantrone in frontline studies for ALL and it is anticipated 
that the use of this agent will circumvent drug resistanc e. High dose cytarabine 
will provide good CNS coverage.  
 
2.2 Re-Induction  
 
A five day course of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide along with 
non-myelosuppressive agents dexamethasone, vincristine and PEG -asparaginase, 
similar to Block I induction (wi thout rituximab and NK cells) will be used to 
consolidate remission.  
 
2.3 Continuation and Interim  Continuation  
 
These phases are similar to ALLR17 with the use of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_794368] 
(modeled after Total XI and ALLR11). This continuation regimen is well 
tolerated in an outpatient setting. Four weeks of this regimen will be used as 
interim continuation betwee n the induction Block III and re -induction phases to 
allow time for recovery from intensive chemotherapy. During continuation 
cyclophosphamide and etoposide will be omitted as patients would have received 
these agents during the induction and re -induction blocks. We will use vinblastine 
in interim continuation and alternating with vincristine in weeks 4 and 8 of each 
cycle of continuation. There are in vitro data showing sensitivity of ALL to 
vinblastine .44 Considering the he matological toxicity of vinblastine, the dose will 
be adjusted according to the patient’s ANC.  
 
Additional interim continuation weeks of chemotherapy will also be given to the 
occasional patients who are deemed unable to tolerate intensive therapy as 
presc ribed by [CONTACT_1758]. Criteria include but are not limited to systemic fungal 
infection, severe thrombosis or grade [ADDRESS_1095547] -risk patients (i.e. late relapse) with positive MRD (≥0.01%)

study, the 12 month EFS was 80% versus 48% in patients with positive versus

for HSCT, they may continue to re -induction therapy or be offered alternate 
studies. They will receive HSCT as soon as MRD is negative and a suitable donor 
is availab le. 
 
2.5 Background and Rationale for Biologic and Ancillary  Studies  
 
2.5.1 Minimal residual disease  (MRD)  
 
MRD is an excellent surrogate marker for response and survival in childhood 
ALL at initial diagnosis.[ADDRESS_1095552] (≥ 0.01%) at 
the end of [ADDRESS_1095553] Jude ALLR11 and ALLR15 studies, the 
cumulative incidence of second relapse was 70.2% for MRD positive patients (≥ 
0.01%) versus 28% for MRD negative patients (p=0.008) .45 In the COG 
AALL01P2 study, the 12 month EFS was 80% versus 48% in patients with 
positive versus negative MRD at the end of the first block of remission induction 
therapy.[ADDRESS_1095554] positive at  the end of re - 
induction therapy is relatively high: 68% in AALL01P2 and 71% in ALLR17.  
Thus, in ALLR18, we will attempt to decrease the rate of MRD positivity by 
[CONTACT_14662] a novel induction regimen. It remains unclear whether patients with 
insufficient r eduction of MRD can be salvaged by [CONTACT_794468].  
 
2.5.2 CD20  expression  
 
The CD20 antigen is expressed on the surface of peripheral blood B -lymphoblasts 
in approximately 50% of patients with precursor B -cell ALL.11 The 
administration of steroids increased this proportion to 75% by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_1095555] three weeks of induction Block I to study the kinetics of 
CD20 expression in relation to the various components of therapy.

exert potent anti -leukemia effects if the cognate MHC class I epi[INVESTIGATOR_794369]’s leukemia cells for the d onor’s inhibitory KIRs. In a landmark article 
evaluating NK cell alloreactivity in [ADDRESS_1095558], those with KIR -ligand incompatibility (including 
patients with ALL, CML, and MDS) had higher probabilities of overall survival 
and disease free survival and lower rates o f transplant -related mortality and 
relapse.[ADDRESS_1095559] there 
will be variability in both pre -existing asparaginase antibodies and in the 
development of antibodies on ALLR18. We will incorporate  single serum 
samples to measure antibodies to asparaginase as well as to measure asparaginase 
activity in serum (which may be affected by [CONTACT_794470]).  
Antibodies against native E. coli (Elspar), PEGylated E. coli (Oncaspar), and 
Erwinia asparaginase are measured by [CONTACT_794471]. Those with possible allergic 
reactions will also have measurement of anti -asparaginase antibodies and 
asparaginase at the time of the reaction and, if re -challenged, after the next dose. 
Aspara ginase will be measured using a spectrophotometric assay based on 
conversion of asparagine to aspartic acid .52 These measures will be available to 
use as covariates in analyses of objectives 1.1.1 and 1.2.1.

2.5.5 Surveillance for antibiotic resistance (completed with amendment  3.0) 
 
A COG study evaluating a [ADDRESS_1095561] marrow relapse noted the rate of febrile neutropenia and 
clinically or microbiologically docu mented infections to be 59.7%, 39.6% and 
79.4% per block of therapy.[ADDRESS_1095562] led to the 
initiation of a phase I study of survivin antagonists in relapsed ALL. Studies of 
DNA changes (copy number variations, loss of heterozygosity) at St Jude have 
provided insights into the clonal ev olution of relapse58 and a recent re -sequencing 
effort identified novel mutations including those in the CREBBP gene at relapse.59 
Another study of matched samples from the Children’s Oncology group identified 
deletions of the MSH6 gene in a subset of patients specifically at relapse.60 The 
studies mentioned above had a limited number of patient samples  and thus it was

correlate to multiple clinical features and response. In addition, recent discoveries

2.5.7 Drug sensitivity  studies  
 
In newly diagnosed ALL, ex vivo drug sensitivity predicts long -term relapse risk, 
is associated with drug -specific gene expression patte rns, and is being coupled 
with preclinical studies in cell lines and murine models to identify determinants of 
drug sensitivity.65-67 Not much data is available for in vitro drug resistance in 
relapsed ALL though it is well known clinically that relapsed blasts are relatively 
chemo -resistant. In 1995, Klumper et al68 demonstrated that relapsed blasts 
(N=137) were highly resistant to glucocorticoids, L -asparaginase, anthracyclines 
and thiopurine s, but not to other agents like vincristine, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_794370] (N=141). In this study, matched 
samples were only available for [ADDRESS_1095565] led to the identification of genes correlating with 
sensitivity to single agents as well a s combination chemotherapy.66,67 Findings also 
point to previously unrecognized potential targets for therapeutic  intervention.  
Profiles at relapse are available in a subset of patients too. I n ALLR18, we will 
continue to study ex vivo sensitivity of primary ALL blasts to multiple anti 
leukemic agents (e.g., mercaptopurine, thioguanine, prednisolone, dexamethasone, 
vincristine, L -asparaginase, cytarabine, and daunorubicin) and/or chemo - 
sensiti vity modulators (e.g., rolipram, a PDE4B inhibitor that improves sensitivity 
to glucocorticoids).

Cells harvested from patients in ALLR18 will be used for e ngraftment into murine 
models and will contribute to the ongoing efforts at SJCRH to establish a panel of 
xenografts of high risk acute leukemia samples to serve as a resource for a range of 
studies of the biologic basis of relapse in acute leukemia, as we ll as establishing a 
platform for the preclinical testing of novel therapeutics.  
 
 
2.5.9 Resistant clones during therapy for relapsed  ALL 
 
Recent genomic profiling studies from our group and others identified somatic 
mutation within the NT5C2 gene directly relat ed to drug resistance in relapsed ALL 
(~15 -20% in T and B -lineage ALL at relapse).71,[ADDRESS_1095569] a substantial proportion of patients in this trial 
would be NT5C2 mutant. Therefore, this protocol offers a unique opportunity to 
examine the dynamics of NT5C2 mutation during therapy (e.g., the change of % 
mutant cel ls at a function of time), especially as patients progress through various 
blocks of therapy. Therefore, it is important to determine the feasibility of 
monitoring NT5C2 mutation during ALL therapy. Our ultimate goal is to examine 
the clinical value of pro spectively identifying NT5C2 mutant patients and possibility 
of implementing NT5C2 -guided treatment individualization. Bone marrow samples 
will be collected for this objective to coincide with the timing of MRD evaluations. 
Consent for TBANK is required fo r participation in these studies.

participants continue chemotherapy if MRD is negative after Blo ck II of induction. 
If the assay is unsuccessful or the specimen is inadequate, the MRD will be 
assumed negative for purposes of treatment decisions and it will be handled as 
missing data for data analysis of MRD. Repeat MRD should be obtained as soon as 
possible.  
 
Interim continuation treatment will be given to the occasional participants who are 
deemed unable to tolerate dose intensive chemotherapy. Specific criteria to use 
interim continuation therapy include disseminated fungal infection, recent 
develop ment of cerebral thrombosis, or grade [ADDRESS_1095588] of the plan for “interim continuation” as per section  
5.3. Protocol specified therapy will be resumed when the participant’s physical 
condition improves.  
 
5.1.1 General assumptions regarding chemotherapy administration for all  treatment 
phases:  
 
• The timing and duration for administration for all commercially availa ble 
agents are provided in the treatment phase sections as guidelines only. 
Variations in the timing and duration of chemotherapy infusions according to 
institutional practice or variations based on patient care needs are acceptable, 
as long as the treatin g investigator and/or PI [INVESTIGATOR_794371]. These variations will not be considered protocol 
deviations, as long as the total dose is given within 10% of protocol specified 
dose.  
• The term “day” does not refer to an absol ute calendar day. It refers to  a 
general [ADDRESS_1095589]. Jude Nursing  P&P.  
• Medication dosing may be modified for research recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794372]. Criteria 
for medication ca lculations based on body weight/body surface area can be 
found in any version of the St. Jude Formulary. Medication doses may be 
rounded to the nearest integer or to the nearest appropriate quantity when 
clinically or pharmaceutically indicated as per the M.D. and  Pharm.D.

5.1.3 Guidance during times of drug shortages and  unavailability:  
 
Treating investigators are urged to consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794373] -specified the rapy. Although these decisions may constitute “Protocol 
Violations,” they are unavoidable and made in consideration of the best interest of 
an individual patient. These will not be considered monitoring/audit findings if 
appropriately documented. All proto col deviations must be noted in the research 
database and the alterations in therapy due to the agent shortage will be captured. 
This should be accomplished by [CONTACT_45342] “dose modified” and details noted in the 
comments field. These deviations will also be noted in the Deviation Log with the 
notation “Drug substitution/reduction due to unavoidable drug 
shortage/unavailability”.

3) Donors are required to  undergo screening, examination, and testing as 
described in 21 CFR 1271 and the Guidance "Eligibility Determination  for 
Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue -Based Products 
(HCT/Ps)" to determine eligibility. This includes the  following:  
 
a) Medically approved by a non -Department of Bone Marrow 
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (St. Jude or non - St. Jude) to 
serve as an NK cell donor. Medical evaluation must be done  within 
60 days of NK cell collection (i.e. apheresis  procedure).  
b) Medicall y cleared by [CONTACT_794474] 7 days of apheresis  procedure.  
c) Infectious disease testing within [ADDRESS_1095599] one HLA -haplotype with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794379]. 
Specific exclusion criteria include pregnancy and any other medical condition 
that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_794380], precludes performance of an 
apheresis proced ure. If a suitable donor is not available, NK cell therapy as well 
as IL2 administration will be omitted. Subsequent chemotherapy can be initiated  a 
week earlier (i.e., chemotherapy planned day 20 onwards can begin on day  14). 
 
Histocompatibility testing is performed in a CLIA -certified, ASHI - and CAP - 
inspected laboratory of the Department of Pathology, SJCRH. Molecular techniques 
will be utilized to characterize donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794381] I gene content to the 
level sufficie nt to determine the ligand repertoire for KIR recognition.  
 
NK cell collection and selection  
 
On day 11 the donor will undergo apheresis once. The cells obtained will be 
purified for CD56+ cells by [CONTACT_112913] -step procedure described previously.[ADDRESS_1095600] Operat ing 
Procedures of the Human Applications Laboratory. For this protocol, our goal is 
to infuse immediately after processing on Day 12 all the NK cells collected to 
give >2x106 CD56+ cells/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148], but allowing for a 
CD3+CD56− cell dose o f no greater than 0.05x106 /kg. The maximum dose of 
cells that would be infused is 400 x 106 CD56+ cells/kg. The minimum dose that 
would be infused is 0.1 x 106 cells/kg . The NK cell product will undergo quality 
control testing that includes assays for via bility, sterility and purity before release 
for infusion following standard operating procedures of the Human Applications 
Laboratory.

that are in place  include:  
 
• Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for production and quality  processes  
• Documentation of Donor  Eligibility  
• Documentation of processes captured in Batch Records.  
• In-process quality control testing including  sterility  
• Release Specifications establ ished for all  products.  
• Out of Specification Reporting and Investigation  Process  
• Authorization by [CONTACT_794475].  
• Product labeling procedures with multiple person  review.  
• Variance Management  Process  
• Personnel Competence and Proficiency  Program  
• Inventory control and documentation of product history through  patient

 6.0 TREATMENT  MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Philadelphia Chromosome -Positive (Ph+)  ALL  
 
The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved the outcome of children with Ph - 
positive ALL73. Imatinib and dasatinib are the agents used most frequently in 
frontline therapy. Unfortunately, resistance develops commonly  due to point 
mutations within the kinase binding domain of BCR -ABL. By [CONTACT_794480] -performance liquid chromatography, 
these mutations can be detected in a small sub -clone of leukemic cells in 40% of 
newly diag nosed patients, but in the dominant clone in 90% at relapse, thus 
implying selective pressure of the resistant clone after treatment with tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitors.[ADDRESS_1095621] chemotherapeutic agents.78 In view of compelling preclinical data, TKIs 
will be added to frontline ther apy for patients with Ph -like ALL in Total XVII as 
well as ongoing COG studies.  
 
In addition to patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive ALL, patients 
with the Ph -like subtype of ALL and a targetable lesion will also receive a tyrosine 
kinase in hibitor. Testing for specific mutations will be done in a CLIA -approved 
laboratory and patients with fusions predicted to respond to ABL1 inhibitor will 
receive a TKI (ex. imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib). Please discuss individual cases 
with the PI.  
 
The c hoice of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in ALLR18 will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_794388]. Examples include imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib.  
 
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors  should be introduced after Day [ADDRESS_1095622]. Jude

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 6.2 PEG -Asparaginase  Allergies/Hypersensitivity  
 
Participants with allergic reactions or intolerance to PEG -asparaginase will be given 
Erwinia L-asparaginase intramusc ularly or intravenously over 30 -60 minutes 
duration.79 Each dose of PEG -asparaginase will be replaced by [CONTACT_794481] 25,000 
units/m2/dose thrice weekly (2 to 3 days apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday).  
 
Participants wit h possible allergic reactions should have measurements of anti - 
asparaginase antibodies and asparaginase at the time of the reaction and if re - 
challenged, after the next dose. Native E. coli L-asparaginase (L -asparaginase, 
Elspar®) may be given when clini cally indicated, but this should be discussed and 
approved by [CONTACT_978].

6.3.3 Timing of cranial/craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470803]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Participants who will not undergo HSCT (i.e. standard -risk participants): 
After completion of the 3rd course of continuation therapy (i.e. approximately one 
year from diagnosis of relapse). These participants will resume the protocol at  cycle 
4 of continua tion after completion of irradiation but will not receive subsequent 
intrathecal chemotherapy. A lumbar puncture will be done every four months for 
surveillance  only.  
 
Methotrexate should be given IM or as a 2 hour IV infusion if the participant has 
had pr evious cranial irradiation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Participants who will undergo HSCT (i.e. high -risk participants): 
Participants who will receive total body irradiation (TBI) for pre -transplant 
conditioning will receive a cranial irradiation boost (6 Gy) just prior to the  TBI. 
Participants who will not re ceive TBI conditioning will receive cranial or 
craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_794389] 6.3.[ADDRESS_1095624]. Jude

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Concurrent chemotherapy with  irradiation  
 
Those participants receiving cranial irradiation should only receive [ADDRESS_1095625] one week prior to and during irradiation; 
systemic chemotherapy during irradiation will include dexamethasone and 
vincristine with or w ithout PEG -asparaginase.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1095626] and PI [INVESTIGATOR_794390]. The need for testicular radiation will be 
determined for individual participants based on response to therapy, ultrasound 
findings and possibly testicular biopsy.  
 
6.5 Obesity  
 
Actual body weight will be used to calculate body surface area in all participants 
and used for dosage calculations (with the exception that vincristine dosage is 
capped at 2 mg).  
 
6.6 Infants  
 
With the exception of vincristine and mitoxantrone, all dosages given to infants (<  1 
year) will be based on body surface area. For infants < 1 month of age, or for 
infants < 3 months of age born significantly prematurely (< 36 weeks gestation), a 
50% redu ction in dosages of asparaginase, etoposide, methotrexate, thiopurines, 
cyclophosphamide, clofarabine, and cytarabine should be made. The vincristine 
dosage for participants < 12 months of age or < 10 kg weight is 0.05  mg/kg/dose.  
The mitoxantrone dose for  participants less than 10 kg is 0.4 mg/kg/dose  
 
6.7 Down Syndrome Participants  
 
Participants with Down syndrome should be closely monitored. Doses should be 
reduced (30% to 50%) as clinically indicated (especially dexamethasone and high - 
dose cytarabine, and for those who have higher than expected toxicity in earlier 
phases).  
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_1095627] altered MTX pharmacokinetics and enhanced tissue sensitivity to the effects of 
MTX. The hydration and alkalinization regimen should be the same as outlined in 
section 5.1.2. However, the dose of HD -MTX should be 500 mg/m2 (50 mg/m2 over 
1 h and 450 mg/m2 given over 23 h). Baseline leucovorin rescue will begin early (at 
hour 30 at 30 mg/m2 IV q 6 h × 2 doses, followed by 10 mg/m2 IV q6 h × 6 doses).

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 If MTX plasma levels are elevated, increased leucovorin rescue will be 
recommended by [CONTACT_158063]. Vigorous hydration should be 
ensured until the 42 -hr MTX level is known.  
 
6.7.2 Cont inuation low -dose MTX  
 
The low -dose weekly MTX (40 mg/m2) should be administered at full dosage if 
possible. If the patient has severe neutropenia or leucopenia (which delays 
subsequent therapy) or grade 4 mucositis (or mucositis which delays subsequent 
therapy) after being administered 40 mg/m2 low-dose MTX, t he dosage should be 
decreased to 30 mg/m2, and further to 20 mg/m2 and finally to 10 mg/m2 if 
necessary. If 10 mg/m2 is also not tolerated, then leucovorin should be added at 5 
mg/m2 every 6 h for 4 doses, starting 42 h from the MTX dosage, with titration to 
acceptable toxicity.  
 
6.8 Participants with Renal  Dysfunction  
 
Subclinical renal impairment (normal serum creatinine but decreased GFR) may  be 
present in participants receiving concurrent nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. IV acyclovir 
and vancomycin) which, if possib le, should be held during and for 20 hours after 
HDMTX infusions or until adequate MTX clearance has been  documented.  
Consideration to delaying MTX should be given if a patient's serum  creatinine 
indicates renal impairment (e.g., glomerular filtration rate  <50cc/min/1.[ADDRESS_1095629] PI, and/or  PharmD).  
 
In the event of toxicity secondary to high dose methotrexate, consider 
carboxypeptidase (glucarpi[INVESTIGATOR_74715]).

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 6.9.3 HDMTX – High dose  methotrexate  
 
HDMTX should be withheld if there is evidence of existing mucositis or if total 
bilirubin >2 mg/dl and direct bilirubin >1.4 mg/dl.  
 
Subclinical hypertransaminasemia (SGPT >500 IU/L) is an indication to delay only 
high dose methotrexate but no other chemotherapy.  
 
6.10 Cardiotoxicity  
 
Hold mitoxantrone until fractional shortening is > 28%. Consultation with 
cardiologist is suggested if clinically  indicated.  
 
6.11 Vinca Alkaloid  Neurotoxicity  
 
Mild vinca alkaloid toxicities are anticipated. These include jaw pain, constipation, 
decreased deep tendon reflexes. If there is persistent severe ab dominal cramps, gait 
impairment, severe pain that requires narcotics or SIADH develops, the dose may 
be reduced to 50%. Motor paralysis or typhlitis will warrant temporary 
discontinuation of vinca alkaloids.

abdominal pain of [ADDRESS_1095633] scan evidence of pancreatitis), 
PEG -asparaginase may be discontinued permanently when the possibility of 
glucocorticoid - or mercaptopurine induced pancreatitis is excluded. In cases with 
mild to mod erate pancreatitis (abdominal pain less than 72 hours and amylase and 
lipase level less than three times the upper limit of normal), PEG -asparaginase 
should be held and resumed once symptoms and signs subsided. Call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794391] (without abdominal pain) 
and has only elevated amylase or lipase levels. Consideration should be given to  use 
native asparaginase (10,000 units/m2 thrice weekly for 3 doses) for participants who 
are re -challenged. Consideration shou ld also be given to dexamethasone - or 
mercaptopurine - related pancreatitis. Contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_794392] a possibility that the pancreatitis is due to either of these two  drugs.

7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES  
 
These guidelines are provided to help physicians caring for participants treated on 
this protocol. They are guidelines and not protocol requirements. Nothing in these 
guidelines is intended to supplant the judgment of the treating physician regarding 
patie nt management. Current institutional practice may dictate other approaches  to 
the management of the areas discussed in this  section.  
 
7.1 Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
 
It is suggested that baseline serum chemistries (uric acid, urea, creatinine, 
electrol ytes, Ca, Mg, and PO 4) be obtained pre -treatment and frequently after 
therapy is started, and a central venous line (Double Lumen Hickman Catheter or 
DLHC) be inserted for fluid administration and monitoring.  
 
Preventative measures  
 
1. Give allopurinol 300 mg/m2 daily divided TID. Alternatively, rasburicase 
may be given daily until the lysis period is  over.  
2. Intravenous fluids should be started at least 12 hours before  chemotherapy, 
3000 mL/m2/day. NO ADDED  POTASSIUM.  
3. Phosphate binder for  hyperphosphatemia as per institution  guidelines  
 
Suggested monitoring during Induction chemotherapy  
 
1. Strict monitoring of fluid balance is  essential.  
2. Check blood pressure  frequently.  
3. Daily  weights.

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 4. Frequent measurement of serum chemistries  
7.2 Management of  Hyperleukocytosis  
 
In participants with WBC > 400 x 109/L or symptoms of hyperviscosity, 
leukapheresis or exchange transfusion may be used according to local institutional 
guidelines.  
 
7.3 Prophylaxis for  Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia  (REQUIRED)  
 
All participants should receive TMP/SMZ (trimethoprim 150 mg/m2/day in 2 
divided doses on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of each week). For those who 
cannot tolerate TMP/SMZ, monthly pentamidine may be substitut ed. Other options 
include atovoquone or dapsone. Please consult with clinical pharmacists and local 
institutional guidelines.  
 
7.4 Prophylaxis for Fungal Infections  (REQUIRED ) 
 
Participants with relapsed ALL are at especially increased risk for fungal infections, 
most commonly candidiasis and aspergillosis. Although there is no national 
standard for antifungal prophylaxis of these participants, effective regimens include 
voricona zole and posaconazole. Micafungin and caspofungin are acceptable 
alternatives, but fluconazole and itraconazole are not recommended because of lack 
of activity against Aspergillus. Antifungal prophylaxis should be initiated when 
ANC < 500 or <1000 and fall ing or predicted to fall in induction blocks I, III and  
re-induction and continue until count recovery (ANC >100 and rising).  
 
All participants on ALLR18 must receive prophylactic antifungal therapy , 
although the agent(s) used may be based on local institu tional guidelines.  
Acceptable antifungal prophylaxis options are listed below, in order of preference. 
Currently, we recommend voriconazole or posaconazole. Please consult with

7.5 Prophylaxis for Bacterial Infections  (REQUIRED)  
 
Because patients with relapsed ALL are at high risk for bacterial sepsis, all 
participants on ALLR18 must receive prophylactic antibiotics. Prophylactic 
antibioti cs should be started in induction blocks I, III and re -induction when 
the ANC < 500 or < 1000 and falling or predicted to fall, and continue until 
the ANC > 100 and rising. Antibiotics may be given by [CONTACT_794482], according to l ocal institutional guidelines. Acceptable 
prophylactic regimens, in order of preference, include the following:  
 
• Levofloxacin 10 mg/kg PO/IV every 12 hours if < 5 years of  every 
24 hours if > 5 years (maximum 500 mg per  dose)  
 
• Vancomycin 400 mg/m2/dose IV every 12 hours (maximum 1 gram 
per dose) plus ciprofloxacin 250 -350 mg/m2/dose PO every 12 hours 
(maximum 500 mg per  dose)  
 
• Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048] 1500 mg/m2/dose IV every 12 hours (maximum 2  gram 
per dose)  
 
• Vancomycin 400 mg/m2/dose IV every 12 hours (maximum 1  gram 
per dose) plus cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048] 1500 mg/m2/dose IV every 12 hours 
(maximum 2 gram per dose). Note that this regimen is not 
recommended by [CONTACT_978], but is acceptable if preferred by [CONTACT_794483].  
 
• Please consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794394] a prophylactic regimen 
other than one listed above. Because local infection rates, organisms, 
and susceptibilities vary, other prophylactic regimens will be 
allowed. However, regimens should be uniform at eac h collaborating

7.6 Management of Febrile  Neutropenia  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_794395]. Participants  with fever (defined as a single oral temperature  38.3 C 
(101F) or temperature of  38.0 C (100.4 F) sustained over a one hour period 
and neutropenia (defined as ANC  500 cells/ L) should be given IV antibiotics 
immediately. We recommend the followi ng guidelines:  
 
• Participants who develop fever while receiving prophylactic levofloxacin or 
vancomycin and ciprofloxacin:  
o Begin cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048] (1500 mg/m2/dose IV every 8  hours)  
o Add or increase vancomycin to 400 mg/m2/dose IV every 8  hours  
o Discontinue ciprofloxacin or  levofloxacin  
 
• Participants who develop fever while receiving prophylactic  cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]:  
o Begin meropenem (20 mg/kg/dose IV every 8  hours)  
o Add vancomycin (400 mg/m2/dose IV every 8 hours) if recent 
history of receiving intensive chem otherapy that produces  substantial 
mucosal  damage  
o Discontinue  cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_794396] -related infection, have evidence of sepsis 
(including shock, hypotension, rigors, septic emboli, unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_794397], or poor peripheral perfusion), or are known to be colonized 
by [CONTACT_794484] , should also receive tobramycin, 60 mg/m2/dose IV 
every [ADDRESS_1095640] severe abdominal pain or radiographic findings suggesting 
typhlitis, severe abdominal pain with evidence of sepsis, focal findings suggestive 
of intra -abdominal infection on physical examination, or known or suspected 
infection with Bacillus cereus should receive meropenem, 20 mg/kg/dose IV every 
8 hours, instead of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048].  
 
7.7 Growth  Factors  
 
Prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors (GM -CSF or G -CSF) is not 
recommended. However, GM -CSF (250 µg/m2/day) or G -CSF (5 -10 µg/kg/day) 
may be considered for participants who have life threatening fungal infections or 
bacterial sepsis after discus sion with PI.

 syndrome. In these heavily pretreated participants, it has been difficult to separate 
potential drug -related cases of capi[INVESTIGATOR_794398]/sepsis, progressive disease, or other underlying 
problems resulting from p rior anti -leukemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For these reasons, during and 
after each dose of clofarabine investigators are to assess participants for the onset of 
the following signs or symptoms  grade 2:  
 
• Tachypnea or other evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645];  
• Unexplaine d hypotension;  and/or  
• Unexplained  tachycardia.  
 
If one or more of these signs or symptoms occurs during study drug infusion, 
clofarabine administration is to be interrupted or held as clinically indicated. It is 
recognized that the total infusion time for this clofarabine dose in this circumstance 
may e xceed 1 hour. Thus, if the patient’s condition stabilizes or improves, 
clofarabine administration may resume. Supportive care, strict monitoring of intake 
and output and investigation for other etiologies of the signs and symptoms, such as 
infection/sepsis , must be pursued.  
 
7.9 Etoposide  Reactions  
 
7.9.1 Cardiovascular effects - Transient hypotension has occurred in about 1 to 2  % 
of participants following rapid IV administration of etoposide during clinical trials. 
However, hypotension has not been associated with cardiac toxicity or 
electrocardiogram changes. Blood pressure usually normalizes within a few hours 
after discontinuation of the infusion. To avoid this complication, etoposide should be 
infused over 30 – 60 minutes. If hypotension should occur, stop the i nfusion, and if 
necessary, give 10 mL/kg NS bolus over 15 minutes. Repeat as necessary. Once 
symptoms resolve, resume infusion at ½ the previous infusion rate until the full dose 
administered. If hypotension recurs, stop infusion and administer 10 mL/kg NS  bolus 
as indicated. Once hypotension resolves, resume infusion at ½ previous infusion rate 
until complete. Consider infusing NS at 1 – 1.5 x maintenance during remainder of 
infusion. For all subsequent doses, further dilute and infuse over 2  hours.  
 
7.9.2 Sensitivity reactions - Anaphylactoid reactions consisting principally of 
chills, rigors, diaphoresis, pruritis, loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, fever, 
bronchospasm, dyspnea, tachycardia, hypertension, and/or hypotension have 
occurred in 0.7 – 3% of patients receiving etoposide. Other manifestations include 
flushing, rash, substernal chest pain, lacrimations, sneezing, coryza, throat pain, 
back pain, abdominal cramps, and auditory impairment. Facial/lingual swelling, 
coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis , tightness in the throat, and laryngospasm have  also 
occurred. If an anaphylactoid reaction should  occur:  
 
1. Stop the infusion immediately and notify H/O Fellow or Attending  MD 
2. Administer the following as  indicated:  
a) diphenhydramine 1mg/kg IV (max dose 50  mg)

Protocol document date: 06 -12-2018   
 b) hydrocortisone 50 – 100 mg/m2 IV 
c) epi[INVESTIGATOR_794399]  
d) fluid bolus 10 mL/kg NS infused over [ADDRESS_1095643] resolved, resume infusion at ½ previous rate until 
infusion complete. Consider infusing NS at 1 – 1.5 x maintenance during 
remainder of  infusion.  
4. If anaphylaxis recurs, stop the infusion and re -treat as above. Do  not 
administer remainder  of dose. Consider substituting etoposide with 
etoposide phosphate (Etopophos®) for all subsequent  doses.  
5. If anaphylaxis does not recur, pre -medicate all subsequent doses with 
diphenhydramine 1mg/kg (max 50 mg) and hydrocortisone 50 – 100 mg/m2. 
Consider s lowing the loading dose to be administered over [ADDRESS_1095644] at bedside all of the following for all subsequent  infusions:  
a) Diphenhydramine 1mg/kg IV (max 50  mg) 
b) Hydrocortisone 50 – 100 mg/m2 IV 
c) epi[INVESTIGATOR_794400]: anaphylactoid reactions are still possible with etoposide phosphate. If 
the patient cannot tolerate the substitution, drug is contraindicated and must be 
discontinued.  
 
7.10 Drug  Interactions  
 
Because concurrent use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) with anti -leukemic therapy has recently been 
associated with inferior EFS, every effort should be made to avoid these agents, as 
well as rifampin, which also induces many drug metabolizing enzymes. Gabapentin 
does not induce hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes and may be a suitable 
alternative anticonvulsant. Azole antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, and ketoconazole) and the macrolid e group of antibiotics (e.g. 
erythromycin, rifampin, and zithromax) may have potent inhibitory effects on drug - 
metabolizing enzymes, and the doses of some antileukemic drugs (e.g. vincristine, 
anthracyclines, steroids, etoposide) may need to be reduced in  some patients on 
chronic azole antifungals or antibiotics. Consult Pharmacokinetics if long -term use 
of these interacting drugs is unavoidable.  
 
Penicillins interfere with tubular excretion of methotrexate, and it is recommended 
that an alternative non -penicillin antibiotic be used.  
 
Ph+ participants receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib, dasatinib and 
nilotinib) should not receive drugs known prolong the QT interval and should avoid 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Participants should also avoid fo od [ADDRESS_1095645]. Jude

 Cytokine release syndrome is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_33234], headache, 
tachycardia, hypotension, rash and shortness of breath. It is caused by [CONTACT_794485]. IL -2 will be discontinued for cytokine release syndrome > 
grade 2. Supportive care with IV fluids, correction of hypoalbuminemia with albumin 
infusions and close monitoring should be perfo rmed. In severe cases, corticosteroids 
may be required. Corticosteroids should be avoided (if possible) during the [ADDRESS_1095646] 7 days after the infusion.

9.2 Suggested Long -Term Follow -up Evaluations  
 
The following evaluations are recommended for participants who are off -treatment 
after completion of protocol specified therapy:  
 
• It is r ecommended that participants will be followed every [ADDRESS_1095654] 18 years old. Thereafter, the patient will become alumni 
and will be followed according to the institution’s  policy.  
• During the St. Jude visit, CBC with differential and other laboratory  studies 
as clinically indicated will be  obtained.  
• It is recommended that QCT for bone density be performed at 5 years off - 
therapy.  
• Participants wi ll be considered off therapy [ADDRESS_1095655] treatment 
taken. Adverse events will not be reported while patient is off -therapy 
unless they are unanticipated problems (see Section 12.0) deemed related  to 
therapy by [CONTACT_794487]. 
• After attaining continuous , complete remission for 5 years or more, SJCRH 
participants will be invited to participate in the long -term follow -up 
umbrella protocol and may be referred to the After Completion of Therapy 
Clinic (ACT). Collaborating sites will follow participants as pe r local 
guidelines.  
• When a SJCRH patient has been in remission for [ADDRESS_1095656]  18 
years of age, the patient will become SJCRH alumni and will be followed 
according to the SJCRH institutional  policy.  
 
Note: Participants removed from therapy for other reasons (i.e., relapse, toxicity, 
etc.) before treatment is completed will be followe d for survival only, and 
evaluations will be done as per treating physician’s/institution’s standard practice.

10.3 Toxicity Evaluation  Criteria  
 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4 (CTCAE): This study  will 
utilize the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and 
performance reporting. A copy of the current version of the CTCAE can be 
downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) home page 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). Addi tionally, toxicities are to be reported on the 
appropriate data collection screens/forms.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1095660] be reported to the IRB. However, it is expected that participants 
will occasionally miss some doses or receive the wrong dose of oral chemotherapy. 
Compliance with oral medication will be captured in the CRIS database and 
appropriately documented in the participants’ medical records. Appropriately 
documented doses of missed o r wrong doses of chemotherapy will not constitute a 
deviation unless the amount in question is over 10% of the expected total dose due 
in the respective protocol cycles (these are specified in the CRIS ALLR18 
database). Missed doses do not include doses he ld or reduced for medical reasons 
(toxicity, illness) and will not be considered protocol deviations or violations.  
 
11.0 OFF THERAPY AND OFF STUDY  CRITERIA  
 
11.1 Off-Study  Criteria  
 
• Death  
• Withdrawal of  consent  
• Found to be ineligible (e.g., incorrect  diagnosis)  
• For St. Jude participants: completion of protocol -required evaluations and 
follow -up period (10 years), then survival outcomes will be followed per 
SJLTFU. For participants from collaborating sites, participants will be 
followed for survival status and relapse  until one of the above criteria are 
met (e.g. death, withdrawal of consent, found to be  ineligible).

12.0 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
12.1 Reporting Adverse Experiences (AEs) and Deaths on Treatment  
 
Only “unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others” referred to 
hereafter as “unanticipated problems” are required to be reported to the St. Jude 
IRB promptly, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1095665] 
learns of the unanticipated problem. Regardless of whether the event is internal or 
external (for example, an IND safety report by [CONTACT_418439] 21 CFR 
312.32), only adverse events that constitute unanticipated problems are reportable 
to the St. Jude IRB. As further described in the definition of unanticipated 
problem, this includes any event  that in the PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_794405]: 
 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (1) the

• Serious; or if not serious suggests that the research places subjects or  others 
at a greater risk of harm (including ph ysical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or  recognized.  
 
Unrelated, expected deaths do not require reporting to the IRB . Though death is 
“serious”, the event must meet the other two requirements of “related or possibly 
related” and “unexpected/unanticipated” to be considered reportable.  
 
Deaths meeting reporting requirements are to be reported immediately to the St.  
Jude IRB, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1095667] to reporting adverse experiences:  
 
Serious Adverse Event : Any adverse event temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in research that meets any of the following criteria:  
 
• results in  death;  
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from  the 
event as it  occurred);  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172677];  
• results in a persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• results in a co ngenital anomaly/birth defect;  or 
• any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition 
(examples of such events include: any substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions, allergic bronchospasm requiring  intensive 
treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse), a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, secondary or concurrent cancer, medication 
overdose, or is any medical event which requires treatment to prevent any 
of the medical outcomes previous ly listed.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event : 
 
• Any adverse event for which the specificity or severity is not consistent 
with the protocol -related documents, including the applicable investigator 
brochure, IRB approved consent form, Investigational New Drug (IND) or 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, or other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or if  it

does appear in such documents, an event in which the specificity, severity 
or duration is not consistent with the risk information included therein; or  
• The observed rate of occurrence is a clinically significant increase in  the 
expected rate (based on a cr edible baseline rate for comparison);  or 
• The occurrence is not consistent with the expected natural progression of 
any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the adverse  event.  
 
Internal Events : Events experienced by a research participant enrolled at a site 
under the jurisdiction of St. Jude IRB for either multicenter or single -center 
research projects.  
 
External Events : Events experienced by [CONTACT_794490] a site external to 
the jurisdiction of the St. Jude Institutional Review Board (IRB) or in a study for 
which St. Jude is not the coordinating center or the IRB of record.  
 
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others : An un anticipated 
problem involving risks to subjects or others is an event which was not expected to 
occur and which increases the degree of risk posed to research participants. Such 
events, in general, meet all of the following criteria:  
 
• unexpected;  
• related o r possibly related to participation in the research;  and 
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of  harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. An unanticipated problem involving risk 
to subjects or others may exist even when actual harm does not occur to 
any participant.  
 
Consistent with FDA and OHRP guidance on reporting unanticipated problems 
and adverse events to IRBs, the St. Jude IRB does not require the submission of  
external events , for example IND safety reports, nor is a summary of such 
events/reports required; how ever, if an event giving rise to an IND safety or other 
external event report constitutes an “unanticipated problem involving risks to 
subjects or others” it must be reported in accordance with this policy. In general, to 
be reportable external events need  to have implications for the conduct of the  study 
(for example, requiring a significant and usually safety -related change in the 
protocol and/or informed consent  form).  
 
Although some adverse events will qualify as unanticipated problems involving 
risks t o subjects or others, some will not; and there may be other unanticipated 
problems that go beyond the definitions of serious and/or unexpected adverse 
events. Examples of unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
include:

12.2 Recording AEs and  SAEs  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated and documented by [CONTACT_158096][INVESTIGATOR_157995]. CRAs 
are responsible for reviewing documentatio n related to AEs and entering directly 
into CRIS protocol -specific database. The data to be recorded are 1) the event 
description, 2) the NCI CTCAE v4.0 code and grade, 3) the onset date, 4) the 
resolution date (or ongoing), 4) action taken for event, 5) p atient outcome 6) 
relationship of AE to protocol treatment/interventions, 7) if AE was expected or 
unexpected, and 8) comments, if applicable. AEs that are classified as serious, 
unexpected, and at least possibly related will be notated as such in the data base as 
“SAEs”. These events will be reported expeditiously to the St. Jude IRB within the 
timeframes as described above.  
 
Cumulative summary of Grades 1 -5 events will be collected in Induction Block I; 
and Grade [ADDRESS_1095670] of the protocol therapy as 
part of the progress reports to IRB at the time of continuing review. Hematological 
adverse eve nts will not be collected in database. Specific data entry instructions for 
AEs and other protocol -related data will be documented in protocol -specific data 
entry guidelines, which will be developed and maintained by [CONTACT_794491].  
 
The study team will meet regularly to discuss AEs (and other study progress as 
required by [CONTACT_158098]). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_794406], and corrections will be made if applicable. 
Once the info rmation is final the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794407], to acknowledge 
his/her review and approval of the AE as entered in the research database.  
 
12.3 Reporting Requirements to the  FDA  
 
Any unexpected fatal or unexpected life -threatening event judged by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_794408], will be reported to the FDA by 
[CONTACT_794492] a written safety report as complete as 
possible within e ight additional calendar days (i.e. full report 15 calendar days 
total after notification of event).

collaborating sites for AEs that are serious, unexpected, and at least possibly 
related to protocol treatment o r interventions will be reported to site IRB and the 
St. Jude IRB within the reporting requirements described above. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_794411], considering the following  criteria:  
 
• Is the AE serious, unexpected, and related or possibly related to 
participation in the  research?  
• Is the AE expected, but occurring at a significantly higher frequency  or 
severity than  expected?  
• Is this an AE that is unexpected (regardless of se verity that may alter the 
IRB’s analysis of the risk versus potential benefit of the research and, as a 
result, warrant consideration of substantive changes in the research 
protocol or informed consent process/document?

13.3 Study Monitoring  
 
This study is considered high risk (HR -3) for monitoring purposes. Protocol and 
regulatory comp liance, including essential regulatory documentation, will be 
assessed as well as the accuracy and completeness of all data points relating to the 
primary and secondary objectives semi -annually. If the study design has strata, 
accrual will be tracked conti nuously. The first two enrollees will be monitored and 
15% of the study enrollees thereafter, semi -annually.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_794413], and 
for data accuracy and completeness. The study team will meet at appropriate 
intervals to review case histories or quality summaries on participants and retain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] m inutes that are signed by [CONTACT_978].  
 
The Eligibility Coordinators in the Central Protocol and Data Monitoring Office 
(CPDMO) will verify informed consent documentation and eligibility status on 
100% of St. Jude participants within 5 working days of enrollmen t completion.  
 
The Clinical Research Monitor (CRM) will verify informed consent documentation 
and eligibility status of all non -St. Jude participants and perform a quality 
verification of select St. Jude participants during routine monitoring intervals (ev ery 
6 months). Overall study conduct, compliance with primary and secondary 
objectives, age of majority consenting, safety assessments and reporting, and the 
timeliness and accuracy of database entries are monitored routinely.  
 
Study documents routinely mo nitored on selected participants include medical 
records, database entries, study worksheets, and case report forms. Study 
documents are monitored for participant status, demographics, staging, subgroup 
assignment, treatments, investigational drug accounta bility, evaluations, responses, 
participant protocol status, off -study and off -therapy criteria, and for all other 
specifics as detailed in a separate study -specific monitoring plan. The study - 
specific monitoring plan may be revised over time, to adapt mo nitoring frequency 
and/ or intensity to a changing environment when appropriate (for example: new 
safety signals; positive history of compliance; all participants are in long term 
follow -up; or the enrollment period has ended).  
 
The recording and reporting  of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), 
and Unanticipated Problems (UPs) to include type, grade, attribution, duration, 
timeliness and appropriateness will be reviewed by [CONTACT_35717]/ CRM. The CRM 
will generate a formal report which is shared wi th the Principal Investigator (PI), 
study team and the Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).

13.[ADDRESS_1095681] 6 participants were considered not evaluable due to an 
amendment to ALLR17. The previous trial ALLR16 opened in January 1997 and 
closed to accrual in September 2003 with 40 evaluable participants enrolled. Thus 
historically there would be on average 5 to 6 participants enrolled per year in our 
institution. Thus, at the institution’s historical rate, we expect [ADDRESS_1095682] to accrue 40 evaluable 
participants in approximately 4 years for th e primary objective.  
 
Update amendment 2.0 : The first 5 patients were enrolled in a staggered manner 
(until completion of Block I) due to FDA stipulations to ensure safety of the 
experimental regimen. As a consequence, enrollment was slow for the first 2 y ears 
until the restricted enrollment period was completed on 7/28/14. Therefore, we will 
extend the accrual of the trial by 2 years (i.e., we expect to accrue 40 evaluable 
patients in approximately 6 years for the primary objective).  
 
14.2 Monitoring of Inducti on Toxicities and Short -Term  Efficacy  
 
The chemotherapy in the remission induction phase of this protocol is more 
intensive than the previous trials. We will closely monitor grade 4 or higher 
infections and toxic deaths during remission induction.  
 
Grade 4  infection or higher: The rate of grade 4 or higher infection during 
Induction of ALLR16 and R17 is 15% and 17.6% respectively. The following 
group sequential rule will be in place to monitor if there is sufficient evidence that 
the true probability of gra de 4 or higher infection is higher than 20%.

Based on the Binomial distribution, the overall significance level is less than 0.091 
based on the inclusion -exclusion formula, and the statistical power to stop the trial at 
each look is 0.49, 0.74, and 0.86, respectively if the true probability is 45%.  
 
Toxic deaths during Induction Block I. All toxic deaths (not related to 
progressive disease) during Induction will be monitored closely. In ALLR16 and 
ALLR17, all disease -unrelated deaths were toxic deaths: 2/40 on ALLR16 and 
2/[ADDRESS_1095684] block of induction, we will suspend the trial and re -evaluate the 
safety of the therapy.  
 
One-year even t-free survival: The 1 -year EFS rate of ALLR16 and R17 is about 
50%. For monitoring purpose failures we will exactly include death, failure to 
attain CR, relapse, second malignancy, excessive toxicity resulting in cessation of 
ALLR18 treatment, and lost to  follow -up (but we fully expect to follow every 
patient for at least one year). The following binomial based group sequential rule 
will be in place to monitor if there is sufficient evidence that the true 1 -year failure 
rate is higher than 55%.  
 
Number of participants completing 
one-year Tx  Suspend trial if # failures >=

30 20 
 
Based on the binomial distribution, only when the number of failures greater than 
or equal to 12 and 22 at each look respectively can the overall significance level be 
controlled below 0.075, but these numbers are too high to be clinically acceptable. 
We t hus set the boundary at 10 and 20. Based on the binomial distribution, if the 
probability of failure at one year is 0.7 (i.e. 0.2 higher than the historical 0.5 and  
0.15 higher than the monitoring target of 0.55), then the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_794414] 0.73 and at the second look 0.72. [Note that 
based on the binomial distribution, only when the number of failures is greater

(i.e., erroneous ly stop when the true [ADDRESS_1095685] 0.5) probability be 
controlled below 0.075, but these numbers are too high to be clinically acceptable. 
We thus set the boundary at 10 and  20.]

refractory precursor B -cell ALL treated with risk -directed therapy  
 
Analysis and power: This is a phase -II clinical trial. The outcome will be analyzed 
in terms of overall survival (OS) since diagnos is of first relapse. Only death will be 
considered a failure for OS. Event -free survival (EFS) will also be estimated. For 
EFS, relapse and second malignancies will be considered as failures in addition to 
death in complete remission. The time to EFS will be set to [ADDRESS_1095688] errors by [CONTACT_794496]. Three -year OS and EFS rates, as well as longer term sur vival rates (5 year and 
10 year) will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Additionally, EFS and OS will be estimated separately in two strata: participants 
with prior bone marrow transplant (BMT) and those never had any BMT because it 
is expected  that participants with prior BMT may have worse survival. The follow - 
up time on each participant will be three years since enrollment.  
 
Kaplan -Meier estimates of EFS and OS in R16 and R17 are shown below:

The objective here is estimation instead of comparison. Comparisons to historical 
controls are considered exploratory. With the sample size n=40, the statistical 
power will be limited. Analysis will begin after [ADDRESS_1095690] enrolled patient.  
 
14.4 Secondary  Objectives  
 
1) To determine minimal residual disease (MRD) levels at the end of  remission 
induction therapy and compare with  ALLR17.  
 
Probability (proportion) of positive MRD will be compared with that from the 
ALLR17 trial using Fisher’s exact test. MRD will also be put into ordered 
categories such as negative (<0.01%), low (0.01% - 1%) and high (>=1%) and 
compared with those in ALLR17 using exact Chi -square test. We are aware that 
the power is limited given the small sample size, unless the true difference is 
unusually large. Analysis will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1095691] enrollment.  
 
2) To estimate levels of CD20 expression at ba seline, during treatment with 
dexamethasone -containing chemotherapy and following rituximab treatment in week 
1 of Block I of remission induction therapy for relapsed precursor B -cell ALL 
 
Mean and median of CD20 expression levels will be computed at each time point 
along with 95% confidence intervals. Trajectory of CD20 levels as a function of 
time will be modeled and predicted using a longitudinal data model, with time (and 
possibly other clinical and demographic variables) and an intra -patient random 
effect as factors; this analysis is considered exploratory. Analysis will begin no 
later than [ADDRESS_1095692]. Jude

14.5 Exploratory  Objectives  
 
1) To assess donor NK cell killer immunoglobulin -like receptor (KIR) repertoire 
and explore the efficacy of NK cell infusions followed by [CONTACT_794459].  
 
The donor KIR repertoire will be described by [CONTACT_148216] (counts and 
proportions). Th ree and five year EFS of participants who received NK cell 
infusion will be estimated by [CONTACT_794497] 95% confidence 
intervals. Analysis will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1095693] enrollment.  
 
2) To study whether pre -existing or emerging de velopment of serum antibodies  to 
asparaginase is related to hypersensitivity reactions or exposure to asparaginase 
or to anti -leukemic or adverse effects of therapy, in participants with relapsed 
ALL.  
 
Due to heterogeneity among participants and prior ther apy, we will use exploratory 
analytic tools to assess whether anti -asparaginase antibodies are related to clinical 
hypersensitivity reactions. Analysis will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1095694] 
enrollment.  
 
3) To describe the effect of prophylactic antib iotics on the evolution of  antibiotic 
resistance in peri -rectal swab isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mitis and enterococci and resistance 
patterns of bacterial isolates from all sterile site culture s (completed with 
amendment  3.0) 
 
Resistance of selected colonizing and invasive organisms to representative 
antibiotics from various classes (ex. Cephalosporins, carbapenems, 
fluoroquinolones) will be described pre and post antibiotic prophylaxis at basel ine 
(pre-antibiotic prophylaxis) and post -antibiotic prophylaxis at any time point for 
the entire study population and separately based on type of antibiotic prophylaxis 
the patients received. All suspected or proven infections which occur while a 
patient is on antibiotic prophylaxis as well as C. difficle infections during and up to 
one month post antibiotic prophylaxis will be described.  
 
Analysis will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1095695] enrollment.  
 
4) To characterize global gene expression and copy number changes in  leukemic 
cells at relapse and to compare to initial diagnosis (when available) to improve 
knowledge of mechanisms of  relapse  
 
The analyses will be performed using established methods.17-[ADDRESS_1095696] enrollment.  
 
5) To determine in vitro sensitivity of pretreatment relapsed leukemic cells  to 
anti-leukemic agents and compare to in vitro sensitivity at diagnosis (when 
available)

6) To engraft freshly harvested relapsed ALL cells into murine models of ALL  to 
gain insights into therapy  resistance  
After  engraftment, various downstream analyses will be done on the leukemic cells 
including immunophenotype, histologic and genomic studies. Analysis will begin 
no later than [ADDRESS_1095699] enrollment.  
 
8) To study the development of resistant clones dur ing therapy for relapsed ALL.  
 
NT5C2 mutation detection will be performed by [CONTACT_794498] -sequencing using next 
generation platforms. We plan to sequence NT5C2 coding regions on the Mi -seq 
platform, but are mindful of continuing evolvement of sequencing technologies to 
adopt the most cost -effective and efficient platforms for this study, with the help 
from Hartwell Center and PCGP. Analysis will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1095700] enrollment.  
 
15.0 OBTAINING INFORMED  CONSENT  
 
15.1 Consent/Assent at  Enrollment  
 
The process of informed consent for AL LR18 will follow institutional policy. The 
informed consent process is an ongoing one that begins at the time of diagnosis and 
ends after the completion of therapy. Informed consent should be obtained by [CONTACT_794499]/her designee, in the presence of at least one non -physician 
witness. Initially, informed consent will be sought for the institutional banking 
protocol (research study), blood transfusion and other procedures as necessary. After 
the diagnosis of relapse ALL is established, we w ill invite the patient to participate 
in the ALLR18 protocol. Consent/assent for initial enrollments will be done at St.  
Jude for all participants (including NK cell donors).  
 
Throughout the entire treatment period, participants and their parents receive 
constant education from health professionals at SJCRH and collaborating sites, and 
are encouraged to ask questions regarding alternatives and therapy. All families 
have ready access to chaplains, psychologists, social workers, and the St. Jude 
ombudsperson for support, in addition to that provided by [CONTACT_794500].

15.3 Consent When English is Not the Primary  Language  
 
When English is not the patient, parent, or legally authorized representative’s 
primary language, the Social Work department will determine the need for an 
interpreter. This information documented in the participant’s medical record. 
Either a certified int erpreter or the telephone interpreter’s service will be used to 
translate the consent information. The process for obtaining an interpreter and for 
the appropriate use of an interpreter is outlined on the Interpreter Services, OHSP, 
and CPDMO websites.  
 
Collaborating Sites will follow institutional policy for consenting non -English 
speaking participants (and will provide institutional policy to St. Jude).

APPENDIX II: PEDIATRIC RITUXIMAB INFUSION GUIDELINES  
 
Dose = 375 mg/m2 
 
• Dilute in NS to final concentration 1 mg/ml for ease of  administration.  
• Administer intravenously through a dedicated line 
Pre-medicate  with:  
• Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO (max 650  mg) 
• Bena dryl 1 mg/kg IV or PO (max 50  mg) 
 
FIRST INFUSION : Participants treated at St. Jude will be as per current St. Jude formulary 
from Intranet (collaborating sites will follow institutional formulary/policy)  
 
SUBSEQUENT INFUSIONS : Participants treated at St. Jude will be as per current St. Jude 
formulary from Intranet (collaborating sites will follow institutional formulary/policy)  
 
GENERAL GUIDELINES : 
 
1. Monitor blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_794422] [ADDRESS_1095716] epi[INVESTIGATOR_794423].  
3. If infusion related events occur, slow the infusion or stop the infusion until resolution, 
treating the participant if necessary. If it is determined that the participant can be 
safely re -challenged,  begin the infusion at 50% of the rate at which the infusion was 
running when  stopped.  
4. Verify that the participant has not taken antihypertensive medications within 12  hours 
of beginning the rituximab infusion. Hypotension may occur during the  infusion.  
5. Participants with a high number of circulating cancer cells (> 25,000/mm3) may be  at

APPENDIX III: DRUG/DEVICE/BIOLOGIC AGENT INFORMATION  
 
1. VINCRISTINE  (Oncovin ) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Vincristine is an alkaloid obtained from the periwinkle (Vinca 
rosea) plant. It reversibly binds to microtubule and spi[INVESTIGATOR_158009]. 
Vincristine has poor penetration into the CSF. It is extensively protein bound (~75%).  
Extensive metabolism occurs in the liver. Excretion is primarily in the bile. A  dosage decrease 
is recommended in participants with elevated bilirubin (see section 7.3).  
 
Formulation and stability : Vincristine is supplied in multiple -dose 1 mg/mL vials containing [ADDRESS_1095717] vials should be stored under refrigerat ion and protected from 
light.  
 
Supplier : The drug is commercially available.  
 
Toxicity : Dose -limiting toxicity is neurotoxicity, which is characterized by [CONTACT_794504]/or paralytic ileus, ptosis, vocal cord paralysis, weakness, jaw pain, abdominal pain , 
peripheral neuropathies, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and “foot drop.” Peripheral neuropathy 
is often the first sign of neurotoxicity and is initially reversible. Other toxicities reported 
include alopecia, mild nausea and vomiting, SIADH, myelosuppress ion, orthostatic 
hypotension, optic atrophy, transient cortical blindness, and auditory damage. Acute shortness 
of breath and severe bronchospasm have been reported after administration of vinca  alkaloids. 
Myelosuppression is rare at usual doses. Vincristine is a vesicant and may cause severe tissue 
damage if extravasation occurs. Note that dose reduction may be necessary in participants <1 
year of age or <10 kg in weight; dosing on a “per kg” (ra ther than per m2) basis has been 
advocated for infants in order to decrease  toxicity.  
 
Guidelines for administration : intravenous, see Treatment section 5.2.1 (Remission induction 
Block I), section 5.4 (Re -Induction) and section 5.5 (Continuation).  
 
 
2. DEXAM ETHASONE (Decadron®)  
 
Source and pharmacology : Dexamethasone is a synthetic congener of the natural adrenal 
hormone hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone is a white or yellowish crystalline powder. It binds 
with steroid receptors on nuclear membranes to impair cellular mitosis and inhibit protein 
synthesis. Dexamethasone also has potent anti -inflammatory effects and suppresses the 
immune system. Dexamethasone is absorbed well orally. It is metabolized in the liver, and the 
metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine.  
 
Formulation and stability : Dexamethasone  is available as tablets of various strengths and as 
an elixir. It is also available as a solution for parenteral use. All formulations of the drug can 
be stored at room temperature. The injectable form may be further diluted in 5% dextrose or 
0.9% NaCl -containing solutions and is stable for at least [ADDRESS_1095718]. Jude

DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Methotrexate  is poorly and variably absorbed orally, with 
an average of  40% for doses of < 30 mg/m2. At higher dosages, the extent of absorption 
decreases. Methotrexate is approximately 50% protein bound. It distributes widely into body 
tissues and fluids with sustained concentrations in the kidney and the liver. Methotrexate 
undergoes metabolism by [CONTACT_794505]. It is excreted 
mainly in the urine as unchanged drug with sm all amounts being excreted in the bile and 
feces. The percent recovered as unchanged drug in the urine is higher with short infusions 
than with prolonged infusions. Methotrexate has a biphasic elimination with an initial half -life 
of  2-3 hours and a term inal half -life of 10 -12 hours. Methotrexate may be “sequestered” in 
body fluid collections and eliminated slowly from these areas. Patients with effusions or GI 
obstruction should have plasma levels monitored closely for delayed excretion  following  
high-dose methotrexate.  
 
Formulation and stability : Methotrexate is supplied in single -dose vials containing 50mg, 
100mg, 200mg, and 250 mg of methotrexate as a 25 mg/ml preservative -free solution and in 
vials containing 20mg, [ADDRESS_1095720] can be reconstituted by [CONTACT_158123], 0.9% NaCl or D5W to a final 
concentration not exceeding 25 mg/ml. The 1000mg vials containing lyophilized product are 
reconstituted to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml.  
 
Supplier : commercially available  
 
Toxicity : The dose limiting toxicities of methotrexate are generally bone marrow suppression, 
ulcerative stomatitis, severe diarrhea or acute nephrotoxicity. Toxicities reported frequently 
include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, hepatic toxicity  and alopecia. Less 
common side effects include blurred vision, photosensitivity, anaphylaxis, headache, 
pneumonitis, skin depi[INVESTIGATOR_158014], rash, vasculitis and encephalopathy. 
During high -dose methotrexate therapy, most patients experi ence a transient decrease in GFR, 
but renal failure can occur, particularly if the patient does not receive urinary alkalinization and 
aggressive hydration before, during and after receiving high dose methotrexate. Leucovorin 
rescue should be initiated wit hin [ADDRESS_1095721] delayed methotrexate 
clearance and a greater risk of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_158015].

5. CYTARABINE (Ara -C) (Cytosar -U) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Cytarabine is a deoxycytidine analogue. It must be tri - 
phosphorylated to its active form, ARA -CTP, by [CONTACT_794506]. Ara -CTP inhibits DNA polymerase. In addition, ara -CTP is incorporated into DNA 
as a false base, causing inhibition of DNA synthesis. It is cell cycle, S phase specific.  
Cytarabine does penetrate the blood brain barrier. It is converted to its inactive form, urac il 
arabinoside, by [CONTACT_56615]. Approximately 80% of the dose is 
recovered in the urine, mostly as uracil arabinoside (ara -U). 
 
Formulation and stability : Cytarabine is available in multi -dose vials containing 100, 500, 
[ADDRESS_1095722] vials can be stored at room temperature. For IV  
use, either sterile water for injection or bacteriostatic water for injection can be used to 
reconstitute the lyophilized drug. For intrathecal use , only sterile water for injectio n should be 
used for reconstitution. The 100 and 500 mg vials are reconstituted with 2 and 10 ml 
respectively resulting in a final concentration of 50mg/ml. The 1000 and 2000mg vials are 
reconstituted with 20ml and 40 ml respectively resulting in a final c oncentration of 50mg/ml. 
After reconstitution, the drug is stable for 8 days at room temperature.  
 
Supplier : commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Myelosuppression is the dose limiting adverse effect, with leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia being predominant. Oth er adverse effects reported commonly include 
nausea and vomiting (may be severe at high doses), diarrhea, mucositis, anorexia, alopecia, 
skin rash and liver dysfunction. A flu -like syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_411], muscle and bone 
aches is common. Less comm on side effects include allergic reactions and cellulitis at the 
injection site. High doses of cytarabine can cause conjunctivitis, hepatitis, and a group of CNS 
symptoms including somnolence, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia and personality changes.  
CNS symptoms are usually reversible and are more common in patients who have received 
previous cranial irradiation. In addition, a syndrome of sudden respi[INVESTIGATOR_794427].

ml single -use vials. Each vial also contains sodium chloride 9 mg/ml, sodium citrate 7.35 
mg/ml, polysorbate 80 0.7 mg/ml and water for injection. Rituximab for injection 
concentration must be  diluted with 5% Dextrose or 0.9% NaCl prior to administration. After 
dilution, unused drug is stable for 24 hours when refrigerated (2 -8 degrees Celsius) and [ADDRESS_1095723] sunlight.  
 
Supplier : commerci ally available  
 
Toxicity : Hypersensitivity reactions may occur; therefore, premedication with acetaminophen 
and diphenhydramine should be considered before each infusion. The most common toxicities 
are infusion related and may include chills, fever, headac he, nausea, vomiting, angioedema 
(13%), hypotension (10%), bronchospasm (8%), and arrhythmia. Other possible adverse 
reactions include thrombocytopenia, myalgias, arthralgias, asthenia, and throat irritation.  
 
Guidelines for administration : Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Infusions 
should be initiated at 50 mg/hour for 30 minutes. If hypersensitivity or infusion -related events 
do not occur, subsequent infusions can be administered at an initia l rate of 100 mg/hour and 
increased by 100 mg/hour every 30 minutes as tolerated. Infuse at a maximum rate of 400 
mg/hour. See section 5.2 (Remission Induction, Block I and Appendix II).  
 
 
7. CLOFARABINE (Clolar™,  Clofarex)  
 
Source and pharmacology : Clofarabi ne is a purine nucleoside analog. It is intracellularly 
metabolized to the active metabolite clofarabine 5’ -triphosphate which competes with 
deoxyadenosine triphosphate for binding to ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. It 
inhibits DNA synthesis, terminates DNA chain elongation and inhibits DNA repair.  
Clofarabine also disrupts the mitochondrial membrane which results in the release of proteins, 
cytochrome C and apoptosis -inducing factor leading to cell death. It is mainly excreted in the 
urine as unchanged drug.  
 
Formulation and stability : Clofarabine is available in the parenteral form as a preservative - 
free solution that is 1 mg/mL. It is available in 20 mL vials. The undiluted drug should be 
stored at room temperature. The diluted solution is s table for 24 hours at room temperature.

Block I) and section 5.4 (Re -induction)  
 
 
8. CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE  (Cytoxan) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard derivative. It acts as an 
alkylating agent that causes cross -linking of DNA strands by [CONTACT_794507], thus interfering with the normal function of DNA. 
Cyclophosphamide is cell -cycle, phase non -specific. Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed 
from the GI tract with a bioavailability of > 75%. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that 
requir es activation. It is metabolized by [CONTACT_51867] -function oxidases in the liver to [ADDRESS_1095724], which is considered to be the major 
active  metabolite, and acrolein. In addition, 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide may be 
enzymatically metabolized to 4 -ketocyclophosphamide and aldofosfamide may be 
enzymatically metabolized to carboxyphosphamide which are generally considered to be 
inactive. Cyclophosph amide and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Dosage 
adjustments should be made in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min.  
 
Formulation and stability : Cyclophosphamide is available in 25 and 50 mg tablets. 
Cyclophosphamide is als o available in vials containing 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000mg of 
lyophilized drug and 75 mg mannitol per 100 mg of cyclophosphamide. Both forms of the 
drug can be stored at room temperature. The vials are reconstituted with 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 
ml of ster ile water for injection respectively to yield a final concentration of 20 mg/ml.  
Reconstituted solutions may be further diluted in either 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing 
solutions. Diluted solutions are physically stable for 24 hours at room temperatur e and 6 days 
if refrigerated, but contain no preservative, so it is recommended that they be used within 24 
hours of preparation.  
 
Supplier : commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Dose limiting toxicities of cyclophosphamide are bone marrow suppression and 
cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_158011], cardiac 
necrosis or hemorrhagic myocarditis and can be fatal. Hemorrhagic cystitis may oc cur and 
necessitates withholding therapy. The incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis is related to 
cyclophosphamide dose and duration of therapy. Forced fluid intake and/or the administration 
of MESNA decreases the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis . Other toxicities 
reported commonly include nausea and vomiting (may be mild to severe depending on

Source and pharmacology : Etoposide is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_158017]. It is thought to act mainly by [CONTACT_794508] I I, causing double and 
single strand DNA breaks. Etoposide is cell cycle, phase -specific, with activity in the G2 and 
S phases. Absorption of etoposide is approximately 30 -40% and is highly variable and 
somewhat dose -dependent. It is extensively bound to se rum proteins and is metabolized in the 
liver, including cytochrome P450 3A metabolism to several moieties that include a reactive 
oxidized species. Etoposide and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine with a smaller 
amount excreted in the feces. Dosage adjustments should be considered in patients with liver 
dysfunction, kidney dysfunction or hypoalbuminemia.  
 
Formulation and stability : Etoposide is available in multi -dose vials containing 100mg, 
150mg, 500mg and 1000mg of etoposide as a 20mg/ml so lution and 30% alcohol. Etoposide

11. CliniMACSTM System  
 
This system is described fully in the Investigators Brochure and is briefly described here. The 
mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic -activated 
cell sorting. The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolatio n of many cell types 
from heterogeneous cell mixtures. For example, apheresis products can be separated in a 
magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as 
CD34+ human hematopoietic cells enrichment, CD3+ T cel l depletion, or CD56+ NK cell 
enrichment.  
 
The cells to be isolated or depleted are specifically labeled with super -paramagnetic particles 
by [CONTACT_794509] a cell surface antigen. After magnetic labeling, the cells are 
separated using a high -gradient magnetic separation column as described below. The 
magnetically labeled cells are retained in the magnetized column while the unlabeled cells 
flow through. The retained cells are eluted by [CONTACT_794510], 
washing the c ells out and collecting them.  
 
The super -paramagnetic particles are small in size (about 50 nm in diameter) and are 
composed of iron oxide/hydroxide and dextran conjugated to monoclonal antibodies. These 
magnetic particles form a stable colloidal solution and do not precipi[INVESTIGATOR_794429]. The CliniMACS device incorporates a strong permanent magnet and a 
separation column with a ferromagnetic matrix to separate the cells labeled with the magnetic

particles. The high -gradi ent system allows the application of strong magnetic forces and a 
rapid demagnetization. Small ferromagnetic structures, such as the column matrix, placed in a 
magnetic field, concentrate this homogenous field and thereby [CONTACT_794511]. I n their immediate proximity, the ferromagnetic structures generate magnetic forces 
10,000 -fold greater than in the absence of those structures enabling the retention of 
magnetically labeled cells. After removing the column from the magnet, the rapid 
demagn etization of the column matrix allows the release of retained cells.  
The CliniMACS device is comprised of a computer controlled instrument incorporating a 
strong permanent magnet, a closed -system sterile tubing set containing columns with a coated 
ferromag netic matrix and a paramagnetic, cell specific, labeling reagent. The instrument will 
separate the cells in a fully automated process

Toxicities : Aldesleukin is a highly toxic drug. Most adverse effects are dose related and 
schedule dependent, with fewer toxiciti es associated with low dose, subcutaneous or 
continuous IV infusions as compared to high dose, rapid IV infusions. Most adverse effects 
are self -limiting and reversible within [ADDRESS_1095726] frequently reported serious adverse effects include 
hypotension, renal dysfunction with oliguria/anuria, dyspnea or pulmonary congestion, and  
mental status changes (l ethargy, somnolence, confusion, agitation). Additional serious adverse 
effects reported include myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, gangrene, respi[INVESTIGATOR_794430], GI bleeding, intestinal perforation, ileus, coma, seizures, sepsis, and 
renal impairment requiring dialysis. Most patients receiving aldesleukin develop some degree 
of a flu -like syndrome that may include fever, chills, rigors, fatigue, weakness, malaise, 
arthralgia and myalgia.

13. PEG -L-ASPARAGINASE (Pegaspargase,  Oncaspar ) 
 
Source and pharmacology : PEG -asparaginase is a modified version of the enzyme, L - 
asparaginase. L -asparaginase is modified by [CONTACT_158109] 
(PEG) to the enzyme. The asparaginase used in the manufacturing of PEG -asparaginase is 
derived from Escherichia coli. Asparaginase hydrolyzes serum asparagine (an amino acid 
required to synthesize proteins and DNA) to aspartic acid and ammonia, and is therefore lethal 
to cells that cannot synthesize asparagine. Asparaginase is active during all phases of the cell 
cycle. Asparaginase is not absorbed from the GI tract and must be given parenterally. PEG - 
asparaginase has a plasma half -life of approximately [ADDRESS_1095727] 15 
days following the initial treatment. It cannot be detected i n the urine.  
 
Formulation and stability : PEG -asparaginase is available in single -use vials containing 5 ml 
of PEG -asparaginase as a clear solution. Each vial contains 3750 units of drug at a 
concentration of 750 units/ml. The intact vials should be stored under refrigeration. Freezing 
destroys its activity, which cannot be detected visually. It should not be used if it is cloudy or 
a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160592].  
 
Supplier : commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Acute toxicity includes anaphylactic reactions which occur most commonly when 
the drug is given IV. These can be characterized by [CONTACT_158110], hypotension, 
diaphoresis, fever, chills, edema and loss of consciousness. Allergic reactions at the site of IM 
injection include pain, swelling and erythema. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to 
PEG -asparaginase may be less than with conventional E. coli derived asparaginase although 
cross -sensitivity can occur. Other adverse effects include ne utropenia and associated 
immunosuppression, mild nausea and vomiting, malaise, anorexia, elevated LFT’s, 
pancreatitis and hyperglycemia. A decrease in protein synthesis including albumin, fibrinogen 
and other coagulation factors may occur which can result in thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism. Less common side effects include renal dysfunction and CNS complications, 
including somnolence, weakness, lethargy, coma and seizures.  
 
Guidelines for administration : Intravenous or intramuscular injection, see section 5.2.1 
(Remission induction) and 5.4 (Re -induction).  
 
 
14. ERWINIA L -ASPARAGINASE  (Erwinase ) 
 
To be used in case of allergy or intolerance to PEG -Asparaginase.  
 
Source and pharmacology : Erwinia asparaginase is an enzyme. It is derived from Erwinia 
chrysanthemi  and may be useful in patients with an allergy to the E. coli derived product. 
Asparaginase hydrolyzes serum asparagine (an amino acid required to synthesize proteins) to 
aspartic acid and ammonia, and is therefore lethal to cells that cannot synthesize as paragine. 
Asparaginase is active during all phases of th cell cycle. Asparaginase is not absorbed from

15. MERCAPTOPURINE (6 -MP) (Purinethol ) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Mercaptopurine is a purine antimetabolite. It must be converted 
intracellularly to 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (6 -TGNs), the active forms of the drug. The 6 - 
TGNs are then incorporated into DNA and RNA and cause inhibition of DNA and RNA 
synthesis. Mercapt opurine is cell cycle, S phase specific. Absorption is variable and 
incomplete (5 -37%) and is decreased by [CONTACT_158125]. Mercaptopurine does 
distribute into the CSF, with CSF concentrations of  27% of plasma concentrations when 
given by  [CONTACT_3365]. Mercaptopurine undergoes first pass metabolism in the GI 
mucosa and the liver. It is metabolized in hematopoietic tissues by [CONTACT_794513]. It is inactivated to methylated metabolites by [CONTACT_794514] (thiopurine methyl 
transferase) and to [ADDRESS_1095729]. Jude

Formulation and stability : Mercaptopurine is commercially available as a 50 mg tablet and 20 
mg/mL oral suspension; store at room temperature and protect from light.  
 
Supplier : Tablets are commercially  available.  
 
Toxicity : The dose -limiting toxicity of mercaptopurine is myelosuppression. Mercaptopurine 
can cause intrahepatic cholestasis and focal centralobular necrosis and is usually manifested 
by [CONTACT_158129]. Other toxicities incl ude mild nausea 
and vomiting, skin rash, hyperuricemia, and mild diarrhea.  
Guidelines for administration : oral tablets or suspension, see section 5.2.2 (Remission 
induction, Block II), section 5.3 (Interim continuation), section 5.5 (Continuation).  
 
 
16. LEUCO VORIN (Folinic Acid)  
 
Source and pharmacology : Leucovorin is a racemic mixture of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is 
involved as a cofactor for 1 -carbon transfer reactions in the synthesis of purines and 
pyrimidines. Leucovorin is a potent antidote for both th e hematopoietic and 
reticuloendothelial toxic effects of folic acid antagonists by [CONTACT_158124]. 
It is postulated that in some cancers, leucovorin enters and “rescues” normal cells from the 
toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in p reference to tumor cells, because of differences in 
membrane transport and affinity for polyglutamylation. Leucovorin is converted in the 
intestinal mucosa and the liver to 5 -methyl -tetrahydrofolate, which is also active as a reduced 
folate. It is excreted  primarily in the urine with minor excretion occurring in the feces.  
 
Formulation and stability : Leucovorin is supplied in 5, 15 and 25 mg tablets and vials 
containing 50, 100 or 350 mg of leucovorin as a lyophilized powder. The tablets and the 
lyophilized  powder can be stored at room temperature. The 50 mg and 100 vials can be 
reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 5 or 10 ml of sterile water or bacteriostatic water for injection 
respectively to yield a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The 350 mg vials can be reconstitut ed 
with 17 ml of sterile water or bacteriostatic water for injection to yield a final concentration of 
20 mg/ml. The reconstituted solution is stable for at least 7 days at room temperature.  
Leucovorin may be further diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl con taining solutions. 
Leucovorin is also available as a 1 mg/ml oral solution.  
 
Supplier : commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Leucovorin is generally well tolerated. Toxicities that have been reported 
uncommonly include rash, mild nausea, headache, and wheezing  (possible allergic reaction). 
Intrathecal leucovorin is contraindicated and has caused neurotoxic deaths. There have been 
rare reports of leucovorin promoting seizures.  
 
Guidelines for administration : oral or intravenous, see section 5.2.2 (Remission indu ction

17. MITOXANTRONE  (Novantrone ) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione that is structurally similar to 
the anthracyclines. It is thought to act by [CONTACT_632617], causing template disorder, 
steric obstruction and inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition, mitoxantrone 
inhibi ts the action of topoisomerase II. Mitoxantrone is active throughout the cell cycle.  
Mitoxantrone is about 78% protein bound and does cross the blood brain barrier. 
Mitoxantrone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. The parent drug and 
metab olites are excreted primarily via hepatobiliary excretion with small amounts excreted in 
the urine. Dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic dysfunction 
(total bilirubin > 3.4 mg/dl).  
 
Formulation and stability : Mitoxantrone is ava ilable in multi -dose vials containing 20 mg, 25 
mg or 30 mg of mitoxantrone as a dark blue, aqueous solution at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. 
The intact vials should be stored at room temperature. Refrigeration may result in 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_794431], wh ich will re -dissolve upon warming to room temperature. The 
drug should be further diluted to at least 50 ml in 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl prior to 
administration. These solutions are chemically stable for at least 7 days when stored at room 
temperature.  
 
Supplier: commercially available  
 
Toxicity : The major dose -limiting toxicity of mitoxantrone is leukopenia with 
thrombocytopenia and anemia occurring much less frequently. Nausea and vomiting are 
usually moderate in severity. Other side effects reported commo nly include alopecia,  diarrhea, 
headache, fever and stomatitis. Blue to green discoloration of urine and other body fluids 
occurs. Other side effects reported less commonly include elevated liver function tests, 
allergic reactions, seizures, jaundice and r enal failure. Congestive heart failure has been 
reported, but is much less common than with doxorubicin. CHF has been reported primarily 
in patients receiving prior therapy with anthracyclines. Patients with an increased risk of 
cardiotoxicity include thos e having received prior therapy with anthracyclines, those with 
previous mediastinal radiotherapy and those with pre -existing cardiac  conditions.  
 
Guidelines for administration: Intravenous, see section 5.2.3 (Remission induction, Block III).  
 
 
18. TENIPOSIDE (VM -26) (Vumon)

excretion may account for a small amount of total excretion.  
 
Formulation and stability : Teniposide is available in clear glass ampules containing 50 mg of 
teniposide. Each ml of teniposide solution contains 10 mg of teniposide, 30  mg benzyl 
alcohol, 500 mg Cremophor EL and 43% dehydrated alcohol. Intact ampules should be 
stored under refrigeration and protected from light. Freezing does not adversely affect the 
product. Teniposide must be diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl contai ning solutions prior 
to administration to a final concentration between 0.1 -1mg/ml. At these concentrations, 
solutions are stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature. Solutions of 1mg/ml should be 
used within 4 hours of preparation. Refrigeration of dil uted solutions is not recommended.  
 
Supplier : Commercially available  
Toxicity : The major dose -limiting effect of teniposide is bone marrow suppression. Nausea 
and vomiting (moderate in severity), diarrhea, alopecia and mucositis are reported commonly. 
Hypo tension may occur if the drug is given too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Hypersensitivity reactions and 
secondary leukemias have been reported.  
 
Guidelines for administration : Intravenous, see section 5.3 (Interim continuation) and section  
5.5 (Continuation).  
 
 
19. VINBLASTINE  (Velban) 
 
Source and pharmacology : Vinblastine is an alkaloid extracted from the periwinkle plant 
(Vinca Rosea). It reversibly binds to microtubule and spi[INVESTIGATOR_794433]. It may also block cellular utilization of glutamic acid, thereb y inhibiting purine 
synthesis and urea formation via the citric acid cycle. Vinblastine is highly protein bound and 
poorly penetrates the CSF. Metabolism in the liver is extensive with one metabolite, deacetyl 
vinblastine, being more active than the parent  drug. The major route of elimination is via the 
bile. Dosages should be adjusted for patients with impaired liver function (bilirubin > 3 
mg/dl).  
 
Formulation and stability : Vinblastine is available in 10 ml vials containing 1mg/ml of 
vinblastine in solution. Intact vials of vinblastine solution and lyophilized vinblastine should 
be stored under refrigeration.  
 
Supplier : Commercially available  
 
Toxicity : The dose limiting to xicity is myelosuppression. Other toxicities reported commonly 
include alopecia, mild nausea and vomiting and constipation. Vinblastine is a vesicant and 
may cause severe tissue damage if extravasation occurs. Vinblastine rarely produces 
neurotoxicity char acterized by [CONTACT_794516], loss of deep tendon reflexes, weakness, 
jaw pain and “foot drop”. This toxicity is much less common than with vincristine. Acute 
shortness of breath and severe bronchospasm have been reported following the administration  
of vinca alkaloids.

20. IMATINIB (Gleevec®, imatinib mesylate)  
 
Source and pharmacology : imatinib mesylate is a phenylaminopyrimidine derivative and is a 
4-[(4-Methyl -1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_200270])methyl -N-[4-methyl -3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl) -2-pyrimid -inyl]amino] - 
phenyl]benzamidemethanesulfonate. It is a protein -tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the 
Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase created by [CONTACT_794517].  
 
Formulation and stability : Each film -coated tablet contains 100 mg or 400 mg of imatinib free 
base. The drug should be stored at 25 C (77F); excursions permitted to 15 C-30C (59F - 
86F). The tablets should be dispensed in a tight container, USP, and protected from moisture.  
 
The prescribed dose should be administered orally, with a meal and a large glass of water. In 
children, the daily dose may be split into two – once in the morning and once in the evening. 
For patients unable to swallow the film -coated tablets, the tablets m ay be dispersed in a glass 
of water or apple juice. The required number of tablets should be placed in the appropriate 
volume of beverage (approximately 50 mL for a 100 -mg tablet, and 200 mL for a 400 -mg 
tablet) and stirred with a spoon. The suspension sho uld be administered immediately after 
complete disintegration of the tablet.  
 
Supplier : Commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Common toxicities include dyspepsia/heartburn, nausea/vomiting, headache, 
myelosuppression, and fatigue. Occasional toxicities include  fever, edema in limbs, face, 
periorbital area, weight gain, increased SGOT/SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, 
abdominal pain and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], myalgia, arthralgia, decreased bone marrow cellularity, 
lymphopenia, eczema dermatitis, rash, muscle pain and cr ampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anorexia, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_152115] (hypo -vitiligo). Rare toxicities include cerebral edema, melena/GI bleeding, anemia, 
diarrhea, dysphagia, esophagitis, odynophagia, hemorrhage/bleeding without grade 3 or 4

to multiple forms of human malignancies. In adults, the maximum plasma concentration of 
dasatinib after oral administration is observed between 0.5 and 6 hours. The observed effects 
from food were not clinically relevant. The overall terminal half -life is 3 -5 hours. The drug 
exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and linear elimination characteristics over the 
dose range of 15 mg to 240 mg/day in adults. Dasatinib is primarily metabolized in the liver 
by [CONTACT_752806]3A4 enzyme, is a significant inhibitor of CYP3A4. Dasatinib may decrease 
the metabolic clearance of drugs that are significantly metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzyme.  
Due to the potential of dasatinib to prolong the QT/QTc, caution must be used when 
administering it with other potential QTc prolong ing medications. Due to the possibility of 
gastrointestinal, cardiac, and cutaneous hemorrhage, avoid using medications that inhibit 
platelet function or anticoagulants in conjunction with Dasatinib. Dasatinib is not a p - 
glycoprotein inhibitor.  
 
Formulation and stability : Dasatinib is available as tablets of 20 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg. The 
core tablet is surrounded by a film coating to prevent exposure to the active drug substance 
during handling. If tablets are cut or crushed, procedures to prevent e xposure to the active 
drug substance should be followed. Pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers should not 
handle crushed and/or broken dasatinib tablets.  
 
The intact dasatinib tablets can be placed (and allowed to dissolve) in 1 ounce of lemonade (a 
double strength juice is recommended to obscure the bitter taste), or 1 ounce of preservative -free 
apple juice, or 1 ounce of preservative -free orange juice.  
 
The following (i.e. steps 1 thru 7) is the procedure for the preparation of the lemon ade dosing 
solution. For preservative -free apple juice or preservative -free orange juice, steps 2 thru 7 
should be followed.  
 
1. Mix the contents of one 12 ounce can of Minute Maid Premium Frozen Concentrate 
with 2 cans (i.e. the emptied  lemonade  container)  of water.  This will produce  lemonade 
that is a little more than twice as concentrated as the instructions on the can with a 
sweeter  taste.  Please  keep  the lemonade  solution  refrigerated  when  not in use. 
2. Place  1 ounce  (30 mL) of this lemonade  solution  into a drinking  glass.  
3. Place  the proper  dose of intact  tablets  into the lemonade.  Please  be sure to always  wear 
protective gloves when handling the medication. A mask is not required when  handling 
the medication. Always use the [ADDRESS_1095731] time. Immediately 
administer the entire contents of the  glass.  
6. In order to ensure administration of the entire medication dose, a rinsing step is 
necessary.  Add 0.5 ounce (15 mL) of lemonade into the same glass that has just been 
emptied.  Swirl  the contents  to remove  any remaining  signs  of tablets  from  the sides  or 
bottom of the  glass.  
7. Administer the washing lemonade to the  patient.

22. NILOTINIB (Tasigna™)  
 
Source and pharmacology : Nilotinib is a selective Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor that may 
be used in the treatm ent of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL). Nilotinib binds to and stabilizes the inactive 
conformation of the kinase domain of Abl protein. It is considered to be a “second generation” 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor and may be efficacious in patients who have becomes resistant to 
“first generation” drugs such as imatinib. Nilotinib is an analog of imatinib and features a 
more energetically favorable binding mode that contributes to its enhanced potenc y (twenty 
times higher than imatinib). The increased potency is hoped to allow lower dosages, which 
may limit side effects that would otherwise make this medication intolerable.  
 
Formulation and stability : Tasigna (nilotinib) capsules, for oral use, contai n 150 mg or 200 
mg nilotinib base, anhydrous (as hydrochloride, monohydrate) with the following inactive 
ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate 
and polyoxamer 188. The capsules contain gelatin, iron oxide (red), iron oxide (yellow), iron 
oxide (black) and titanium dioxide. The capsules should be stored at 25°C, although 
excursions are permitted between 15 -30°C.  
 
Supplier : Commercially available  
 
Toxicity : Its most common side effects, occurring in over 10% of patients, include peripheral 
edema, headache, rash, pruritis, fatigue, GI upset, increased lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], neutropenia (grades 3/4, 
median duration 15 days), thrombocytopenia (grades 3/4, median duration 22 da ys), 
neuralgias, musculoskeletal pain, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. Other serious side 
effects include QT prolongation, depression, insomnia, electrolyte disturbances, pancytopenia, 
and elevated LFTs. Reports of sudden deaths from QTc prolongati on has let the FDA to 
require a “Black Box” warning on Tasigna emphasizing the need to monitor electrolyte levels 
and co -administration of other medications in patients taking the drug. Nilotinib should not be

taken with drugs that prolong t he QT interval or inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. It may 
induce other CYP enzymes, thus affecting the metabolism of other drugs. It also inhibits P - 
glycoprotein and is a substrate for its efflux transporter. The REMS (Risk Evaluation and 
Mitigation Stra tegy) approved in conjunction with the Black Box Warning requires that all 
patients receive specific oral and written counseling to take nilotinib on an empty stomach, 
time doses appropriately, get regular ECGs, avoid grapefruit products, and report all ot her 
medications to the prescribing physician. Nilotinib should be used with caution in patients 
with a history of pancreatitis or impaired hepatic function.  
 
Dosage and route of administration : Nilotinib is available as oral capsules in 150 mg and 200

APP ENDIX VI: DEFINITIONS RELATED TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES  
 
I. ASSESSMENTS  
 
A. Fever : A single temperature of > 38.3oC (101oF) or >38.0oC (100.4oF) on two 
occasions within [ADDRESS_1095739] be oral with glass or IVAC7 
thermometers or at the tympanic membrane by [CONTACT_158132] (Thermoscan7). 
The same method should be used throughout the febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_794434].  
B. Neutropenia : Neutrophil count < 500/mm3 or < 1,000/mm3 with predicted decline 
to <500/mm3. 
C. Duration of Fever (for epi[INVESTIGATOR_158019] ): The initial 
temperature  is the one immediately before the first dose of antibiotics and GCSF. 
This is des ignated as zero hour . The end of a febrile period  is at the time of the 
first temperature of 38.0oC or less which is sustained at this level over a period  of 
24 hours or longer without antipyretic intervention. The duration of fever  is the 
number of hours from zero hour to the end of the febrile  period.  
D. Antibiotic Therapy:  Any systemic antibacterial drug will be considered as 
antibiotic therapy whether given orally or parenterally. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_794435].  
E. Antifungal Therapy:  Any antifungal  drug administered orally or parenterally  will 
be considered antifungal therapy. Antifungal therapy will be categorized for 
analysis  as: 
1. Treatment for oral candidiasis  
Nystatin  
Clotrimazole troches 
Micafungin 
Fluconazole 
Voriconazole  
2. Treatment for systemic  mycoses (includes empi[INVESTIGATOR_794436]) 
Systemic amphotericin B (standard and liposomal) 
Fluconazole  
Voriconazole 
Posiconazole 
Itraconazole 
Micafungin  
 
II. BACTERIAL  
 
1. Bacteremia only : Defined as a growth of an organism that is judged not to be a 
contaminant in a blood culture drawn during a febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Organisms are 
considered contaminants if they are part of skin flora (e.g., diphtheroids other  than 
Corynebacterium jeikeium , Bacillus spp. not B. cereus, Propi[INVESTIGATOR_158022]., 
coagulase -negative staphylococcus (CNS) or Micrococcus spp. ) and if they are 
isolated from only one culture receptacle. All other organisms are regarded as 
pathogens. (Specify catheter -related or  not.)

2. Bacterial sepsis : positive blood culture for any bacterium plus clinical evidence  of 
infection (fever, chills, hypotension, etc.). (Specify catheter -related or  not.) 
3. Urinary tract infection : urine colony count of 100,000 or greater of a single 
organism plus symptoms, dysu ria, flank pain, etc. Asymptomatic bactiuria  is the 
same colony count without  symptoms.  
4. Pneumonia (bacterial ): radiographic discernible infiltrate plus isolation of 
potentially causative bacteria from bronchoalveolar lavage, blood or biopsy 
specimen. If po sitive blood culture, code as bacterial sepsis with  pneumonia.  
5. Meningitis : positive culture of causative bacteria from CSF plus symptoms 
compatible with  meningitis.  
6. Osteomyelitis : radiographic lesions plus positive blood or bone aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy 
cultures.  
7. Acute Otitis Media : physician diagnosis plus antibiotic  treatment.  
8. Pharyngitis : only if group A beta hemolytic streptococcus is isolated from throat 
culture in patient with symptoms. A positive rapid streptococcal test is acceptable 
in place of culture. Oth er types of pharyngitis will not be  considered.  
9. Cellulitis : erythema and induration plus isolation of bacteria from aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/  drainage.  
 
III. FUNGAL  INFECTIONS  
 
A. Candidiasis  
1. Oral: presence of typi[INVESTIGATOR_794437].

NOTE: Probable IFD requires the presence of a host factor, a clinical criteriaon, and a mycological criterion. 
Cases that meet the criteria for a host factor and a clinical criterion but for which mycological criteria are 
absent are considered possible IFD.  
a Host factors are not synonymous with risk factors and are characteristics by [CONTACT_794522]. They are intended primarily to apply to patients given treatment for malignant disease 
and to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794442] -organ transplants. These factors are also

d The presence of signs and symptoms consistent with sepsis syndrome indicates acute disseminated disease, 
whereas their absence denotes chromic disseminated disease  
e These tests are primarily applicable to aspergillosis and candidiasis and are not useful i n diagnosing 
infections due to Cryptococcus species or Zygomycetes (e.g. Rhizopus, Mucor, or Absidia species). Detection of 
nucleic acid is not included, because there are as yet no validated or standardized methods.

In the table above, cases that meet the criteria for a host factor and a clinical criterion but 
for which mycological criteria are absent are considered possible IFD.  
 
C. Histoplasmosis : a diagnosis of disseminated disease may be established by a 
positive Histoplasma antigen test on CSF, urine or serum by [CONTACT_191117], or the  presence 
of characteristic intracellular yeast forms in a peripheral blood smear or in bone 
marrow.  
Criteria for the diagnosis of endemic mycoses  
Diagnosis and criteria  
Proven endemic mycosis  
In a host with an illness consistent with an endemic mycosis, 1 of the following  
• Recovery in culture from a specimen obtained from the affected site or  from 
blood  
• Histopathologic or direct microscopic demonstration of appropriate morphologic 
forms with a truly distinctive appearance characteristic of dimporphic fungi, such 
as Coccidiodes species spherules, Blastomyces dermatitis thick -walled broad - 
based budding yea sts, Paraccidioides brasilensis multiple budding yeast cells, 
and, in the case of histoplasmosis, the presence of characteristic intracellular  yeast 
forms in a phagocyte in a peripheral blood smear or in tissue  macrophages  
• For coccidioidomycosis, demonstra tion of coccidioidal antibody in CSF, or a 2 - 
dilution rise measured in 2 consecutive blood samples tested concurrently in the 
setting of an ongoing infectious disease  process.  
• For paracoccidioidomycosis, demonstration in 2 consecutive serum samples of  a 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_794443]  
• Presence of a host factor, including but not limited to those specified in #[ADDRESS_1095741] result from urine, blood,  or 
CSF 
Note: E ndemic mycosies includes histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, 
paracoccidioidomycosis, sporotrichosis, and infection due to Penicillium marneffei. Onset within 
[ADDRESS_1095742] factors nor clinical features are 
sufficiently specific; such cases are considered to be of value too limited to include in clinical 
trials, epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], or evaluations of diagnost ic tests.  
 
D. Others : the investigator may include certain other infectious diseases of unique 
nature. Acceptance requires decision before decoding occurs and with the 
agreement of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_794444].

APPENDIX VIII: HDMTX ADMINISTRATION AND MONITORING GUIDELINES 
INDUCTION BLOCK II  
 
High -dose MTX (HDMTX) will be given at a dose of 5 g/m2 over [ADDRESS_1095743] for the patient 
prior to administration of HDMTX. Every effort should be m ade to avoid nephrotoxins 
(amphotericin, acyclovir) and drug that could compete with MTX (penicillins and proton pump 
inhibitors) on the day of and the day after HDMTX begins; use of NSAIDs and salicylates of any 
kind is contraindicated. HDMTX should not b e given to patients with any residual mucositis 
without discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_87031].  
 
Standing orders should be in place that includes twice daily BMP, magnesium, and phosphorus. 
In addition, orders should include specific instructions to notify  the physician of record or their 
designee. These include:  
 
• Notification if HDMTX stopped for a cumulative time of 60 minutes or  more  
• Any increase in serum creatinine by > 0.3 mg/dL or a doubling of creatinine from pre - 
HDMTX  value  
• 2 or more consecutive urine pH < 6.5 or 2 consecutive urine pH > 9 
• No urine output for 4  hours  
• > [ADDRESS_1095744] 48 hours after start of  HDMTX  
• > [ADDRESS_1095745] 48 hours after start of  HDMTX  
• Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_794450] [ADDRESS_1095746] 4 times with the HDMTX: prior to starting 
the infu sion and at hours 6, 23, and [ADDRESS_1095747] daily until the concentration is  
< 0.1 µM. After the patient has cleared MTX, please fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_794451]  (from 
your lab system) to the SJ Pharmacokinetics  Lab at for inclusion into the SJ 
electronic medical  record.  
 
Ideally, each patient will receive IV hydration with Bicarb beginning the evening prior to 
scheduled admission for HDMTX with a ra te of at least 125 mL/m2/hr. Hydration should 
continue at this rate until the MTX concentration is < 0.5 µM or longer if the patient has a 
history of toxicity or delayed excretion. Patients with poor clearance are candidates for increased 
hydration and mor e aggressive alkalinization. Acetazolamide is an effective diuretic in patients 
with delayed MTX excretion. Patients with MTX concentrations > [ADDRESS_1095748] to discuss targeting and 
leucovorin rescue. (Please use the  group email  ).SJ will also 
provide contact [CONTACT_794523].

hours BEFORE or AFTER glucarpi[INVESTIGATOR_794455] a substrate for 
glucarpi[INVESTIGATOR_794456].  
 
NOTE : Early leucovorin rescue should not need to start prior to 24 hours, regardless of the 
concentration. Although it is not likely to be very effective, early leucovorin should be instituted 
sometime between 24 and 42 hours at a dose of ~2000 – 2400 mg/m2/day if the 24 hour 
concentration is > 300 µM or it is above 200 µM and the half -life is > 8 hours. Continuous 
infusions of leucovorin are slightly preferred over bolus infusions, on the off chance that high 
leucovorin concentrations could either compete with  MTX for excretion or contribute to 
neurotoxicity, but doses as high as 500 mg/m2 can be given safely if necessary.

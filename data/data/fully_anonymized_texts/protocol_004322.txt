3.1. Cystic Fibrosis  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, autosomal recessive disease resulting from a mutation in a 
single gene on  chromosome 7 that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) protein  (Katkin, 2020 ). The CFTR gene  encodes for the CFTR protein , which 
is located in every mucus-producing organ of the body, including the lungs, liver, pancreas, and 
intestines, as well as sweat glands. Normally, the CFTR protein controls the movement of ions 
from inside the cell to outside the cell. In people with CF, the mutated gene causes the protein to 
not work properly, which, in turn, affects the movement of sodium and water. This causes thick, 
sticky mucus and blockages in the lungs and digestive system .  
Staphylococcus aureus  is one of the most common airway pathogen in patients with CF  
(Figure 1). Airway infections are associated with progressive lung  function decline and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], which is the leading cause of mortality. Pulmonary exacerbations are 
aggressively managed with high health care utilization, requiring chronic treatment. Methicillin -
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is also associated w ith poor survival in CF patients. In patients with 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_436834], median survival time is 6.2 years less than for 
patients with negative MRSA cultures. Therefore, MRSA infection may be a modifiable risk 
factor for death in pa tients with CF ( Figure 2).

regarding their utility in the management of bacterial exacerbations in patients with CF: 1)  no 
agent has been demonstrated to have an acceptable efficacy and safety profile to result in 
marketing authorization approval by  [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA), European 
Medicines Agency ( EMA), or other health authority for the treatment of exacerbations of CF 
caused by S. aureus; 2) the agents possessing appreciable activity against MRSA require 
parenteral administration; 3) agents such as trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole , clindamycin, 
doxy/minocycline, that can be administered orally do not possess consistent activity against 
MRSA and have significant safety and tolerability issues limiting their utility in CF patients.  
3.2. Lefa mulin  
XENLETA® (lefamulin; BC-3781), is a novel, semi -synthetic, first -in-class pleuromutilin 
antibiotic for systemic use in humans. Pleuromutilin derivatives inhibit bacterial protein 
synthesis by a novel interaction with the peptidyl transferase center ( PTC) in domain V of 23S 
ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) in the large ribosomal subunit. The unique binding site of the 
pleuromutilins in the highly conserved core of the ribosomal PTC confers a low propensity for 
the development of bacterial resistance, and a lack of cross -resistance with other antibiotic 
classes. A pleuromutilin has been approved for topi[INVESTIGATOR_436835].

acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults  18 years of age and older  caused by [CONTACT_436848]: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus  
(methicillin -susceptible isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae , and Chlamydophila pneumoniae  (Nabriva Therapeutics, Inc., 2021 ). 
While the number of patients in the CABP pi[INVESTIGATOR_436836], lef amulin has been demonstrated to possess excellent 
activity against MRSA in in vitro and in vivo animal infection models. In addition, lefamulin was 
shown to have similar efficacy as compared with intravenous (IV) vancomycin in a Phase 2 
clinical study of t he treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in which 
approximately 69% of subjects had MRSA as the causative organism identif ied (Prince, 2013). 
For details on lefamulin nonclinical and clinical development programs, see the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.3. Study and Dose Rationale  
Study NAB-BC-3781-1014 (hereafter referred to as Study 1014) is designed to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) of a 600-mg immediate -release (IR) tablet and [ADDRESS_553483] common causative pathogens associated with 
exacerbations of CF ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 201 9). Current treatment guidelines for the 
management of exaccerbatio ns of CF caused by S. aureus recommend the use of unapproved 
antibactertial agents. Further, many of the recommended treatments can only be administered via 
the IV route and/or have limitations due to safety and tolerability. L efamulin is a novel, first -in-
class, IV and oral pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent that has been demonstrated to be highly 
potent against S. aureus, including MRSA and strains obtained from patients with CF ( Nabriva 
Therapeutics, Inc., 2021; Sader, 2021). Cystic fibrosis patients have  altered drug distribution and 
elimination kinetics for many antimicrobials relative to patients without CF. While the advent of 
CFTR modulaotrs has resulted in improved lung function and had a positive impact on the 
quality of life of CF patients, limited  data have been published describing the impact of the 
conomittnat use of CFTR modulaotrs and commonly used antibacterial agents ( Albright, 2020).  
This study is intended to assess the PK and safety of  a single dose of IV and oral formulations of 
lefamulin in adults with CF.  
3.3.2.  Dose Rationale  
For treatment  of adults with CABP, the recommended  dosage regimen of lefamulin is  as follows: 
• 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h)  by [CONTACT_12781] 60 minutes for 5  to 7 days, or  
• 150 mg q12h by [CONTACT_12781]  60 minutes then switch to 600  mg orally 
q12h (at  the discretion of  the physician) for 5  to 7 days total,  or 
• 600 mg orally q12h for 5  days. 
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 20 Confidential  In this study, single doses of IV and oral lefamulin will be studied in CF patients; PK data from 
this study will be sufficient to compare exposure in these patients to the known exposure in non -
CF patients. The single doses to be evaluated in adults will be those recommended for treatment 
of CABP, ie , 150 mg IV or 600 mg orally.  
3.4. Risk Assessment  
Patients participating in  this crossover study will receive lefamulin as a single 600 -mg IR tablet 
and a 150-mg IV infusion in a crossover fashion  for the purposes of PK and safety assessment . 
Consequently,  patients participating in the study will be unlikely to derive any clinica l benefit 
from exposure to lefamulin.  
In adult clinical studies conducted to date, lefamulin has been well tolerated when administered 
by [CONTACT_436849] (see Investigator’s Brochure, Section 5.2.1). Following oral dosing, 
gastrointestinal adverse events were most frequent (typi[INVESTIGATOR_436837], diarrhoea, or 
abdominal pain), without a clear correlation with dose level. Following IV dosing, the most 
frequently reported adverse events were administration site reactions. Analysis by [CONTACT_436850] ≥  [ADDRESS_553484] inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Potential patients will be carefully screened by [CONTACT_436851], medical history, 
physical examination, and by [CONTACT_53402] ( ECG) to exclude those  patients who could be at 
increased risk. Participating patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability during each part 
of the study  and through a Follow-up phone call  which will take place [ADDRESS_553485]

A schedule of study assessmen ts is provided in Table 1. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion  criteria may be enrolled in the study after the nature and purpose of the 
protocol has been explained and written informed consent /assent has been voluntarily given by 
[CONTACT_23328]/her legal representative, when appropriate .  
Consent must be obtaine d before any screening procedures are performed and before study drug 
administration. All study assessments and procedures as specified in this protocol will be 
performed by [CONTACT_29517] a qualified designee.  
Patients will be screened within 30 days  before check-in to the CRU on Day -1. For patients who 
are screened ( ie, those with signed written informed consent) but not enrolled, the reason for 
screening failure will be documented.  If a patient is determined to be a screen failure, he/she can 
be rescreened once if the Investigator believes the patient will be eligible upon rescreening.  
8.1. Medical/Surgical History  
A medical and surgical history will be taken at Screening  and on Day  -[ADDRESS_553499] been present/a ctive within [ADDRESS_553500] of the study.  The medical history should  
include drug allergy history.  
8.2. Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination  (except for rectal and vaginal examinations)  will be performed 
by [CONTACT_436852] -in to the CRU on Day  -1. At the other time 
points specified in Table 1, focused physical examinations will be performed according  to 
standard institutional practices and must be documented in source documents. Clinically 
significant f indings, as determined by [CONTACT_737],  will be documented in the eCRF as either 
medical history or adverse events.  
Body weight and height will be measured at Screening only.  
8.3. Vital Signs  
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body temperature, HR, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oxygen saturation  measurements will be recorded at  the time points 
specified in Table 1.  
Vital signs will be measured after patients have rested for at least 5 minutes in a sitting position.

twice. If the second repeat measurement value does not qualify the patient, he or she is not 
eligible for that  part of the  study but may be reevaluated at a later time. 
Vital signs measurements should be repeated if clinically significant changes or machine errors 
occur during the course of the study .

will be analyzed at a local laboratory . Additional tests may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator if deemed clinically appropriate . A full list of the clinical laboratory tests that will be 
performed and analyzed can be found in Appendix  1. 
A serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at the 
Screening and Day -1 Visits for each dosing period . A confirmatory FSH level will be 
determined at Screening for females who are ≥  [ADDRESS_553501] -menopausal. A FSH level 
> 40 mIU/mL indicates non -child bearing potential.   
Safety laboratory results outside the normal range will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5256] 
“clinically significant” or “not clinically significant.” Any clinically significant value that is not 
expected for this population should be repeated as necessary.  
If a patient has an abnormal laboratory value at check -in for either study period,  the laboratory 
test may be repeated . If after the repeat measurem ent the value does not qualify the  patient , the 
patient is not eligible for that part of the study. If the Investigator determines that the laboratory 
abnormality is likely to be transient and easily explained, the explanation will be documented

be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], or a monitoring physician, an d will be treated and/or followed 
until the symptoms or values have either resolved or are assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737].  
Every reasonable attempt should be made to retain patients in the study. If a patient does not 
report to the study site for a  scheduled visit, study personnel will make [ADDRESS_553507] attempts: 
[ADDRESS_553508] to follow -up if: (1) upon receipt of delivery 
confirmation of the certified letter the  patient does not contact [CONTACT_779] ; or (2) the certified letter is 
returned as undeliverable.  
9. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
9.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation  patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the use of a 
medicinal ( investigational ) product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. 
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 34 Confidential  Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient before the start of the 
study (ie, before infor med consent) should be recorded as medical/surgical history. Any medical 
occurrences that are new or worsened from the time of informed consent and up to and including 
the final visit must be reported as AEs. All AEs must be recorded regardless of causalit y. 
Patients will be monitored throughout the study for adverse reactions to the study medications 
and/or procedures at each study visit. Questions will be posed in a non -leading manner so as not 
to bias the response. In addition to questioning at specific time points, patients will be 
encouraged to spontaneously report any AEs. Any patient with an AE or clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory test result will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], or a monitoring physician, 
and will be treated and/or followed  until the symptoms or values have resolved or are assessed as 
stable by [CONTACT_737]. A physician, either at the investigative site or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_322522], will administer treatment for any serious adverse events ( SAEs). When 
appropria te, medical tests and examinations may be performed to ensure an AE has fully 
resolved. 
Adverse events will be collected throughout the study from the time a patient signs the informed  
consent through the Follow-up assessment  after the second dosing period . Whenever possible, a 
specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be 
identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an observed or reported 
sign or symptom is not considered a component of  a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_3786], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  
The Investigator will evaluate and report the onset date/time, outcome and end date/time, 
severity (intensity), relationship to study drug, actions tak en with study drug, whether event 
caused study discontinuation, whether concomitant or additional treatment was given, and 
determination of seriousness for each AE.  
Laboratory abnormalities will not be considered AEs unless they are associated with clinica l 
signs and symptoms or require medical intervention. Clinically significant abnormal clinical 
laboratory findings, unless judged by [CONTACT_167610]’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will 
not be reported as AEs.  
The Investigator will exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
clinical laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
9.2. Assessment of Sever ity (Intensity)  
The following definitions for rating severity (intensity) will be used: 
• Mild: An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
• Moderate : An AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic interventio n. 
The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but the 
patient is still able to function . 
• Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 35 Confidential  9.3. Assessment of Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to explain each AE and determine its 
relationship, if any, to study drug treatment. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the 
event to the study drug will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult the 
Investigator’s Brochure in the determination of his/her ass essment. Causality should be assessed 
using the following categories:  
• Not related : The event could readily be explained by [CONTACT_436857] a temporal relationship with the study drug did not exist.  
• Possibly Related : There was some  temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the study drug and the event was unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_436858]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Probably Related : The temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the study drug was suggestive, and the event was less likely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Definitely Related : The event followed a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, fo llowed a known or suspected response pattern to 
the study drug, was confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] 
(dechallenge) and reappeared upon repeated exposure (rechallenge). (N OTE: this is 
not to be construed as requiring re -exposure of the  patient, however , a category of 
definitely related could only be used when recurrence was observed.).  
9.4. Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life-threatening.  NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the  patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity.  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -
existing conditions, which have not worsened after entry into the  study, should not be classified 
as SAEs. For example, admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436840] t hat meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 36 Confidential  NOTE: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436841] [ADDRESS_553509] be reported to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC or 
their representative within 24  hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE 
that meets 1 or more of the aforementioned serious criteria). Reportin g is done by [CONTACT_436859] (EDC) system or paper SAE report form, 
whichever is applicable. The EDC system and/or paper report forms should be completed in as 
much detail as possible but lack of comple te information should not delay the reporting of the 
SAE.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC, or their representative. 
However, it is very important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for 
every event prior to transmission of the SAE report form to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC, or their 
representative.  The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_47958] l ight of follow -up 
information, amending the SAE report form accordingly. The causality assessment is [ADDRESS_553510] elapsed . In 
addition, the Sponsor will also assess causality of SAEs based on the information provided by 
[CONTACT_737].  
All SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse events (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported by [CONTACT_436860] a ccordance with the European Directive 
2001/20/EC, as applicable.

02 November 2021 37 Confidential  • Pregnancy exposure ( a patient becomes pregnant while taking study drug)  
Patients who are pregnant at Screening and/or Day -[ADDRESS_553511] be notified of 
any female patient (or the partner of a male patient) who becomes pregnant during the  
study. Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies  must be followed 
to conclusion to determine their outc ome. This information is important for both drug 
safety and public health concerns. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designee to report any pregnancy that occurs during this study to Nabriva 
Therapeutics DAC or their representative.  
• Lactation exposure ( ie, the patient  was taking study drug while nursing an infant)  
• Accidental exposure (someone other than the study patient was exposed to study 
drug) 
• Overdose ( the patient  received more than the prescribed dose of study drug within a 
given timeframe)  
• Other medication errors that potentially place patients at a greater risk of harm than 
was previously known or recognized ( eg, study drug was administered by [CONTACT_436861]) 
10. DRUG SUPPLIES

study medications. At conclusion of the study, any unused study drug will be destroyed at the 
site after approval from  the Sponsor. If no supplies remain, this will be recorded in the drug 
accountability section of the final monitoring report.  
10.5. Compliance  
Study personnel will supervise , observe, and record  all study drug dosing of each  patient while 
he/she is an inpatient at the C RU.  
10.6. Treatment of Overdose  
As study personnel are administering and documenting all doses in the study, the risk of 
overdose is considered to be low.  
No specific antidote to lefamulin is known. Any signs or symptoms of a possible overdose will 
be treated supportively. In the case of an emergency, standard emergency procedures will be 
employed.  
10.7. Occupational Safety  
Lefamulin is not expected to pose a significant occupational safety risk to site staff under norm al 
conditions of use and administration. Material Safety Data Sheets describing occupational 
hazards and recommended handling precautions will be either provided to the Investigator, 
where this is required by [CONTACT_1207], or are available upon request from Nabriva Therapeutics.

Methodology: (Part A)  Open label  multiple dose study of a combination drug (SEL -212) 
combined with an open label multiple dose study of a single drug  (SEL -037) followed by  (Part 
B) an open label administration of a single drug (SEL -037).  Part C will involve patients naïve to 
SEL-212 who are treated with multiple doses of the combination drug (SEL -212).  
 
Number of patients (planned):  In Part A and Part B, a pproximately 100 subjects will be 
divided into 11 dosing cohorts , each consisting of 6 -20 subjects . Cohorts 1 -10 are closed to 
enrollment  but are permitted to be re -opened to increase the enrollment to the maximum total 
number of subjects permitted . Cohort s 11 and 12 will continue enrolling up to 20 subjects  per 
cohort . Cohort 1 will receive  SEL-037 (pegsiticase alone , 0.2 mg/kg ). Cohort 2 will receive  
SEL-037 (pegsiticase alone, 0.4 mg/kg), Cohort 3 will receive SEL-212 (with 0.05 mg/kg  of 
SEL-110 + 0.2 mg/kg pegsiticase) , Cohort 4 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.05 mg/kg of SEL -
110 + 0.4 mg/kg pe gsiticase), Cohort 5 will receive SEL -212 (with 0. 08 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 
0.2 mg/kg pegsiticase) , Cohort 6 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.08 mg/kg  of SEL -110 + 0.4 
mg/kg pegsiticase) , Cohort 7 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.1 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg 
pegsiticase) , Cohort 8 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.1 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 0.4 mg/kg 
pegsiticase) , Cohort 10 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.125 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 0.4 mg/kg 
pegsiticase, Cohort 11 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.15 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg 
pegsiticase), and Cohort 12 will receive SEL -212 (with 0.15 mg/kg of SEL -110 + 0.4 mg/kg 
pegsiticase . (Note : Cohort 9 is intentionally omitted from this protocol in order to maintain 
the cohort numbering convention of associating even numbered cohorts with th e 0.4 mg/kg 
SEL-037 dose.)  
 
In Part C, up to 40 patients naïve to SEL -212 will be enrolled . Patients enrolled in Cohort 13 will 
receive SEL -212 (0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg SEL -037). Patients enrolled in Cohort 1 5 
will receive an initial induction dose of SEL -212 (0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg SEL -037) 
and, then, four s ubsequent doses of SEL -212 (0.10 mg/kg SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg SEL -037). 
Patients enrolled in Cohort 17 will receive SEL -212 (0.10 mg/kg SEL -110 + 0.2 mg/kg 
SEL-037).  (Note: Cohort s 14 and 1 6 are intentionally omitted from this protocol in order to 
maintain the cohort numbering convention of associating odd numbered cohorts with the 0. 2 
mg/kg SEL -037 dose.)  
 
Subjects who withdraw early or have significant protocol deviations or compliance iss ues 
may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor to complete the objectives of the clinical 
study and maintain the integrity of the data set.

Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985334], dosage and mode of administration:  
SEL-037 is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a 2 ml stoppered vial with 6 mg SEL -037 per 
vial.  SEL -037 is reconstituted with 1.1 mL of sterile water for injection, USP.  A sufficient 
volume of reconstituted SEL -037 at 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg will be dilu ted in 100 mL of 
0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP and dosed as a single intravenous infusion with an 
infusion pump over 60 minutes  (+/- 2 minutes). If necessary the infusion time may be 
extended in order to en sure the infusion of the study medicatio n in entirety . If a subject is 
assigned to Cohort s [ADDRESS_985335] will receive a single IV infusion of normal saline 
(20 mL) with  a syringe infusion pump over a period of 55 minutes starting concurrently with 
a 60 minute infusion of 125 mL of norm al saline.  This will be followed by [CONTACT_721313] -037 ( 0.2 mg/kg for Cohort 1 or 0.4 mg/kg  for Cohort 2 ) 
delivered over 60 minutes  (+/- 2 minutes). If necessary the infusion time may be extended in 
order to en sure the infu sion of the study medication in entirety . 
SEL-110 will be supplied frozen in 10 ml glass  vials . After thawing at room temperature for 
2 hours , the appropriate amount of SEL -110 on a mg/kg basis will be drawn into a syringe  or 
syringes  and administered as an IV infusion with a syringe infusion pump . If a subject is part 
of Cohorts 3-8, 10, 11, or 12,  then SEL-110 is to be administered prior to SEL -037. In 
cohorts receiving SEL-110 doses <0.10 mg/kg, SEL -110 will be infused at a single steady 
rate sufficient to deliver the dose volume over a period of 55 minutes concurrently with a 60 
minute infusion of 125  mL of normal saline . In cohorts receiving SEL -110 ≥0.10 mg/kg, the 
rate of SEL-110 infusion will be 5.5 mL/hour for the first  30 minutes  and, then, will be 
changed to a steady rate sufficient to deliver the remainder of the dose volume for the 
additional 25 minutes, concurrently with a 60 minute infusion of 125 mL of normal saline.  
For all cohorts receiving SEL -110, the infusion  of SEL-037 (0.2 mg/kg for Cohorts 3,  5, 7, 
and 11 ; 0.4 mg/kg for Cohorts 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ), as described above , will be started  at the 
60 minute mark . 
For Cohort s 13, 15, and 17 , SEL-110 will be administered prior to SEL -037. The rate of 
SEL-110 infusion will be 5.5 mL/hour for the first 30  minutes and, then, will be changed to a 
steady rate sufficient to deliver the remainder of the dose volume for the additional 25 
minutes, concurrently with a 60 minute infusion of 125  mL of normal saline. The i nfusion of 
0.2 mg/kg SEL-037 will delivered by [CONTACT_721314] 60  minutes (+/ - 2 
minutes). If necessary , the infusion time may be extended in order to ensure the infusion of 
the study medication in entirety.  
 
Distribution of Subjects  
All enrolled subjects will be randomized initially to Cohorts 1, 2, [ADDRESS_985336] 
experience will be evaluated before enrollment is opene d to all cohorts.  The future 
enrollment will be randomized between all open cohorts.

closed due to enrollment levels may be re-opened to increase the enrollment to the maximum 
total number of subjects permitted.  
 
 
Premedication for Study Drug  Treatments  
All subjects will receive 180 mg fexofenadine orally the night before receiving study drug  
(12 h ± 2h) and again 2 ± 1 hours before receiving study drug (ie. prior to SEL -037 for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 or SEL -110 for Cohorts 3 -8, 10, 11, and 12).  In additi on, they will also 
receive methylprednisolone  40 mg  (or equivalent drug , for example prednisone 50  mg IV or 
dexamethasone 8 mg IV ) intravenously 1 ± 0.5 hour before receiving study drug  (ie. prior 
SEL-037 for Cohorts 1 and 2 or SEL -110 for Cohort s 3-8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 , and 17 ).  This 
will occur for every dose of study drug in Treatment Periods [ADDRESS_985338] is 
enrolled in the study. These medic ations will be supplied by [CONTACT_3652].

Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985383] containing SEL-037 (pegsiticase, Recombinant Pegylated 
Candida Urate Oxidase) and SEL-[ADDRESS_985384]  consisting of a biodegradable polymeric 
nanoparticle consisting of PLA (poly (D,L -lactide)) and PLA -PEG (poly (D,L -lactide )-block -
poly-(thylene -glycol )) encapsulating rapamycin . 
 
SEL-037 (pegsiticase ; Recombinant Pegylated Candida Urate Oxidase)  is a lyophilized 
recombinant uricase (urate oxidase) conjugated to multiple 20 kDa molecular weight 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules.  The uricase component of SEL-[ADDRESS_985385] Candida utilis  (Koyama, 1996)  and expressed in Escherichia coli  for production 
(Bomalaski, 2002) .  The uricase component catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to the more 
soluble compound allantoin that is then readily excreted and is being developed to reduce 
hyperuricemia in chronic gout patients  refractory to conventional therapy . SEL-037 has been 
given to humans in a single ascending dose escalation Phase 1 clinical study  SEL-037/101 and 
was given in a single fixed dose of 0.4  mg/kg with or without SEL -110 in a Phase 1b clin ical 
study SEL -212/101.  
SEL-110, (PLA, PLA -PEG nanoparticle encapsulating rapamycin) is designed to inhibit the 
formation of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) when concomitantly administered with a biologic drug 
during the first few doses of the biologic. When SEL-110 is dosed in this manner it induces 
durable, antigen -specific immune tolerance to the biologic therapeutic in animal models.  SEL -
110 has demonstrated the ability to induce antigen specific immune tolerance to pegylated 
uricase (SEL -037) in wild typ e mice, uricase deficient (knock -out) mice, rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. SEL-[ADDRESS_985386] time in a single ascending dose clinical study 
SEL-212/101 . All of the proposed SEL -110 alone doses (0.03 mg/kg, 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg and 
0.5mg/k g) have been completed.  We believe we have identified a MTD in this clinical study for 
SEL-110 of 0.3 mg/kg as discussed further in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
SEL-212 is the combination (i.e. sequentially administered) of SEL -110 and SEL -037 in order to 
prevent the formation of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) and induce immune tolerance to SEL -037 
such that subsequent doses of SEL -037 will remain effective at low ering uric acid levels in 
patients.  SEL-212 was evaluated in a single dose clinical study (SEL -212/101) .  The highest dose 
cohort of SEL -212 proposed was not enrolled  as the SEL -110 component dose exceed ed what 
we believe was the MTD for SEL -110. 
The curre nt multiple dose study of  SEL-212 evaluates  the safety, pharmacokinetics , 
immunogenicity,  and the ability of  SEL-212 to reduce blood uric acid level s, reduce/prevent the 
development of anti -uricase and anti -pegsiticase antibodies  in patients with symptomatic gout 
and elevated uric acid levels .  
Study: SEL-212/201

uricases to metabolize uric acid and renal clearance is the sole method of elimination of uric acid 
(Wu, 1989; Wu, 1992; Oda, 2002) .  Hyperuricemia can occur when excess circulating uric acid 
overwhelms renal excretion capacity or when renal clearance is impaired.  As uric acid 
concentrations rise and reach saturation or super -saturation  levels , urate crystals can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_721273].  This can lead to gout, a painful joint inflammation , due to the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_721274] j oints.  This can also lead to tophus formation, destructive arthritis and renal calculi.  
The American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend lowering uric acid level s to at 
least below 6 mg/dL (Khanna, 2012a; Khanna, 2012b) .   
There are 5 lines of therapy for the reduction of uric acid levels and gout treatment: 1) 
nonpharmacological therapy through diet, lifestyle and comorbidity management, 2) 
symptomatic treatment with NSAIDS, colchicine, or corticosteroids, 3) xanthine oxidase 
inhibitors that inhibit uric acid production like allopurinol, 4) uricosuric agents that improve uric 
acid renal clearance such as probenecid and febuxostat, and 5) uricase therapy with pegloticase  
(Krystexxa®) in patients with severe gout who are refractory  to other treatments.  
4.2.2.  Use of Uricase s to Treat Hyperuricemia  and Gout  
Uricases  metabolize uric acid to allantoin, which is readily soluble and excreted .  Uricase 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_721275] .  Rasburicase (Elitek®), an unpegylated recombinant uricase cloned from 
Aspergillus flavus  (Oldfield, 2006; Cammalleri, 2007) , is approved for management of uri c acid 
levels in patients with tumor lysis syndrome (Elitek®).  Krystexxa® (pegloticase) is a 
recombinant uricase (primarily porcine with a carboxyl -terminus sequence from baboon) bound 
by [CONTACT_27873] [ADDRESS_985388] ory gout (Biggers, 2008; 
Sherman, 2008) .  The c onjugation of uricase with PEG is thought to decrease the 
immunogenicity and increase the half -life of the uricase molecules  (Zalipsky, 1992; Mehvar, 
2000; Fishburn, 2008; Veronese, 2008) .  The clinical experience with Krystexxa®  has shown that 
a significant numbe r of patients will develop a nti-drug antibodies which limit  the long term 
efficac y of the drug  (Lipsky, 2014) . 
4.2.3.  Other Pegylated Proteins  
Pegylated proteins are also approved for use in other indications such as pegylated  E. coli 
asparginase (Oncaspar) as a component of chemotherapy for the treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and bovine pegademase ( pegylated adenosine deaminase ) as a 
replacement therapy for adeno sine deaminase deficiency  in infants and children .

4.3. Summary of Previous Findings  of SEL -037 and SEL -110 
4.3.1.  Nonclinical Animal Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SEL -037 
SEL-037 in rodent models reduces serum uric acid concentrations  in a dose related manner at 
doses tested up to 1.2 mg/kg.  
Nonclinical drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies of SEL-037 showed dose -dependent 
increases in exposure in both the rat and monkey, though terminal half -life was considerably 
longer in the monkey.  The distribution study in rat indicated accumulation in the lungs, kidneys  
and bladder at all time points  relative to the concentration found in plasma and other tissues.  
Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination of SEL-037 in rats.  
The nonclinical toxicology program consists of single intravenous dose toxicity studies 
conducted in rat s and monkeys at doses up to 58.2 mg/kg and 28 day general toxicity studies in 
rats and monkey s in doses up to 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively , a reproductive and early 
embryonic developmental toxicology study conducted in rats  up to a dose of 10 mg/kg , an 
immunotoxicology study conducted in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], an immunogenicity study conducted in 
monkeys, an in -vitro hemoly sis test conducted in blood obta in from New Zealand White rabbits, 
and a 28-day injection site evaluation study conducted in monkeys.  
SEL-037 was well tolerated and there were no clinically significant findings observed in any of 
the above studies with the exception of immunotoxicity no ted in the guinea pig and a decrease in 
complement in the monkey.  Following sensitization in the guinea pig, a strong anaphylactic  
reaction leading to death in all dosing groups was observed.  In monkeys, following weekly 
intravenous administration, SEL-037 produced a low titer of non -neutralizing antibodies to SEL-
037 and uric ase at all dosing levels.  Antibodies were noted within 14 days of the initiation of 
dosing.  In general, antibodies to PEG were not observed.  A decrease in complement was also 
noted in monkeys  at 5 mg/kg  which appears to return to near normal values f ollowing a 4 week 
recovery period.  These changes noted in complement may be secondary to consumption of 
formed immune complexes.  
In addition, SEL -037 was further evaluated in multidose  intravenous toxicity studies of five 
monthly repeated doses of SEL -037 with a one month recovery in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys.   
In the GLP repeated dose study of SEL -037 in rats (Study 1933 -008), reversible test article -

In the GLP repeated dose study of SEL -037 in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 1933 -009), there 
were no adverse findings noted. Test article -related effects were limited to watery feces which 
were observed in males in all treated groups periodically throughout the treatment phase, but not 
observed during the recovery period and were not considered to be adverse due to the sporadic 
and minimal nature of the finding. Based on these data, the NOAEL for  this study was 4.0 mg/kg 
SEL-037, the highest dose level tested.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SEL -110   
Consistent with ICH guidance, SEL -110 has been evaluated in nonclinical studies to support 
clinical study in humans, including safety pharmacology studies in rats and monkeys, as w ell as 
single and multiple dose toxicology studies in rats and monkeys.  Immunotoxicology and local 
injection site reactions also were evaluated as a component of a repeat dose study in monkeys 
(Study 1933 -004).  Initial nonGLP dose finding studies of SEL -110 toxicity were completed in 
Sprague Dawley rats (Study 14 -[ZIP_CODE] -N1) and cynomolgus monkeys (Study 14 -[ZIP_CODE] -N1) in 8 -
week studies (given biweekly five times by [CONTACT_375831]).    
In the GLP repeated dose study of SEL -110 in rats ( Study 1933 -005), 1, 3 and 6 mg /kg were 
given as an intravenous slow bolus 3 times separated by 28 days. SEL -110 produced dose -
dependent decreases in body weight and food consumption over the course of the study, 
primarily in the male animals that persisted for both sexes in the 6 mg/kg  dose group through the 
end of the recovery period.  Observation of reduced sizes of reproductive organs including testes 
and ovaries, as well as microscopic correlates, were observed at the 3 and 6 mg/kg dose levels. 
These changes are consistent with the known effect of rapamycin on the gonadotropin axis (Roa, 
2009) .  Microscopic changes were observed in the heart (mild cardiomyopathy) in males at the 
high dose 6.0  mg/kg group.  At recovery, bilateral incipi[INVESTIGATOR_721276] 6.0  mg/kg/dose group.  Cataracts are a known toxicity of rapamycin in male rats, 
which is thought to be related to the development of hyperglycemia (Rapamune NDA  21-083). 
Based on the adverse findings observed at 3 and 6 mg/kg/dose including effects on the male 
reproductive system, 1 mg/kg/dose was identified as the No -Observed -Adverse -Effect -Level 
(NOAEL) for SEL -110 (rapamycin containing nanoparticle) when admin istered as a bolus 
intravenous injection on three occasions (Days 1, 29, and 57) in rats.  
While adverse effects of rapamycin in the male rat reproductive system are not unexpected (e.g., 
Chen et al., 2013), they have been shown to be reversible (Rovira et al., 2012).  Because the 
major impact of SEL -[ADDRESS_985389] one spermatogenic cycle.  In rats, 
spermatogenesis is approximately 53 days (Gray et al., 2004) and is followed by [CONTACT_3450] 
8-10 days during which the sperm enter and mature in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046].  Because there were 
findings of nearly empty epi[INVESTIGATOR_721277] (which account for the reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_721278]), it is important to allow the recovery period to span at least 63 days before looking for 
signs of potential recovery.  In the completed toxicology studies the recovery period was 30 
days.  
In response to the findings  involving the reproductive organs of rats in Study 1933 -005, the 
Sponsor conducted Study 1933 -013, an 8 -week toxicity study in rats with a recovery period of up

to 36 weeks. This study examined the effects produced when both male and female rats were 
treated with the high dose of SEL -110 (6 mg/kg) administered as IV bol us injections on study 
days 1, 29, and 57.  A total of 195 animals (75 males and 120 females) were randomly assigned 
by [CONTACT_721322]. Animals were 
euthanized at 61 days ([ADDRESS_985390] admi nistration) and at  times during the recovery 
period correlating with successive spermatogenic cycles in male rats.  Histopathologic 
examination of the organs in the reproductive systems of both males and females was performed. 
In males, recovery appeared t o begin as soon as Day 124, when active degeneration of germ cells 
was no longer identified and early spermatocytes were regularly observed suggesting that 
spermatogonial mitotic activity continued and spermatogenesis was starting to resume. Absence 
of spe rmatids and pachytene spermatocytes was likely the result of degeneration of those cell 
types at Day [ADDRESS_985391] contributed to the lower mean testis weight at this time 
point. By [CONTACT_2006] 187, 20% of animals showed testes within normal limits and  in many animals, 
tubules displayed normal spermatogenesis. By [CONTACT_2006] 250, the amount of sperm present in all 
animals was within normal limits, suggesting full recovery. The testes of 40% of animals were 
within normal limits. At Days 187, 250, and 313, varyin g degrees of tubular atrophy were 
present in over half of the animals. Most cases were minimal to mild and the majority of the 
tubules displayed normal spermatogenesis. In females, differences in follicular cyst formation 
and decreased corpora lutea were o bserved between rats at the 6.0 mg/kg dose and in controls at 
Days [ADDRESS_985392] represented a spectrum of 
normal age -related changes. Notably, at Day 118 there were no microscopic differences between 
control anima ls and those at 6.0 mg/kg/dose.   In females, the partial reversibility of ovarian 
findings seen previously in the rat was shown to be completely reversible during extended 
recovery. The return of spermatogenesis and normal levels of sperm in many male rats  suggest 
recovery from the original testicular effects. In some rats the presence of atrophic tubules at the 
end of the recovery period may represent partial recovery or may have been related to normal 
senescence. In either case , in both male and female ra ts, there was nonetheless strong evidence of 
reversibility of the toxic effects of high dose (6 mg/kg) SEL -110 on reproductive organs in both 
female and male rats.  
In the multi -dose study of SEL -110 in cynomolgus monkeys ( Study 1933 -006), 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 
mg/kg were given as an intravenous slow bolus 3 times separated by 28 days. SEL -110 was well 
tolerated at all doses, although there were observations of inappetence, vomitus and watery feces 
in males and females at the 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg doses. It should be noted that reproductive orga n 
toxicity was not observed in C ynomolgus monkeys and no adverse findings were observed in the 
reproductive tracts of either sex at any time or at any dose level. Additionally, consistent with t he 
immunosuppressive action of rapamycin, test article related microscopic findings of minimal 
follicular lymphoid depletion in the spleen in males and females at all dose levels and lymph 
nodes (mandibular and mesenteric) in males and females at 1.0 and 3 .0 mg/kg were observed, 
but were not severe enough to be considered adverse.  The no -observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL) for this study was 3.0  mg/kg for males and females, the highest dose level tested.  
In order to provide more comprehensive PK data, th e Sponsor also undertook an additional GLP 
rat PK study (1933 -014) that examined dose levels of 0.5, 1.5, and 3 mg/kg of SEL -110.  In this 
study whole blood samples containing SEL -110/rapamycin were analyzed using a new validated

GLP assay.  At the 0.5 mg/ kg dose level of SEL -110 reported in study 1933 -014, AUC 0-720 was 
determined to be 43,300 ng*hr/mL for SEL -110 administered alone and 57,700 ng*hr/mL for 
SEL-110 administered in combination with 0.4 mg/kg of SEL -037.  At the 1.5 mg/kg dose level 
of SEL -110, AUC 0-720 was 289,000 ng*hr/mL for SEL -110 administered alone and 243,000 
ng*hr/mL for SEL -110 administered in combin ation with 0.4 mg/kg of SEL -037.  These 
exposures are significantly higher than the AUC 0-672 of 5,100 ng*hr/mL previously reported in 
the 1933 -005 study , which used a  non-validated bioanalytical method . This difference was due to 
using a validated assay in the 1933 -014 study that overcame the extraction limitations 
experienced previously when attempting to measure high concentrations of SEL -110/rapamycin 
in rat whole blood at the early PK time points for study 1933 -005. Based on these results, the 
AUC corresponding to the 1 mg/kg NOAEL (study 1933 -005) is conservatively estimated to be 
86,600 ng*hr/mL and therefore, using the recommended AUC NOAELrat /2, the data support clinical 
doses with 4 -week AUC values of 43,400 ng*hr/mL.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SEL -212 
Consistent with ICH guidance, SEL -212 has been evaluated in nonclinical studies to support 
clinical study in humans, including safety pharmacology studies in monk eys, as well as a single 
dose toxicology stud y in rats , a two dose toxicology study in C ynomolgus monkeys and a 
repeated dose toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys . 
Consistent with the 3 R’s principle, a modified acute toxicology study of SEL -212 in 
Cynom olgus monkeys was conducted (Study 1933 -011). Animals received a slow bolus 
intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 14 with animals sacrificed 24 hours after the second 
injection. The groups were SEL -110 alone at 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, SEL -037 at 2.0 mg/kg wit h 
SEL-110 at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg, SEL -037 at 5.0 mg/kg with SEL -110 at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 
mg/kg as well as 3 control groups of saline, empty nanoparticle (same composition of SEL -110 
but without the rapamycin) and SEL -037 at 5.0 mg/kg.  SEL -110 (alone or  in combination with 
SEL-037) administered by [CONTACT_439] [ADDRESS_985393] was noted in groups receiving 1.0 or 
3.0 mg/kg SEL -110 (rapamycin) as indicated  by [CONTACT_721323], decreased hematopoietic 
cellularity, and abscess of the femoral bone marrow. There were no adverse effects of SEL -037 
or SEL -110 given alone or in  combination and no evidence of exacerbation of effects of either 
component on the other one.  Based on all of the data, the NOAEL for the combination (SEL -
212) was 3.0 mg/kg SEL -110 and 5.0 mg/kg SEL -037.      
In rats, a single dose, slow bolus intravenou s study of SEL -212 was conducted with the main 
group sacrificed 24 hours after dosing and the recovery group sacrificed 14 days after dosing 
(Study 19 33-010). The groups included SEL -110 alone at 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg, SEL -037 at 4.0 
mg/kg with SEL -110 at 1, 3,  and 6 mg/kg, SEL -037 at 10 mg/kg with SEL -110 at 1, 3 and 6 
mg/kg as well as 3 control groups of saline, empty nanoparticle (same composition of SEL -110 
but without the rapamycin) and SEL -037 at 10 mg/kg. A single intravenous dose of SEL -110 
(alone or in combination with SEL -037) administered to rats resulted in adverse mean body 
weight decreases compared to control in males (at 3 and 6 mg/kg) and microscopic findings (at

1, 3, and 6 mg/kg) that were noted in the heart and correlated to hematology findings  consistent 
with inflammation (increased circulating neutrophils and/or monocytes and increased 
fibrinogen).  The microscopic finding in the heart was considered to be adverse due to the trend 
towards increased incidence and severity over the course of the  recovery phase.  
In the multi -dose study of SEL -212 in Cynomolgus monkeys (study 1933 -007), the toxicity of 
repeated doses of SEL -[ADDRESS_985394] SEL -212 was 
assessed over 16 weeks with a one month recovery.  Once mon thly IV administration of SEL -
110 for a total of 3 doses (alone or in combination with SEL -037) plus two additional doses of 
SEL-037 alone did not result in adverse findings. Microscopic findings related to SEL -110 
consisted of follicular lymphoid depletio n in the spleen and lymph nodes (mandibular and 
mesenteric). Microscopic finding related to SEL -037 consisted of minimal follicular lymphoid 
hyperplasia in the spleen and/or lymph nodes (mesenteric, mandibular) of some animals. SEL -
110-related clinical pat hology changes consisted of infrequent minor increases in lymphocytes, 
monocytes, fibrinogen and/or eosinophils. Clinical signs related to SEL -110 consisted of watery 
feces and periocular erythema and/or swelling in individual males and females. Based on t hese 
data, the NOAEL for the study was 3.0 mg/kg SEL -110 when administered alone or in 
combination with SEL -037 and was 4.0 mg/kg SEL -037 when administered alone or in 
combination with SEL -110. 
Local irritation was evaluated in a nonGLP repeated dose study  of SEL -212 in Cynomolgus 
monkeys to assess anti -drug antibodies (Study 1933 -004). There was no evidence of dermal 
irritation with repeated dosing of SEL -212.

[IP_ADDRESS].  SEL -037 
To date there has been one completed clinical study ( Phase I Study SEL-037/101) in humans for 
SEL-037 under IND 126034.  Doses of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg SEL -037 administered as 
single IV infusions to otherwise healthy patients with screening serum uric acid > 6 mg /dL 
demonstrated no evidence of safety signals as no SAEs or clinically significant treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs). SEL-037 demonstrated potent dose -dependent reductions in 
serum uric acid levels that were below quantification limits from Study Day 2 for all subjects 
(N=22). The duration of the PD effect was durable to Day [ADDRESS_985395] -dependent, not dose -dependent. The presence of 
ADA generally correlated with enhanced cle arance of SEL -037 and diminished 
pharmacodynamic activity of SEL -037 at Study Day 14 in 3 subjects (0.1 mg/kg), 2 subjects (0.2 
mg/kg), 3 subjects (0.4 mg/kg), and 2 subjects (0.8 mg/kg). At Study Day 30, two subjects with 
very low anti -uricase antibodies had serum uric acid concentrations below 1 mg/kg. The clinical 
study report was submitted to IND 126034.   
A second Phase I clinical study (SEL -212/101) in humans for SEL -212 (the combination of SEL -
110 and SEL -037) under IND 124184  is complete . SEL-212 in this clinical study was  tested as a 
single dose where increasing amounts of SEL -110 were combined with SEL -037 at a fixed dose

level. In this study there were 4 cohorts of SEL -110 alone, 6 cohorts of the combination SEL -212 
(SEL -110 with SEL -037), and one cohort of SEL -037 alone.  In the cohort of subjects who 
received SEL -037 alone (0.4 mg/kg), one serious adverse event (SAE) of non -study drug -related 
atrial fibrillation was reported.  In addition, among the 5 subjects who received 0.4 mg/kg SEL -
037, the p harmacodynamic activity of SEL -037 was demonstrated by [CONTACT_721324] ( Figure 1). Data for this clinical study has been submitted to the FDA under IND 
124184.  
Additionally a similar product, designated Uricase -PEG 20 and manufactured by [CONTACT_721325] 
(Paramus, NJ) was evaluated in two Phase [ADDRESS_985396] stu dy 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) examined the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Uricase -PEG 
20 after intramuscular administration and the second study (NCT1021241) examined the safety, 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Uricase -PEG 20 after intravenou s administration. In 
both studies, Uricase -PEG 20 was found to be well tolerated and effective in reducing serum uric 
acid levels.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SEL -110 
SEL-110 was investigated in the completed Phase I study (SEL -212/101) in a total of 28 subjects 
with elevated uric ac id levels (excluding the potential need for replacement subjects) who were 
dosed in four cohorts in a stepwise ascending manner. Within each cohort, five subjects received 
active drug substance and two subjects received placebo (saline). The doses of SEL -110 
evaluated were 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg. In that study, overall, SEL -110 was well tolerated, 
at doses < 0.5 mg/kg, and the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Treatment -
emergent AEs (all causality) that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects who  received SEL -110 alone (N=20) 
were headache (7 subjects, 35%), infusion related reaction (4 subjects, 20%), dizziness (2 
subjects, 10%), paresthesia (2 subjects, 10%), rash maculopapular (2 subjects, 10%), and 
stomatitis (2 subjects, 10%).  Two subjects e ach experienced SAEs of stomatitis at the highest 
dose of SEL -110 (0.5 mg/kg). The events were assessed as severe and related to study drug, and 
the subjects recovered from the events. As a result of these events, the Sponsor did not 
investigate planned do ses of the combination drug (SEL -212) that had the 0.5 mg/kg SEL -[ADDRESS_985397] of the class of biodegradable lactide polymers, part of the family of

In the complete d Phase I study of SEL -212, six cohorts received a combination of SEL -037 at a 
dose of 0.4 mg/kg and increasing doses of SEL -110 (0.03, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg) .  Adult male 
and female subjects (N= 36) were enrolled on a dose level (cohort) basis with [ADDRESS_985399] ivity, and pharmacokinetics of SE L-212 were assessed.  
Overall, SEL -212 was well tolerated, and the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity. Treatment -emergent AEs that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects who received SEL -212 (N=31) 
were headache (4 subjec ts, 13%), rash (4 subjects, 13%), dizziness (3 subjects, 9.7%), dyspnea 
(3 subjects, 9.7%), nausea (3 subjects, 9.7%), aphthous ulcer (2 subjects, 6.5%), arthralgia (2 
subjects, 6.5%), flushing (2 subjects, 6.5%), gout (2 subjects, 6.5%), pneumonia (2 subj ects, 
6.5%), and rash pruritic (2 subjects, 6.5%). Two subjects who received SEL -212 (0.1 mg/kg 
SEL-110 + 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037) were reported with SAEs that were moderate in intensity  and 
assessed by [CONTACT_216447] . One subject expe rienced drug 
hypersensitivity , and the other subject experienced acute kidney injury and pneumonia  (assessed 
by [CONTACT_721326]) . Both subjects recovered from the events. A 
third subject who received SEL -212 (0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 + 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037) had SAEs of 
upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, and intestinal mass that were 
assessed as not related to study drug. The subject recovered from these events.  
SEL-212 demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in reducing serum uric acid levels  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_721279] -037 dose tested (0.4 mg/kg) and reducing or preventing the formation of anti -uricase 
antibodies in a dose dependent fashion.  The uric acid level of all subjects treated with SEL -212 
dropped to below 0.1 m g/dL within 24 hours after infusion. SEL -110 appeared to inhibit the 
formation of anti -uricase antibodies in a dose -dependent manner correlating with more sustained 
control of uric acid levels ( Figure 1).  Evaluation of anti -uricase, anti -PEG, and anti -pegsiticase 
antibodies showed that anti -uricase antibodies were the most sensitive measure of ADAs in the 
Phase 1 study, corresponding with decreased pha rmacodynamic activity of SEL -037 as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_721327].

Pharmacokinetic assessments of concentrations of SEL -110 in whole blood were performed on 
samples collected from cohorts who received SEL -110 alone and in combination with SEL -037. 
Results are summarized in Table 7 for cohorts of patients who received SEL -110 doses above

The relationship between SEL -110 exposure (C max, AUC 0-last, AUC 0-inf) and dose level was 
explored using two statistical approaches. Th e first approach applied the Hummel power analysis 
performed using Linear Mixed Effects model to determine the slope of the linear regression 
between log -transformed PK parameters. The second approach applied ANOVA comparisons of 
PK parameters for cohorts at the same dose level. Under both approaches, cohorts that received 
SEL-110 alone and co -administered with SEL -037 were analyzed.  
Dose proportionality was confirmed for SEL -110 administered alone (slope of approximately 1) 
and SEL -110 co -administered with SEL -037 (slope of approximately 1.2) ( Figure 2).  Further, 
ANOVA confirmed that SEL -037 increased systemic exposure of SEL -110 ( Figure 3).

4.4. Potential Risks and Benefits  
4.4.1.  SEL -[ADDRESS_985404]’s response to multiple doses of pegisiticase alone . 
Potential risks include those that have been identified in preclinical studies  and clinical studies of 
SEL-037 and SEL-212 as well as similar marketed products .  These include 1) infusion reactions 
including anaphylaxis , 2) gout flares  and 3) methemoglobinemia  and h emolysis .   
The use of biological therapeutics utilizing a protein of non -human origin is associated with the 
risk of immunogenicity that could  result in infusion reactions including anaphylaxis.  The 
formation of antibodies to SEL -[ADDRESS_985405] been associated with infusion reactions and 
anaphylaxis  (Sundy, 2007; Cortes, 2010; Sundy, 2011) .  These adverse events would appear to 
be more prevalent in multiple dosing regimens but have been reported associated with the first 
dose presumably due to cross -reactivity o r preexisting immunogenicity to the various 
components of the drug product  or non -IgE related reactions . The current study excludes subjects 
with previous exposure to uricases and with preexisting immunoreactivity  to PEG.

Gout flares are a potential risk i n subjects with gout as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_721280].  Premedication for flare will be given  to subjects.  
One of the by[CONTACT_721329]-037 is hydrogen peroxide.  
Excessive o xidative stres s can be detrimental to red blood cells.  Serious hemolytic reactions and 
methemoglobinemia were reported in less than 1% of the oncology patients with tumor lysis 
syndrome in clinical studies with Elitek®.  Similar events of severe hemolytic reactions have 
been reported with Krystexxa®.    Subjects that are catalase or glucose -6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficient have a reduced ability to deal with oxidative stress and these subjects 
will be excluded.  
4.4.2.  SEL -[ADDRESS_985406]’s anti -drug antibody response and the 
effect of SEL -[ADDRESS_985407] been identified in preclinical and clinical studies  of SEL -
110 and SEL -212 as well as similar marketed products.  These inc lude 1) infusion reactions 
includ ing anaphylaxis, 2) leukopenia and opportunistic infection , 3) metabolic disturbances 
(hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia) , 4) hypophosphatemia , 5) 
stomatitis , 6) oligo/azoospermia and 7) potential  fetal development effects as seen in preclinical 
studies . 
Rare cases of anaphylaxis were reported in t he Phase 3 trials of Sirolimus ( Rapamune®) during 
its development.  Identification of the reason for these reactions has not been made whether it be 
the rapamycin or other ingredients in the oral formulation.  Subjects with a history of 
anaphylaxis, angioedema or previous infusion reactions will be excluded from the trial.  
Additionally only sites with immediate capability to handle a reaction of this seve rity will be 
allowed to participate in the trial to reduce the risk to any subject.  
Leukopenia has been reported in patients taking oral rapamycin . Whether the cause of the 
leukopenia is a direct relation to the rapamycin exposure, precedes or is due to th e development 
of an opportunistic infection is unknown. Resolution of the leukopenia occurred in cases without 
subsequent infection with the stoppage of Sirolimus (Rapamycin) exposure.  The current study 
will exclude subjects with any evidence of infection  or developi[INVESTIGATOR_721281].  Additionally all subjects will told to avoid anyone who has an 
active infection either bacterial or viral. Subjects will al so have a WBC performed on day [ADDRESS_985408] exposu re of each treatment cycle.  In our single clinical study SEL -212/[ADDRESS_985409]. (Data on file)  
Metabolic disruptions (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and 
hypercholesterolemia) have been reported in post -transplant  patients who have been exposed  to 
rapamycin  (Johnston, 2008; Ghisdal, 2012) . The occurrence of post -transplant diabetes mellitus 
(PTDM) has been recognized for many years as a consequence of solid organ transplant

immunosuppression  (Shivaswamy, 2013) . Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179559] a well -recognized si de effect of 
rapamycin therapy (Hakeam, 2008) . In our single ascending dose clinical study SEL -212/[ADDRESS_985410]. (Data on file)  
The exact mechanisms of rapamycin in duced hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and its lipid 
effects are unclear at this time.  It has been shown that rapamycin can diminish β -cell 
proliferation in hyperglycemic states thereby [CONTACT_721330], proliferatio n, hypertro phy and a reduction in aptosis (Barlow, 2013) . Additionally, 
rapamycin has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of IRS -1 and IRS -2 in human adipocytes 
mimicking changes seen in type 2 diabetes and in human peripheral blood monocytes associated 
with insulin resi stance (Pereira, 2012) . Rapamycin has also been shown to increase basal 
lipolysis and reduce lipid storage (Pereira, 2012) .  Due to these , subjects who participate will 
have these specific laboratories (fasting glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol  levels) monitored  
closely for significant changes during their participation .  Subje cts will be monitored on days 7, 
14, [ADDRESS_985411] 
received mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin  (Soefje, 2011) . And so subjects will be monitored 
on days 7, 14, [ADDRESS_985412] received 
mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin as early as 7 days after treatment and responds to locally 
applied Clobetasol cream  (Soefje, 2011) .  And so subjects will be monitored on days 7, 14, 21 
and 28 of eac h treatment cycle as is directed in the schedule of events.  
Oligo/azoospermia has been seen in some male renal transplant patients taking an oral form of 
SEL-110 (rapamycin) administered chronically on a daily or three times weekly basis for the 
prevention  of transplant rejection when treated for a period greater than six months.  The 
mechanism for this effect is not known. In those patients where oligo/azoospermia has been seen 
partial to full reversibility of sperm production following cessation of treatm ent with the oral 
form of rapamycin  has been demonstrated  (e.g., Deutsch et al., 2007; Skrzypek, 2007; Zuber et 
al., 2008) . Male patients should be informed that their fertility may be affected temporarily or 
permanently after being given SEL -110.    
In pr eclinical animal studies performed with an oral form of the drug to be administered in this 
study, SEL -110 (a component of SEL -212) showed adverse effects when given to pregnant rats.  
These effects included fetal death, reduced fetal weights, and delays i n the formation of bones. It 
is not known whether these effects would also occur humans, a similar risk should be considered 
possible until such studies are performed. Because of the se potential adverse effects, all females 
who directly participate in this  clinical study must be of no childbearing potential and all males 
with female partners with childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception and 
agree to continue doing so for four months after study drug dosing.  Childbearing potential is  
defined as: a) less than 6 weeks after surgical removal of ovaries, tubes with or without removal 
of the womb or (b) pre or perimenopausal (less than 24 months of being without a period 
naturally).  
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985413]’s anti -drug antibody response and the effect of SEL -[ADDRESS_985414] been identified at this time to the combination of SEL -037 and SEL -110 
when presented as SEL -212. 
4.5. Rationale for SEL -212 Dose s Selected  
Dosing in this Phase II study (SEL -212/201) of up to 0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 in combinat ion with 
either 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037 (ie, SEL -212) is supported by [CONTACT_721331] 4.3.1  and Section 4.3.2 , respectively.   
Doses of 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037 were se lected for the Phase II study based on 
preclinical evaluation in rodent, rat, and monkey (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and clinical evaluation  in two 
completed  Phase I studies. In the Phase I clinical study SEL -037/101 (IND 126034) doses of 0.1, 
0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg SEL -037 demonstrated potent and dose -dependent reductions in 
serum uric acid levels and no evidence of safety signals as no SAEs or clinicall y significant 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported. Further clinical evidence supporting 
the Phase II doses of SEL -037 come from the  completed  Phase I Study SEL -212/101. 
Preliminary analyses of the study data show that one serious advers e event (SAE) of non -study 
drug-related atrial fibrillation was reported in [ADDRESS_985415] who received 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037 alone. 
Among the 5 subjects who received 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037, the pharmacodynamic activity of SEL -
037 was demonstrated by [CONTACT_721332] ( Figure 1).  
Doses of SEL -110 in the Phase II Study of SEL -212 (SEL -212/201) are based on the nonclinical 
toxicological data (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and the dose range tested in the Phase I single ascending dose 
clinical trial SEL -212/101.  Preliminary analyses of safety data in the Phase I study suggest that 
doses of SEL -110 up to 0.3 mg/kg were well -tolerated (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In nonclinical studies, 
the concern regarding the irreversibility of testis toxicity (the effect on the gonadotropin axis) in 
the rat was addressed by [CONTACT_721333] 
1933 -013 with an extended recovery period covering multiple spermatogenic cycles (Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ). Importantly, a rat GLP PK study performed with a validated PK assay shows that the 
SEL-110 exposure based on AUC at the NOAEL dose of 1 mg/kg provides a greater than 4 -fold 
safety margin at the proposed dose level of 0.15 mg/kg in humans  (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In addition , 
the calculation of the clinical doses of SEL -110 are predicted based upon the NOAEL of 3 mg/kg 
in Cynomolgus monkeys which is an  appropriate species for these estimates.  The refore, the  
clinical dose of 0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 represents a 6.5 -fold safety factor over the 3 mg/kg 
NOAEL in the non -human primate study based on body surface area (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and a 6.5 -
fold safety factor over the 6 mg/kg dosed to rats  in Study 1933 -013 based on body surface area 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Finally, doses of SEL -212 (ie, combination of SEL -037 and SEL -110) in the Phase II study are 
supported by [CONTACT_721334] , pharmacodynamic , and pharmacokinetic  data in 
the completed Phase I study (SEL -212/101) . SEL-212 appears to be well -tolerated at doses of 
0.03-0.3 mg/kg SEL -110 in combination with 0.4 mg/kg SEL -037. SEL -212 reduces serum uric 
acid levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_721282] -dependent inhibition of ADAs with increasing doses 
of SEL -110 (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Importantly, the mean and median values for systemic exposure 
(AUC) of SEL -110 at doses of 0.1 mg/kg  and 0.3 mg/kg ( Table 7) examined in conjunction with 
the results of analyses depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] [ADDRESS_985416] that a dose of 0.15 mg/kg SEL -
110 will result in systemic exposure substantially below the exposure determined by [CONTACT_721335] (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The dose -dependent inhibition of the formation of anti -uricase antibodies correlated with more 
sustained control of uric acid levels and is an important consideration for higher doses of SEL -
110 in light of the potential risk of infusion related reactions with repeat dosing with SEL -037. It 
is expected that the risk of anaphylaxis will decrease with increasing doses of SEL -110 due to 
inhibition of ADA formation.  
4.5.1.  Rationale for Dose Selected (Part C)  
Dosing in the Part C of this Phase II study (SEL -212/201) of up to 0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 in 
combination with 0.2 mg/kg SEL -037 (ie, SEL -212) is similarly supported by [CONTACT_721336] 4.3.1  and Section 4.3.2 , respectively.   From our review of 
interim serum uric acid and antibody data from Part A and B cohorts, we believe that 5 doses of 
the combination may be allow enhanced reduction of antibodies and serum uric acid for the 
duration of the therapy.  Similar to Parts A & B, d oses of 0. 2 mg/kg SEL -037 were selected for 
Part C based on preclinical evaluation in rodent, rat, and monkey (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and clinical 
evaluation in two  completed Phase I studies.  Support for [ADDRESS_985417] continued to extend our toxicology 
program to include additional  doses of SEL -110 alone and in combination with SEL -037.  We 
will submit t oxicology data that demonstrat es the safety of delivering 5 doses at up to 0.15 
mg/kg SEL -[ADDRESS_985418] will be converted from the planned regimen  of 5 doses of SEL -
212 to a receive only SEL-037 at  0.2 mg/ kg at the 4th and 5th dose and hence converted to a 
regimen of [ADDRESS_985419] 5 doses of 
SEL-110 at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg at all [ADDRESS_985420] 4 doses 
of SEL -110 at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg at treatment periods 2 -5.  Preliminary analyses of data 
in the Phase I study (SEL -212/101 ) and cohorts in Part A and Part B suggest that the first 
treatment period may be a critical time period for preventing antibody development to SEL -037; 
thus increased doses of SEL -[ADDRESS_985421] dose of SEL -110 in 
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.1  Effective Date

 57  
    
 
treatment period 1 will be at a higher dose of 0.15 mg/kg in Cohort 15  to allow for comparison of 
efficacy and safety with other regimens in Part C .  
       
4.6. Study Population  
Approximately 140 subjects with symptomatic gout and elevated uric acid levels ≥ 6 mg/dL . 
4.7. Study Rationale  
When blood levels of urate exceed the physiologic limit of solubility, it may crystallize in the 
tissues and cause gout.  Gout is an intermittent inflammatory arthritis caused by [CONTACT_721337], which can cause  an intensely painful joint inflammation .  Chronic 
hyperuricemia can lead to further deposition of uric acid in soft tissues, resulting in destructive 
arthritis and  formation of tophi and renal calculi (Choi, 2006; So, 2008; Wortmann, 2008) .  
The incidence of gout increases as circulating uric acid levels increase  (Campi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 1987)  and 
lowering circulating urate levels is a prim ary means of managing gout.   The American College of 
Rheumatology recommends lowering  urate levels to a target of less than  6 mg/dL at minimum 
(Khanna, 2012a)  to improve th e signs and symptoms of gout .  
Intravenous uricase therapi[INVESTIGATOR_721283]  (Goldman, 2001; 
Cortes, 2010; Sundy, 2011) .  They have also be en shown to lose efficacy due to the fo rmation of 
anti-drug antibodies (Lipsky, 2014) .  SEL-[ADDRESS_985422] formulation and the type of pegylation  which may improve 
tolerability and efficacy , and the addition of the immune modulator to reduce/prevent anti -
uricase antibody for mation.  The current study evaluates  the safety, to lerability, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  (uric acid lowering ability) and the ability to mitigate the 
formation of anti -drug antibodies of SEL -[ADDRESS_985423] s with  symptomatic gout and circulating uric acid levels greater than or equal to 6 mg/dL.

individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_721271]. If they continue to meet the 
requirements for continued participation they may continue in the clinical trial.  
 
The medical mo nitor , Investigator , IRB,  or regulatory agency may also stop additional dosing or 
dose escalation  based on any condition th at warrants termination such as the discovery of an 
unexpected, serious or unacceptable risk to subjects or an unacceptable incidence  of an expected 
event (e.g., unacceptable incidence or severity of infusion  reactions) which suggests  additional 
dosing is not warranted.    
6.3.2.  Safety committee  
Safety data will be monitored on an ongoing basis b y the Investigator s and medical monitor.  If 
two or more subjects in a single cohort experience SAEs that are assessed as related or possibly 
related to study drug, then the safety committee will review all relevant safety in formation for all 
subjects in that cohort . The data will include the accu mulated data through the time of the 
scheduled meeting.   At minimum, this committee will include the Investigat ors, or their 
representatives,  who have had subjects dosed at their site  in the cohort of interest , the medical 
monitor  and a sponsor representat ive.  
6.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study will be terminated when  the subjects have completed follow -up assessments as per 
Section  1.[ADDRESS_985439]  determined there is an unacceptable risk to subjects or additional dosing or 
procedures are  not warranted or necessary .   
The study may be terminated at a particular investigational site under the following conditions:  
• The Investigator fails to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate ; 
• The Investigator fails to comply with pertinent regulations ; 
• There is insufficient adherence to the protocol ; 
• Knowingly false information is submitted to the IRB, Sponsor or designee, or regulatory

drug) .  There  are no other food, meal, and beverage  or fluid intake restrictions.  Subjects should 
maintain a normal routine and diet as much as possible.  
7.4. Subject Completion and Withdrawal  
7.4.1.  Screen Failures  
An evaluation of the subject’s eligibility occurs from consent through the predose assessments 
and a subject will not be considered enrolled in the study until dosed  with study drug .  Any 
subject that is screened but not dosed will be considered a screen failure  and the reason for 
failure will be documented .  
7.4.2.  Subject Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study when the subject has completed the 
Treatment Period 5, Day [ADDRESS_985445]  Withdrawal  and Discontinuations  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Withdrawal Procedures  
Early terminations are when an enrolled  subject withdraws consent or the Investigator terminates 
a subject.  The reason for withdrawal will be evaluated and recorded in the case report form 
(CRF ) and source documents.  Subjects that withdraw may be replaced (see Replacement of 
Subjects , Section  7.4.4 ). 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time.  A documented effort must be made to determine 
why a subject withdraws consent, fails to return for the necessary visits, or is dropped from the 
study.  All subjects that withdraw early upon termination should hav e the Early Termination visit 
assessments completed (i.e., End of Study assessments), if the assessments pose no risk to the 
subject and the subject allows such assessments.   
The Investigator should consult with the Sponsor/medical monitor prior to withdr awing any 
subject.  Since this is a multiple dose  safety study, once dosed, subjects generally should  not be 
terminated by [CONTACT_117128] d should be followed through  [ADDRESS_985446] study drug  (e.g.,  End of Study ).  Subjects with compliance issues  or major 
deviations that effect data quality will also continue to be followed thro ugh [ADDRESS_985447] as possible, unless otherwise indicated by [CONTACT_429] .

SEL-037 for Cohorts 1 and 2 and Part B of all cohorts or prior to SEL -110 for Cohorts 3 -8, 10, 
11, and 12 ) to reduce infusion reactions .  These medications will be supplied by [CONTACT_3652].  
In Part C  (Cohorts 13 , 15, and 17 ), the premedication schedule described above will apply.  
8.2.2.  Management and Treatment of Infusion Reactions  
The following steps will be implemented in this protocol to either reduce the risk of infusion 
reactions or manage infusion reactions.  
• Subjects with imm unoreactivity to PEG will be ineligible for the study  
• Subjects with prior exposure to uricase therapy  will be ine ligible  
• Each subject will be observed for infusion reactions after dosing  of study drug in  the 
clinic  for 9 hours  from the start of study dru g infusion (SEL -110 or saline  for Part A or 
SEL-037 for Part B ).  Subjects will be instructed on the signs or symptoms of infusion 
reaction  and told to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_721286].

• SEL-110 will be administered vi a syrin ge pump to control the infusion rate of the small 
volume of material   
• SEL-037 will be administered by [CONTACT_721346] a healthcare setting 
and by [CONTACT_721347].   
• Subjec ts will be pre -medicated with 180 mg fexo fenadine orally  two times before dosing  
and 40 mg methylprednisolone  (or equivalent drug)  intravenously -1 ± 0.5h before dosing 
in an attempt to reduce infusion reactions in subjects.   
• Subjects with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema or previous infusion reactions will be 
excluded from the trial.  
• Only sites with immediate capability to appropriately respond to a reaction of this 
severity will be allowed to participate in the trial to r educe the risk to any subject  
If an infusion reaction occurs, Investigators are allowed to use concomitant medications or  
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate subject care.  Investigators should also utilize 
the infusion reaction lab kit (see Ap pendices) to collect additional blood specimens.  In the case 
of a Grade [ADDRESS_985450] should be treated according to 
the clinical trial site’s protocol for infusion reactions (e.g., monitoring, administration of 
antihistamines, corticosteroids, fluids and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], as clinically indicated).   
8.2.3.  Gout Flares  (Prevention and Treatment)  
All subjects that meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be given premedication for gout 
flare prevention.  The regimen will begin [ADDRESS_985451] receiving preventative premedication 
they (the gout flare)  are to be recorded as an adverse event and treated  at the discretion of the 
investigator  to provide adequate patient care.  Investigators should consult with the medical 
monitor if a change in the subject ’s uric acid lowering medication is needed.

9.4.1.  SEL -037 Preparation  
Each vial of SEL-037 will be reconstituted with 1 .1 ml of steri le water for injection , USP  (United 
States Pharmacopeia) which forms a 6 mg/mL concentrated solution and then diluted  for 
administration in 100 ml of room temperature 0.9% sodium chloride for injection , USP . The full 
resultant volume of the SEL -037-normal saline solution (100 mL saline + required volume of 
reconstituted SEL -037) will be administered in the allotted time.  Reconstituted SEL-037 is 
stable at room temperature and normal light conditions for 8 hou rs and the diluted SEL-037-
normal saline solution for infusing should be used (i.e., infusion completed ) within 6 hours of 
dilution.   
9.4.2.  SEL -110 Preparation  
Each vial of SEL -110 will be thawed at room temperature and brought to room temperature over 
a 2 hour  period before being drawn into appropriate size syringe/syringes for IV infusion with 
syringe pump . Thawed SEL -110 is stable for 24 hours at room temperature at normal light 
conditions.  
SEL-110 should be administered as soon as possible after thawing; how ever, overnight thawing 
of SEL -110 at room temperature is permitted as long as the SEL -110 dose is completely 
administered within 24 hours of removal from its frozen storage conditions.  
Doses are calculated on a mg/kg basis according to a patient ’s weight  as described in Section 
19.3.2 . In cohorts receiving SEL -110 doses <0.10 mg/kg, the maximum dose per study visit, 
irrespective of the patient’s weight, is 12 mg (equivalent to 6.0 mL of SEL -110). In cohorts 
receiving SEL -110 doses ≥0.10 mg/kg, there is no maximum dose; however, the rate of SEL -[ADDRESS_985454] ed as described in Section 9.5, with an initial infusion rate of 5.5 
mL/hour.  
9.5. Administration  
The thawed SEL -110 will be withdrawn from the vial and dosed via IV infusion with a syringe 
infusion pump .  In cohorts receiving SEL -110 doses <0.10 mg/kg, SEL -110 will be infused at a 
single steady rate sufficient to deliver the dose volume over a period of 55 minutes concurrently 
with a 60 minute infusion of 125 mL of normal saline. In cohorts receiving SEL -110 ≥0.10 
mg/kg, the rate of SEL -110 infusion will be 5.5 mL/hour for the first 30 minutes and, then, will 
be changed  to a steady rate sufficient to d eliver the remainder of the dose volume for the 
additional 25 minutes, concurrently with a 60 minute infusion of 125 mL of normal saline.   
The diluted SEL-037 in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP 100 ml  will be infused 
intravenous ly with an infusion pump  over a 60 minute period.   
All study drugs should be administered through the same IV access.  All blood samples should 
be drawn from an alternative venous access.  
Only if medically warranted in response to an AE  will the Investigator modify the infus ion 
parameters ( decrease the rate of infusion , interrupt the infusion,  or reduce the dose volume 
infused ).  The Investigator will notify the study team of any changes in infusion parameters.

maintenance.   
9.7. Study Drug Disposal  
Unused, partially used and empty vials will be stored until the Sponsor or sponsor representative 
instructs the s ite to return or dispose of the vials.  Unused supplies will be returned or disposed of 
using appropriate documentation according to International Conference on Harmonization -Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), local requirements, applicable Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration  and Envir onmental Protection Agency  regulation s, and applicable study -specific 
procedures.  
10. PHARMACOKINETIC , PHARMA CODYNAMIC  AND 
RADIOLOGIC  ASSESSMENT S 
10.1. Sample Collection  
Multiple  blood samples will be collected from a venous access which is different and on an 
alternative limb th an the site where study  drug has been administered. The blood samples will be 
processed  for a determination of whole blood  levels of rapamycin, serum  levels of  SEL-037, 
uricase activity, serum  uric acid levels , antibody  (anti-PEG, anti -pegsiticase and anti -uricase) 
levels , inflammatory marker assessments and T -cell recall assessments  according to the 
procedures in the study laboratory manual  and in Section 1.1 (the sc hedule of events by [CONTACT_9084]).  
For Part C (Cohort s 13, 15, and 17 ), at each timepoint specified in the schedule of events 
(Section 1.1, Table 5), 2 blood samples will be collected for sUA measurement. One sample will 
be stored and shipped under ambient temperature and one sample will be stored and sh ipped 
under frozen conditions. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details about sample handling.  
The target blood collection time for the follow -up visits will be  approximately the same time of 
day as the start of study drug dosing .  Blood draws should be collected as close to the times 
specified, as possible.  The acceptable window of collecting samples is:  
• All dosing d ay (Treatment Periods 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Day 0) samples : target collection time ± 5 
minute window  
• Follow -up visit  (Trea tment Periods 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Day 1) : the target collection time ± 2 hour 
window  from D0 0 hour  
• Follow -up visits (All except Day 1): the target collection time ± 8 hour window from D0 0 
hour

• Dosing day (Treatment Periods 2, 3, 4 and 5, Day 0) and EOS visi t: target day ± 1 day 
window  
• Infusion reaction labs ± [ADDRESS_985456] noted in the open label portion of the SEL -212/101 clinical trial and th e initial portion 
of this SEL -212/[ADDRESS_985457] on serum uric acid (sUA) 
when subjects are given SEL -212. This effect had persisted beyond [ADDRESS_985458] for an additional visit if the sUA at the 
Treatment Period 5 Day 21 (Visit 32) is below 6 mg/dL. The additional visit would be 60 ± 1 
days after the  Treatment Period 5 Day 0 dosing day (Visit 28)  at which time we would have the 
value of the sUA for the Day 21 (Visit 32) visit and their end of study visit (EOS P5 Day 30 ) 
value. The beneficial ef fect on the sUA is an unexpected, positive event which is beneficial to 
the subject and would likely be beneficial to the projected treatment population in the future.  
 
In Part C (Cohorts 13 , 15, and 17 ), subjects will be followed as described above . 
 
Blood samples will be taken at the observational visits for assessments that will include: serum 
uric acid, and serum samples for anti -pegsiticase , anti -uricase and anti -PEG.  
10.2. Analytical Procedures  
Serum  samples for SEL -037, for uricase activity  and for uric acid determinations and whole 
blood samples for rapamycin determinations will be measured by [CONTACT_28762].  Serum 
samples for antibody (anti -PEG, anti -uricase, and anti -pegsiticase) determinations will be 
measured by [CONTACT_28762].  Procedures for processing samples will be included in the 
Study Manual.   
Anti-pegsiticase, anti -uricase and anti -PEG samples will be sampled as per the schedule of 
events.  At minimum, the samples to be analyzed  will include the Day 14 and pre -dose samples 
for each treatment period as well as the Day 7, 14, 21 and EOS/Early Termination visit for the 
final treatment period for each subject.  
10.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The following PK parameters will be calculated on SEL -037, uricase activity  and SEL -110 and 
assessed: the maximum observed serum concentration (C max), the time at which C max occurred 
(Tmax), area under the serum concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_985459] quantifiable 
concentration (AUC last), area under the serum concentration -time c urve from time 0 to infinity

(AUC inf), the terminal elimination rate constant (K el), terminal half -life (t 1/2), serum clearance of 
drug (CL), and apparent volume of distribution at equilibrium (V ss). 
10.4. Radiologic Assessments  
Dual energy computed tomography ( CT) scans will be performed as an exploratory measure for 
at least 2 subjects in Cohorts 10, 11, and 12 during the screening interval , between Days 21 -28 of 
Treatment Period 3 (Visit 20 -Visit 21 ), and between Days 21 -30 (inclusive)  of Treatment Period 
5 (Visit 32)  or at Early Termination to investigate changes to uric acid deposits. In addition, in 
any cohorts reopened for enrollment, at least [ADDRESS_985460] during the screening interval, between Days 21 -28 of Trea tment Period 3 (Visit 20 -Visit 
21), and between Days 21 -30 (inclusive)  of Treatment Period 5 (Visit 32) or at Early 
Termination to investigate changes to uric acid deposits.  
In Part C, dual energy CT scans will be performed for Cohorts [ADDRESS_985461] scan and analysis can be found in the study procedure 
manual.    
10.5. Inflammatory Marker  Assessments  
Asse ssments of inflammatory markers will be performed as an exploratory measure for  all 
subjects enrolled in ea ch cohort at the predose visit for Treatment Period 1 (Visit 4/Day 0) and 
one additional inflammatory marker sample is to be collected for Treatment Period 5 – this may 
be collected at Visit 32/Day 21, between Visit 32/Day 21 and the EOS Visit, or at the EOS 
Visit/Day [ADDRESS_985462] to inflammatory marker 
assessments .  Procedures for the assessments and analysis can be found in the study procedure 
laboratory manual.  
In Part C (Cohorts 13 , 15, and 17 ), assessments of inflammatory markers will be performed as an 
exploratory measure for all subjects at the predose visit and day 7 visit for all Treatment Periods 
1-5 and one additional inflammatory marker sample is to be collected near the end of Tre atment 
Period 5 – this may be collected at Visit 32/Day 21, between Visit 32/Day 21 and the EOS Visit, 
or at the EOS Visit/Day 30, or at Early Termination to investigate changes to inflammatory 
markers.  
10.6. T-cell recall  Assessments  
Assessments of T -cell recal l responses to pegsiticase will be performed as an exploratory 
measure for all subjects in each cohort to investigate changes to T-cell recall response to 
pegsiticase .  Assessments will be performed for each subject at 3 time points  as per the schedules 
of events  and at Early Term visit . If a predose T -cell recall specimen is not available this will not 
preclude the drawing of a specimen for T -cell recall at v18, v30 or at Early Term.  Procedures for 
the assessments and analysis can b e found in the study procedure manual.

thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen ) and urinalysis.    
Screening tests for glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies, HbA1c, HIV and hepatitis 
C will be conducted at the Scr eening Visit .   
The collection date, time, and study day will be documented .  
11.1.7.  Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected  per the schedule of events.   Procedures for processing samples 
will be included in the study laboratory manual . 
11.2. Adverse and Serious  Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and 
definition of a non -serious adverse events (AE) , serious adverse events ( SAE) as provided in this 
protocol .   
11.2.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug (i.e., study drug) in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can 
arise with use of any drug or medi cinal product.   
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study upon dosing  of study drug for the first time .  
AEs (and thus SAEs) will be collected from the time the subject is dosed (infusion is started) 
until the end of the End of Study  Visit.  During  the Screening Phase  (from time informed consent 
is signed to immediately before dosing) any clinically significant changes in the subject’s health 
will be recorded in the subject’s medical history.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected Adverse Events and Unexpected Suspected Drug R eaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction (an AE where there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
cause d the event; suspected drug related) is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specifici ty or severity that has been observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE  is any adverse event  that occurs irrespective of study treatment assignment, if it satisfies 
any of these criteria:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening;  
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.1  Effective Date  
March 19, 201 8 
 
 84  
    
 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010];  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions;  
• is a con genital anomaly or birth defect;    
• is an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
11.2.2.  Recording Adverse Events  
Subjects will be encouraged to spontaneously report any changes in health from the time of 
informed consent signing through completion of the study.  Study staff will also inquire about 
any changes in  the subject ’s health.   
All AEs will be recorded in the  source document and the CRF.   It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and 
diagnostics reports) for the presence of AEs and for a complete evaluation of known AEs.  
At minimum f or each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the event 
name/term/description, onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), event severity/ intensity, 
relationship to study drug, action taken in regards to study drug, whether the event is an SAE , 
and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study .  The event time is only required 
while the subject is in the clinic.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event Term /Name/Description  
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of each AE based on signs, s ymptoms, and/or 
other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis will be the AE term used to document the 
AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.    
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE/SAE.  The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying disease s, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug will be considered and 
investigated. The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information for marketed products in  the determination of his/her assessment.  
The Investigator will assess causality as to whether the event is related or not related to study 
drug based on the following definitions:  
• Not Related  (If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship to st udy drug or the AE 
was more likely explained by [CONTACT_450539]). 
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.1  Effective Date  
March 19, 201 8 
 
 85  
    
 
• Unlikely to be Related : Onset of the event has a reasonable temporal relationship to study 
drug administration and although a causal relationship is unlikely, it is biologically  plausible.  
• Possibly Related : Onset of the event has a strong temporal relationship to administration of 
the study drug and a causal relationship is biologically plausible  
• Related  (the study drug dosing  and AE were closely related in time and the AE may be  
explained by [CONTACT_72029]: e.g., known pharmacological effect or recurrence on 
re-challenge).  
There may be situations, particularly when an SAE has occurred , where  the Investigator has 
minimal information to make an assessment  in an initial SAE report. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every SAE  prior to 
transmission of the SAE report. The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_721287] -up information, amendi ng the SAE report accordingly.  Any assessment of causality 
made by [CONTACT_721348]’s source medical record.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event Intensity /Severity  Grading  
AEs will be classified according to the Rheumatology Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0 
(Woodworth et al. 2007).  The general  framework for grading AEs is provided below , and the 
full scale is provided in  Section  19.1 of the protocol . 
• Grade 1  (mild)   AE that is usually transient  of short duration ; or involves mild or minor 
symptoms which are  of marginal clinical relevance; or is asy mptomatic consist ing of clinical 
or diagnostic observations alone; no intervention or only minimal treatment with non-
prescription intervention  was required . The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
• Grade 2 (moderate)  AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living  (e.g., shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], laundry, 
transportation, or ability to conduct finances) , causing discomfort but poses no significan t or 
permanent risk or harm to the subject . 
• Grade 3  (severe)  AE that is medically significant/important but not life -threatening; may 
require brief hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721288]; interrupts usual activities 
of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention . 
• Grade 4  (life-threatening)  An AE, and/or its immediate sequelae, which is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or which is associated with physical or mental dis abilities that affect 
or limit the ability of a person to perform activities of daily living (eatin g, ambulation, 
toileting, etc.) ; disability may be persistent or result in significant disability, incapacity or 
limitation of self-care activities.   
For an assessment of anaphylaxis , the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis will be 
based on th e National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  (NIAID )/ Food Allergy & 
Anaphylaxis Network ( FAAN ) Symposium criteria  for anaphylaxis diagnosis (Section  19.2).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Outcome  
The result or conclusion of the adverse event  will be assessed and recorded by [CONTACT_162633]: 
• Fatal  
• Not recovered/not resolved (the AE has not improved or subje ct has not recuperated ). 
• Recovered/resolved (the AE has improved or subject has recuperated)  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  (recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting 
from the AE) 
• Recovering/resolving  (the subject  is improving  but the AE  has not yet resolved ) 
• Unknown  (not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Action taken with study drug  
The action taken in regards to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_1694]:  
• Dose not changed ( dose completed ) 
• Dose reduced ( IV infusion w as modified by [CONTACT_721349] ) 
• Dose interrupted ( IV infusion was temporally modified by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_51119] ; 
slowing of the rate of infusion should also be classified as interrupted ) 
• Drug withdrawn ( IV infusion was modified through termination of the infusion ) 
A response o ption for increasing  the dose is not an available course of action  in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory and Diagnostic Abnormalities as Adverse Events  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory fi ndings or other abnormal diagnostic assessments 
(e.g., ECGs, vital signs) that are detected in dosed subjects or that significantly worsen relative to 
baseline in dosed subjects will be reported as AEs or SAEs.  Clinically significant is based on 
investiga tor judgment but will typi[INVESTIGATOR_721289], result 
in active management of the subject,  or are associated with clinical signs and symptoms.  Since 
the study requires subjects with elevated or abnormal uric acid levels , abnormal uric acid levels 
will typi[INVESTIGATOR_721290].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or a SAE and 
followed .  The outcome of all pregnancies must be followed up and documented even if the 
subject is no longer a study participant.  
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.1  Effective Date  
March 19, 201 8 
 
 87  
    
 
The Investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on every female who 
becomes pregnant while enrolled in this study  and on every female partner of a male subject who 
becomes pregnant while the male partner is enrolled in this study . The Investigator will report to 
the Sp onsor or Sponsor’s designee within [ADDRESS_985466]’s or female partner of 
a subject’s pregnancy. The subject or female partner of a subject must also be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the  mother and child will 
be forwarded to the Sponsor or Sponsor Designee, as appropriate. Follow -up on the child will be 
to the first well -child visit.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
A spontaneous abortion , congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects will be considered SAE s and will 
be reported as such. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy and is 
considered reasonably related to the study drug by [CONTACT_737], will be reported to the 
Sponsor .  
11.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
11.3.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is from the time the subject is dosed until 
the End of Study .  During the Screening Phase  (from time informed consent is signed up to the time 
of dosing) any clinically significant changes in the subject’s health will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical history.    
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to th e study 
drug, the Investigator sh ould promptly notify the Sponsor.  
11.3.2.  SAE Reporting Procedures  
If SAEs occur, all investi gators should immediately, but not later than 24 hours of observing or 
learning of the event, complete and fax the SAE form to  INC Drug Safety . 
Facsimil e (for SAE only):  [PHONE_1188]  
Email (for SAE only):   [EMAIL_3091]  
The investigator will complete the SAE form and provide all case information available at the 
time of the initial report. The investigator must include the following mandatory  case 
information:  
i. the subject identification number  
ii. the event description  
iii. the seriousness criteria  
iv. the investigator’s causality assessment  
The reporting investigator must send the written and signed SAE report by [CONTACT_276869], 
within 24 hours of obs erving, notification of, or learning of the SAE  to INC Drug Safety  as 
described above.   Follow -up information regarding an SAE and the supporting data, including 
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985467] all information regarding an SAE, the Investigator  will not wait 
to receive additional information before completing as much of the form as possible and 
notifying the safety group . The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The Investigator will always provide  at minimum:  1) AE term or event name/description, 2) 
subject identifier, 3) an assessment of causality ( see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
11.3.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
The Sponsor  or Sponsor  representative will report fatal or life -threatening SAEs that are 
unexpected suspected adv erse reactions to the FDA within 7 calendar days , and non-fatal or life -
threatening SAEs that are  unexpected suspected adverse reactions within 15 calendar days  as 
Investigational New Drug ( IND) Safety Reports , in accordance with [ADDRESS_985468] (IRB) / Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC).  
All Investigators involved in studies with this drug will receive a copy of each IND Safety 
Report .  When a n Investigator  receives an IND Safety Report or other safety information (e.g., 
revised Clinical Investigator’s Brochure/Investigator’s Brochure), the  responsible person 
according to local requirements is required to promptly notify his or her IRB.  
11.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject and provide further information to 
in regards to AEs and SAEs . All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the 
condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -
up.  Once resolved, the appropriate CRF entries and event reporting forms will be updated , as 
appropriate .  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_69846]/contacts.  The Investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any 
supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elu cidate the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee may request th at the Investigator perform or arrange for 
the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The Investigator is obligated to assist. If a subject

Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985469] the PK evaluation of the drug . 
Factors that may influence  serum S EL-037 concentrations  and/or the whole blood rapamycin 
concentrations  (e.g., interruptions in the infusion or changes in the infusion rate) will be 
reviewed.  If an influenci ng factor is present, a decision will be made by [CONTACT_721350], whether to include or exclude the specific sample or subject.  All subjects 
and samples excluded from the analysis will be clearly documented in the study report.  
12.4. PK Analy ses 
Data will be listed for all individual subjects with available SEL-037 serum concentrations and 
rapamycin whole blood levels . All concentrations below the lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration  data listings. Concentrations 
below the LLOQ will be treated as zero in the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters.  
For each dose, descriptive statistics, including arithmetic mean, standard deviation, geometric 
mean, coefficient of variation, median, m inimum, and maximum will be calculated for 
rapamycin in whole blood  and SEL -037 serum  concentrations at each sampling time and for all 
PK parameters.  
Graphical representations of the results will include (but are not limited to) the following graphs  
as app ropriate:

The verbatim AE  terms in the CRFs will be  coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  By [CONTACT_108], the study only collects treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAE) so all AEs are TEAEs.  The percentage  of subjects with specific TEAEs will be 
summarized  for each dose. 
Study: SEL-212/201 
Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985470] , system organ class and preferred term.  
TEAEs will be summarized  (number of events, number and % of subjects having experienced at 
least one event) by  [CONTACT_2715], system organ class and preferred term. TEAEs will be also summarized  
by [CONTACT_2236], and by [CONTACT_2235]. SAEs  will be only listed.   A narrative will be produced for those 
subjects who have discontinued treatment due  to an adverse event or who experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_985471]. Normal reference range s and 
markedly abnormal results will be used in  the summary of laboratory data. Data will be flagged 
according to the reference limits (H igh or Low) if applicable. Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for each laboratory analyte at  baseline and at eac h scheduled time point for each dose 
and each treatment. Changes from  baseline results will be presented descriptively as well as in 
pre- versus post -treatment  cross tabulations (with classes for below, within, and above normal

15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with ICH -GCP guidelines and all applicable 
regulatory requirements, including, where applicable, the Declaration of Helsinki.  
15.3. Written Informed Consent  
This study will be conducted in full compliance with the informed consent regulations in [ADDRESS_985475] be approved by [CONTACT_60284]. The 
Investigator is responsible for obtaining written consent (signed an d dated ICF) from potential 
subjects prior to performing any trial tests or assessments required by [CONTACT_760]. A copy of the 
signed consent document will be given to the patient and the original retained by [CONTACT_3786].  
No Investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the Investigator has 
obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An Investigator may seek such consent only under circumstances that provid e the 
prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether to participate 
and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information given to the 
subject or the representative must be in a language und erstandable to the subject or the 
representative. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory 
language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any 
of the subject's legal rights, or r eleases or appears to release the Investigator, the institution, the 
Sponsor, or its agents from liability for negligence.  
An IRB -approved consent form should inform each prospective subject or the legally authorized 
representative of each prospective sub ject of the purpose and the nature of the study, its possible 
hazards and benefits, and the subject's right to withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice to further treatment. Exemptions to the requirement for informed consent in the United 
States are described in 21 CFR 50.23.  
The Investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and 
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Patients 
must also be notified tha t they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The patient 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided.

from the time of a subject’s visit. A monitor representing the sponsor will verify the CRF 
documentation for each patient against the source documents at the study center. Instances of 
missing or uninterpretable data will be brought to the attention of the  investigator and/or sponsor 
for resolution.  
16.2. Data Management  
Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable study standards and data 
cleaning procedures. Database lock will occur when data management quality control procedures a re 
completed.  
16.3. Study Site Close -Out  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor may conduct the following activities in conjunction with 
the investigator or site staff, as appropriate:  
1. Resolve data queries.  
2. Accountability, reconciliation, and return of un used study drug(s).  
3. Review of final site study records for completeness.  
4. Return all study -specific equipment to the appropriate vendor as required .  
16.4. Retention of Study Documents and Records  
Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site study records in a safe and 
secure location. All CRF data will be retained by [CONTACT_721357] . The 
investigator will retain a copy of all source documents and CRF data (i.e., either hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_721293] a 
paper CRF or DVD -ROM containing pdf files of CRFs provided by [CONTACT_456]) for the subjects 
enrolled at the site. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when 
needed (e.g., audit or inspect ion). Where permitted by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or institutional 
policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., 
microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is

Version: 7.[ADDRESS_985477] applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_72040], or the Sponsor standards/procedures; otherwise, th e retention period will 
default to [ADDRESS_985478] notify the Sponsor  of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, 
but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of the 
records in the event the Investigator leaves the site.  
16.5. Inspection of Records  
The Sponsor  (or Sponsor representative) will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow 
the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, 
subject charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
17. PUBLICATION POLICY  
In the event of a conflict between the provisions  of this section and a written contract regarding 
the conduct of Study between Sponsor (or a contract research organization) and the site, the 
Investigator or any person assisting Investigator with the Study, the terms of that contract shall 
control.  
17.1. Owne rship

This information and data shall not be used by [CONTACT_779], Investigator, or any person assisting 
Investigator with the Study for any purpose other than conducting the Study. These restrictions 
do not apply to: 1) information which becomes publicl y available through no fault of the site, 
Investigator or any person assisting Investigator with the Study; 2) information which it is 
necessary to disclose in confidence to an IRB solely for the evaluation of the Study; 3) 
information which it is necessar y to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical care to a 
Study subject; or 4) Study results which are permitted to be published as described in the next 
section.  
17.3. Publication  
If the Study is a multi -center study, the first publication or disclosure  of Study results shall 
include data from all sites.  
Investigator may publish the results of the Study only for noncommercial, educational or 
academic purposes provided that: 1) said publication is made after the multi -center publication; 
and 2) prior to making the publication, or otherwise disclosing the Study results, Investigator 
provides Sponsor with a copy of the proposed publication and allows Sponsor a reasonable 
period to review. Proposed publications shall not include the Sponsor  confidential info rmation 
(other than the Study results) or personal data with respect to any subject (such as name [CONTACT_224203]) and if the Sponsor  identifies any such the Sponsor  confidential information in a proposed 
publication, it shall be removed.  
At the Sponsor ’s req uest, the submission, publication or other disclosure of a proposed 
publication will be delayed a sufficient time to allow the Sponsor  to seek patent or similar 
protection of any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial property rights 
contained in such proposed publication.

19.2. NIAID/FAAN Clinical Criteria for Anaphylaxis  
From the Second Symposium on the Definition  and Management of Anaphylaxis (Sampson, 
2006) . 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are present  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_721305] a likely  allergen for 
that patient  (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known  allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours):  
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 30% 
decrease in systolic blood pressure  
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease 
from th at person’s baseline

19.3. Reconstitution and D ilution for I nfusion  Instructions  
19.3.1.  SEL -037 Instructions  
Follow instructions below:  
1. Convert weight of subject to kg, as needed  (weight in pounds divided by 2.2 046). 
2. Calculate the mL of reconstituted SEL-[ADDRESS_985495]  
Volume (ml) reconstituted SEL-037 required for each infusion =  
 
(dose in mg/kg) x (subject weight in kg) / (concentration of SEL-037 per ml in vial i.e., 6 mg/m L) 
3. Since each vial , once reconstituted , will yield  about [ADDRESS_985496] equals the number of 
ml of reconstituted SEL-037 needed for the infusion rounded up to the next whole 
number.  
4. Reconstitute the required number of vials each with 1 .1 mL of room temperature  sterile 
water for injection, USP.   Invert (don’t shake) each vial several times to ensure product 
is reconstituted.  Do not use any vials with visible clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   Reconstituted SEL-037 
should be diluted as in Step 5 as soon as possible but reconstituted SEL-037 is stable at 
room temperature and normal light conditions for 8 hours .   
5. Dilute required volume of reconstituted SEL-037 by [CONTACT_721365] 100 m L of 0.9% saline 
for injection, USP.   
6. Infuse total volume of the SEL-037-normal saline solution  over 60 minutes  (+/- 2 
minutes). If necessary the infusion time may be extended in order to ensure the infusion 
of the study medication in entirety .  The SEL-037-normal saline solution  is stable for up 
to 6 hours at room temperature (i.e., the infusion should be completed within 6 hours of 
dilution) but it is recommended that the infusio n of SEL-[ADDRESS_985497] to the IV pump, flush the IV drip 
set using a volume of 0.9% normal saline equal to the prime volume of the tubing . 
 
Example  for subject weighing 200 pounds  in Cohort 2 (0.4 mg/kg group)   
Step 1:  I f not already done convert 
weight to kg:  = 200 pounds / 2.2 046 = 90. 7 kg 
Step 2: Calculate volume of reconstituted 
SEL-037 needed : = (0. 4 mg/kg) x (90. 7 kg) / (6 mg/ mL)

Step 4 and 5: Reconstitute 7 vials and add 6.0 mL to 100 m L of 0.9% normal saline for injection, USP.  
Step 6:  Infuse 10 6.0 mL over 60 minutes  (+/- 2 minutes). If necessary the infusion time may be 
extended in order to ensure the infusion of the study med ication in entirety  
Step 7: At the conclusion of the infusion, using the port closest to the IV pump, flush the IV 
drip set using a volume of 0.9% normal saline equal to the prime volume of the tubing

1. Convert weight of subject to kg, as needed (weight in pounds divided by 2.2 046). 
2. Calculate the volume (m L) of SEL -[ADDRESS_985498] , with a maximum volume of 
6.0 mL (equivalent to 12 mg of rapamycin in SEL -110) per study visit per individual  in 
cohorts receiving SEL -110 doses <0.10 mg/kg. If calculated required dose volume exceeds 
6.0 mL, dose volume should be set to 6.0 mL.  In cohorts receiving SEL -110 ≥0.10 mg/kg, 
there is no maximum volume of SEL -110, however their initial rate of SEL -110 is restricted 
to 5.5 mL/hr as described in section 9.5 .  If calculated required dose volume exceeds 6.0 mL, 
for cohorts receiving SEL -110 ≥0.10 mg/kg, the full calculated dose volume should be used. 
 
Volume (m L) SEL -110 required =  
(dose in mg/kg) x (subject weight in kg) / (concentration of SEL -110 per ml in vial i.e., 2 mg/m L) 
 
3. Calculate the number of vials of SEL -[ADDRESS_985499].  Round the calculation up 
to the next whole number.  
 
Number of SEL -110 vials required =  
[Volume (m L) SEL -110 required + priming volume (mL)] / (5 m L/vial)  
 
4. Thaw the required number of vials at room temperature fo r at least 2 hours.  Once the vials 
are thawed, invert slowly (don’t shake) each vial twenty  times to ensure product is uniform.  
Do not use any vials with visible clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Thawed SEL -110 should be administered as soon 
as possible but thawed SEL -110 is stable at room temperature and normal light conditions for 
24 hours.  
5. Load a syringe with the appropriate size for the dose.  In order to pri me the line between 
the syringe and the injection site valve, an additional priming volume of SEL -110 
(approximately 1.5mL) , equal to the volume of the connecting line used (approximately 
0.65mL) and the prime volume of the 5 micrometer membrane filter (Pall Medical, PN 
HP1050 ; 0.85 mL ) used, should be added to the syringe.   When loading syringes, do not 
bubble air through the product to avoid the formation of foam.  
6. Start an infusion of 125 mL of normal saline solution over 60 minutes using an IV set with 
an injection site valve.    
7. Start an infusion of SEL -110 as described below concurrently with the saline infusion of 
Step 6:  
a) For cohorts receiving SEL -110 doses <0.1 mg/kg, u sing the injection site valve, 
immediately  after starting the normal sal ine IV, slowly inject the SEL-110 using a 
syringe infusion pump at a single steady rate to deliver the dose over a period of 55 
minutes. A 5 µm syringe filter (5 µm syringe filter Supor (PES) membrane, Pall Medical 
P/N HP1050) for single use must be included in the SEL -110 line downstream of the 
syringe and proximal to the injection site valve.    
b) For cohorts receiving SEL-110 doses ≥0.1 mg/kg, using the injection site valve, 
immediately after starting the normal saline IV, slowly inject the SEL -110 using a syringe

infusion pump at an initial infusion rate equal to 5.5 mL/hour for the first 30 minutes of 
infusion and, then, change to a steady rate sufficient to deliver the remainder of the dose 
volume for the additional 25 minutes. A 5 µm syringe fil ter (5 µm syringe filter Supor 
(PES) membrane, Pall Medical P/N HP1050) for single use must be included in the 
SEL-[ADDRESS_985500] weighing 200 pounds in Cohort _ 5__ (0. 08 mg/kg group)  
Step 1: If not already done convert weight to kg:  
= 200 pounds / 2.2 0462  = 90. 7 kg 
Step 2: Calculate volume of SEL -110 needed , with a maximum volume of 6.0 mL 
(equivalent to 1 2 mg of rapamycin in SEL -110) per study visit per individual , since the example 
cohort 5 is receiving <0 .1 mg/kg SEL -110.  If calculated required dose volume exceeds 6.0 mL, 
dose volume should be set to 6.0 mL: 
= (0. 08 mg/kg) x (90. 7 kg) / (2 mg/ mL) 
= 7.26/2 = 3.6 mL SEL-110 
Step 3: Calculate number of vials needed  (assumes 1.5 mL prime volume) :  
= [3.6 mL SEL-110 required + 1.5mL] / (5 m L/vial)  
= 1.02 vials.  Round up to 2 vials. 
Step 4 and 5: Thaw 2 vials and load syringe with 3.6 mL SEL-110 plus the priming volume 
(approximately 1.5 mL) . 
Step 6: Start infusion of 125 mL of normal saline solution over 60 minutes.  
Step 7: Immediately after the start of the normal saline infusion, slowly inject 3.6 mL of SEL-
110 at a single steady rate over 55  minutes , using a 5 µm syringe filter proximal to the injection 
site valve . At the end of the 55 minutes, continue t he saline infusion for the additional 5 minutes 
after the SEL -110 infusion stops to flush the main line.

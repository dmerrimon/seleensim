 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
 COVID- 19 and Cytokine Release Syndrome  
 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is an unprecedented international pandemic caused 
by [CONTACT_144878][INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV- 2).[1] The spread of 
the virus and the incidence of the disease are accelerating at exponential rates. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_144858], delays in testing have allowed for dissemination that is undetect ed and unaccounted. Aggressive measures are being taken to 
develop vaccines and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], but even relaxation of regulatory measures are unlikely to expedite their development to allow for rapid widespread dissemination.  Mortality in 
patients with severe and critical disease is exceedingly high. In Wuhan, mortality 28 -day 
mortality for those admitted to the ICU was over 60%. [1] In [LOCATION_001] City, initial 
mortality rates for those requiring mechanical ventilation was over 75% for those age 65 years and under, and 97% for those over 65 years- old.[2] These staggering statistics 
highlight a population with a significant unmet need. It is imperative that existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144859]- 19.  
 Emerging evidence suggests that this novel coronavirus, like others, induces an overactive and ineffective immune cascade associated with acute lung pathology, acute myocarditis, and cytokine storm mediated by [CONTACT_144879] 2, 6, and 8, TNF -alpha, 
interferon -γ, and G -CSF. [3] This aberr ant immune response is thought to be the principal 
contributor to the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19. Additionally, studies of viral 
kinetics suggest that viral peaking occurs a number of days prior to the apex of symptoms, 
further suggesting that dec ompensation is an immunopathogenic response related to innate 
immune cells. [4] Numerous anecdotal reports describe the onset of severe symptomatology 
with refractory pyrexia occurring one to two weeks after initial viral prodrome, consistent 
with this theory. As such, a number of agents, including IL -6 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, 
are aiming to disrupt these immune pathways in COVID clinical trials.  
 
 Lessons and Preclinical Data from CART -releated CRS  
 
Chimeric antigen receptor T -cell (CART) therapy has been limited by [CONTACT_144880] 50% of patients.  Toxicities primarily manifest as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by [CONTACT_144881], hypotension, increasing oxygen requirements and elevations of cytokines including IFNγ, GM -CSF, TNF, IL -10, 
and IL -[ADDRESS_165788] tocilizumab, 
which is effective at blocking the early events of CRS but ineffective at controlling life threating CNS CRS. [5]  A clinical s trategy to prevent CRS without attenuating CART 
mediated anti -tumor activity is essential for the safe use of CART as a curative therapy for 
hematological malignancies.  Enhancing the safety and efficacy of CART therapy though the amelioration of CRS will dramatically improve outcomes and expand clinical 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/2020  Page 8 of 41 
    
    
 application of adoptive T cell therapy. The same processes may underlie the terminal 
clinical manifestations of COVID -19 where patients suffer from progressive fever, 
increasing oxygen requirements, bleeding and clotting due to the activation of the coagulation cascade and eventual respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].[6]  These events are often associated with elevation of biomarkers such as elevated IL -6, CRP, D -Dimers and ferritin levels , 
which are comparable to those seen in CART -related CRS .[7]   
 
 Gene edited CART  model  for the Mitigation of CRS  
 We hypothesize d that the generation 
of CART cells, engineered through CRISPR/Cas9  gene editing to delete 
IFNγ, or other selected genes known to mediate inflammatory interactions between CART and target cells and macrophages (source of IL -6 and 
other inflammatory cytokines) may ameliorate CRS, preventing downstream IL -6 secretion from 
macrophages.  We had previously 
shown that inhibitors of JAK1/2 could block the production of IL -6 
and CRS symptoms when immunocompetent mice were treated with anti- murine CD3 in vivo ( Fig 1 ). 
We hypothesize d that the generation 
of CART cells, engineered th rough 
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to delete IFNγ will completely ameliorate CRS, preventing downstream IL -[ADDRESS_165789] of IFNy deletion in human T cells on the release of CRS related cytokines, specifically IL-6.  Using CRISPR/Cas9, 
IFNy was genetically deleted in human primary T cells (>80% deletion).  IFNy deficient T cells were stimulated in the presence 
of immature dendritic cells, prior 
to cyt okine quantification by 
[CONTACT_6428] (+24hrs).  Contrary to 
expectations, deletion of IFNy, significantly increased IL -6

mediator released by [CONTACT_144882]-6 by [CONTACT_144883]/macrophages ( Fig 
2) 
 
 PI3K Inhibition Potently Mitigates CRS in Pre -clinical CART Model  
 Using unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screens in which we have deleted several hundred genes 
involved in pathways of inflammation in CART19 cells , we have explored several other 
genes of  interest. .  Although these studies are still in progress we have identified several 
pathways /genes  involving co- stimulatory pathways signaling through phosphoinositide 3-
kinase  (PI3K) in macrophages.  One of these pathways includes the CD40- CD40L 
pathway.  CRISPR/Cas9 genetic deletion of CD40L in CART resulted in normal CART function but no production of IL -6 when incubated with iDC (data not shown).  We 
phenocopi[INVESTIGATOR_144860]40L on CART and C D40 on iDC using 
antibodies to each.  Of note is that one pathway of CD40 signaling in macrophages includes PI3K signaling specifically PI3K γ signaling.  We tested the pharmacologic inhibition of 
PI3K using a dual PI3K -δγ inhibitor duvelisib.  D uvelisib, w hich is currently FDA 
approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) had a potent effect on IL-6 production (even more potent that antibodies to CD40L) while having no impact on 
CART function , similar to CD40L -CD40 blockade and JAK1/2 blockade ( Fig 3 ) Of 
interest is that the combination of a JAK1/2 inhibitor and duvelisisb completely a  brogated IL-6 production in our in vitro CAR model (Fig 4 ).

Protocol Versi on: 11/30/[ADDRESS_165791] seen in preclinical work on CART therapy.. 
Many of the cytokines reduced by [CONTACT_144884] y 
elevated in patients with COVID -19, including IL-1beta, IL -6, IL -8, MIP-1α, MIP -1β, IL -
10, and TNFα, supporting a potential role in mitigating CRS.[8, 9]  Duvelisib may also 
positively impact the respi[INVESTIGATOR_144861] -19 causing acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]. In a murine model of acute pulmonary inflammation, PI3Kδ inhibition has be en demonstrated to decrease IL -17 production and decrease pathogenic 
neutrophil recruitment to the lung. [10] Duvelisib has also demonstrated significant 
reductions in pro- inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltra tion in in vivo models of 
asthma and pulmonary inflammation.[11]  Lastly, duvelisib may potentiate the elimination 
of SARS -CoV -2 through preferential macrophage polarization and inhibiting viral 
persistence. Duvelisib has been demonstrated to polarize macrophages to the M1 phenotype which is responsible for pathogen elimination.[12]  Such macrophage 
polarization has been demonstrated in primary samples from clinical trials of duvelisib .[13]  
Additionally, PI3K/Akt signaling has been shown to be a requirement for persistent SARS -
CoV- 1 infection in vitro in Vero E6 cells, which inhibition of PI3K can disrupt.[14, 15]  
 The exceedingly high mortality rates of severe and critical COVID -19 warrant the 
identification and evaluation of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144862].  Based on preclinical data from our institution and others, we 
hypothesize that PI3K   inhibition with duvelisib could  potentially quell aberrant 
hyperactivtation of the innate immune system, preferentially polarize macrophages, reduce 
pulmonary inflammation, and limit viral persistence , thereby [CONTACT_144885].

-1 15 mg twice daily  
-2 Discontinue  
 
 Supportive Care  
 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/2020  Page 16 of 41 
    
    
 Patients should receive full supportive care, including but not limited to intravenous fluids, 
transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, antivirals, antibacterial agents, and antiemetics, when appropriate at the discretion of the treating clinician.  
 
5.3.1 Recommended  Prophylaxis Medications  
 
Patients should receive prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) during study 
treatment. Following completion of study treatment , continue PJP prophylaxis until 
the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/μL.  
 CMV prophylaxis may be consi dered in patients deemed high risk per institutional 
guidelines, although is not mandatory. CMV viral load monitoring will occur for seropositive patients.  
 
5.3.2 Prohibited/Discouraged  Medications 
 
Strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided as they decrease duveli sib area under 
the curve (AUC) which may reduce duvelisib efficacy.   
 Strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided as they increase duvelisib AUC which 
may increase the risk of duvelisib toxicities. If strong CYP3A inhibitors are 
clinically necessary, the do se of duvelisib should be reduced to [ADDRESS_165797] dexamethasone 6mg  daily oral or intravenously at the time of screening 
(Day - 1) and continue through Day +10 or beyond, unless contraindicated, per 
results of the RECOVERY T rial.[19]  
 
5.3.4 Investigational or Off- Label Treatments for COVID -19  
 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/[ADDRESS_165798] received other investigational or off -label agents previously are 
eligible for study and these agent(s) may be continued at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 During study treatment, screening through Day 10, the  addition of investigational 
or off -label agents for patients on the study is discouraged. However, physicians  
who believe use of such agents is warranted should discuss with the principal investigator. If s uch agents are administered, patients are permit ted to continue on 
duvelisib.  
 
 Viral Load Monitoring 
 All patients will have three consecutive days of viral load monitoring prior to receiving duvelisib, on Screening day, Day - 1, and Day 1 (see S ection 7.0), to establish the baseline 
viral load and trend. For patients with an increase in viral load of >0.5 log on two consecutive days, or >1 log increase in one day, clinical judgement should be used t o 
determine if any continued rising viral load is suspr ected to be related to study treatment . 
If suspected to be related to study treatment , follow dose modifications as outlined in 
section 5.2. If thought to be unrelated to study treatment ,  i.e. keepi[INVESTIGATOR_144866], 
no change unless deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_1963]. 
 
 Worsening COVID- 19 Symptomology 
 
Patients with clinically worsening  symptoms  of COVID- 19 may be removed from study 
treatment at any time per discretion  of the treating physician and additional treatments may 
be commenced. Howev er, patients should continue to be followed as per the protocol 
calendar in s ection 7.0.    
 
 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient /surrogate  no longer wishes continuation of the protocol 
therapy, the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) documented in the case report forms.   
 Patients will be removed from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) t hat, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator

 Planned Correlative Studies  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_165801] limited information on the molecular effectors that control in B cells the production of specific classes (ie. IgM, IGG, IGA) and subclasses (IGG1, IGG2, IGG3, IGG4) of antibodies during SARS -CoV2 infection. 
The latter information is crucial to understand which factors trigger the production of antibody classes and subclasses with neutralizing activity rather than those exerting pro -inflammato ry functions by [CONTACT_144892], or by [CONTACT_144893]. Finally, the identification of molecular determinants contributing to the establishment of long -lived antigen -
specific memory B cells and antibody- secreting plasma cells during the acute phase 
of SARS -Cov2 infection represents a key step to possibly modulate the duration of 
anti-viral responses.  
 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/[ADDRESS_165802] SARS -
CoV2 during the acute phase of the infection. Specifically, Duvelisib may influence the extent of B cell activation in response to SARS -CoV2 recognition, by 
[CONTACT_21413] B cell receptor (BCR) signalling, wh ich in turn controls B cell 
proliferation and terminal differentiation [ 16.17 ). Duvelisib exposure may also 
influence immunoglobulin isotype switching [17] This effect may lead to a 
substantial shift in the classes and subclasses of antibodies produced during the viral infection. In particular, Duvelisib treatment may change the ratio between neutralizing IGG1 antibodies and pro- inflammatory IGG3 antibodies produced 
during the acute phase of SARS -CoV2 infection. Duvelisib inte rference of PI3K 
signalling may enhance the process of antibody somatic hypermutation in antigen -
specific B cells recruited into germinal centers (GC), in the frame of a conventional 
T-cell dependent anti -SARS -Cov2 immune respons e [17] . Whether enhanced 
antibody diversification ignited in GC B cells by [CONTACT_144894], positively impacts on 
the average affinity of antibodies raised against SARS -Cov2 remains to be 
determined. Finally, Duvelisib treatment, during the acute phase of SARS -Cov2 
infection, could exert a crucial impact on the net output of germinal centers represented by [CONTACT_144895]- lived memory B cells and plasma cells 
producing high- affinity anti- virus antibodie s [17,18] .   
 
Aim of the investigations and experimental plan 
The proposed studie s aim to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effects 
of Duvelisib treatment on the antibody response raised against SARS -CoV2 in the 
acute phase of infection. Specifically, we will measure the effects of Duvelisib 
treatment on the concentration of all classes (IGM, IGG, IGA) and subclasses (IGG1, IGG2, IGG3, IGG4), IGA1 and IGA2) of serum anti -SARS -CoV2 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_144869]- specific antibodies, respectively at Day -2, Day- 4, Day- 8, Day- 15, and Day-
29 of infection. Through serum neutralization tests, we will als o estimate at the 
same time points, the effects of Duvelisib on the extent of production of anti -SARS -
Cov2 neutralizing antibodies. Finally, flow cytometric determinations will establish whether Duvelisib treatment impacts.  on the frequency of circulating  RBD- binding

plasma cells/plasma blasts, assessed at the different time points after the infection.  
 
Methods  
The laboratory of Dr S. Casola (The FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, IFOM, Milan) has developed an in- house ELISA -based serological assay to measure 
serum/plasma levels of the entire spectrum of antibody classes and subclasses (IGM, IGG1, IGG2, IGG3, IGG4, IGA1/A2) raised against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS -CoV2 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870], produced in recombinant 
fashion. In particular, the assay will ensure the measurement of absolute amounts 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/2020  Page 24 of 41 
    
    
 (i.e concentration) of IGM - and IGG1 -specific anti -RBD antibody titers. An 
ELISA -based competition assay will be employed to quantify the neutralizing 
activity of the serum of SARS -Cov2 -infected patients.  To perform the serological 
tests mentioned above, we will need between 0.5 and 1.0 ml of fresh or - 20°C -
stored serum (or plasma).  One -two ml of fresh or cryopreserved peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells will be needed to estimate by [CONTACT_144896] -specific memory B cells and plasma cells revealed after staining the cells 
with a tetramer form of fluorescent labelled recombinant RBD.

Analysis will include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of  cytokine expressio n 
via multiplex cytokine array  or other markers /predictors  of response.

12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a double -blinded randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_144873]. The purpose of this study is to provide 
hypothesis generating data on the efficacy and toxicity duvelisib for the treatment of COVID -19. 
The total accrual goal is 2 8 patients , approximately 14 in each arm . Blocks of 10 pati ents will be 
used to allocate patients to either duvelisib or placebo. The projected enrollment time frame is  3 
months ( approximately 9  patients per month).  
 
 Determination of Sample Size  
 
The primary endpoint is 28 day overall survival (OS). While outcomes data are still developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], observational studies in other areas demonstrate 28- day OS to be poor but 
highly variable, from approximately 10- 40%. [12 –14] The variability is outcomes makes a 
priori sample size calculations difficult, but as this pi[INVESTIGATOR_144874], sample size considerations were based largely on 
feasibility and detecting a clinically meaningful effect rather than stat istical significance. 
For duvelisib to have clinically meaningfully efficacy, we estimate that 28 -day OS is >60% 
in this patient population. Based on this assumption, a sample size of 28, [ADDRESS_165814] an improvement in 28- day OS  from approximately 20% to 60%, 
with >80% power at a one -sided type I error of <0.20. If 28 day survival in the placebo 
cohort is considerably higher, for example 40%, we would only have approximately 40% 
power in detecting a statistical -significant difference. In either event, additional 
confirmatory studies that are adequately powered would be needed to more accurately 
assess the efficacy of duvelisib  for the treatment of COVID -19.  
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
The primary endpoint is 28 day overall surviv al (OS) and will be treated as a binary 
outcome for the purposes of the primary analysis and will be described using descriptive 
statics with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. This will be an intent -to-treat 
analysis, and all patients randomized will be included in the analysis. The assumption is 
that all patients will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_165815] to follow -up for 
any reason prior to this point will be included in the analysis and considered treatment failures  and treate d the same as a death . The 28 day OS of each cohort, duvelisib versus 
placebo, will be compared using Fisher’s exact test of independence.   
 
In addition to the primary analysis, OS will be treated as a time- to-event variable and will 
be described using Ka plan- Meier product limit estimators of event time curves and, if 
reached, median s with 95% confidence intervals.  Cox proportional hazards models may be 
used to adjust for potential confounding effects. These analyses are considered exploratory, 
and we ackn owledge that the proposed sample size will have low power for such 
adjustment. 
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/2020  Page 31 of 41 
    
    
  
The analyses of secondary end points are all exploratory in nature. Secondary endpoints of 
efficacy include: h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_144863]  (for tho se on a 
ventilator at the time of randomization), vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy . 
Kaplan -Meier product limit estimators of event time curves and, if reached, median s with 
95% confidence intervals, and compared between cohorts using the Log -Rank test. For 
these analyses, patients will be censored at Day 28 or at death, whichever is earlier. Secondary end points of toxicity are viral kine tics and adverse events. The rate of viral load 
elevation and other adverse events of interested will  be summarized using descriptive 
statistics and compared using Fisher’s Exact tests.  
 
Demographic and clinica l characteristics of the sample and of each cohort will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, the number of patients , 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles will be provided. For categorical variables, the number and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be summarized with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
 Study Termina tion 
 
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144875]. In addition, at any time the 
study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_144901], enrollment issues, etc. In this event, all participating sites, physicians, and patien ts will be notified and alternative

 13.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document to be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_144902] (or designee) prior to IRB/IEC submission.    
 Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has received official written documentation from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington Univers ity 
prior to study activation:  
• Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show which version of the protocol was approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
• Docu mentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must include a 
statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if applicable), and 
the Wash ington University study team.  
• Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572 (if applicable), and the CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
• Protocol signature [CONTACT_144904] [CONTACT_144903].  
 
The coordinating center Principal Investigator (or designee) is responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary sit es within 4 
weeks of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated secondary sites are expected 
to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt unless 
otherwise noted.  Upon the secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such 
shall be sent to the Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.  
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must 
be kept on file at Washington University.  
 
The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call to update and inform regarding the progress of  the trial.

 APPENDIX C : Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
 Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adve rse event 
caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of t he investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
o Death  
Protocol Versi on: 11/30/[ADDRESS_165817] 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other important medic al event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant.  
 
F. Deviation  
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
inclu ding the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  
 
A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential t o negatively impact 
the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or 
welfare of participants or others or th e scientific validity of the study.

Melanoma”

Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294468]:  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_242761]2 and NGFR transduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for treatment of metastatic 
melanoma.  A total of [ADDRESS_294469] developed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242762] (TILs), 
followed by [CONTACT_242783].  Although tumor regression can be dramatic in some 
patients, in other patients we see no clinical response.  We hypothesize that inefficient migration 
of T cells to tumors is one of the rate limiting steps in the generation of an effective anti -tumor 
response.  Therefore, we are investigating methods to improve T -cell trafficking to tumors 
through the introduction of specific receptor genes that can enhance migration to tumor sites. Melanomas specifically express the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8, which are thought to 
promote autocrine growth and angiogenesis.  However, we have found that tumor antigen-
specific T -cells fail to express the chemokine receptors specific for these ligands, including 
CXCR2.  In a strategy designed to direct T cells toward chemokines expressed by [CONTACT_15198], we 
have developed a system to genetically modify T cells using retroviral vectors encoding CXCR2. 
We have demonstrated  that murine T -cells transduced to express CXCR2 exhibited enhanced 
trafficking to CXCL1 expressing tumors and this led to improved anti -tumor responses and 
survival.  We  now propose to translate our findings from our mouse models to humans by 
[CONTACT_242784] -reactive TILs genetically modified to express 
CXCR2.   To compare the ability of CXCR2 transduced TIL to migrate to tumor compared to 
control TIL, each patient will also receiv e TIL transduced with the truncated NGFR (nerve 
growth factor receptor) marker gene.

 T-cell migration into tissues is largely dependent on expression of specific chemokines that 
signal through corresponding chemokine receptors expressed by [CONTACT_24495]. In order to identify chemokines that are expressed constitutively by [CONTACT_20405], we first investigated 
chemokine expression in human melanomas freshly isolated  
from patients. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_242763]. For controls, we prepared cDNA from 
a renal carcinoma (RCC) cell line, cultured normal fibroblasts and cultured melanocytes. 
Table 1 shows ratios of the signal intensity in the various normal and tumor tissues compared to PBMC. Differences are considered significant (in bold, Table 1)  when ratios

shows ratios of the signal intensity in the various 
normal and tumor tissues compared to PBMC. 
Differences are considered significant (in bold, 
Table 1)  when ratios are greater than 2 or less than 
0.5 and varied from normal tissues and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by a factor of greater than [ADDRESS_294471] the other chemokines as being markedly 
upregulated with a high relative signal intensity in a significant proportion of melanomas (6 of 
10) when compared to levels in normal tissues and RCC (mean value 13. 56 + 5.97 versus 1.04 
+ 0.22). CXCL9 was also upregulated in a majority of melanomas tested, although the mean 
value of 4.49 + 1.30 was lower than that for CXCL1. The analysis of cDNA from fresh 
melanoma samples suggests that CXCL1 is expressed at the tumo r site in vivo .  To confirm that 
melanoma cells, as reported, could produce CXCL1 protein, we next evaluated the production 
of CXCL1 by [CONTACT_242785]. For these purposes, cell lines were plated at 
5x105 cells/ml and, [ADDRESS_294472] human melanoma cell lines also constitutively produced 
significant amounts of CXCL1. (Table 
2)(Kershaw, Wang et al. 2002) .   
CXCL1 binds to the chemokine receptor CXCR2.  In addition, CXCL8 (IL -8) can bind to CXCR2.   
Because CXCL8 (IL -8) was also seen in some of 
the tumor samples and has been reported to be highly expressed in some melanoma cells, we 
evaluated a panel of melanoma cell lines for their 
ability to produce IL- 8 (Table 3), and 6 of 8 
melanoma lines produced significant levels of CXCL8.  Moreover, we also analyzed paraffin-
embedded melanoma tissue samples from patients  
for the expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8 by  
[CONTACT_9064] (Figure 1). Both chemokines were found to be present in the majority of lymph 
node and metastatic lesions analyzed, consistent 
with published findings  (Richmond, Lawson et al. 
1985; Payne and Cornelius 2002) . Thus, the 
majority of human melanomas produce ligands for 
CXCR2, providing a strong rationale for improving tumor homing of T cells through ectopic 
expression of this chemokine receptor.

Murine tumors produce CXCL1 
As reported, the expression of CXCL1 appears to be restricted to tumor and inflammatory 
tissues.  This was further confirmed for murine tissues by [CONTACT_242789] (GEO) database and the SAGEmap database (both available at 
http://www.ncbi.nlm .nih.gov/).  Evaluation of the murine transcriptome in the GEO database, 
which included the evaluation of transcript levels from [ADDRESS_294473] probes, revealed that murine CXCL1 RNA levels were not 
significantly higher in any tissue compared to that seen in lung, liver, and kidney.  In addition, in our own studies, CXCL1 was undetectable in lysates of minced kidney or lung from normal mice 
(not shown), as determined by [CONTACT_6428].  
 We next assessed whether  murine tumor cells could produce CXCL1. Fresh tumor explants 
derived from 24JK sarcoma, cultured overnight in medium, produced large amounts of CXCL1, 
as determined by [CONTACT_6428] (not shown) .  In addition, cultured MC38 tumor cells expressed high 
levels of CXCL1 (Figure 4B) .  While B16 tumor explants expressed CXCL1, cultured B16 tumor 
cells did not.  Therefore, the CXCL1 gene was introduced into B16 for some of our models, as 
discussed below.  
 
Activated, tumor -reactive T cells do not express CXCR2 
 We next analyzed the chemokine receptors expressed by [CONTACT_20150] -reactive human and murine T 
cells. Using an RNAse protection assay, cultured human T cells appeared to express the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4 (data not shown; 
(Kershaw, Wang et al. 2002)). Notably, human T cells did not express the CXCL1- binding 
chemokine receptor, CXCR2. To confirm this pattern of receptor expression, we evaluated the 
ability of tumor reactive human T cells to respond functionally by [CONTACT_242790]. We found that the T cells could 
generate a calcium flux in response to the chemokines CCL5 (a ligand for CCR1, 3, and 5), 
CCL2 (ligand for CCR2), and CXCL12 (ligand for CXCR4), but not CXCL1, results that were 
consistent with the expression pattern observed using the RNAse protection assay.  
 
In a similar fashion, we determined whether cultured murine T cells could naturally respond to 
CXCL1.  As with human cells, murine T cells did not naturally migrate towards CXCL1, or exhibit 
calcium flux when exposed to CXCL1. Consistent with this, in an RNAse protection assay, 
murine alloreactive and peptide stimulated T cells were found to express CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5, but not CXCR2 (data not shown).  
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294474] been established to monitor cells in vivo,  including bioluminescence imaging (BLI). 
Compared with other technologies, BLI has several advantages that made it a powerful tool for 
the preclinical studies. First, BLI is a non-invasive imaging method. It allows 
researchers to continuously monitor the 
same animal for the duration of the 
experiment.  Second, BLI does not 
require radioisotopes and is 
inexpensive. Third, multiple 
experimental animals can be imaged by [CONTACT_242791], thus saving 
valuable time and resources.  
However, in murine adoptive T- cell 
therapy studies, the number of 
transferred T cells migrating to the 
tumor site is typi[INVESTIGATOR_242765] a few 
hundred, which was below the level of detection of most bioluminescence 
technologies. Therefore, in order to monitor the small T cell population in 
vivo, our first priority was to develop a 
sensitive in vivo  imaging system based 
on bioluminescence technology. To improve the expression of current virus 
based firefly luciferase constructs in 
mouse T cells, we optimized the codon usage to the highest frequency of Mus musculus , removed the cryptic splice 
sites and added the woodchuck hepatitis virus pre- element to augment export of the viral mRNA 
into the cytosol. These modifications resulted in >80% transduction efficiency in mouse T cells 
and high levels of expression (Figure 2A) . After sorting the firefly luciferase transduced T cells, 
we observed a [ADDRESS_294475] (Figure 2B) . By [CONTACT_242792], as few as three transduced T 
cells could be visualized after subcutaneous injection into the mice (Figure 2C) .  
Establishing a new murine tumor model to monitor the migration of transferred T cells in 
vivo  
 
Following optimization of firefly luciferase expression in primary murine T -cells(Rabinovich, Ye 
et al. 2008), we next focused on studying T -cell migration in murine tumor models.  However, Figure 2. Comparison of coreporter expression and 
luminescent activity of T cells expressing standard 
versus enhanced retroviral firefly luciferase (A) MurineT 
cells were transduced with the standard firefly luciferase 
construct v -ffLuc ( left) or  enhanced firefly luciferase 
construct v -effLuc (Right). The expression of Thy1.1, the 
reporter gene of both luciferase constructs, was assessed 3 
days after transduction by [CONTACT_4133]. (B)  Murine T cells 
transduced with v -ffLuc or v -effLuc (as indicated) were 
injected s.c. at the indicated numbers into B6 Albino mice, 
and photon emissions were measured on an IVIS 200. ( C) 
T cells transduced with v -effLuc  were injected s.c. at the 
level of 30, 10, or 3 cells as indicated.

we found that BLI could not be used optimally with the B16 melanoma tumor model, due to the 
blockade of the luciferase signal by [CONTACT_242793] C57BL/6 mice and the black 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_242766] B16 tumor.  Therefore, we needed to develop a new murine tumor model to 
monitor tumor -specific T cell migration in vivo  by [CONTACT_242794]. To reduce the absorption of the luciferase 
signal by [CONTACT_242795] C57BL/6 mice, the C57BL/6 mouse strain was replaced with an albino C57BL/6 mouse strain, which shares the same genetic background with C57BL/6 
mice, but contains  a spontaneous mutation of the tyrosinase gene. Additionally,  the melanoma 
tumor a ntigen, gp100, was cloned into a lentiviral vector containing mIL- 4R as a reporter gene, 
and transduced into a colon carcinoma derived from C57BL/6 mice, MC38. A stable gp100-expressing MC38 tumor cell line (MC38/gp100) was generated by [CONTACT_242796]- 4R reporter. We also transduced Pmel T cells with 
retroviral supernatants containing the mCXCR2 and luciferase constructs ( Figure 3A ). We 
routinely obtained more than 90% transduction efficiency ( Figure 3B ). F urthermore, 
MC38/gp100 tumor cells could activate Pmel T cells, which express a transgenic TCR 
recognizing an H- 2D
b restricted gp100 peptide, to exhibit cytolytic activity ( Figure 3C ) and 
produce effector cytokines such as IFN -γ (Figure 3D ). Because MC38/g p100 tumor cells, unlike 
B16 tumor cells, express consistent levels of MHC class I molecules, the activation of Pmel T 
cells by [CONTACT_212281]38/gp100 does not require IFN -γ pretreatment of tumor to induce class I expression. 
In this respect, the MC38/gp100 tumor cells are more similar to human melanoma than B16, 
since IFN gamma is not required by [CONTACT_242797]8+ antigen- specific 
T-cells.  The luciferase signal from the transferred T cells in the MC38/gp100 tumor site, could 
be appropriately detected (data not shown).   Therefore, the MC38/gp100 tumor model 
combined with our modified BLI system is a powerful and sensitive tool to study tumor -specific T 
cell migration.    
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294476], OFL -GFP, 
or OFL- GFP and CXCR2. Sorted transduced T cells were used to perform a migration assay 
using a transwell system.  T cell migration to the lower well was measured in vitro  by [CONTACT_242798] D -luciferin. Higher levels of luciferase intensity were 
observed from Pmel T cells expressing both CXCR2 and luciferase than from Pmel T cells expressing luciferase alone. Furthermore,  increased migration of CXCR2- transduced Pmel T 
cells was dependent on CXCL1 as the migration of CXCR2- expressing Pmel T cells was similar 
with control T cells in the absence of CXCL1 (Figure 4A) . Moreover, we confirmed the 
migratory ability of CXCR2 -expressing Pmel T cells towards CXCL1 produced by [CONTACT_242799]. Our results indicated that the concentration of mCXCL1 in overnight cultured medium from 
2x10
6 MC38 or MC38/g p100 tumor cells was higher than 10ng/ml. Production of mCXCL1 was 
comparable between MC38 and MC38/gp100 tumor cells (Figure 4B) . Although mCXCL1 was 
present in B16 tumor explants (data not shown), mCXCL1 produced by [CONTACT_242800] B16 
tumor cells was undetectable by [CONTACT_6428]. Therefore, we also established a stable CXCL1-
expressing B16 tumor cell line (Figure 4B). By [CONTACT_242801], we investigated the migratory ability of CXCR2- expressing Pmel T cells in vitro.  Figure 3. Generation and functional characteristics of CXCR2 expressing Pmel T cells. (A) Schematic representation of viral 
vector containing mCXCR2. Long terminal repeat (LTR) from the murine stem cell PCMV virus drives high- level, constitutive 
expression of mCXCR2 in Pmel T cells. (B) FACS analysis of transduced Pmel T cells. Pmel T cells were transduced with modified 
luciferase (OFL) or OFL and mCXCR2. Cells were sorted based on the expression of GFP or CXCR2. Sorted cells were cultured 
for 3 days and us ed for transfer therapy. Before transfer, the purity of transferred cells was evaluated by [CONTACT_4133]. More than 
90% of transferred cells are either GFP positive or GFP and CXCR2 double positive, as expected. ( C) Cytotoxic reactivity of 
CXCR2 expressing Pmel T cell against MC38/gp100 tumor.  MC38 or MC38/gp100 cells were labeled with Cr51. After labeling, 5000 
tumor cells were cocultured with either CXCR2 expressing Pmel T cells or OFL- expressing Pmel T cells for 6 hours. The 
supernatants were monitored for gamma- activity. (D) IFN -γ secretion by [CONTACT_148647]2 expressing Pmel T cells in response MC38/gp100 
tumor. Similar cell lysis rate and similar amount of IFN -gamma secretion were found between CXCR2- expressing Pmel T cells and 
control Pmel T cell in response to  MC38/gp100 tumor.

Conditioned medium from either CXCL1- expressing B16 or MC38 tumor cells induced 
enhanced migration of CXCR2 expressing Pmel cells, but not the migration of control T cells 
(Figure 4C) . Additionally, the number of migrating T- cells corr elated with the concentration of 
CXCL1 in the cell culture supernatants. By [CONTACT_22242], the cell culture medium from B16 tumor 
cells didn’t alter the migration of CXCR2- expressing T cells when compared to medium alone, 
confirming that the migration of CXCR2- expressing T cells was dependent on CXCL1. Taken 
together, these results suggest that the introduction of the CXCR2 gene into Pmel T cells 
enhanced the migratory ability of those T cells towards a CXCL1 gradient in vitro  in a dose-
dependent manner, but did not alter the activation of T cells upon antigenic stimulation, in the 
presence or absence of CXCL1 (data now shown).  
 
CXCR2 -expressing Pmel T cells possess an enhanced ability to traffic to tumor in vivo  
To analyze the in vivo  migratory 
pattern of CXCR2 -expressing Pmel 
T cells in tumor -bearing mice, we 
took advantage of our newly 
established MC38/gp100 tumor 
model and modified BLI system. 1x10
6 Pmel T cells expressing OFL -
GFP alone or OFL -GFP and CXCR2 
were intravenously injected into 
C57BL/6 albino mice harboring 
MC38/gp100 tumors (average tumor 
size=20 mm2; All the mice receiving 
Pmel T cells  
also received DC vaccination and hIL-2 i.p injection as previously 
described (Lou, Wang et al. 2004) . 
Luciferase signals from the 
adoptively transferred Pmel T cells were 
monitored on a daily basis. Although the 
transferred Pmel T cells were detected by 
[CONTACT_242802] T cell transfer, most of 
the transferred Pmel T cells were initially 
found in the lung and liver which is 
consistent with adoptive T- cell transfer in 
humans ( Figure 5A ). Six days after T cell 
transfer, the majority of the transfer red 
Pmel T cells were localized at the tumor site. The distribution pattern of transferred tumor -
specific T cells obtained by [CONTACT_242803]- photon 
emission computed tomography (CT) -CT fusion imaging method (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_184423], Grimm et al. 2007) . 
Therefore, we used the luciferase results from mice on day six after T cell transfer as 
representative data to characterize the tumor migration of transferred Pmel T cells. As shown in 
Figure 5B , mice receiving CXCR2 -expressing T cells displayed a stronger luciferase signal at 
the tumor site than mice receiving T cells expressing luciferase alone on day 6 after T cell Figure 4: Enhanced migration ability of CXCR2

transfer. The average luciferase intensity of all mice (N=9) from each group was quantified by 
[CONTACT_242807] ( Figure 5C ). By [CONTACT_22242], in peripheral blood, the percentage of  Thy1.1+  
cells, a cell surface marker for transferred Pmel T cells,  among total CD8+ T cells in the 
peripheral blood remained similar between mice receiving CXCR2- expressing Pmel T cells or 
control Pmel T cells ( Figure 5D ). These results suggest that transduction of T -cells with the 
CXCR2 gene resulted in their preferential accumulation to tumor sites expressing CXCL1.  
Introduction of CXCR2 into human T cells induces calcium flux in response to CXCR2 
ligands  
 
Having demonstrated that CXCR2 transduced murine T- cells were more effective in vivo in 
murine tumor models, we next tested this system with human T -cells in vitro in preparation for 
bringing this concept to the clinic.  We have attempted to utilize knowledge of the expression 
patterns of chemokines and chemokine receptors in tumors and T cells to design strategies to enhance T- cell migration to tumors. Our initial approaches have taken advantage of our 
experience in modifying T cells by [CONTACT_242808] (Hwu, Shafer et al. 1993; Hwu, 
Yannelli et al. 1993; Hwu and Rosenberg 1994; Treisman, Hwu et al. 1994; Treisman, Hwu et 
al. 1995; Lam, Reeves et al. 1996; Kershaw, Wang et al. 2002; Royal, Kershaw et al. 2002) . 
Our strategy thus far has involved 
transduction of human lymphocytes 
with specific chemokine receptor 
genes in order to allow them to 
recognize and respond to the 
chemokines specifically produced by 
[CONTACT_15198]. In order to confer 
responsiveness to CXCL1, we cloned the human CXCR2 receptor gene into 
a retroviral vector and used it to 
transduce human T cells. Flow 
cytometric analysis demonstrated 
that T cells expressed surface CXCR2 following retroviral 
transduction (data not shown).   We 
next evaluated the function of the CXCR2 receptor in transduced T 
lymphocytes by [CONTACT_242809]2 ligands. T cells 
were transduced with either the 
CXCR2 -expressing or control 
retroviral vector were incubated with human CXCL8.  
 
Addition of the chemokine CXCL12, which binds 
to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 constitutively  
expressed by [CONTACT_242810] T cells, was included as a 
positive control. CXCR2 -transduced T cells 
responded to CXCL8 and human or mouse CXCL1  with a rapid increase in intracellular 
calcium (Figures 6a, 6b, and 6 c). The Figure 5: Enhanced migration ability of CXCR2

requirement for CXCR2 was demonstrated by [CONTACT_242811]2 ligands of 
control vector only -transduced T cells (Figures 6e, 6f, and 6g). As expected, both chemok ine 
receptor and vector -only transduced T cells were able to respond to CXCL12 (Figures 6d and 
6h). These results clearly demonstrated that introduced human CXCR2 could function in 
transduced primary human T cells and cause mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to 
binding of its chemokine ligands.

expression, as control vector -transduced T cells 
migrated in lower numbers irrespective of the

transduced T cells migrated towards CXCL1 in greater numbers than control vector -transduced T cells. (b) 
When CXCL1 was included in the upper and lower

transduced T cells migrated towards cell culture 
supernatant derived from the CXCL1- secreting tumor 
cell lines SK23 and HCT/GRO in greater numbers than 
towards supernatants from CXCL1 negative cells or 
media alone. The requirement for CXCR2 for the 
observed effect was evident from the comparatively lower migration levels of non- transduced or control 
vector -transduced T cells.

transduced T cells responded to the CXCR2 
ligands CXCL8, in addition to human and murine 
CXCL1 (a-c), to a similar degree as to the positive 
control CXCL12 (d) , the ligand for the 
constitutively expressed CXCR4. Control GFP

CXCR2 ligands (e -g), but did respond to the 
positive control CXCL12 (h).

presence or absence of CXCL1. Migration was demonstrated to be a result of increased specific 
chemotaxis rather than increased chemokinesis since inclusion of CXCL1 in both the upper and 
lower chambers did not result in increased migration of CXCR2- transduced T cells through 
trans wells (Figure 7b). Chemotaxis was G -protein -dependent, as it was inhibited by [CONTACT_242815] a dose- dependent manner (data not shown).    
In order to determine whether CXCR2- transduced T cells could respond to CXCL1 derived from 
tumor cells, transwell migration assays were also performed using overnight culture supernatants from tumor cell lines as the source of chemokine in the lower chamber. Significant numbers of CXCR2- transduced T cells migrated towards supernatant derived from SK23 
melanoma and fro m a CXCL1 -transduced HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line (HCT/GRO), 
approximately 3- fold more than towards media alone (Figure 7c). An approximately 2 -fold 
increase in migration was observed in response to CXCL1- expressing tumor cell supernatant 
compared to t he CXCL1 -negative cell supernatants derived from the colon carcinoma 
COLO205, the ovarian carcinoma line IGROV -1 and non- transduced HCT116.  
 Interestingly, migration of CXCR2 -transduced T cells was greater towards CXCL1- negative 
supernatant derived from ovarian and colon carcinoma cell lines than towards media alone. This latter observation may be due to the presence of CXCL8 found in supernatants from these cell lines (data not shown), since CXCR2 binds to both CXCL1 and CXCL8. CXCR2 was 
responsible for the increased T- cell migration observed, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_242816]- transduced T cells, irrespective of the source of 
supernatant (Figure 7c). These studies clearly demonstrate the feasibility of altering the 
migratory phenotype of T cells with the introduction of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (Kershaw, Wang et al. 2002) .   
 
We also demonstrate that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be readily transduced with 
human CXCR2 expressing vector ( Figure  8A). Furthermore ,  
transduction of CXCR2 confers enhanced migration capabilities in response to CXCL1 graduent compared to NGFR transduced cells ( Figure 8 B).

Transfer of CXCR2- expressing Pmel T cells further improves T -cell mediated antitumor 
immune responsesSince CXCR2 expression results in increased accumulation of tumor 
antigen specific T cells at the tumor site, we next assessed whether this increased accumulation would result in better antitumor immune responses. Seven days after tumor challenge, mice 
were treated with adoptive T- cell tran sfer (combined with TBI, gp100 peptide pulsed DC 
vaccination and hIL -2 injection as per our routine protocol). The size of MC38/gp100 tumor was 
measured every other day. Compared with untreated mice, transfer of 1x10
6 Pmel T cells  
resulted in a significant  decrease of MC38/gp100 tumor growth, which is consistent with our 
previous studies using the B16 tumor model (Figure 9A) .  More importantly, tumor growth in 
mice receiving CXCR2 -expressing Pmel T cells was significantly slower than in mice receiving 
contr ol (luciferase only) Pmel T cells (Figure 9A). In another related experiment, tumor growth in 
mice transferred with 1x106 CXCR2 -expressing Pmel T cells was comparable to that of mice 
received 5x106 control Pmel T cells (data not shown), suggesting that fewer T- cells need to be 
transferred if migration to the tumor is more efficient. Moreover, the introduction of the CXCR2 gene into adoptively transferred Pmel T cells also led to a significant increase in the survival of 
MC38/gp100 -bearing mice (Figure 9 B). Although CXCR2 -expressing Pmel T cells did not 
confer better protection in B16 tumor bearing mice than control Pmel T cells (data not shown), likely due to the lack of CXCL1 expression by [CONTACT_242817] B16 tumor, the growth of CXCL1-
expressing B16 tumors in vivo  was significantly delayed in mice treated with CXCR2- expressing 
Pmel T cells compared with control Pmel T cells (Figure 9 C). 
Transferring CXCR2- expressing 
Pmel T cells was also found to 
significantl y extend the survival 
time of B16 -CXCL1 tumor 
bearing mice (Figure 6D). These data strongly suggest that 
expression of CXCR2 by 
[CONTACT_242818] T cells 
enhances the in vivo antitumor immune response.   
 
Hence, Our results from 
preclinical murine models and 
human TILs have demonstrated the feasibility of altering 
lymphocyte migration in vitro  and 
in vivo with the use of retroviral 
gene transfer, and also showed 
that improved migration of 
CXCR2 -transduced tumor -
specific lymphocytes has conferred enhanced tumor 
protection in murine models.

Primary Objective  
• To  assess the  feasibility and safety  of CXCR2 and NGFR Transduced TILs for treating 
metastatic malignant  melanoma.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
 
• Determine whether CXCR2 transduction enhances the ability of TIL to migrate to 
melanoma tumors  
 
• Determine the levels of CXCL1 and CXCL8 chemokines produced by [CONTACT_242820]2 transduced TIL  
 
• Characterize the clinical response and correlate with migration of CXCR2 transduced 
TIL to the tumor and levels of CXCL1 and CXCL8 at the tumor site.  
  
 3.0 Clinical Pharmacology  
 3.1 CXCR2  transduced TIL  
 CXCR2 is a 67- 70 kD seven -transmembrane G -protein coupled chemokine receptor. The 
ligands that bind to CXCR2 include CXCL8 (IL -8) and CXCL1 (GRO -α).  TIL retrovirally 
transduced to express CXCR2 can migrate in vitro and in vivo to CXCL1 and CXCL8 expressing tumors.   
 3.2 NGFR transduced TIL  
 
Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) belongs to the TNF (tumor necrosis factor) superfamily of 
receptors and is one of the receptors for neurotrophins. A non -signaling truncated version of 
human NGFR, lacking the cytoplasmic domain, is rout inely used as a marker for gene 
transduction. In this study, a human truncated NGFR will be used as  a control for CXCR2 TIL 
transduction. Since it is of human origin and lack s a cytoplasmic domain, it will not elicit any 
immune r esponses and is incapable of eliciting intracellular signaling cascades. It acts as a 
marker to identify control TIL cells  since human T cells normally do not express NGFR.  
 
 
3.3  Interleukin- 2 (Aldesleukin, Proleukin)  
 
Interleukin- 2 (IL-2) will be manufactured and supplied by [CONTACT_242821] 
M.D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial sources. IL-2 is a 133 amino acid- long peptide 
primarily secreted by T- cells in response to various antigenic stimuli.  T he cytokine acts through 
a specific IL- 2 receptor consisting of α , β, γ subunits.  In addition to T -cell proliferation, IL -2 
leads to activation and proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, increasing their tumoricidal 
activity.  Other actions of IL -2 include augmentation of B- cell growth and immunoglobulin 
production, enhancement of interferon (IFN) -γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -β production 
from T -cells, IL -6 production by [CONTACT_51920], modulation of histamine release by [CONTACT_242822], and 
upregulation of  IL-2 receptors.  This triggers the release of various other cytokines leading to the 
total immune/ inflammatory reaction and resultant toxicity.   
 
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294477] been seen with IL -2 (See Appendix  G). 
 3.4  Fludarabine 
 
Fludarabine phosphate is a fluorinated nucleotide analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine, 9 -β-
D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara- A) that is relatively resistant to deamination.   Fludarabine is a 
purine antagonist antimetabolite.  Fludarabine phosphate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_242767] [ADDRESS_294478] 18 months at 2 – 8 degrees C; when reconstituted, 
fludarabine is stable for at least 16 days at room temperature.  Specialized references should be consulted f or specific compatibility information.  Fludarabine is dephosphorylated in serum, 
transported intracellularly and converted to the nucleotide fludarabine triphosphate; this 2- fluoro-
ara-ATP molecule is thought to be required for the drug’s cytotoxic effects.  Fludarabine inhibits 
DNA polymerase, ribnucleotide reductase, DNA primase, and may interfere with chain 
elongation, and RNA and protein synthesis.  
 Fludarabine is administered as an I.V. infusion in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride, USP over 
approximately  15-30 minutes.  At doses of 25 mg/m
2/day for [ADDRESS_294479] cases of severe and 
life-threatening hematologic toxicity.  Hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or  more 
courses of fludarabine with or without a prior history of a positive Coomb’s test; fatal hemolytic anemia has been reported.  In addition, bone marrow fibrosis has been observed after 
fludarabine therapy.  Other common adverse effects include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weakness.  Irreversible and potentially fatal central nervous system toxicity in the form of 
progressive encephalopathy, blindness, and coma is rare at the currently administered doses.  
More common neurologic side effects at the current doses of fludarabine include weakness, 
pain, malaise, fatigue, paresthesia, visual or hearing disturbances, and sleep disorders.  
Adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_83864], dyspnea, and allergic or idiopathic 
interstitial pneumonitis.  Tumor lysis syndrome has been rarely observed in fludarabine 
treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).  
 
3.5  Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)  
 Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic anti -neoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards.  It is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed 
function microsomal oxidase system.  These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321].  The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross- linking 
of tumor cell DNA.   
 
Protocol 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 16 of 39 
 
Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability greater than 
75%.  The unchanged drug has an elimination half -life of 3 to 12 hours.  It is eliminated primarily 
in the form of metabolites, but from 5% to 25% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged 
drug.  Several cytotoxic and noncytotoxic metabolites have been identified in urine and in 
plasma.  Concentrations of metabolites reach a maximum in plasma 2 to 3 hours after an 
intravenous dose.  Plasma protein binding of unchanged drug is low but some metabolites are 
bound to an extent greater than 60%.  It has not been demonstrated than any single metabolite 
is responsible for either the therapeutic or toxic effects of cyclophosphamide.  Although elevated levels of metabolites of cyclophosphamide have been observed in patients with renal failure, 
increased clinical toxicity in such patients has not been demonstrated.  
 Following conversion to active metabolites in the liver, cyclophosphamide functions as an 
alkylating agent and possesses potent immunosuppressive activity.   The serum half -life after 
intravenous administration ranges from 3 to 12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be 
detected in the serum for up to 72 hours  after administration.  
     
Cyclophosphamide will be obtained from commercially available sources by [CONTACT_941] M. D. Anderson 
pharmacy.  It will be diluted in 250 ml NS and infused over  approximately  two hours.  The dose 
will be based on the patient’s body weight, but to prevent undue toxicity, it will not exceed a 
dose greater than 40% of the maximum ideal body weight for drug dosing using MD Anderson 
(MDACC) clinical calculator for Body Surface Area (BSA) and Body Mass Index (BMI). 
Hematologic toxicity occurring with cyclophosphamide usually includes leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia.  Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting may occur, especially after high- doses.  
Diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and mucosal and oral ulceration have been reported in patients.  Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in about 20% of patients; severity can range from microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with bladder fibrosis.  Although the incidence of 
hemorrhagic cystitis associated with cyclophosphamide appears to be lower than that 
assoc iated with ifosfamide, mesna (sodium 2- mercaptoethanesulfonate) has been used 
prophylactically as an uroprotective agent   Mesna may not be effective in all patients.  Patients who receive high dose cyclophosphamide may develop interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can be fatal.  Hyperuricemia due to rapid cellular destruction may occur, particularly in patients with 
hematologic malignancy.  Hyperuricemia may be minimized by [CONTACT_74918], 
alkalinization of the urine, and/or administration of allopurinol.  If allopurinol is administered, 
patients should be watched closely for cyclophosphamide toxicity due to allopurinal induction of 
hepatic microsomal enzymes.  At high doses, cyclophosphamide can also result in a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; hyponatremia with progressive weight gain 
without edema occurs.  Cardiotoxicity has been observed at high doses of cyclophophamide.  
Deaths have occurred from diffuse hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis and from acute 
myopericarditis; in such cases, congestive heart failure may occur within a few days of the first 
dose.  Other consequences of cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity include arrhythmias, potentially irreversible cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis.  Other reported adverse effects of 
cyclo phosphamide include headache, dizziness, and myxedema; faintness, facial flushing, and 
diaphoresis.

3.6  Mesna (Sodium 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate, Mesnum, Mesnex, NSC -113891)  
 
Mesna (sodium 2- mercaptoethanesulphonate; given by [CONTACT_51215]) is a synthetic sulfhydryl 
compound that can chemically interact with urotoxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide (acrolein 
and 4- hydroxycyclophosphamide) to decrease the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic 
cystitis.    
Mesna was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.  Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine, mesna is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_242768], mesna disulfide (dimesna).  Mesna disulfide remains in the intravascular 
compartment and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135284].  In the kidney, the mesna disulfide is 
reduced to the free thiol compound, mesna, which reacts chemically with the urotoxic 
metabolites, resulting in their detoxification.   
 
Mesna will be obtained commercially and is supplied as a 100 mg/ml solution.  Intact ampules 
are stored at room temperature.  Diluted solutions (1 to 20 mg/dl) are physically and chemically 
stable for at least 24 hours under refrigeration.  Mesna is chemically stable at room temperature 
for 48- 72 hours in D5W, 48- 72 hour in D5W/0.45% normal saline, or 24 hours in normal saline.  
It will be diluted up to 20 mg Mesna/ml fluid in D5W or normal saline and will be administered 
intravenously as a continuous  infusion.  Toxicities include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  
 3.7  G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factor)  
 G-CSF may be given in the form of Filgrastim or PEG -Filgrastim at the appropriate doses. The 
side effects of G -CSF are skin rash, myalgia and bone pain, an increase of preexisting 
inflammatory conditions, enlarged spleen with occasional associated low platelet c ounts, 
alopecia (with prolonged use) elevated blood chemistry levels.  
  
3.8 Levofloxacin (Levaquin) and Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole double strength (TMP / 
SMX DS, Bactrim)  
 Levaquin is used to prevent infections caused by [CONTACT_50904].  It is a synthetic  broad spectrum 
antibacterial agent.  The mechanism of action of levofloxacin involves inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase, enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.  
 TMP/SMX DS will be obtained by [CONTACT_941] M.D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial sources.  It will 
be used for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP).  The oral dose is 1 tablet 
PO bid twice a week. Like other sulfa drugs, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole- trimethoprim) can 
cause allergies, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Allergies typi[INVESTIGATOR_74845] a widespread itchy 
red rash with fever eight to fourteen days after beginning the standard dose. Neutropenia, a 
reduction in the number of neutrophils, can also occur.   
 3.9  Acyclovir (Zovirax) and Valacyclovir Hydrochloride (Valtrex)  
 
Acyclovir and Valtrex will be obtained by [CONTACT_941] M. D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial 
sources.   
 
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294480] herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV -1) and 2 
(HSV -2) and varicella- zoster virus (VZV).  The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective 
due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by [CONTACT_242823].  This viral 
enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue.  The 
monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by [CONTACT_242824] a number of cellular enzymes.  Acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of 
herpes viral DNA.  
 
Acyclovir will be used to prevent the occurrence of herpes virus infections.  It is supplied as 
powder for injection in 500 mg vials.  Reconstitute in 10 ml of sterile water for injection for 
bacteriostat ic water for injection to a concentration of 50 mg/ml. Reconstituted solutions should 
be used within 12 hours.  IV solutions should be diluted to a concentration of 7 mg/ml or less 
and infused over 1 hour to avoid renal damage.  Oral tablets of 200 and 800 mg are available, if 
the patient is able to tolerate medication by [CONTACT_1966].  Reversible renal insufficiency has been reported with intravenous but not oral acyclovir.  Neurologic toxicity including delirium, tremors, 
coma, acute psychiatric disturbances, and abnormal EEGs has been reported with higher doses 
of acyclovir.  Should this occur, a dosage adjustment will be made or the drug should be discontinued.  Stomach upset, headache, nausea, rash, hives, diaphoresis, hematuria; 
hypotension, and thrombocytosi s have been reported.  Hair loss from prolonged use has also 
been documented. Acyclovir will not be used concomitantly with other nucleoside analogs that interfere with DNA synthesis, e.g. ganciclovir.  In renal disease, the dose is adjusted as per 
product  labeling.  
 3.10 Fluconazole (Diflucan)  
 
Fluconazole will be obtained by [CONTACT_941] M. D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial sources.  It will be used for prophylaxis against fungal infections.  It is available in 200 mg tablets.  It can cause 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain, and liver damage that may be 
irreversible.  It can cause rashes and itching, which in rare cases has caused Stevens Johnson 
Syndrome. It has several significant drug interactions.  The package insert should be consulted 
prior to prescribing.  For IV administration in patients who cannot tolerate the oral preparation, Fluconazole comes in 2 mg/ml solution for injection, and prepared according to Clinical Center 
Pharmacy standard procedures.  It should be administ ered at a maximum IV rate of 200 mg/hr.  
 
3.11  Ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran)  
 
Ondansetron hydrochloride will be obtained by [CONTACT_941] M. D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial 
sources.  It will be used to control nausea and vomiting during the chemotherapy pr eparative 
regimen.  It can cause headache, dizziness, myalgias, drowsiness, malaise, and weakness.  
Less common side effects include chest pain, hypotension, pruritis, constipation and urinary 
retention.  Consult the package insert for a complete list of side effects and specific dose 
instructions.  
 3.12  Furosemide (Lasix)  
 
Furosemide, a loop diuretic, will be obtained by [CONTACT_941] M. D. Anderson pharmacy from commercial 
sources.  It will be used to enhance urine output during the chemotherapy preparative regimen 
with cyclophosphamide. Adverse effects include dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, weakness,

 6.0 Treatment Plan Turnstile II  
 
6.1  Outline   
 
• 15 patients will be treated (refer to Section 11.0 Statistical Considerations and Data 
Analysis).  Patients will receive a T cells transduced with CXCR2 as well as T cells 
transduced with NGFR  (as a control gene) . 
• T cells will be expanded in a state -of-the-art GMP facility that will allow compliance with 
all FDA regulations regarding investigational cell transfer products.  We have 
demonstrated that we can successfully expand TIL on the majority of patients and have 
treated patients with up to 150 billion TIL.    
• All patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cytoxan and fludarabine to enhance T cell persistence and effectiveness in vivo .  Cytoxan will be administered at 60 
mg/kg/day I.V. in 250 ml NS over  approximately  2 hours on Days – 7 and – 6.  Mesna 60 
mg/kg with D5W or NS at 125 ml/hr infus ed intravenously over 24 hours on Days -7 and 
-6.  The dose will be based on the patient’s body weight, but to prevent undue toxicity , it 
will not exceed a dose greater than 40% of the maximum ideal body weight for drug dosing using MD Anderson (MDACC) clinical calculator for Body Surface Area (BSA) and Body Mass Index (BMI).    Fludarabine will then be infused at 25 mg/m
2 IVPB daily 
over approximately  15-30 minutes on Days – 5 to –1. 
• On day 0, all patients will receive  up to 1.5x1011 T cells (including both CXCR2 and 
NGFR transduced TIL  in one combined infusion) in NS , depending on the number that 
can be generated in the laboratory . It has been previously shown that infusion of cell 
numbers in this range is well tolerated. Depending on the amount of T -cells and the 
volume, TIL  will be infused  as an inpatient by I.V. for maximum infusion time of up to 4 
hours, unless ordered otherwise by [CONTACT_5936].  Tylenol (acetaminophen) will be given by 
[CONTACT_1738] 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 23 of 39 
 
mouth before the T -cell infusion to decrease the risk of these side effects. Twelve (12) to 
sixteen (16) hours after completing the T cell infusion, all patients will receive high dose 
interleukin- 2 (IL-2) on an inpatient basis at the standard dose of 720,000 IU/kg as an 
intravenous bolus over an approximate 15 minute period every 8- 16 hours for up to 15 
doses  on Days 1 to 5, as tolerated.  Doses will be skipped if patients reach Grade III or 
IV toxicity due to high dose IL -2, except for the reversible Grade III toxicities common to 
high dose IL -2 such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, 
mucositis, dysphagia, or constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes (i.e. platelets, creatinine, and total  bilirubin) as detailed in Appendix G.  If the toxicity is easily reversed 
by [CONTACT_242827], then additional doses may be continued.  
• If the patient’s platelet count is less than  80K on Day 21  (-2 days/+7 days) , the second 
course of high dose IL -[ADDRESS_294492] 80K.   The 
second course of IL2 can  be omitted at the discretion of PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or treating physician.   
For the evaluation of peripheral blood cells following T cell transfer, [ADDRESS_294493] and/or excision, within 30 
days of lymphodepletion, and again on Days 6 (+/ - three  days),  and day 2 1(+/- seven  
days)when feasible.  These days were selected based on our previous studies at the 
National Cancer Institute.  During high dose IL -2 administration (Days 1 -5 and 22-26 ), 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) yields are low, possibly due to adhesion of immune cells to vasculature.  Therefore, days 6(+/- three days)and day 21 (+/- seven  
days)have been selected as the earliest feasible time points to obtain cells and evaluate 
the immediate effects of immunization.   Additional time points to obtain PBMC are week 
6(+/- 7 days)  and week 12(+/ - 7 days) . To evaluate T cells at the tumor site, required  
tumor samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_242828] 30 days of lymphodepletion and then 
again at approximately day 21 (+/ - seven days) when feasible.  Additional optional 
biopsies may be done at week 6(+/ - 7 days)  and week 12(+/ - 7 days) . 
• The retrovirus vector is replication- defective, i.e. will not replicate after infection into the 
host cells. No new viral particles will be formed following infection into the TIL. The 
infection will be performed at the early stages of T- cell expansion. Non infecting vector 
will be washed away during the expansion and harvest process.  The TIL for  infusion will 
not contain any retrovirus vector; therefore there will be no danger to the nurses from the 
retrovirus vector. A negative pressure room will not be required; these transduced TIL 
will be administered in the same manner as non -transduced TIL.  
• Feeder cells will be CMV negative if pre -treatment testing of the patient reveals absence 
of CMV seropositivity. If a patient is CMV positive at baseline, CMV positive feeder cells 
may be utilized. Pools of feeder cells from CMV seropositive patients  will be tested by 
[CONTACT_242829]. Those feeder cells 
that have undetectable levels of CMV by [CONTACT_242830]. We will monitor all  patients receiving TIL  with 
serum CMV pcr testing at day 3 (+/ -24 hours) post  TIL infusion and 3 weeks (+/ -7 days) 
after TIL infusion.  CMV pcr blood testing is drawn in a single 10mL purple  top tube. The test will be performed at MDA through the molecular diagnostics lab. If there is evidence 
of CMV reactivation as evidenced by [CONTACT_242831], infectious disease specialist will be 
consulted and further management or therapy will be per expert recommendations.  
• Administration of the lymphodepletion treatment and concomitant medications including  
supporting prophylactic medication will be documented in the medical record but will not 
be captured in the case report form for this protocol.  TIL administration and IL -2 starting 
at Day 0 will be captured in the case r eport form.

• Variations from the lymphodepletion (e.g. infusion times; schedule of treatments, etc) 
prior to day [ADDRESS_294494] but will not be considered protocol violations/deviations.

Treatment:  
 
Day -7 and – 6: 
Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day I.V. in 250 ml NS over approximately  2 hrs.  
Mesna 60 mg/kg with D5W or NS at 125 ml/hr infused intravenously over 24 hours.  
 
Day -5 to Day -1: 
Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IVPB daily over approximately 15- 30 minutes for 5 days.   
 
Day 0:  
Depending on the amount of T-cells and the volume, T- cells will be  infus ed in NS with maximum 
infusion time of up to 4 hours, unless ordered otherwise by [CONTACT_5936].  Tylenol  (acetaminophen) 
will be given by [CONTACT_242832] T- cell infusion to decrease the risk of the side effects.  
 
Days 1- 5:       
High dose IL- 2, 720,000 IU/kg IV bolus (about 15 minutes) every 8- 16 hours for up to 15 doses, 
beginning approximately 12- 16 hours after T cell infusion.  
 
Day 22-26 (- 2 days/ + 7 days) : 
High dose IL- 2, 720,000 IU/kg IV bolus (about 15 minutes) every 8- 16 hours for up to 15 doses.  
If platelet count is greater or equal to 80K.  
 
6.2     Prophylaxes  
 
6.2.1  Infection Prevention and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis  
 
Patients will receive Levaquin at 500 mg daily until ANC recovers to greater than 500/mm 3 and 
the fixed combination of trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as double strength (DS) tablet [ DS tabs = TMP 160 mg/tab and SMX 800 mg/tab ] p.o. b.i.d. twice a week.  TMP/SMX -DS will be taken by [CONTACT_242833] -[ADDRESS_294498] chemotherapy.   For patients with sulfa allergies, Pentamidine will be given (once 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 300 mg IV every 21 days for six months after lymphodepletion.  If 
IV Pentamidine is not feasible after discharge, Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP) 
prophylaxis can be substituted with oral antimicrobials such as Atovaquone as per standard of care for 6 months after lymphodepletion. 
 
 
 
6.2.2    Herpes Virus Prophylaxis  
 
At the time of the T cell infusion, patients will be administered valtrex 500 mg p.o. daily for 6 months if the patient is able to take oral medications.  If the patient needs intravenous 
medications give acyclovir 5 mg/kg IVPB every 8 hours, which is continued until absolute 
neutrophil count is greater than 1000/ml.  Reversible renal insufficiency has been reported with IV administered acyclovir but not with oral acyclovir.  Neurologic toxicity including delirium, 
tremors, coma, acute psychiatric disturbances, and abnormal EEGs has been reported with 
higher doses of acyclovir.  If symptoms occur, a dosage adjustment will be made or the drug will 
be discontinued.  Acyclovir will not be used concomitantly with other nucleoside analogs (e.g. 
Protocol 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 27 of 39 
 
ganciclovir), whic h interfere with DNA synthesis.  In patients with renal disease, the dose is 
adjusted as per product labeling.  Valtrex /Acyclovir is to be continued for 6 months after 
lymphodepletion.  
 
6.2.3     Fungal Prophylaxis  
 
Patients will begin Fluconazole 200 mg p.o. daily with the T cell infusion (Day 0) and continue 
for 6 months  after lymphodepletion. 
 
6.2.4   Ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran)  
It will be used to control nausea and vomiting during the chemotherapy preparative regimen.  It can cause headache, dizziness, myalgias, drowsiness, malaise, and weakness.  Less common 
side effects include chest pain, hypotension, pruritis, constipation and urinary retention.  Consult the package insert for a complete list of side effects and specific dose instructions.  
 6.2.5  Furosemide (Lasix)  
It will be used to enhance urine output during the chemotherapy preparative regimen with cyclophosphamide. Adverse effects include dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, weakness, orthostatic hypotension, photosensitivity, rash and pruritis.  Consult the package insert for a 
complete list of side effects and specific dose instructions.  
 6.2.[ADDRESS_294499] or 4th generation cephalsosporin or 
a quinolone for fevers ≥38.5 C with an ANC less than 500/mm
3.  Aminoglycosides should be 
avoided unless clear evidence of sepsis. Infectious disease consultation will be obtained from all patients with unexplained fever or any infectious complications.  
 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_294500] Support  
 
In order to reduce neutropenia following chemotherapy and T cell infusion, G -CSF will be given 
at 5 μg/kg/day daily subcutaneously until neutrophil counts reach > 500/mm
3 Using daily CBC’s 
as a guide, the patient will also receive platelets and packed red blood cells (PRBC’s) as needed.  Attempts will be made to keep Hb >8.0 gm/dl, and platelets >20,000/ml.    Leukocyte 
filters will be utilized for all blood and platelet transfusions to decrease sensitization to 
transfused WBC’s and decrease the risk of CMV infection.   Irradiated blood and blood products 
should be used.  
 
7.0    Evaluation During Study  
 
• Before the treatment starts and at each visit, the patient will be asked  to complete two 
quality of life questionnaires.  It should take about 15 minutes to complete the questionnaires.  
 
• During the preparative regimen and high dose IL- [ADDRESS_294501] a 
complete blood count (CBC) and electrolytes every 1 to 2 days of treatment.  Patients 
will be monitored with vital signs at baseline, every 15 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes ) during 
cell infusion  and after cell infusion hourly  (+/- 30 minutes)  for 4 hours after the infusion.   
Protocol 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 28 of 39 
 
• Phlebotomy will be performed prior to tumor harvest and/or excision, or within 30 days of 
lymphodeplet ion, and again on Day 6 (+/ - three days ) and day 21 (+/- seven days ) after 
the cell infusion when feasible, and again at 6 week (+/ - 7 days) and 12 week ( +/- 7 
days) after the cell infusion when feasible. These blood samples will be used to evaluate 
T cell persistence and function, using a variety of assays. To assess the secondary  
endpoint of T cell migration to the tumor, required  tumor samples will be obtained within 
30 days of lymphodepletion and then again at approximately day 21 (+/-7 days). Optional 
biopsies may be obtained at 6 weeks (+/ - 7 days) and 12 weeks (+/ - 7 days).   
•  The presence of CD4+ T- cells at the tumor site will also be evaluated.  Patients” blood 
samples will be obtained and undergo analysis for detection of RCR by [CONTACT_242834] [ADDRESS_294502] the GaLV 
envelop gene and are performed by [CONTACT_242835], Indiana University.  Blood samples will be archived annually 
thereafter 10 years if all previous testing has been negative with a brief clinical history.  If 
patients die or develop neoplasms during this trial, efforts will be made to assay a biopsy 
sample for RCR.  If any pos t-treatment samples are positive, further analysis of the RCR 
and more extensive patient follow -up will be undertaken, in consultation with CBER.  The 
results of these tests are maintained by [CONTACT_242836] A nderson Cancer Center research team.   
• Complete evaluation of evaluable lesions with physical examination and appropriate CT scans or PET/CT will be performed approximately at 6 weeks (+/ - 7 days) and at 12 
weeks (+/ - 7 days) after the cell infusion, at which time patient will be restaged. 
• After [ADDRESS_294503] of Care and follow- up visit tests and scans will be physician dependent.  
• Tumor measurements will not be required for patients who have progression of disease.  
• If patients are unable to return for follow -up visits, the patients will be followed for 
survival via phone or clinic visit approximately every [ADDRESS_294504] -to follow -up 
or the study is completed.  
• At the time of the patient’s death, no matter the cause, we may request permission for an autopsy in order to obtain vital information concerning the safety of this experimental 
therapy approach.  
 
• W e will send the patient  two questionnaires (FACT -G, FACT -Melanoma)(Appendix  D, E) 
yearly to get information regarding their quality of life for [ADDRESS_294505] stable disease or a partial response to treatment, they may be re- treated after 
re-evaluation with the same schedule that they had been given safely previously [less than 
Grade III (except for common high dose IL- 2 toxicities noted in Appendix ) or Grade IV toxicity 
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294506] measures].  Re- treatment benefits and risks will be carefully 
explained.  A maximum of 1 re -treatment course may be given for each patient. 
 
8.0 Evaluation of Toxicity 
 
This study will utilize the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for 
Adverse Events version 4.[ADDRESS_294507] access to 
a copy of the CTC AE version 4.0.  
 
Careful evaluation to ascertain the toxicity, immunologic effects and anti -tumor efficacy of cell 
infusions will be performed.  Toxicities will be monitored and documented on a daily basis beginning at  day 0 (T- cell infusion) and continuing until discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242774] -2 infusion.  The criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_242775]:  
 
1. A Grade IV non -hematologic  toxicity not explained by [CONTACT_8668]- [ADDRESS_294508] Manager in the IND Office.   The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_242776].  Whenever a 
trend is identified, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_242777].   The 
investigator or  physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects 
enrolled on the trial.   
The use of the nonmyeloablative regimen in this protocol is a major procedure which entails 
serious discomforts and hazards for the patient.  Although it is anticipated that this protocol is 
relatively safe because of the expected recovery of the patients’ bone marrow within 2 to 4 
weeks, fatal complications are possible.  It is therefore only appropriate to carry out this 
experimental procedure in the context of life threatening metastatic cancer.  The major hazards are infection and disease progression.  The major discomforts are nausea, mucositis, anorexia, 
diarrhea, fever and malaise.  Side effects of common drugs used in this nonmyeloablative 
regimen include:  
 Cyclophosphamide:  Marrow suppression, nausea, mucositis, rash, hemorrhagic cystitis, 
myocardial damage, alopecia, infertility, nausea and vomiting, SIADH.  
  Fludarabine:  Myelosuppression, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, 
anorexia, weakness, neurologic toxicity, and interstitial pneumonitis.  Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine.  
 
Antim icrobials in general:  Allergic reactions, renal impairment, nausea, vomiting, hepatic 
damage, marrow suppression.  
 
Protocol 2009-0471

9.0 Criteria for Response 
Tumor response to therapy in this study will be done using immune -related response criteria 
(irRC)  which is a modified version of WHO criteria.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_294510] one diameter > [ADDRESS_294511] diameter with its perpendicular.  Skin lesions 
can be considered measurable.  Cutaneous lesions that are > 5 mm in diameter 
can be considered measurable. 
 
Non-Measurable (evaluable) Lesions are all other lesions, includi ng 
unidimensionally measurable disease and small lesions.  
 
Definition of Index/Non -Index Lesions  
 
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and ten 
lesions in total, should be identified as index  lesions to be measured and 
recorded on the medical record at baseline.  The index  lesions should be 
representative of all involved organs.  In addition, index  lesions should be 
selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment  by [CONTACT_15218], and how representative 
they are of the patient’s tumor burden.  A sum of the products of diameters (SPD) for all index  lesions will be calculated and considered the baseline sum of the 
products of diameters.  Response criteria to be followed are listed below.  The 
baseline sum will be used as the reference point to determine the objective tumor response of the index  lesions at tumor assessment (TA).  Measurable lesions, 
other than index  and all sites of non- measurable disease will be identified as 
non-index  lesions.  Non -index  lesions will be recorded on the medical record and 
should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as the index  lesions.  In 
subsequent assessments, non -index  lesions will be recorded as “stable or 
decreased disease,” “absent”, or “progression.” 
 
9.2  Definition of Tumor Response Using irRC  
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assessment using the immune -
related response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporates the contribution of new measurable lesions.  Each net Percentage Change in Tumor 
Burden per assessment using irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth 
kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
 
Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
  
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index  lesions.  
This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_242837]. 
 
irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in 
the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index  
Protocol 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 34 of 39 
 
and all new measurable lesions (i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden).  
Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is  factored into the overall 
tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the 
SPD increases by > 25% when compared to SPD at nadir.  
 irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence 
of progressive disease.  
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  At least 25% increase Percentage Change in 
Tumor Burden (i.e., taking sum of the products of all index  lesions and any new 
lesions) when compared to SPD at nadir.  
 
Definition of Non- Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
 
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non-index  lesions.  
This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_242838] (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD): non-index  lesions are not 
cons idered in the definition of PR, these terms do not apply. 
irProgressive Disease (irPD):  Increases in number or size of non- index  lesions 
does not constitute progressive disease unless/until the Percentage Change in Tumor Burden increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir of the index lesions 
increases by [CONTACT_242839]).  
 
Impact of New Lesions on irRC  
New lesions in and by [CONTACT_242840].  However, their contribution to total tumor burden in included in the SPD which in 
turn feeds into the irRC criteria for tumor response.  Therefore, new non-
measurable lesions will not discontinue any subject from the study.  
 
9.3  Definition of Overall Response Using irRC  
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria:  
 Immune- Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all 
tumor lesions (index and non- index together with no new 
measurable/unmeasurable lesions) for at least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of complete response.  
 Immune- Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two 
largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as 
the SPD baseline.  At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the 
products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of 
new measurable lesions are added together to provide the Immune Response 
Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD).  A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is considered an 
immune Partial Response (irPR).  
 
Protocol 2009-0471 
September 6, 2017 
Page 35 of 39 
 
Immune- Related Stable Disease (irSD):  irSD is  defined as the failure to meet 
criteria for immune complete response or immune partial response, in the 
absence of progressive disease.  
Immune- Related Progressive Disease (irPD): It is recommended in difficult 
cases to confirm PD by [CONTACT_242841].  Any of the following will constitute progressive disease:  
• At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions over 
baseline SPD calculated for the index lesions. 
• At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions and new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD c alculated for the 
index lesion.

9.[ADDRESS_294512] Overall Response Using irRC (irBOR)  
irBOR is the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study as a whole, 
recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone 
lesions) for the individual subjects in the study.  For assessment of irBOR, all 
available assessments per subject are considered.  
 
If a lesion is surgically resected or treated with definitive radiosurgery, the size of the lesion prior to the definitive local therapy will be included in the calculated 
irBOR.  
 10.0  Criteria for Removal from the Study  
 
Patients will be taken off the study if:  (a) the patient voluntarily withdraws, (b) there is significant 
noncompliance, or (c) there is progression of disease in those patients after being treated by 
[CONTACT_1738] 2009-0471

lymphodepletion, T -cell infusion, and IL- 2 in Turnstile  II.  Any patient who develops Grade IV 
toxicity due to cell infusion will be taken off protocol.   
 
11.0  Statistical Considerations and Data Analysis  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_242780]2 and NGFR transduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for treatment of metastatic 
melanoma.  A total of [ADDRESS_294513] not been 
able to reach the nominal dose level 2 due to the inherent variability in quantities of T cells able 
to be generat ed for  individual patients. Thus, this trial is being redesigned as  a feasibility study 
with the primary objectives to assess the feasibility of generating TILs  and safety of   and  
treating patients with genetically modified T cells.   
 
Secondary objectives include  response, defined following immune- related response criteria.  
Immunological endpoints include number of CXCR2 transduced cells and number of NGFR 
transduced cells at infusion, number of CXCR2 transduced cells and number of NGFR 
transduced cells based on tumor biopsy, and the amounts of CXCR2 and CXCL8 cytokines.  
Regression analysis will be used to estimate the ability of the genetically transduced T -cells to 
differentially recognize the cancer cell cytokines. Logistic regression will be used to assess the 
effects of  immunological variables on the probability of clinical response.  A sample size of 15  
patients was determined primarily by [CONTACT_242842].  
 
12.0 Statistical Considerations. A clinical response/safety summary will be submit ted to the 
IND medical monitor after the first five participants are treated and every five thereafter . 
 
12.1 Outcomes.   The primary clinical endpoint will be response, defined following immune -
related response criteria as a 50% or greater decrease in the tumor’s linear dimension post 
treatment, compared to baseline, evaluated  by [CONTACT_242843] 6, week 12 and then 
every 3 month intervals for up to one year of follow up.  
 
 Immunological endpoints will include (i) at infusion, Xc = number of CXCR2 transduced cells 
and Xs = number of NGFR transduced (control) cells, (ii) post treatment, based on tumor 
biopsy, Yc = number of CXCR2 transduced cells and Ys = number of NGFR transduced cells, 
and (iii) post treatment, Z
CXCR2   = amount of CXCR2 cytokine and Z CXCR8   = amount of  CXCL8 
(IL-8) cytokine.   
  
12.2.  Estimation of Immunological Effects. Denote the pre -treatment and post -treatment 
ratios by R
X = Xc/Xs  and R Y = Yc/Ys.  In order to test the hypothesis that the CXCR2 cells are 
more likely to find the tumor than the NGFR (control) cells, the linear regression model R Y = b 0 + 
b1 RX + error will be fit to the (R X , RY) pairs and the hypothesis H 0: b1 = [ADDRESS_294514] 
the alternative H A: b1 > 1. [1]  The alternative H A says that the CXCR2 cells are more likely to 
enter and be present in the tumor than the control cells.  This is a statistical version of the 
intuitive idea that, if the TIL methodology works as designed and the genetically transduced T -
Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_294515] - and pre- treatment 
ratios RR = R Y/RX should be larger than 1.  
 
12.3.  Estimation of Clinical Response Rate.  Additional regression analyses will include 
logistic regression to assess the effects of Yc,  R Y and RR on the probability of clinical 
response, as well as regression f its of  Z CXCR2   and Z CXCR8 as functions of Yc,  R Y and RR.   
 12.4.  Sample Size.  A total of 15 patients will be treated as determined primarily by [CONTACT_242844] .  
 13.0  Data Entry and Protocol Management  
 For the purposes of this study at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Protocol Data Management System (PDMS) will be employed.  All patients will be registered in CORe utilizing 
a two -turnstile registration before any study specific tests a re performed. The continual 
reassessment method (CRM) used in phase I will be implemented using the Biostatistics 
Department Clinical Trial Conduct Website.

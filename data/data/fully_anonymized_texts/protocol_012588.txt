muscle protein. The composition is protected by [CONTACT_673577] a 
specially formulated m ixture of essential amino acids (EAAs) and whey protein .  The overriding 
metabolic goal of the composition is to maximally stimulate the rate of net muscle protein 
synthesis. The stimulation of protein synthesis is the metabolic basis for increases in musc ular 
strength and function, and is crucial for increased biogenesis of mitochondria.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_910397] composition is protected by [CONTACT_673578]. It contains a combination of 
ingredients designed to stimulate muscle protein synth esis and to ultimately induce long -term 
improvements in muscle function and size.  
Muscle Protein Synthesis: EAAs are the key to rapid recovery of muscle. EAAs are the “active” 
components of dietary protein, meaning that they are the amino acids contained i n dietary 
protein that actually stimulate the production of new muscle protein. In fact, EAAs are the only 
dietary macronutrients that are required for survival. They are “essential” because the body 
cannot produce them. There are 9 dietary EAAs. There are  11 more dietary non -essential 
amino acids that are not required in the diet because they can be produced in the body. The 
composition is based on a blend of 8 of the 9 EAAs. In addition to being the “active” 
components of dietary protein, EAAs also have t he advantage over intact protein because free 
EAAs are absorbed from the intestine more quickly and more completely than amino acids 
contained in protein, which require digestion before absorption. Finally, the relative amounts of 
each EAA can be tailored for any specific metabolic function. In the case of the composition to 
be tested, the EAA formulation is designed to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in 
healthy individuals under the age of [ADDRESS_910398] Protein: Intact proteins are popular diet ary supplements to stimulate muscle protein 
synthesis. While EAAs have a distinct advantage over intact protein in terms of the amount of 
muscle protein produced following exercise, the response to intact protein is sustained over a 
longer time than free E AAs because of the slower absorption. The composition combines the

protein cause an immediate increase in muscle protein synthesis (due to the EAAs), and the 
respons e is sustained by [CONTACT_673579].  
 
1.[ADDRESS_910400] effectively stimulated by 
[CONTACT_673580]. The response of protein synthesis following EAAs is more than twice as large as a 
comparable dosage of whey protein (1). Oral ingestion of 2 x 6 g doses of EAAs, taken one 
hour apart after exer cise, induces a greater response of muscle protein turnover than any 
other nutritional strategy (2). The magnitude of response to EAAs after exercise is dose 
dependent. The anabolic response to 6 g of EAAs was twice that of the response to 3 g (2,3). 
Addit ion of non -essential amino acids to EAAs provides no extra benefit in terms of muscle 
protein synthesis (4,5).  
We assert that the optimal profile of EAAs for young, healthy subjects differs from that for 
elderly individuals. In contrast to the case for old er individuals, there is no requirement for a 
disproportionate amount of leucine above and beyond to fulfil its requirement as a precursor 
from protein synthesis. Whereas a disproportionately large dose of dietary leucine relative to 
the other EAAs amplifi es the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in metabolically -
challenged circumstances such as aging (6), a large dose of leucine is not necessary in 
younger individuals. A large dose of leucine activates mTOR and other factors that are 
involved at the m olecular level in regulating the rate of muscle protein synthesis (7). While this 
action of leucine is helpful when the activity of mTOR and associated factors are blunted, such 
as occurs in aging. However, mTOR activity is not rate -limiting in young, heal thy individuals. 
Therefore, a high proportion of leucine in the composition would be redundant in terms of 
activation of mTOR. By [CONTACT_673581], the profile of the 
EAAs in the composition more closely reflects the pr ofile of EAAs in muscle protein. This is 
advantageous since the limiting step in muscle protein synthesis in healthy young individuals is 
the availability of EAA precursors in proportion to the profile of EAAs in muscle protein (8).

The rapid peak response in plasma EAAs is a key reason for their effectiveness (10). On the 
other hand, the total duration of the response is limited, because just as the concentrations of 
EAAs in the blood rise rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], they fall rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673571] (2). For this reason, the composition 
contains protein in addition to the EAAs to prolong the anabolic response in the recovery 
period.  
EAAs are the “active” components of dietary protein that are primarily responsible fo r the 
stimulation of protein synthesis. N on-essential amino acids (N EAAs ) are not required in the 
short term. This is because the NEAAs are normally produced in the body at fast enough rates 
to avoid deficiencies. On the other hand, studies performed in li vestock suggest that maximal 
long-term animal growth and development is achieved with a balance of about 20 -30%% 
NEAAs and 70 - 80%EAAs (11). The addition of a small amount of intact protein to a mixture of 
EAAs is the most efficient way to incorporate the appropriate amount of NEAAs into a dietary 
supplement designed to stimulate muscle protein synthesis over the long -term. A number of 
studies have determined that whey protein is the most effective intact dietary protein in terms 
of stimulation of muscle pr otein synthesis after exercise (12,13). Whey protein is approximately 
50% EAAs and 50% NEAAs. By [CONTACT_106814] a small amount of whey protein with EAAs, the 
necessary intake of NEAAs is provided in a format (I,e,. intact protein) that, while not as 
effective a s the EAA mixture, nonetheless has its own stimulatory effect on muscle protein 
synthesis. The combination of free EAAs and intact protein give an immediate response (from 
the free EAAs) which is prolonged over time by [CONTACT_673582].  
The idea of combining a specific formulation of EAAs with an intact protein to obtain both an 
immediate as well as a more sustained response of protein synthesis is novel. Previous 
studies have added leucine to whey protein, but the inventor’s labor atory found this approach 
to not be effective (14). If only leucine is added to intact protein, an imbalance in the availability 
of the other EAAs is created that limits precursor availability for protein synthesis. The same 
limitation is true in the case of providing only branched chain amino acids. A unique aspect of

 the composition to be investigated is that a balanced mixture of all the EAAs is added to the 
whey protein source. With this approach, the rapid response of muscle protein synthesis to the 
free EAAs is sustained by [CONTACT_673583].  The 
unique combination of whey protein and a specially formulated EAA mixture that coincides with 
the proportionate demand for precursors for stimulated muscle protein s ynthesis provides a 
rapid and sustained response.  
The stimulation of both the number and function of the mitochondria is central to improved 
functional capacity of muscle. The EAA leucine in the composition acts as a nutraceutical to 
stimulate mitochondria  biogenesis (15), and the free amino acids and protein stimulate the 
synthesis of new mitochondrial proteins (16). Therefore, the combination of free EAAs 
increases the ability of the muscle mitochondria to produce energy.  
 
2.0 Hypothesi s 
 
We propose that consumption of the EAA/protein composition will stimulate the net gain (net 
protein synthesis) of body protein in a dose -dependent manner. We further propose that the 
magnitude of increase in net protein synthesis will be greater than induced by [CONTACT_673584], which is currently the most popular supplement on 
the market targeting the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis.  
 
3.0 Study  Design  and Procedures  
 
We will study a total of up to 20 healthy male and females between 18 and 50 years of age. 
We will use a randomized, two -period , stable isotope (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Tewksbury, 
Mass.) infusion study: 4.[ADDRESS_910402] -meal period (total 8 .5-h 
time period). The principal end -point will be the total anabolic response (whole body protein 
synthesis minus breakdown) and the secondary end point will be muscle protein fractional 
synthetic rate ( FSR) over the [ADDRESS_910403] of an essential amino acid/protein composition on protein metabolism.

subjects will be enrolled into Arm 2 – the single stable isotope arm, using the specific consent 
form.  
 
3.1 Study Visits  
Visit 1: subjects will come to the UAMS IOA 3rd floor for informed consent discussi on. Once 
consent is obtained, subsequent study procedures will be performed. A medical history  
including allergies  and list of current medications will be obtained (printed from Epic if they are 
a UAMS patient). Subject height and  weight will be measured. A blood sample will be drawn 
for complete blood count [CBC] . Females of child bearing capacity will be asked to provide a 
urine sample for pregnancy testing. Blood and urine samples will be sent to LabCorp for the 
screening tests. A physical exam and vital  signs will be performed at this visit or at visit 2. A 
DEXA scan for whole -body analysis will be performed in the PI’s lab at UAMS  (or at visit 2) . 
Subjects can get a copy of their CBC and DEXA scan upon request. Any abnormal findings will 
be discussed with them by [CONTACT_673585]/or physician. Based upon the results of the 
screening blood sample, visit 2 will be scheduled.  
 
Visit 2: Subjects return to the UAMS IOA  having fasted overnight from 10:[ADDRESS_910406] visit. If not performed at visit 1, the physical exam  
and/or DEXA scan  will be performed at this visit. For subjects who enrolled into  the dou ble 
infusion arm, r andomization will be performed as to the order of supplement  dose  ingestion . 
After vital signs are measured, the study nurse will insert an IV catheter into a vein on each of 
the subjects’ arms. One catheter is used to infuse the stable isotopes L -ring-D5 phenylalanine 
and 2H2 -tyrosine. The other is to allow for periodic  blood sampling , warming the arm by [CONTACT_673586]/protein composition on protein metabolism.

will undergo 1 DEXA scan.  
 
5.3 Muscle samples : 
Briefly, the risks related to the biopsy procedure include pain, bleeding, bruising, small scar 
formation at the biopsy site, Infection, and vaso -vagal response. Muscle biopsies are 
performed by a physician utilizing local anesthesia (using 1% plain Iidocaine) for pain 
management and strict steri le procedures. Subjects must meet platelet criteria prior to biopsy.  
See appendices for SOP and related documents.  
 
5.4 Study supplements : 
The test composition will be provided by [CONTACT_348215], LLC. It consists of a proprietary blend of 
eight essential amino a cids and whey protein . It is produced by [CONTACT_673588], Inc, Carol Stream, Il.  
This product is not currently  commercially available.  All components of the composition have 
been ruled as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) by [CONTACT_1622]. They are natural component s 
of the normal diet. Prinova, Inc, has all necessary certifications for making products for human 
consumption. Two doses of the product will be tested ( approximately 6.3 and 12.6 g of active 
components).  The product come s as powder and will be dissolved in w ater (8 -16 oz) for 
consumption.   
The whey protein is olate is  available commercially.  The dosage (12.6  g) will be dissolved in 
water (12 oz) . There are no known risks of adverse effects of either the test composition  or the 
whey protein in the dosage s used in this study.   All components ar e Generally Regarded as 
Safe by [CONTACT_1622], and Prinova Inc has all the necessary certifications for producing and

5.6 Stable Isotope Infusion:  
Briefly, the risk related to th e isotope infusion is pyrogenic response. All isotope infusions are  
compounded and  prepared by a licensed pharmacist at UAMS. An SOP for infusion 
procedures will be utilized (see Appendix). All stable isotopes are tested for sterility and 
pyrogenicity. The  stable isotopes will be filtered during infusion through a sterile 0.22 micron 
(Millipore) filter placed in the infusion line.  Stable isotopes are naturally occurring compounds 
and are not radioactive and are already present in the body in varying amount s. The infusion 
will be in a 'tracer' dose, i.e., a dose only detectable by [CONTACT_134294].  Infusion of these molecules 
will increase the level of naturally occurring isotopes by 7 -10%. Any adverse reactions during 
the isotope infusion that suggest infection (urtic aria, flushing, nausea, vomiting, sweating, 
chills, altered heart rate, hypo/hypertension, and hyperthermia) will be promptly addressed by 
[CONTACT_5989]. Depending on the seriousness of the reaction, the infusion study will be 
terminated.

7.[ADDRESS_910413] of two different nutritional 
beverages  on total anabolic response (TAR) and muscle protein synthesis (MPS). To this end, 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be employed to compare th e protein sources 
with respect to mean response (either TAR or MPS) after adjusting for basal measures. If a 
significant protein group effect is detected, then pairwise comparisons will be performed to 
determine if the two sources or two doses differ. In t his case, the Tukey -Kramer method will be 
used to adjust for multiple comparisons. A 5% will be used to determine statistical significance.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Calculation & Power Analysis  
A total of N= [ADDRESS_910414] 80% power to detect 
effect sizes of f = 0.484 or larger (Table 1). This 
estimate assumes the basal covariate explains 
50% of the variation in the response and a 5% α -
level is used to determine statistical  significance. 
(Note that the effect size, f, is simply the ratio of the variation between the three group means 
and the between -subject variation). In the event the effect of the covariate is mis -specified, the 
following table presents effect sizes that c an be detected as the magnitude of variation 
explained by [CONTACT_673589] 10% to 90%.

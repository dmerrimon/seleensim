 DOCUMENT HISTORY  
Version  Date  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
1.0 26Jul2021  n/a Initial protocol  
2.0 19Aug2021  Added  clinical relevance  endpoint 
(lower bound of the two-sided 95% 
CI for the seroresponse rate in adults 
≥[ADDRESS_383471] be ≥60% ). Omitted from initial protocol 
inadvertently.  
3.0 17Sep2021  Changed primary  immunogenicity 
objective to demonstrate superiority 
to placebo from inferiority to EBSI -
CV-317-004. Added preliminary 
group unblinded immunogenicity 
analysis . Change in PXVX0317 program strategy 
and allowing for earlier regulatory  
interactions prior to final database lock.  
4.0 25Jan 2022  Removed intra articular  steroids from 
exclusion criteria 7  
Added labelling informatio n in 
section 5.1.3  
Updated Adverse Event collection to 
begin at Day 1  
Rearranged Immunogenicity 
endpoints  
Reasons for allowing rescreening 
were expanded  Intraarticular  steroids were erroneously 
mentioned as allowed in earlier versions 
of the protocol.  
Section 5.1.3 was modif ied to better 
align with ICH E6(R2) GCP  and 
Emergent’s  updated protocol template.  
Adverse event collection was  updated 
per FDA request  that any event that 
begins prior to first vaccine 
administration be reported as medical 
history . 
Immunogenicity endpoints were 
reprioritized  per EMA Scientific Advi ce. 
Rescreening was aligned with EBSI -CV-
317-[ADDRESS_383472] 
positive for COVID -19. Clarified 
definition of MAAE.  Addition of exploratory o bjective and 
endpoint to the protocol per EMA 
Scientific Advice.   
Reasons for delay of vaccination were  
updated to clarify that vaccination of 
potential participants  with evidence of 
active SARS -CoV -2 virus  infection 
should be delayed (or not enrolled) to 
reduce the risk of confounding safety 
and immune response data.  
MAAE definition was clarified  to ensure 
consistent reporting of events , as 
intended  for this clinical study.  
6.[ADDRESS_383473] 
been updated  and reorganized  and 
GMT analysis was removed from 
hierarchical testing .  
  and EMA definition 
of seroresponse rate as the 
presumptive seroprotection rate.  Simplification for global use of the 
protocol  and t o align with FDA and 
EMA feedback received 26Jul2022 and 
25Jan2023, respectively.

Reasons for Delay of Study V accination : 
i. Any fever (oral temperature ≥100.4 °F [≥38 .0°C]) within 24 hours of planned study 
vaccination.  
ii. Any condition that may interfere with as sessment of reactogenicity and/or other  
safety asses sments . 
iii. Signs and /or symptoms of an acute infectious illness . 
iv. Participants  should not be randomized  if they have tested positive for COVID -19 
(using any type of test , even if asymptomatic)  for [ADDRESS_383478]  result  eg, PCR.  
If any one of these occur at the time of the  scheduled study vaccination , randomization is 
permitted later, if within the screening window (30 days ), at the discretion of the 
investigator and after consultation with the MM. If randomization  and v accination  cannot 
occur within the  allowed  screening window, rescreening will be  required.

the percentage of participants who achieve a n anti -CHIK V SNA . See Section 
9.6.2  for immunogenicity analysis details and Section 9.4 for success criteria and 
multiplicity controls . 
Safety  Endpoints : 
• Incidence of solicited  adverse events (AEs) through Day 8  for PXVX0317 and 
placebo.  
• Incidence of unsolicited AEs through Day 29  for PXVX0317 and placebo.  
• Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended adverse events 
(MAAEs;  medically attended visits include hosp ital, emergency room [ER], urgent 
care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel),  and adverse events of 
special interest (AESI; new onset or worsening arthralgia that is medically attended) 
through Day 183  for PXVX0317 and placebo . 
Secondary Immunogenicity  Endpoints : 
• Key Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: Difference in anti -CHIKV SNA 
seroresponse rate (PXVX0317 minus placebo) with associated 95% CIs at Day 15  
and Day 183, in that order (see Section 9.6.2 ). 
• Anti-CHIKV SNA GMTs by [CONTACT_311533] 95% CIs at Day 15 and Day 
183.  
• Geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) from Day 1 to subsequent collection time 
points.  
• Number and percentage of participants  with an anti -CHIKV SNA titer ≥15 and 
4-fold rise over baseline.  
Exploratory Immuno genicity Endpoint:  
• Geometric mean titers  and associated two -sided 95% CIs for neutralizing antibodies 
against various  CHIKV genotypes measured at Day 22 (and at baseline if necessary) 
for a subset of participants  in the PXVX 0317 group . 
Procedures and Assessments:   
Study procedures/assessments will occur at: Screening (Visit 1), to occur no more than 30 
days prior to Day 1 of IP administration; Day 1 (Visit 2, Baseline, Randomization, and IP 
Administration); Day 15 (Visit 3); Day 22 (Visit 4); Day 29 (Visit 5, teleph one contact); 
Day 92 (Visit 6, telephone contact); Day 183 (Visit 7, End of Study) or Early 
Discontinuation Visit  (EDV) . The per -participant  estimated total study duration is 212 
days (includes the 30-day screening window ).  
Solicited AEs (collected from D ay 1 through Day 8) will consist of local adverse reactions 
(injection site pain, redness , and swelling) and systemic adverse reactions (fever, chills, 
fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia , and nausea). Unsolicited  AEs will be collected from 

PXVX0317

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 11 of 78 
 
 Day 1 throug h Day 29. S erious adverse event s, MAAEs , and AESI  will be collected from 
Day 1 through Day 183 End of Study Visit.   
The immune response to PXVX0317 will be measured by [CONTACT_311534] 
182 days after dosing (Day 183). CHIKV  SNA levels will be measured by a validated 
CHIKV luciferase -based assay ( hereafter referred to as human SNA assay) developed by 
[CONTACT_456]  (see Section 7 for human SNA assay description) . 
Statistical Methods : 
Seroresponse rates : Proportions (percentages) of participant s in PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups with a seroresponse at Day 15, Day 22, and Day 183 will be summarized with 
two-sided 95% CIs based on the Wilson score method.  This analysis will be primarily 
based in the immunogenicity evaluable population  (IEP) and repeated for the modified 
intent -to-treat (mITT) population as a measure of the robustness of the findings . The 
significance of the treatment group dif ference will be assessed using chi -square test s at 
each visit  based on both age groups combined  with a  two-sided  alpha=0.05.  
The difference in CHIKV  SNA seroresponse rates ( PXVX0317  minus placebo ) among 
baseline seronegative participant s will be calculated  along with the two-sided 95% CI for 
the difference based on the Newcombe hybrid score method  at Day 15, Day 22, and Day 
183. At Day 22, t he lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
seroresponse rates ( PXVX0317  minus placebo ) for both age strata combined must meet or  
exceed  for clinical relevance  to be demonstrated.  
Geometric mean titers : Geometric mean titers  will be derived from a linear analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with log 10-transformed CHIKV SNA titers as the de pendent 
variable and treatment group and study site as fixed effect s. The adjusted least square 
means and their two-sided 95% CIs calculated based on the ANOVA model will be back 
transformed and reported as the PXVX0317 and placebo group GMT values at Day 15, 
Day 22, and Day 183.  Significance testing  will be carried out at a two -sided significance 
level of 0.05  using both age strata combined . 
Geometric mean fold increase : Geometric mean fold increase  in CHIKV SNA titers  from 
Day 1 to Day 15, Day 22, and Day  183 will be reported for PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups . 
Four -fold rise over baseline in CHIKV  SNA titer : Proportions (percentages) of participant s 
in PXVX0317 and placebo groups with a CHIKV  SNA titer of at least 4 -fold rise over 
baseline at Day 15, Day 22,  and Day 183 will be summarized with two -sided 95% CIs 
based on the Wilson score method.  
Safety endpoints : The safety of PXVX0317 in adults ≥65 years of age will be evaluated 
using solicited AEs occurring from IP administration on Day 1 until Day 8 , unsoli cited 
AEs through Day 29, MAAEs, AESI , and SAEs though Day 183 End of Study Visit, and 
vital signs. Solicited AEs include local (pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic reactions 
(fever, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea).

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 12 of 78 
 
 Sample  Size Considerations:  Based on the data from the phase 2 study (protocol 
PXVX -CV-317-001), the seroresponse rate for PXVX0317 vaccine is expected to be 
approximately  v s <5% for the placebo participant s. With an assumed 10% rate of 
nonevaluable participant s, the power to show superiority over placebo with 180 
PXVX0317 vaccine and 180 placebo evaluable participant s is >99.9% for the combined 
age groups.  
The difference in seroresponse rate between PXVX0317 and placebo groups that is 
considered cli nically relevant is . With 180 PXVX0317 -treated participant s and a 
target seroresponse rate of  vs a rate of 5% for placebo, the width of a two -sided 95% 
CI would be ± 5.4%. If the target PXVX0317 seroresponse is , the width would be 
±6.9% . Theref ore, the  difference in seroresponse rate s must be above  for the lower 
bound of the 95% CI for the difference to be .  
Analysis Populations  
Enrolled  population : All screened participants who sign the inf ormed consent form 
(ICF), are entered in the electronic data capture (EDC ) database and  meet all eligibility 
criteria . 
Randomized population: All screened participant s who provide informed consent and 
provide demographic and other screening measurements and are randomized.  
Exposed population: All participant s in the randomized population who receive IP.  
Safety population: All participant s in the exposed population who provide safety 
assessment data. Safety endpoints will utilize the safety population, analyzed as treated.  
Modified intent to treat popu lation: All randomized participant s who are vaccinated and 
have at least one postinjection CHIKV SNA titer result, analyzed as randomized.  
Immunogenicity evaluable population:  All participant s in the mITT population who: i) 
provide eva luable serum sample results for the Day 22 time point within the required time 
frame  (Days 19 to 27) ; ii) have no measurable CHIKV SNA at Day 1 ; iii) have no 
important protocol deviation or other reason to be excluded as defined prior to unblinding.  
The IEP is the primary pop ulation for all immunogenicity analyses.  
Preliminary  Analysis : There will be a safety and immunogenicity preliminary  analysis  on 
data for all participants through the Day [ADDRESS_383479] -party vendor and 
unblinded results will be reported only at the  treatment group  summary level preserving 
the double -blind status on the participant  level.  No p -value penalty will be assessed 
because the Day 22 primary immunogenicit y endpoint data will be final at the time of 
preliminary analysis  and no action regarding the study will be made based on these 
findings .

PXVX0317 is a CHIKV  VLP  vaccine. The vaccine is comprised of 40 μg CHIKV VLP 
adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide  2% adjuvant (2% [w/w] aqueous suspension of aluminum 
hydroxide , Alhydrogel®) and stabilized with formulation buffer, supplied as a single dose of 
0.8 mL in a pre -filled syringe to be administered IM in the deltoid  muscle .  
Placebo (diluent) is a sterile aqueous solution with the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_311483] [ADDRESS_383493] without CHIKV VLP or aluminum hydroxide  components . 
For additional study vaccine information, see Section 5.1 and the PXVX0317 Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB).   
1.1.1 Indication  
The target indication for PXVX0317 vaccine is for active immunization to prevent disease 
caused by [CONTACT_311537] . 
1.2 Chikungunya Virus and Dise ase Background  
Chikungunya virus is an arthropod -borne alphavirus of the family Togaviridae . The CHIKV 
virion contains a positive -sense single -strand RNA genome with a long open reading frame 
coding for capsid (C) and envelope (E1, E2, E3, and 6K) structur al proteins, together with 
four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 ) required for replication of the virus . 
Since the first case reports of CHIKV in a 1952 –1953 outbreak in Tanzania (1), this disease 
has been endemic in Africa and parts of Asia with transmission occurring through Aedes 
aegypti  and more recently via Aedes albopi[INVESTIGATOR_311484] (2).  
Beginning in 2014, CHIKV disease cases were reported among US travelers returning from 
affected areas in the Americas and local transmission was identified in [LOCATION_012], Puerto Rico, 
and the US Virgin Islands. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
approximately [ADDRESS_383494] been documented ( Figure 1 
adapted from  (3)). Although mosquitoes are the primary mode of transmission of CHIKV, 
blood -borne transmission via needle stick is possible. Maternal -fetal transmission has been 
documented during pregnancy (4).

 Figure 1 Chikungunya Virus  Global Burden (adapted from (3)) 
 
Following an incubation period of 2 to 12 days, acute clinical manifestations include high 
fever, rash, gastrointe stinal complications, headache, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, 
and joint pain (5, 6, 7). The most classic symptom of chikungunya is a debilitating 
polyarthralgia that is present in greater than 90% of cases (8). This acute phase resolve s 
within several weeks, but joint pain and arthritis may persist for months or years in over 25% 
to 40% of infected individuals (9). The frequency and severity of arthritic sequelae are higher 
in older adults  (10). 
Currently t here are no approved vaccines to prevent CHIKV infection or disease. However, 
protection against subsequent infection has been shown to correlate with the presence of 
CHIKV antibo dies that neutralize the virus in vitro  (11, 12).  
1.3 Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies  
The sponsor conducted a study in mice that demonstrated comparability between the immune 
responses induced by [CONTACT_33807] -CHKVLP059 -00-VP (discussed in Section 1.4) and 
PXVX0317 vaccines. Following this, the sponsor conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_311485] (NHP) to determine the CHIKV challenge dose 
required to induce signs of arthritis, as quantified  by [CONTACT_311538] . A scoring system was developed to measure the 
degree of joint infiltration  and a  challenge dose of 107 plaque forming units (PFUs) of 
CHIKV La Reunion outbreak strain LR2006 -OPY1 was selected as the optimal dose  to 

PXVX0317

 induce signs of arthritis in NHPs.  An NHP  active vaccination and challenge study with the 
PVXV0317 vaccine  followed . Nonhuman primates  received two IM immunizations (on 
study Days 0 and 28) with VLP (1.25, 6, or 20 µg) adjuva nted with alum (300 µg), VLP 
alone (20 µg) , or alum alone, followed by [CONTACT_311539] 107 (PFU) of CHIKV strain 
LR2006 -OPY1.   
Data from the study demonstrate that all three dose levels of the PXVX0317 vaccine, 
including 20  µg without alum, induced a robus t immune response as measured by [CONTACT_311540] ( NHP SNA Assay) , even after a 
single immunization. Importantly, the addition of alum increased the prechallenge SNA titers 
compared to the VLP vaccine without  alum. Furthermore, vaccination completely protected 
NHPs from viremia, as measured by [CONTACT_311541]. Joint 
pathology scores in the active vaccination study demonstrate that vaccination with 
PXVX0317 protects NHPs from joint  infiltration in a dose -dependent manner. Quantitative 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -qPCR) analysis (by [CONTACT_311542] -qPCR 
assay) of joint tissues showed significantly lower levels of viral RNA in tissues of vaccinated 
animals, which rarely had detectable RNA, compared with animals that had received only 
alum. Taken together, these data suggest that vaccination induced CHIKV SNA prot ects 
cynomolgus macaques from developi[INVESTIGATOR_311486].  
In addition, Emergent conducted a passive transfer and challenge study in cynomolgus 
macaque NHPs. Human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from plasma of volunteers 
vaccinated  with PXVX0317 was passively transferred to NHPs at three dose levels (5, 15 , 
and 100 mg/kg, resulting in SNA titers at time of challenge of 1:38, 1:101, and 1:644, 
respectively) followed by [CONTACT_311537] (strain LR2006 -OPY1 ) challenge. All three dose levels of 
IgG purified  from plasma of PXVX0317 vaccinated participants protected NHPs from 
viremia as measured by [CONTACT_95288]. Human IgG administration also appears to protect 
NHPs from joint pathology in a dose -dependant manner. Results indicate that purified human 
IgG at an SNA titer of 1:[ADDRESS_383495] viremia as measured by 
[CONTACT_311543].  
1.4 Literature and Data Relevant to the Trial  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) initiated the 
development of the CHIKV VLP vaccine, designated VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP. The VRC 
completed phase 1 (VRC  311) (13, 14) and phase 2 (VRC 704) (15, 16) clinical studies. 
PaxVax Inc. then manufactured the vaccine as PXVX0317, conducted a mouse 
immuno genicity study showing comparability to the VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP vaccine, and 
proceeded to a phase 2 study (PXVX -CV-317-001) (17). PaxVax Inc. was acquired by 
[CONTACT_311544], Inc. in October 2018, and has been renamed Emergent Travel Health 
Inc. (Emergent) as the sponsor of two phase 2 studies (PXVX -CV-317-001 and 
EBSI -CV-317-002), a phase 3 study (EBSI -CV-317-004) and this phase 3 study .

 1.4.1 Clinical Study VRC 311  
The safety and immunogenicity of VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP were evaluated under BB -IND 
[ZIP_CODE] in VRC  311, a phase 1 open -label, dose -escalation study (13, 14). Healthy adult 
participants 18 to 50 years of age were assigned to sequential dose level groups to receive IM 
injections of 10 µg, 20 µg, or 40 µg (without adjuvant) on Weeks 0, 4 , and 20, with 
follow -up for 44 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability 
of the vaccine. Secondary endpoints were CHIKV -specific immune responses assessed by 
[CONTACT_311545] y (13, 14).   
All injections were well tolerated, with no SAEs reported. The  most common local reaction 
was mild injection site pain (36%) and the most common systemic reaction was mild malaise 
(24%). No moderate or severe reactogenicity was observed (13, 14). 
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dose groups after the second vaccination. The 
GMT of the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was [ADDRESS_383496] vaccination in all dose groups (10 µg group p=0.0197, 20  µg group p<0.0001, and 
40 µg group p<0.0001). Four weeks after th e third vaccination, the GMT of the IC 50 was 
8745 for the 10 µg group, 4525 for the 20 µg group, and 5390 for the 40 µg group (13, 14). 
These findings were confirmed by [CONTACT_17588] a plaque reduction assay and the sponsor’s 
luciferase -based assay ( human SNA assay) (18), confirming both the immunogenicity of the 
VLP and the suitability of human SNA  assay for future studies (see Section 7 for assay 
details).  
1.4.2 Clinical Study VRC 704  
The NIH VRC 704 was a phase 2 study conducted at multiple CHIKV -endemic sites in the 
Caribbean (15, 16). The study was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study with 200 
participants (planned) receiving  20 µg of CHIKV VLP and 200 receiving placebo in a 
two-dose series at Weeks 0 and 4. The study was initiated in 2016 and completed in 2018. 
Approximately 20% of participants demonstrated detectable CHIKV neutralizing antibodies 
at baseline using the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) reported as EC 50 values. 
EC 50 is the dilution of sera that inhibits 50% infection in viral neutralization assay. 
Chikun gunya virus  VLP appeared safe and well tolerated in participants who were followed 
through Week 72, with no related SAEs or other safety concerns (15, 16). Chikungunya virus  
VLP appeared highly immunogenic, with a GMT of 2004.5 and 99.5% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311487] 8. A boosting effect of SNA after administration of CHIKV 
VLP was also observed in participants with base line CHIKV neutralizing antibodies (15, 16). 
Specimens from VRC 704 were al so analyzed ad hoc  by [CONTACT_456], using the human SNA 
assay. A subgroup analysis was performed on participants without baseline CHIKV 
neutralizing activity. Using a more stringent 80% neutralization cut -off (NT 80), the GMT was 
123 at Week 4 and 1701 at Week 8. After Week 8, antibody levels declined by [CONTACT_2902] 1 log 
but remained elevated above baseline, with GMTs of 213 at Week 24, 115 at Week 48, and 
100 at Week 72, indicating that long -term protection can potential ly be achieved without the

 need for booster dose(s). These results demonstrated that CHIKV VLP was safe and 
immunogenic in adults in CHIKV -endemic areas, including those with serologic evidence of 
previous CHIKV exposure. The most frequently reported local  AE was pain/tenderness at the 
injection site reported as mild by 58 of 197 (29%) vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311488] 3/197 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (2.0%). The most frequently 
reported systemic AEs were mild or modera te headache reported by 54 of 197 (27.4%) 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], malaise (53/197, 26.9%), and myalgia (46/197, 23.4%) (15, 16). Placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311489]. One 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (0.5%) experienced a headache graded as severe following the second 
vaccination. A total of 1 6 SAEs in 15 (3.8%) participants were reported, all were assessed as 
unrelated to the IP ( ie, CHIKV VLP or placebo). All potentially related AEs resolved without 
clinical sequelae (15, 16). 
Taken together, the findings from VRC [ADDRESS_383497] that 
VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP is well -tolerated and immunogenic in both CHIKV -exposed  and 
CHIKV -naïve adults.  
1.4.3 Clinical Study PXVX -CV-317-001 
The sponsor’s phase 2 clinical study (PXVX -CV-317-001) conducted in the US compared 
multiple dose and dosing regimens of CHIKV VLP in healthy adults 18 to <46 years  of age  
(17). The dosages of CHIKV VLP ranged from 6 µg to 40 µg, adjuvanted  or unadjuvanted . 
These doses were below or approximately equivalent to those used in the NIH’s VRC 311 
and VRC 704 clinical s tudies using the non -adjuvanted CHIKV VLP (VRC -CHKVLP059 -
00-VP) vaccine. PXVX0317 vaccine was immunogenic across all dose groups as measured 
by [CONTACT_311546]. Immunogenicity data reported as 80% antibody neutralization titer 
(NT 80) values supported the b enefit of adjuvant was evident after one dose but not two doses. 
There was a clear dose -response relationship in GMT. Participants receiving [ADDRESS_383498] schedule (Days 1 and 29), either unadjuvanted (as the NIH reference dose) or 
adjuvanted, had the highest Day 57 GMT at 1946 and 1884 respectively, similar to those of 
CHIKV VLP recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311490] 704 study. Participants receiving the single 40 µg dose 
demonstrated only slightly lower GMT levels (1712 at Day 57, ie, 28 days after vaccination); 
all other dose groups demonstrated a GMT range of 914 to 1613 at Day 57. Seroconversion 
rates (titer ≥15) showed that with a single dose administered, up to 98% of study participants 
produced a neutralizing antibody response by [CONTACT_2006] 8. Further, the immune re sponse was 
shown to be persistent through the 24-month visit, including in the one dose 40  µg CHIKV 
VLP regimen. There was a clear dose -response relationship in GMT, with the Group 8 40 µg 
CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose resulting in 86% seror esponse (titers ≥40) 
[ADDRESS_383499] GMTs at Day 182. Seroresponse was well 
maintained at 760 days in Group 8 participants . Based on these data the 40  µg CHIKV VLP

 1.4.4 Clinical Study EBSI -CV-317-002 
The phase 2 clinical study ( EBSI -CV-317-002) conducted at two sites in the US compared  
the safety and immunogenicity of a 40 µg CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose  
in prior recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311491] -naïve controls ( 19).  
The 30 prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 30 gender and age -matche d vaccine -naïve 
controls were vaccinated and followed for six months. There were no differences between the 
groups in CHIKV neutralizing antibody GMTs at Day 22 and no new safety signals were 
identified.  
For more information refer to the IB.  
1.5 Seroresponse Rate  
In historical studies, a human SNA assay threshold titer of  ≥40 was used, however after  
additional analysis of protective efficacy data from animal studies  and discussions with 
regulatory agencies, an anti-CHIKV SNA titer  (seroresponse rate, als o considered  the 
presumptive seroprotection rate) will be used in the present and future studies.  
1.6 Rationale for Dosage and Route of Administration  
The regimen of PXVX0317 selected for this study is 40 µg of CHIKV VLP with alum 
adjuvant administered in a s ingle IM dose on Day 1. The alum dose of 300 µg is within the 
range of doses of alum adjuvants used in many licensed vaccines, including VLP -based 
vaccines. This dose also creates a concentration ratio to PXVX0317 that achieves high 
(~90%) levels of adsorp tion, thought to enhance immunogenicity. The IM route of 
administration is consistent with that in previous clinical studies (VRC 311, VRC 704, 
PXVX -CV-317-001, and EBSI -CV-317-002). This regimen was selected by [CONTACT_311547] -CV-317-001 s tudy data. All regimens tested were given to groups of 
50 to 53 healthy adults and all resulted in 100% seroconversion by [CONTACT_2006] 57. The group 
receiving a single dose of [ADDRESS_383501] CHIKV SNA GMT at Day 
182 and Day 365. Similar findings  were observed i n EBSI -CV-317-002. 
The PXVX0317 vaccine (40 µg CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum inum hydroxide  adjuvant) single 
dose was selected for further development by [CONTACT_311548] 3 clinical study 
(EBSI -CV-317-005). 
1.7 Population to be Studied  
The target population is adults ≥65 years of age.  This study will generate safety and 
immunogenicity data in elderly adults, in whom PXVX0317 has not been previously 
evaluated. This study is important due to the high relative disease burden in older adults, as  
well as potential concerns about immunosenescence and attendant hyporesponsiveness to 
vaccination in this age group.

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page [ADDRESS_383502] solicited AEs reported by [CONTACT_3445] s enrolled in study PXVX -CV-317-001 were mild 
to moderate in severity. The percentage of participant s who reported ≥Grade 3 AEs for the 
following categories were as follows: any AEs (7.9%), any solicited AE (6.1%), any 
systemic solicited AE (5.9%), any local solicited AE (0.2%), any unsolicited AE through  
Day 57 (2.9%), any treatment -related solicited AE (3.6%), any treatment -related systemic 
solicited AE (3.4%), any treatment -related local solicited AE (0.2%). There were no reports 
of ≥Grade 3 treatment -related unsolicited AEs through Day 57. No participant s had a 
treatment -related SAE, and no participant s permanently discontinued study due to AE or died 
during the study.  
Among participant s from PXVX -CV-317-001 Group 8 (n=50) participant s who received the 
40 µg adjuvanted dose selected for furthe r development, 48.0% reported solicited AEs 
occurring within seven  days postvaccination with active vaccine at Day 29. Approximately 
22% of participant s reported solicited  systemic AEs and 40.0% reported solicited local AEs. 
Solicited local  AEs reported in cluded only injection site pai n; no injection site redness or  
swelling was reported after receipt of the active dose. Solicited systemic AEs reported 
included malaise (4.0%), fatigue (4.0%), headache (8.0%), myalgia (12.0%), nausea  (4.0%) , 
and joint pain ( 2.0%).  
There were [ADDRESS_383503] pulse, and/or sweating. Participants  will be 
directed to inform study staff immediately if experiencing any of these symptoms.  
1.8.3 Risks with Blood Draws  
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, feeling f aint, fainting, needle site infections, 
swelling, and rarely other infections. Bruising at the site of blood drawing can be prevented

wiped clean with alcohol and s terile equipment  will be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks of Positive Screening Test for HIV, Hepatitis B , and Hepatitis C 
At the Screening Visit, participant s will be tested for HBV , HCV , and HIV. Receiving 
information that any health screening tests are abnormal or that tests for HIV and HBV or 
HCV are positive may upset participant s. The study doctors will discuss their health results 
face-to-face (and notify their primary doctor at thei r request). Counseling will be available to 
the study participant  if they wish. A positive HIV status could limit a participant ’s ability to 
obtain future life and health insurance. In rare circumstances, a positive HIV test has led to 
discrimination in em ployment and housing, etc. Participant s will be advised of this in the  
ICF. 
1.8.4 Risks to Pregnancy  
PXVX0317 has not been thoroughly evaluated for potential risks to unborn or nursing 
children.  
1.8.5 Risks to Confidentiality  
Efforts will be made to keep participants’  personal health information confidential. To 
maintain confidentiality, paper study records will be stored in a secure location such as a 
locked office or locked cabinet. Electronic data will be password  protected. Electronic study 
records and samples take n will be coded with a number, not the participants’ names. Records 
will only be shared with authorized personnel and only in connection with carrying out the 
obligations relat ed to the study.  
Although efforts are made to protect the research study records , there is always a risk that 
someone could get access to the personal information in research records or other 
information researchers have stored about participants . 
1.8.[ADDRESS_383504]  CHIKV  disease ; however , the 
clinical efficacy of this vaccine for that indication has not yet been proven. This study will 
accumulate additional safety data on this vaccine and uniquely provide a first glimpse at the 
safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in the context of el derly adults. This data will be 
important to the design of field studies. If, for example, the vaccine is less immunogenic in 
the elderly, this should be considered for determining any potential modified dosing/dose 
regimen recommendations.

 1.9 Hypothesis  
The study hypothesis being tested is that the  immune response to PXVX0317 is superior to 
that of placebo  in adults ≥65 years of age  at Day 22 , that the immune response to PXVX0317 
in adults ≥65 years of age  at Day 22 is clinically relevant , and that the safety  profile in adults 
≥65 years of age  is comparable  to that in individuals 1 8 to <65 years of age . A clinically 
relevant immune response in adults ≥65 years of age is defined as the lower bound  of the 
two-sided 95% CI for the Day 22 seroresponse rate . 
Note:  Seroresponse rate (considered the presumptive seroprotection rate) is defined as the 
percentage of participants who achieve an anti -CHIK SNA titer .

3.2.9 Assess Solicited Adverse Events  
Electronic or p aper diar ies (memory a ids) will be used to collect solicited AEs following 
vaccination. Participants  will record events in their  diary daily, for at least seven days after 
vaccination.  Solicited AEs to be assessed in this study are local events of pain, redness, and 
swelling at  the injection site and systemic events of oral temperature ≥38 .0°C (≥100.4°F), 
chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea .  
Participants will be trained to complete a  diary (electronic or paper) to observe, measure, and 
record these solici ted AEs  daily . A digital thermometer will be provided to the participants to 
measure their temperature each day. The highest temperature measured each day should be 
recorded in the participant ’s diary  or memory aid  (electronic or paper). To record injectio n 
site local reactions, a ruler will be provided to the participant to measure and record the 
diameter of redness and swelling at the largest point of the reaction each day.   
Study staff will review the signs and symptoms recorded in the diary or memory aid  
(electronic or paper)  daily  and will follow -up with parti cipants if any data is missing . The 
investigator will then assess all solicited AEs for sever ity (Section 8.1.8 ) and the action 
taken, and causality (Section 8.1.9 ). The results of the investigator’s assessment will be 
recorded as a separate source document an d will be entered on the solicited AE eCRF.

3.3.1 Primary Endpoints  
Coprimary Immunogenicity Endpoint s 
• Difference in anti-CHIKV SNA seroresponse rate (PXVX0317 minus placebo) and 
associated 95% CI at Day 22 .  
Success criterion: L ower bound of the two -sided 95% CI on the difference in 
seroresponse rates  between PXVX0317 and placebo groups  (equivalent to a 
difference >[ADDRESS_383514]).

3.4 Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
3.4.1 Masking/Blinding Proce dures  
Study participants , the investigator, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study. Sponsor’s MM and personnel, who are in 
regular contact [CONTACT_311552]/or involved with documentation as sociated with the 
study will remain blinded to all participant randomization assignments.  
The following safeguards will be employed to reduce the risk of inadvertent unblinding:  
• Use of a standardized pre -filled syringe and injection volume for all injections.  
• All PXVX0317 and placebo syringes have a semi -transparent barrel cover to mask 
any difference in appearance between placebo and PXVX0317.  
• No sponsor personnel will have access to the randomization schedule. No site 
personnel will have access to  treatment assignments. The Randomization and Trial 
Supply Management (RTSM) system allows for unblinding in an emergency (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 37 of 78 
 
 • Assays will be run in a blinded manner. The assay titer results will not be delivered to 
the sponsor data management and analysis team s until after database lock, as they are 
potentially unblinding.  
• Should any participant or staff member become inadverten tly unblinded, the 
investigator will promptly (within 24 hours of their awareness of the error) disclose 
the event to the sponsor’s M M in a blinded fashion (disclosing only participant 
number, not treatment) so that corrective action can be initiated. The unblinding 
sequence of events will be documented and retained as source documents. A protocol 
deviation will be entered in the eCRF.  
Members of the SMC  may have access to unblinded data as defined in the SMC Charter  for 
safety/other  data review.   
Under ce rtain circumstances (eg , safety reasons, required reporting to regulatory agencies), 
unblinding of IP for a particular participant will be allowed. This s afety unblinding will be 
documented as a protocol deviation. Otherwise, unblinding of the study will o nly occur after 
the clinical database has been locked.  
Refer to the  Pharmacy Manual  for procedures in case of accidental unblinding of 
study -affiliated personnel.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Breaking the Blind for Individual Participant s 
If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311492] a participant ’s treatment assignment is urgently 
needed to guide treatment or ensure the participant ’s safety, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311493]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_311494] [ADDRESS_383515] . 
If a participant ’s study treatment assignment is unblinded for safety reasons, or if a 
participant  becomes accidentally unblinded for any reason, the participant  will be requested 
to remain in the s tudy for safety follow -up.  
Documentation of breaking the blind must be entered in the study participants’ source 
documents with the following information recorded: (i) date and time the blind was broken; 
(ii) the rationale behind the unblinding decision/o ccurrence; ( iii) the names of the personnel 
involved; and ( iv) date of contact [CONTACT_311553](s). The unblinding will be 
documented as a protocol deviation.  
3.4.2 Treatment Assignment/Randomization  
Participant  eligibility will be confirmed and documented by  [CONTACT_311554] 1 . Study staff will indicate on a 
randomization eCRF within the EDC system that they want to generate a randomization 
number for the participant . When they agree to proceed, a randomization number will be 
generated from the EDC randomization module but hidden from study staff. The EDC 
randomization module will match the randomization number to an IP kit available at the site

 and inform the study s taff of the assigned kit. Study staff will use the appropriate kit for 
planned administration to the participant . 
Participant s will be considered enrolled once a randomization number has been assigned 
within the EDC system. Participant s will be stratified by [CONTACT_311555] (65 to <75 years and 
≥75 years of age), with a target of 25% enrollment of participant s ≥75 years of age. 
Participant s will be randomized to PXVX0317 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  
The study will be conducted as a double -blind study through Da y 183 End of Study Visit. 
Neither participant s nor clinical site personnel, including the P I, nor the sponsor will know 
participant s' individual treatment assignments until all participant s have either prematurely 
discontinued or completed their participat ion in the study through the Day 183 End of Study 
Visit and the database has been cleaned and locked.  
3.5 Description of Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_311495] ; however , an independent SMC 
will provide safety oversight. The SMC will review aggregated, blinded safety data after the 
first [ADDRESS_383516] completed seven  days of safety follow -up. The remaining 
participant s will be enrolled following the safety review by t he SMC and based on the 
sponsor’s consideration of the SMC’s recommendation.  The need for any further reviews 
will be determined by [CONTACT_4484].

The PXVX0317 vaccine is comprised of CHIKV VLP adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide  
adjuvant 2%, and formulation buffer supplied as a single dose in a pre -filled glass syringe. 
Chikungunya virus  VLP refers to the virus -like particle component of PXVX0317 produced 
by [CONTACT_311557] (HEK293) cells with a DNA expression 
plasmid encoding C and E (E3, E2, 6K, and E1 ) proteins. After expression of the 
plasmid -encoded pro teins, VLPs self -assemble and are released into the cell culture medium 
as ~[ADDRESS_383527] without CHIKV VLP and aluminum hydroxide  adjuvant. The placebo is filled into

 6.7 Early Discontinuation  Visit  
For EDV  occurring within seven  days postvaccination, from seven  to 21 days 
postvaccination, or ≥22 days postvaccination, the Visit 3, Visit 4 , or Visit 7 schedule will be 
followed , respec tively .  
7 ASSESSMENT OF IMMUNOGENICITY   
7.1 Anti-CHIKV SNA  Analysis  
The immune response to PXVX0317 will be measured by [CONTACT_14181]-CHIKV  SNA analysis, for 
which serum samples will be collected on Day 1 predose, Day 15, Day 22, and Day 183  End 
of Study Visit (or at E DV). 
The immunogenicity analysis will be performed using the validated human SNA assay, a 
high-throughput in vitro  infectivity assay developed by [CONTACT_311565]. The induction of t he humoral 
immune response (immunogenicity) by [CONTACT_311566]0317 vaccine, specifically anti-CHIKV SNA 
levels, will be measured by a bioluminescence assay that uses a modified version of CHIKV 
containing a reporter gene that expresses a luciferase protein (CHIKV -luc) in infected Vero 
cells in vitro . Reduction of luciferase activity ( ie, reduced bioluminescence) occurs in 
infected cultures of cells following treatment of CHIKV -luc with test serum containing 
anti-CHIKV SNA. The quantitation of reporter gene expression,  a correlate of the level of 
virus infection of cells, is determined by [CONTACT_311567] a micro -plate 
luminometer. The anti-CHIKV SNA tite r 80 (NT 80) is the reciprocal of the serum dilution 
that provides 80% protection of Vero cells from CHIK V-luc infection , or an 80% reduction 
of luciferase activity compared to virus only control.  
7.2 Cross -reactive Neutralizing Antibodies to Various CHIKV Genotypes  
Cross -reactive neutralizing antibodies to various CHIKV  genotypes  will be measured using 
FRNT 50, as an exploratory objective . Foci from infected cells are enumerated following 
exposure to mixtures of virus and immune serum. The foci are identified by [CONTACT_311568] a colorimetric substrate to hors e 
radish peroxidase. Reduction of stained foci are quantitated using a plate reader and 
neutralizing data analyzed using GraphPad prism analysis software. Anti-CHIKV  
neutralization antibody titer is the reciprocal of the antibody dilution that protects a 
percentage of cells from infection compared to virus only control.

with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigat ional) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
Note s:  
• A diagnosis should be captured as an AE term and signs and  symptoms should be 
captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis. If a diagnosis is ultimately 
made, it should replace the previous report based on signs and symptoms.  
• In the event that there are multiple diagnoses, then all diagnoses should be captured.  
• The worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease is also con sidered to be an 
AE.  
• An abnormal laboratory finding deemed by [CONTACT_978] (or designee ) as not clinically 
significant will not be captured as an AE, but an abnormal laboratory finding that 
worsens after dosing with the IP, from not clinically significant to cl inically 
significant, is considered an AE.  
• Surgical procedures are not AEs. They are the action taken to treat a medical 
condition. The medical condition that was treated with surgery may be the AE 
depending on whether  it occurred prior to IP treatment. Interventions that were 
planned prior to study entry for medical conditions that started prior to study entry 
but did not worsen during the clinical study are not reported as AEs.  
• Medically attended adverse events:  medically attended visits include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l, ER,

an AESI. The occurrence of new onset or worsening arthralgia that is medically attended will 
be monitored throughout the study for all participants . Medically attended visits include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], ER, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel . Routine 
scheduled study visits will not be considered medically attended visits.  
8.1.6 Solicited Adverse Event    
A solicited AE is a protocol -specified AE about which the investigator (or designee) 
proactively asks the participants during a protocol -specified time period. Solicited AEs to be 
assessed for this study are local injection site events of pain, redness, and swelling a t the 
injection site and systemic events of fever with oral temperature ≥ 38.0°C (≥100.4 °F; if more 
than one temperature reading is taken, the highest reading obtained each day should be 
recorded ), fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea.

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 of 78 
 
 Solicited AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_2299] s using a diary (electronic or paper) for 
seven days  postvaccination .    
8.1.7 Unsolicited Adverse Event  
An unsolicited AE is an AE that is spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_311569]. 
8.1.8 Severity of Adverse Events  
The investigator will grade all AEs for severity. For the study Grading Scale see Appendix I .  
Adverse events not listed in the Grading Scale will be graded as follows:  
• Mild (Grade 1) – No interference with activity  
• Moderate (Grade 2) – Some interference with activity  
• Severe (Grade 3) – Significant; prevents daily activity  
• Potentially Life -Threatening  (Grade 4) – as determined at ER visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• For solicited AEs, the severity of redness and swelling recorded as diameters (mm) will 
be summarized according to categories based on the largest diameter linear measurement 
when the local reaction is present . 
• Events reported as not present (0 mm is entered) will be reported as Grade 0.  
8.1.9 Causality of Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible for the assessment of the causality of an AE and the sponsor ’s 
MM will also assess SAE causality, independent of the PI. 
The following g uidelines are provided for this assessment : 
• Unrelated:  No relationship between the IP and the reported event . The event will be 
considered “not related ” to the IP. 
• Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
administ ration of IP and/or follows a known response pattern to the IP but could also 
have been produced by [CONTACT_1604] . 
• Probably related : A reasonable temporal sequence of the event with administration of IP 
exists and based on the known response to the IP, known or previously reported adverse 
reactions to the IP or similar products, or in the PI’s (or design ee) clinical judgment the 
association of the event with the IP seems likely . 
• Definitely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormalit y, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to IP administration, and which cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153] .

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses. The details are described in the 
study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.1 Sample Size Rationale  
Based on the data from the phase 2 study (protocol PXV X-CV-317-001), the seroresponse 
rate for PXVX0317 vaccine is expected to be approximately  v s <5% for the placebo 
participant s. With an assumed 10% rate of nonevaluable participant s, the power to show

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 of 78 
 
 superiority over placebo with 180 PXVX0317 vaccine and 180 placebo evaluable 
participant s is >99.9% for the combined age groups.  
The difference in seroresponse rate between PXVX0317 and placebo groups that is 
considered clinically relevant is . With 1 80 baseline seronegative  PXVX0317 -treated 
participant s and a target seroresponse rate of  vs a rate of 5% for placebo, the width of a 
two-sided 95% CI would be ±5.4% . If the target PXVX0317 seroresponse is , the width 
would be ±6.9%. Therefore, the d ifference in seroresponse rates must be above  for the 
lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference to be .  
9.2 Analysis Populations  
Analysis will be based on the following study populations:  
Enrolled  Population : All screened participants who sign an IC F, are entered in the EDC 
database, and meet all eligibility criteria . 
Randomized Population:  All screened participants who provide informed consent and 
provide demographic and other screening measurements and are randomized in the EDC.  
Exposed Population:  All participants in the randomized population who receive IP.  
Safety Population:  All participants in the exposed population who provide safety 
assessment data. Safety endpoints will utilize the safety population, analyzed as treated.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat population:  All randomized participants who are vaccinated and 
have at least one postinjection anti-CHIKV SNA titer result, analyzed as randomized.  
Immunogenicity Evaluable Population:  All participants in the mITT population who: i) 
provide evaluable serum sample results for the Day 22 time point within the required time 
frame of Day 19 through Day 2 7, inclusive, ii) have no measurable anti-CHIKV SNA at Day 
1, iii) have no important protocol deviation or other reason to be excluded a s defined prior to 
unblinding. The IEP is the primary population for all immunogenicity analyses.  
9.3 Statistical Methods  
Tables will be displayed by [CONTACT_1570] (PXVX0317 and placebo) columns  for the 
analysis populations described in Section  9.6. 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_311573] (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum. In 
the analysis of the human SNA assay data as a continuous variable, anti-CHIKV SNA NT 80 
values will be logarithmically transformed (base 10), and the GMTs and associated 95% CI s 
for each treatment group will be computed by [CONTACT_311574]-transformed means and two -sided 95% CIs. Categorical variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_211261] (n) and percentages of participants (%) in each category, including missing 
or unknown when appropriate.

2. Day 22 GMTs significantly different between PXV X0317 and placebo  in the IEP across 
both age groups combined  using an ANOVA model with logarithmically transformed  
anti-CHIKV SNA titers (log 10) as the dependent variable and treatment group and study 
site as the fixed effects  with a two -sided significance  level of 0.[ADDRESS_383547] is reached formal testing will stop, and the remaining endpoints will 
be rep orted for information only. The seroresponse rates and rate differences at Days 15  and 
183 will be tested sequentially in order, each for the IEP across both age groups combined, as 
follows:  
1. Day 15 seroresponse superior to placebo . 
2. Day 183  seroresponse sup erior to placebo.  
After testing the coprimary immunogenicity endpoints and, if both met, the hierarchical key 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, no other formal hypothesis testing will be carried out. 
The remaining secondary immunogenicity endpoints inclu ding GMTs, GMFI, other titers, 
the exploratory endpoint, and all safety endpoints will be evaluated and reported for 
information only, thus no further multiplicity adjustment is needed.  
9.5 Handling of Missing Data  
Participant s with missing immunogenicity data at Days 15, 22, or 183 will be excluded from 
the corresponding analysis; missing immunogenicity data will not be imputed. Human SNA 
assay anti-CHIKV SNA NT 80 values below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be 
repla ced by [CONTACT_311575]/2 in the immunogenicity analyses. Imputation rules for partial or missing 
dates and for missing AE relatedness and/or severity  will be described in the study SAP.

demonstrated at Day 22 by [CONTACT_311587] 
(the proportion of participants  with a human SNA assay  ; considered the presumptive 
seroprotection rate ). The difference in  seroresponse rates  between the PX VX0317 and 
placebo  groups  will be calculated, along with the 95% CI for the difference based on the 
Newcombe hybrid score method. The lower bound of the two -sided 95% CI on the difference 
in seroresponse rates  between PXVX0317 and placebo groups must be . Additionally, 
the null hypothesis of no difference between seroresponse rate  proportions will be tested 
using a chi -square test with alpha=0.05. No multiplicity adjustment will be employed  (see 
Section 9.4) and no covariate adjustment will be performed.

*The laboratory values provided in the tables serve as guidelines and are dependent upon institutional normal 
parameters. Institutional normal reference ranges should be provided to demonstrate that they are 
appropriate.  
**The clinical signs or symptoms associated with laboratory abnormalities might result in characterization of 
the laboratory  abnormalities as Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). For example. a low sodium value that 
falls within a grade 3 parameter (125 -129 mE/L) should be recorded as a grade 4 hyponatremia event if the 
participant had a new seizure associated with the low s odium value.  
***“ULN” is the upper limit of the normal range.

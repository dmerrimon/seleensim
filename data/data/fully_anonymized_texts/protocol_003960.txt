1. Background and Rationale 
1.1. Overview of Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and Graft 
Versus Host Disease (GVHD) prevention 
 
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a pot entially curative treatment 
modality for many patients with hematological malignancies, solid tumors and acquired or congenital non-malignant disorders. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_883884], graft vers us host disease (GVHD) remains a principal 
obstacle to achieve successful outcomes. Serious infections a nd impairment of generalized 
immune dysfunction are responsible for GV HD-associated mortality.  GVHD incidence 
and severity depends primarily on donor a nd recipi[INVESTIGATOR_883885] (HLA) and the regimen used for post-grafting immune suppression.  The NIH 
consensus development project working gr oup recognized 2 main categories of GVHD, 
each with 2 subcategories. The acute GVHD (aGVHD) category is defined in the absence 
of diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and includes  (1) classic acute 
GVHD occurring within 100 days afte r transplantation and (2) persistent, recurrent, or late 
acute GVHD (features of acute GVHD occurring beyond 100 days, often during 
withdrawal of immune suppression). The broad category of chronic GVHD (c-GVHD) 
includes (1) classic chronic GVHD (without feat ures or characteristics of acute GVHD) 
and (2) an overlap syndrome in which diagnosti c or distinctive features of chronic GVHD 
and acute GVHD appear together.

Identification of novel agents that can prevent GVHD without  compromising graft versus 
tumor (GVT) effect is esse ntial. Ideal GVHD prevention re quires a strategy that will 
generate donor immune tolera nce to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306780]-antigen s while preserving host immune 
reconstitution and reactivity against tumor and infectious agents. GVHD prevention has 
largely been based on the use of pharmacol ogical agents, and to a lesser degree on 
depletion of T cells from the bone marrow (B M) or blood (PBSC) he matopoietic stem cell 
graft. Randomized phase III clinical studies have shown that the combination of 
tacrolimus (TAC) and methotrexate (MTX ) is more effective in preventing GVHD 
compared to cyclosporine (CsA) and MT X following  matched related donor (MRD) 
transplant 2.  A Phase III, multicenter, controlled trial comparing MTX and TAC with 
MTX and CsA for acute GVHD prophylaxis afte r marrow transplantation from matched 
unrelated donors (MUD), showed that there was a significant trend toward decreased 
severity of acute GVHD with TAC/MTX and esta blished this regimen as state-of the-art 
for GVHD prophylaxis for MUD transplants 3. 
 
Sirolimus (SIR), or rapamycin, is an imm unosuppressive medication with potential for 
improving outcomes in allogeneic HCT with dual benefit of both immune suppression and 
anti-malignancy effect. SIR produces at leas t partial blockade of CD28 mediated co-
stimulatory signaling and is  permissive for CD4+CD25 + regulatory T cell (Treg) 
expansion, proliferation, and su rvival. SIR has also been sh own to inhibit differentiation

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  of naïve CD4 T cells to Th17 cells, cells involved in GVHD pathophysiology creating an 
immune tolerant environment. We completed a randomized Phase II trial of TAC and SIR 
vs. TAC and MTX as GVHD prophylaxis after allogeneic transplantation.4 The 100-day 
cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD  for SIR was 43% (95% CI 30-63%), and 
89% (95% CI 80-100%) for MTX, p<0.0001. Gr ade 3-4 acute GVHD for SIR was 16% 
(95% CI 7-36%) and 13% (95% CI 5-33%) fo r MTX, p=0.16. The incidence of any grade 
chronic GVHD for SIR was 51% (95% CI 34- 78%) and 67% (95% CI 52-85%) for MTX, 
p=0.56. The cumulative incidence of moderate  to severe chronic GVHD was 20% (95% 
CI 9-43%) following SIR, and 63% (95% CI 47-83%) for MTX, p=0.013. Median percent 
Tregs among blood CD4 T cells at day 30 was 16.3 (range 12.5-17.9) for SIR versus 9.9 
(8.6-13.5) for MTX, p < 0.0001, and 14.6 (10.8- 18.1) for SIR and 9.7 (7.5-11.6) for MTX 
at day [ADDRESS_1236579], p = 0.0009. SIR-treated patie nts had increased absolute numbers of 
Treg, and decreased absolute numbers of non- Treg CD4+ cells on days [ADDRESS_1236580] supporting the hypothesis 4. 
 A Phase III, randomized, multicenter, open label clinical trial recently published compared TAC/SIR versus TAC/MTX as GVHD prophylax is using peripheral blood stem cells 
(PBSC) in MRD transplants only. The primary objective was comparison of day+114 grade II-IV acute GVHD free survival between patients in the two arms from the time of randomization using intent-to treat analysis ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The cumulative incidence of 
grade II-IV acute GVHD at 114 days was 34%  in the TAC/MTX group and 26 % in the 
TAC/SIR group. Grade III-IV acute GVHD wa s 15% in TAC/MTX group, and 8 % in 
TAC/SIR group with a rate of chronic GVHD  of 43% (TAC/MTX) compared to 54% 
(TAC/SIR). Overall survival did not differ (60% vs. 61%, p NS ).
[ADDRESS_1236581]. In this protocol we will build upon 
prior experience using full intensity conditioning regimen by [CONTACT_883911] 
(PANO) to TAC/SIR GVHD prevention backbo ne in order to investigate whether we 
can achieve further reductions in the inci dence and severity of acute GVHD while 
maintaining a graft versus tumor effect. 
 
1.2. Overview of Histone deacetylase inhibitors immunomodulation and their 
role in a-GVHD 
 
Histones are part of the core proteins of nucleosomes, and ac etylation and deacetylation of 
these proteins play a role in the regul ation of gene expression. Highly charged 
deacetylated histones bind tightly to th e phosphate backbone of DNA, inhibiting 
transcription, presumably, by [CONTACT_883912]. Acetylation neutralizes the charge of histones and generates a more 
open DNA conformation. This conformation allows  transcription fact ors and associated 
transcription apparatuses access to the DNA, promoting expression of the corresponding 
genes. The opposing activities of two groups of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases 
(HATs) and Histone protein deacetylases (HDACs) control the amount of acetylation. 
HDACs regulate chromatin remodeling and gene expression as well as the functions of

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  more than 50 transcriptions factors and non-histone proteins such as P53. HATs acetylate 
and HDACs deacetylate, ε-acetylcystein residues of the histone tails. HATs generally 
increase accessibility and gene transcri ption, whereas HDACs dampen histone-DNA and 
histone/non-histone interacti ons. In normal cells a balanc e exists between HAT and 
HDAC activity that leads to cell specific patterns of gene e xpression. Interruption of this 
balance produces changes in gene expressi on. Several lines of evidence suggest that 
aberrant recruitment of HDAC and the result ing modification of chromatin structure may 
play a role in changes in gene expression  seen in cancer cells suggesting that HDAC 
inhibitors (HDACi) may provide a nove l approach to treat malignancies. [ADDRESS_1236582] been shown to be cr ucial to the activity of the AML-specific 
fusion proteins PLZF-RAR- α, PML-RAR- α, and AML1/ETO.[ADDRESS_1236583]  or apoptosis in cultured tumor cells, and 
to inhibit the growth of tumors in animal models.17,18 19 20 21 22 23Tumor growth inhibition 
and apoptosis in response to  HDACi treatment may also be mediated through changes in 
acetylation of non-histone proteins (e.g. HSP90, p53, HIF-1 α, α-tubulin).24 25 26 Antitumor 
activity has been reported in preclinical  studies with valproic acid, PXD101 and 
MGCD0103 and in clinical studies with  other HDACi, including intravenous (IV) 
depsipeptide and oral MS-275.27 HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has 
been shown to have activity in cutaneous T cell lymphoma  (CTCL), diffuse large cell 
lymphoma, and head and neck cancer.    
HDACi are very attractive molecules in the allo geneic transplant setting since they have a 
dual effect, anti-tumor activity and immune mo dulatory effects. PANO is one of most 
potent HDACi known to date in clinical de velopment by [CONTACT_5343].  PANO effects are 
nonselective, targeting HDACs classes I (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8), class IIA (HDAC4,5,7,9), 
class IIb (HDAC6,10), class I II (SIRT1-7), and class IV  (HDAC11). The clinical 
development program for PANO includes Phase III clinical trial in multiple myeloma
28, 
early-stage trials in acute myeloid leuke mia and myelodysplastic syndromes and for 
advanced Hodgkin lymphoma or as maintena nce therapy following autologous stem cell 
transplant in this disease.  
 
1.3. HDACi immune-modulatory properties and GVHD role: 
 A preclinical study demonstrates that PANO significantly impairs the phenotype and function of dendritic cells (DCs) to stimul ate antigen-specific immune responses and 
represses the production of pro-inflamator y cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-23 and 
TNF- α).

conditioning regimen of fludarabine (40 mg/m 2 daily for 4 days) and busulfan (3·2 mg/kg 
daily for 2 days) and GVHD immunoprophylaxis  of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g three

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  times a day, days 0—28) and tacrolimus (0·03 mg/kg a day, titrated to a goal level of 8—
12 ng/mL, starting day −3 until day 180). Vorinostat (either100 mg or 200 mg, twice a 
day) was initiated [ADDRESS_1236585] until day 100. The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 was 22% (9 5% CI 13—36). The most common non-
hematological adverse events included elec trolyte disturbances (n=15), hyperglycemia 
(n=11), infections (n=6), mucositis (n=4), a nd increased activity of liver enzymes (n=3). 
Non-symptomatic thrombocytopenia afte r engraftment was the most common 
hematological grade 3-4 adverse event (n=9) but was transient and all cases resolved 
swiftly. Acetylation of H3 and H4 was increas ed in PBMC in association with decreased 
TNF-alpha by [CONTACT_717611]. Total numbe r of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were 
not increased although the number of regulatory T cells was increased in association to 
enhanced FOX-P3 and IDO expression by [CONTACT_937]-PCR. In summary, administration of 
vorinostat proved safe and was associated with a lower than expected incidence of severe 
acute GVHD establishing HDACi role in GVHD prevention in patients undergoing 
related-donor reduced-intensity conditioning HCT 33 which is a less stringent setting 
compared to the one that we proposed in this study  (full intensity conditioning and 
matched unrelated donors).  
 
1.4. Panobinostat use in allogeneic HCT setting: 
 
Pan-HDACi in allogeneic BMT may have differe nt effects and encourages investigations 
to study the function of indi vidual HDAC members which ar e not elucidated to date. 
PANO tested in murine models accelerat ed GVHD compared to vorinostat which was 
unexpected but has not translated  in humans in 2 ongoing clini cal trials discussed herein. 
Pathological changes in mice showed increased  liver damage without  significant changes 
in colon or small intestine. Changes were associated with increased systemic Th1 cytokines, enhanced CXCR3 expression on donor CD4
+ and CD8+ T cells, and T cell 
infiltration in the liver 34. 
 In parallel to the development of murine models, we have tested the safety of PANO 
administered to patients with acute GVHD within 72 hours of initiation of glucocorticoid therapy (methylprednisolone 0.8 mg/Kg/day IV or  equivalent for at least 14 days) as first 
line therapy. 
As of November 2014, We have enrolled 20 subjects, median age 53 years (range, 
34-76), male (n=13)/female (n=7), white(n=15)/his panic(n=5); with diagnosis of CLL (n=2), MDS 
(n=2), Myeloma (n=1),  Follicul ar NHL (n=1), CML(n=1), Myelofibrois (n=3), AML (n=6), 
MDS/CMML (n=3) or ALL(n=1). Conditioning regimens included 
Busulfan(BU)/fludarabine(FLU)  AUC 5300 (n=10)  or AUC 3500 (n=3), FLU/Melphalan (n=5) or 
Pentostatin/BU (n=2); and GVHD prophylaxis fo r MUD 8/8 (n=11) or MRD (n=5) HCT with 
TAC/MTX (n=7), TAC/rapamycin(n=7)(sirolimus -SIR), TAC/MMF(n=3) and for mismatched 
transplants with either TAC/SIR/ATG (n=2) or  TAC/MTX/ATG (n=1). Median day of acute 
GVHD (n=19) onset was day + [ADDRESS_1236586] (26 -100 days) with overall grade GVHD II (n=) or 
III (n=6); and median day of acute symptoms in overlap GVHD patients (n=5) was day + 528 
(109-981). All Patients were treated with voric onazole (n=14) or micafungin (n=5) for fungal 
prophylaxis. For the first four patients Panobinosta t was administered intravenously (IV) weekly x 
4 at 2.5MG/M2 (n=3) or 5MG/M2 IV (n=1) with  all 4 achieving either CR (n=3) or PR (n=1) 
GVHD responses by [CONTACT_4475] +15 of Panobinostat. Due to manufacturer discontinuation of IV

MCC [ZIP_CODE]  Page 11  of 90 
IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  formulation, the protocol was amended to use PO Panobinostat. Using 10mg PO TIW 3 doses q 
week x 4 weeks, we treated 2 subjects which were both discontinued from study drug due to 
presumed GHVD progression within 7 days of Pan obinostat (after 3-4 doses). First subject had 
grade II GVHD (skin stage 3, gut stage 1 and liver stage 0) that progress in gut and skin; second 
subject with grade II GVHD (skin stage 3, gut st age 1, liver stage 1) with LFTs worsening 
ultimately evolving into VOD. Due to safety concerns next subjects were treated with 5 mg PO 
TIW 3 doses q week x 4 weeks, dose that was determined to be the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) 
after 6 patients completed therapy in phase I. Currently we are enrolling in phase II portion (n=8). 
GVHD response rate among MTD treated was complete  in 86% (n=12), partial in 7.6% (n=1) or 
progressive in 7.6% (n=1) by [CONTACT_4475] +36 after Panobi nostat with majority achieving responses by [CONTACT_4475] 
+21. Chronic GVHD at day +365 in evaluable patie nts (n=6) was none (n=3) or mild (n=3) and 
steroid was discontinued at a median of 3 months (3-6). Hematological toxicities in evaluable patients (n=14) were mild with worsening of pr ior thrombocytopenia (n=8/10), anemia (n=3/10) 
and leukopenia (n=3/10) and returned to baselin e within 1-2 weeks; LFTs deterioration (n=1) 
within 1 week of Panobinostat in a GVHD stage 3 liver/3 skin patient; pericarditis/cardiogenic 
shock CTCAE(v4) 5 of unclear etiology (n =1); worsening thyroid function (n=1) and 
hypercholesterolemia (n=1). Preliminary correlativ e studies in MTD treated patients showed that 
CD4 and CD8 numbers remained stable during treat ment. T regulatory cells numbers decreased at 
day +8 after Panobinostat and rec overed by [CONTACT_46062] +15 and +29 of treatment. Level of T regs 
inducing cytokines (TGFB and IL-10) increased, possibly contributing to an immune-modulatory environment.  There is evidence of an increased  in acetylation of histone 3 in CD4, CD8 and 
monocytes subsets over time. We are encouraged w ith tolerability of level -1 Panobinostat dose 
and the high GVHD response rate of 86% which ma y compare favorably to the historical GVHD 
response rate. These results suggest a potential ro le for Panobinostat as a tool to improve success 
of glucocorticoids for acute GVHD treatment

Phase I/II Study with oral PANO maintena nce therapy following allogeneic HCT in 
patients with MDS or AML (PANOBEST) (N CT01451268) has been reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bug 
et al 36. PANO was started at a median of 73 days  (range, 60-126) after HCT, for patients 
with active disease (n=11) or in CR2 (n=1) in  12 patients (11 AML,  1 MDS), median age 
of 52 years (range, 21-62). The MTD was dete rmined to be 20 mg  TIW based on one DLT 
(fatigue grade 3) at 20 mg and two DLTs (n ausea/emesis and colitis grade 3 each) at 30 
mg. Grade 2-4 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 83%. Grade 3/4 AEs included 
hematologic toxicity (50%), laboratory alte rations (33%), gastrointestinal symptoms 
(25%), fatigue, pulmonary infection (17% each), sepsis, herpes stomatitis, diabetes, 
syncope, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (8% each). Toxicity was reversible and required at l east one PANO dose reduction in 3 patients. As of ASH 2013, 
acute GVHD was reported in few patients (gra de 2 (n=1) and 3 (n =2) responsive to 
steroids (n=2) or salvage therapy (n=1). Four  patients developed mild (n=3) or moderate 
(n=1) chronic GVHD. With a median fo llow up of 579 days (range, 129-911), 11/12 
patients are alive and 10/[ADDRESS_1236587] of PANO on absolute T reg numb ers (n=9), but a significantly reduced

after 3 doses of PANO (mean±SEM: 14.6±2.6 vs. 9.6±1.2%, p value of t test =0.03).

Summary of trial rationale: The burden of acute GVHD that remains despi[INVESTIGATOR_883886]. Our clinical 
results demonstrate reduction in acute GV HD, suppression of non-Treg CD4 cells, 
and significantly improved Treg reconsti tution with SIR/TAC over MTX/TAC acute 
GVHD prophylaxis. However, prevention is not complete. PANO is a potent and 
versatile inhibitor that targets various protei ns in the cells and has been shown to be 
active in vorinostat resistant cancers which is an advantage. This protocol will test 
the hypothesis that addition of PANO to TAC/SIR may abolish GVHD in matched 
related or unrelated HCT while sparing GV L effect. Accordingly, the combination of 
SIR-based immune suppression and PANO may more effectively facilitate Treg 
differentiation, may inhibit the differentiat ion of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells, and 
more effectively prevent acute GVHD based on known biologi cal activity and role in 
GVHD treatment while potentially targeting minimal residual disease. 
We will test this hypothesis in a single arm phase II clinical trial testing potential 
reduction of acute GVHD incidence, from  50% to 30%, with screening intent to 
discern biologic and potential clinical activity of PANO worthy of a larger 
randomized trial. HDACs are a diverse fa mily of enzymes acting on various 
substrates and HDACi mechanism in GVHD remains unknown to date. We 
hypothesize that PANO has a higher effica cy in preventing GVHD while sparing 
GVL effect. The findings of this study should  indicate whether the effect noted with 
vorinostat is shared by [CONTACT_447384]-se lective HDACi and/or if have a superior 
efficacy or fewer toxic effects and/or ad verse effects in patients receiving a full-
intensity conditioning regimen using matched unrelated/related donors.37 
1.5.Panobinostat Clinical experience 
Clinical development of PANO focuses on the oral formulation. The clinical program for 
the i.v. formulation is completed with no fu rther company-sponsored studies currently 
planned. As of 31 December 2013, 36 clinical studies, includ ing clinical pharmacology 
(CP), Phase I and Phase II trials, as well as two randomized Phase III studies have either 
been completed or are ongoing. A total of [ADDRESS_1236588] one dose of  PANO either as a single agent or in 
combination with other agents.  
Patients were treated with PANO either TIW QW (666 patients) or TIW QOW (96 
patients) in single agent oral PANO clinical  trials. These patient s comprise the pooled 
safety population experiencing AEs during study treatment. The most frequent non-
hematologic toxicity included GI events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), mostly of Grade 1-
2, in both groups. Blood and lymphatic system disorders were the second most often 
reported specific system organ class, with dose-related thrombocyt openia being the most 
frequent AE. Fatigue, mostly Grade 1-2, was also common among patients treated for 
TIW QW and TIW QOW.

As shown in Table 1 above, AEs regardless of causality for TIW QW dosing were 
reported in 664 patients, 99.7% of  the safety population for th is dosing schedule. The most 
commonly reported AEs across doses were gast rointestinal (GI), i.e., diarrhea in 406 
patients (61.0%) and nausea in 372 patient s (55.9%). Thrombocytopenia was the third 
most frequent AE in 359 patients (53.9%) with  the highest frequency in the 40 mg dose 
level (137 patients; 84%). Fatigue also was commonly seen across dose levels in 326 patients (48.9%) overall. Of note hypothyroidism was reported in 12.9% of patients treated at the dose level of 40 mg, mostly  deriving from study [CLBH589E2214] in HL 
patients who are known to have an increased risk for hypothyroidism.

As shown in Table 2  above, Grade 3-4 AEs regardless of causality were reported in 534 
patients, 80.2% of the safety population for the QW schedule. The most commonly 
reported Grade 3-4 AEs across doses were thrombocytopenia in 272 patients (40.8%), 
neutropenia in111 patients (16.7%), anemia in 103 patients (15.5%), fatigue in 82 
patients (12.3%) and febrile neutropenia in 46 patients (6.9%). There were more Grade 3-[ADDRESS_1236589] incidence of febrile neutropenia was seen at the dose level of 60 mg 
(27.4%) compared to the other dose levels where the incidence was ≤ 3.7%. This could 
be because this dose level was only tested 
in  leukemia   patients,   in   whom   febrile   neutropenia   is   a   common 
AE.   Grade   3-4 thrombocytopenia,  grade  3-4  neutropenia  and  grade  3-4  anemia  accounted  for  75.7% (272/359), 82.8% (111/134) and 52.8% (103/195) of 
their respective all grade events. Grade3-4 diarrhea, Grade 3-4 vomiting and Grade 3-4 
nausea accounted for less than 10% of their respective all grades events (see also Table

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  1).For the TIW QOW dosing schedule, AEs rega rdless of causality we re reported in 96 
patients, which is 100% of the safety po pulation. The most comm only reported  AEs (all 
grades) across doses were di arrhea in 65 patients (67.7%), nausea in 60 patients 
(62.5%), fatigue in 54 pa tients (56.3%), vomiting in 42 patients (43.8%), 
thrombocytopenia in 41 patients (42.7%), pyrexia in  35 patients (36.5 %) and anorexia in 
33 patients (34.4%). 
 
In the TIWQOW schedule, Grade 3-4 AEs regardless of causality were reported in 81 
patients, 84.4% of the safety population. The most commonly reported Grade 3-4 AEs across doses were thrombocytopenia in 35 patients (36.5%), neutropenia in 25 patients 
(26.0%), fatigue in 14 patients (14.6%), diarrhea in 11 patients (11.5%), anemia in 10 
patients (10.4%), and febrile neutropenia in 8 patients each (8.3%). 
 
Overall, the most frequent Grade 3-4 AEs regardless of causality for both schedules 
( TI WQ W a nd TI WQ O W)  were ascribed to the same SOC, namely blood and 
lymphatic system disorders. 
1.6. Cardiac Safety 
 
As of [ADDRESS_1236590]-dose 
ECG monitoring intended to measure the oc currence of QTcF (Fridericia Correction 
Formula) and to capture other ECG abnor malities as well. The most common finding 
continues to be a post-baselin e QTcF increase of >30 and ≤60 msec with both dosing 
schedules (approximately 22%). No cases of to rsades de pointes have been observed with 
either oral dosing schedule. 
QTcF abnormalities are shown in Table 1-3, for the QW schedule.

As shown in Table [ADDRESS_1236591]-baseline increase of >30 and ≤60 msec (Grade 1) was 
frequently reported (143 patients, 21.5%). A post-baseline increase of >60 msec was less 
frequent (27 patients, 4.1%). QTcF prolongation  translating into an absolute value of 450 
to 480 msec and of > 480 - 500 msec was meas ured in 88 patients (13.4%) and in 17 
patients (2.6%), respectively. Absolute QT cF prolongation > 500 ms ec was uncommon (6 
patients, 0.9%), mostly referred to [ADDRESS_1236592]-baseline increased values of >30 and ≤60 msec were observed in 16 
(16.7%) patients. Post-baseline increase of >60 msec was less frequent (4 patients, 4.2%). 
Absolute QTcF prolongation values of 450 msec to 480 and of >480 to 500 msec were 
reported in 9 patients (9.6%) and in 1 pa tient (1.0%), respectively. Absolute QTcF 
prolongation above 500 msec was not observed. 
 
 
1.7.  Relationship between panobinostat  plasma concentrations and QTcF

1.8. Human pharmacokinetics 
 
After oral administration, PANO is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y absorbed with no observed lag phase. 
Maximum plasma concentrations were generally reached within 1 hour after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability was 30% (data on file) and the mean (SD) half-life of PANO 
was comparable following i.v. and oral dosi ng ~15.0 (5) hours (Figure 3). Moderate drug 
accumulation was observed with oral three-time s-a-week schedule but not with the weekly 
i.v. schedule (1.4-fold drug accumulation with or al three-times-a-week dosing), consistent 
with the terminal half-life of 15 hours and dosing interval. 
Different  degrees  of  renal  impairment  (mild,  moderate  and  severe)  did  not  alter 
PANO plasma exposure, whereas, mild he patic dysfunction increased PANO plasma 
exposure by 43% and moderate hepatic impa irment marginally increased PANO plasma 
exposure by 105% in cancer patients.

 In vitro experiments suggest ed that the hepatic  oxidative metabo lism of PANO is 
mediated primarily by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP )3A4, and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]2D6 
and CYP2C19. In addition to monooxygenation,  hydrolysis of the hydroxamic sid chain

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  (M43.5) were also found to be mediated (a t least in-part) by [CONTACT_46589]. These same 
metabolic pathways, were also observed in the recent human ADME and mass balance 
study [CLBH589B218]. 
1.9. Dose proportionality 
A positive and linear dose-exposure rela tionship was found following single i.v. 
administration (1.2 to 20 mg/m2, Rs = 0.83; p<0.0001).  After or al dosing with 15 mg to 
80 mg of PANO, dose-proportionality analysis indicated that systemic exposure increased 
nearly dose-proportionally at doses below 60 mg and there is less than proportional 
increase in AUC after 60 mg and 80 mg doses of panobinostat.  It appears that absorption 
may become limiting at doses ≥ [ADDRESS_1236594]  conditions [CLBH589B2111]. The overall 
exposure and inter-patient variability (CV 59%) in 34 patients remained unchanged with 
or without food, whereas C max was transiently reduced by <45% and T max prolonged by 
[CONTACT_8208] (i.e., both normal and high fat breakfast).  Since food did not alter the overall extent 
of absorption, food is unlikely to significan tly impact PANO’s systemic exposure in 
cancer patients. The findings from this formal food effect are consistent with the results 
from an earlier pi[INVESTIGATOR_628779] [CLBH589B 2101] arm 1. Therefore, panobinostat can be 
administered without regard to food in future studies.    
1.11. Study rationale/purpose 
For patients with hematological malignanc ies that cannot be cured by [CONTACT_639205]/immune-modulators/radiation alon e, allogeneic HCT represents the only 
curative option. Treatment failure occurs mo st commonly due to GVHD, toxicity from the 
preparative regimen and/or disease relapse. GVHD continues to be a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality to date. The reporte d rate of acute GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 in a Phase 
III, randomized, multicenter, trial comparing the use of PBSC versus bone marrow in 
MUD transplants showed a rate of acu te GVHD II-IV by [CONTACT_4475] 100 was 47% (40%-53%) 
with grade III-IV 16% (12%- 21%) using PBSC (16). In our randomized Phase II trial of 
TAC and SIR vs. TAC and MTX as GVHD prophyl axis after allogeneic transplantation 
we observed an acute GVHD incidence of 50% with TAC/SIR

Allogeneic HCT  patients could benefit from PANO given its putative immunosuppressive 
activity in order to improve the success rate  of allogeneic HCT. HDACi have several 
unique properties such  as pro-inflammatory cytokines reduction38,[ADDRESS_1236595].

TAC/SIR/PANO provides potential efficacy for GVHD prevention, and 
whether results hold sufficient promise for definitive testing of PANO in 
subsequent randomized clinical trials and/or TAC de-escalation studies. Correlative studies results ONLY will be compared to an “external control”

5.1.1. Peripheral blood stem cells: the stem cell product will be mobilized 
and collected as per institutional (Moffitt) or NMDP standards for related and unrelated donors respectiv ely.  The target graft will have a 
CD34 count of 5-10 x 10
6 cells/kg; however, a cell dose ≥ 2 x 106 
CD34/kg is the minimal dose permitted. 
5.1.2. Umbilical cord blood and bone marrow stem cells are not an accepted stem cell source per this protocol. 
5.2. Conditioning regimen:  The conditioning regimen is per physician discretion 
and can include either 1) myeloablative (MAC) busulfan targeted at an AUC of 
4800 μ M/L*min/day and fludarabine; 2) reduced-intensity (RIC) busulfan 
(6.4mg/kg total over 2 days or  targeted at an AUC or 3500 μM/L*min/day) and 
Fludarabine; or 3) RIC fludarabine and melphalan (140mg/m2). Busulfan 
targeted to an AUC of greater than  5,300µM/L*min/day will not be allowed, 
given the concurrent admini stration of SIR, as this combination (escalated 
AUC of busulfan and sirolimus) was asso ciated with increased risk for veno-
occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver and non-relapse mortality in prior Moffitt 
trial (MCC [ZIP_CODE]).
 Conditioning regimens/ GVHD prophylaxis utilizing 
cyclophosphamide and/or anti-thymocyte  globulin (ATG) as part of the 
conditioning regimen are not eligible. 
 
5.3. Supportive Care : Transfusion as per institu tional practice. Anti-infective 
prophylaxis or preemptive therapy as  per institutional guidelines. 
  
5.4. Antifungal Prophylactic Medications:   
5.4.1. Micafungin is the preferred primar y antifungal prophylaxis treatment 
given its minimal interaction with TAC and SIR metabolism.  
5.4.2. Voriconazole or Posaconazole is  allowed as per treating physician 
discretion.  
5.4.3. Patients with presumed or proven pre- transplant infection treated with 
Voriconazole or Posaconazole will be  allowed to continue with this 
treatment as it has been shown that for primary treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis, azoles like voriconazole have shown better responses 
and improved survival when compared to amphotericin B.42

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.4. If patients develop GVHD (see section 6) on trial it is our standard 
practice to use voriconazole or po saconazole in patients receiving 
prednisone at a dose higher than 0.5mg/kg/day.  In a randomized trial 
for prophylaxis against fungal infect ions among patie nts with GVHD, 
posaconazole was similar to fluconazole for prophylaxis against fungal infections among patients wi th GVHD; and posaconazole was 
superior in preventing invasive aspergillosis and reducing the rate of 
deaths related to fungal infections. 
43 .  
 
5.5. Other medications : In general, the use of any concomitant 
medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_636635], 
including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. antiemetics) with the following 
precautions: 
5.5.1. Any medications listed in Appendix B: [IP_ADDRESS]. Which may cause QTcF prolongation or inducing torsades de pointes should not be used. Concomitant use 
of CYP3A4 inhibitors with  PANO should be avoided to 
prevent potential increase in PANO exposure during concomitant treatment with these drugs.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medications known to be substrates of the isoenzyme CYP2D6 should be avoided in use with PANO as this drug can inhibit isoenzyme CYP2D6 at low micromolar 
ranges. Please refer to Appendix B  for the list of 
CYP2D6 substrates.  
 
5.5.2. Patients receiving any medications th at have the potential to alter 
serum electrolytes (e.g., diuretics) should be monitored very closely 
for electrolyte abnormalities as thes e can contribute to the risk of 
QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias.   
5.5.3. No other investigational therapy sh ould be given to patients during 
PANO administration or until toxicity related to PANO has not 
resolved. 
 
5.5.4. Leukocyte growth factors (e.g.G-CSF and GM-CSF) are not to be administered systematically but may be prescribed for ANC < [ADDRESS_1236603] itutional guidelines at any time 
during this trial. 
  
5.5.6.  Budesonide and beclomethasone. Fo r patients with gastrointestinal 
GVHD, budesonide and/or becl omethasone, with or without 
systemic corticosteroids are allowed.

5.6.1. Screening. One 12-lead EKGs will be performed to assess study 
eligibility at time of enrollment to   accurately estimate Fridericia 
correction for QTC (QTcF) calculation as listed in Table [ADDRESS_1236604] be performed. The QTcF , or average of 3, ( at 
baseline must be ≤ 480 msec for the patient to be eligible  for 
participation in the trial).  The EKG will be analyzed by [CONTACT_883916] [INVESTIGATOR_883887].  
 
5.6.2. Additional 12-lead EKGs will be performed at a minimum at 
scheduled time points as indicated in Table 4 as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS]. With 1st dose: Pre-dose E KG and post dose EKG 
[IP_ADDRESS]. With 3rd dose: Pre-dose EKG

serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium (total corrected for 
albumin, or ionized calcium) in order to rule out correctable 
electrolytes abnormalities that c ould potentially correct prolonged 
QTcF. On any day and time in which electrolytes are assessed, if 
the value is < LLN, then the patient’s potassium, calcium, phosphorous or magnesium should be supplemented as per standard Moffitt procedure. After electrolytes replacement [ADDRESS_1236607] be performed to

 If ANY EKG performed while patient is on trial shows a QTcF ≥ 
480, a minimum of [ADDRESS_1236609] be ≤ 480 msec for the patient to be treated with 
PANO. Electrolyte replacement and/ or avoiding drug(s) that could 
potentially prolonged QTcF should be attempted when indicated.  
PANO could be resumed once QTcF is ≤ 480 as per clinical 
judgement of the treating physician at Moffitt Cancer Center or PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1461]. If Muse system  is malfunctioning, EKG machine 
should provide EKG printout which provides QT correction based 
on Bazett's formula. In these circumstances, QTcB is allowed to be 
used to decide eligibility and/or PANO dosing if heart rate is equal 
or above 60. QTcF can also be ca lculated with QT  and heart rate 
provided in printout. QTcF is obtained based on the following 
formula: QT/RR^0.33. RR= [ZIP_CODE]/Hear t rate. Can use web based

5.7. GVHD prophylaxis  
 
We will test the combination of TAC and SIR, a combination that has proven to 
be safe and effective for GVHD preventi on in matched allogeneic transplants 
(related or unrelated) in addition to PANO.  We propose to test the hypothesis that 
this combination not only enhances T regulatory developmen t but may modulate 
host-donor antigen presentation to allow an  immune-tolerant mi croenvironment to 
prevent GVHD. Therefore, PANO will be in itiated prior to stem cell infusion (see 
Appendix G)and continued for 26 weeks as shown in Figure 4:

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Tacrolimus  will be administered starting on day -3 and 
following our institutional guidelines for dosing.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Micafungin will be used for primary fungal 
prophylaxis, given its minimal interaction with TAC and SIR metabolism; there will be no dose adjustment 
made of TAC or SIR with Micafungin as fungal 
prophylaxis. In those patie nts with active fungal 
infection, anti-fungal treatment will be changed to Voriconazole or Posaconazole. Additionally, those patients on corticosteroid treatment (cumulative dose 
of greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day) will be 
treated with Voriconazole or Posaconazole. In those patients on Voriconazole or Posaconazole, TAC dose will be decreased by 50-67% of its original dose and further adjusted based on serum levels.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) will be graded 
for severity according to CTC version 4. No changes in TAC dose will be made for TMA of grades 1 or 2. For grade 3 TMA, TAC dose will be reduced by 50%. 
For grade 4 TMA, TAC will be discontinued.

supplied as 5-mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_883889]. Medication 
labels will comply with US  legal requirements and be 
printed in English. They will supply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]    If the patient cannot take Panobinostat due to mucositis 
and/or HCT related GI toxicities (nausea/vomit/diarrhea), then he/she should take PANO on that same day within 16 hours after the missed dose if 
possible. After more than 16 hours, that day’s dose 
should be withheld, and the pa tient should wait to take 
PANO until the next scheduled  treatment day (i.e., 
patients should be instructed not to try to make-up the missed dose after 16 hours) . (In our prior experience

major addition was the incorporation of persistent nausea with pathologic evidence of 
acute GVHD as grade 1 gastrointestinal GVHD.  This established grading scheme will 
be utilized for the grading of this en dpoint in the trial. (see Appendix A) 
6.1. Evaluation procedures: Incidence of  acute GVHD will be characterized by 
[CONTACT_883918] 90±[ADDRESS_1236622] sc oring system. Organ stage of GVHD 
will be given for each site of involvement (e.g. skin, liver, and gut), as well 
as a composite grade for overall acute GVHD (see Appendix A). Pathologic confirmation of aGVHD will be dictated by [CONTACT_883919], but not mandated by [CONTACT_3181]. If patients develop 
diarrhea while receiving PANO see r ecommended management in section 
7.2. If patients develop isolated upper  GI symptoms, pathology confirmation 
of GVHD is needed to score as GVHD.  
6.2. Taper of immunosuppression is suggeste d- not mandatory- on days 50±3 for 
TAC or 365±30 for SIR in the absence of GVHD.   
6.3. Therapy for established acute GVHD: Upon recognition of acute GVHD, 
standard treatment may involve high dose (1-2mg/kg) cort icosteroids. The 
primary therapy of acute GVHD is not mandated by [CONTACT_3181]. Interval 
progress will be assessed on a routine basis by [CONTACT_1963]. 
Without anticipated resolution, addi tional immunosuppression may be added 
per the treating physicians’ discretion. The agents us ed, time of initiation, 
duration of exposure, interval response , and any specific toxicities will be 
recorded. 
If GVHD develops and requires treatment with high dose corticosteroids (1-
2mg/kg) while on planned PANO dosing schedule PANO should be stopped 
as failed primary endpoint. 
 
 
7. Safety assessment : 
 
Safety assessments will consist of monitori ng and recording focused toxicities/adverse 
events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) unexpected to HCT (table 8), the 
regular monitoring of hematology, blood chem istry and urine values, vital signs, 
ECOG/Karnosfsky performance status, and th e regular physical examinations and 
EKG assessments as specified in the protocol.

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  7.1. Anticipated adverse events of the transplant protocol and recommended 
management 
7.1.1. Mucositis: The advent of mucositis  will be anticipated, objectively 
characterized and scored per CTCAE (v  4.0) criteria, and recorded. It is 
suggested that patients with inad equate oral nutrition will have 
Nutrition evaluation and consideration for TPN. Pain control is at the 
discretion of the treating physician 
 
7.1.2. Cytopenias: Transfusion support will be provided as needed per standard of care. Hematopoietic growth factors will not be routinely employed to hasten recovery. 
 
7.1.3. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): The BMT Clinical Trial Network 
has developed a consensus statement regarding both a uniform diagnostic scheme for post-transplant thrombotic microangiopathy, as well as recommendations for its management. The authors provide a definition for TMA which includes  the following: RBC fragmentation 
and > 2 schistocytes per high-pow er filed on peripheral blood smear; 
concurrent increased serum LDH a bove baseline; concurrent renal 
(defined as doubling of baseline se rum creatinine or decrement of > 
50% of baseline creatinine clearan ce) and/or neurologic dysfunction 
without an alternate explanation; and negative direct and indirect 
Coombs test results. The primary management strategy should be the dose reduction or discontinuation of  calcineurin-inhibitors upon the 
recognition of post-transplant TMA.  Consideration of calcineurin 
inhibitor replacement by [CONTACT_105]-calcineurin  inhibitor immune suppressant 
agents is at the discretion of the treating physician.
45 In those who meet 
criteria, changes to the immunosuppressi on regimen will be dictated by 
[CONTACT_883920]: No change  for CTCAE(v.4)  grade 1-2; For 
CTCAE(v.4) grade 3 dose reduction by 50% of original dose of TAC; 
For CTCAE(v.4)  grade 4 TAC will be discontinued. Plasma exchange upon recognition of TMA is not indicated. 
 7.1.4. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/ sinusoidal obstruction 
syndrome (SOS): Hepatic VOD/SOS, is  clinically ch aracterized by 
[CONTACT_883921], jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, and volume overload. This syndrome is s een in association with several 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32895], notably including high  dose therapy with hematopoietic 
cell transplantation. Several risk factors have been  identified by 
[CONTACT_883922] e-transplantation abnormalities of 
liver transaminases, chronic hepatitis C and B, certain chemotherapeutic agents used in conditioning regimens primarily

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  conditioning, and prior exposure to gemtuzumab ozogamycin. 
McDonald, et al. examined liver  toxicity in the setting of 
cyclophosphamide/TBI conditioning prior to HCT. These authors monitored plasma levels of cyclophosphamide metabolites and demonstrated that its metabolism widely varied among subjects. Exposure to elevated levels of a metabolite, o-carboxyethyl-phosphoramide mustard, was significantly related to development of 
hepaticVOD/SOS, non-relapse mortality , and survival. Those in the 
highest quartile for exposure to this  metabolite had a 5.9-fold increased 
risk of non-relapse mortality
46. Accordingly, we will exclude those 
conditioning regimens employing cyclophosphamide. 
 The reported rate of VOD/SOS complicati ng HCT varies from 0 to 70% due to 
differences in diagnostic criteria, rec ognition, sample populations, and distribution 
of risk factors. More current reports, in cluding a large multicenter prospective trial 
from the EBMT, describe hepatic VOD/SOS rates of 8-9%
47.  While mild hepatic 
VOD/SOS produces minimal morbidity an d mortality, severe hepatic VOD/SOS 
related mortality reaches 90% which is rare in our experience 4.  
 
Evaluation and management: Surveillance for development of this condition will take place in all patients. Criteria fo r diagnosis include painful hepatomegaly, 
abnormal liver function tests, fluid overloa d, and the absence of alternate etiology 
to explain these abnormalities. Manageme nt of VOD/SOS consists of supportive 
care, and is not mandate d by [CONTACT_3181].  
 
7.2.Anticipated events for PANO and recommended  management : 
 
To date the main adverse events reported ar e similar among all the studies performed with 
oral PANO formulations. Information about common side effects already known about the 
investigational drug can be found in the Investigators’ Brochure (IB) or will be 
communicated between IB updates in the form  of Investigator Notifications. This 
information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
 
7.2.1. The most common non-hematological ev ents (Table 1) reported were:  
[IP_ADDRESS]. GI events (nausea/vomiting/ diarrhea);  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fatigue and electrolytes abnormalities are less common. 
7.2.2. The most common hematological toxici ty reported was thrombocytopenia 
and to a lesser extent mild anemia and leukopenia.  
 These potential adverse effects will be monitored, and their occurrence recorded as specified in section 9.2. No specific diagnostic or therapeutic measures are prescribed by 
[CONTACT_883923]. GI toxicity is  a common side effect 
of HCT especially in the immediate transp lant period (see expected HCT complications 
section 9). Etiology of GI symptoms c ould be multifactorial including conditioning

other etiologies including infection are highly recommen ded.  Endoscopy with biopsies 
should be considered for evaluation of GVHD if  the patient is beyond day +22, but is left 
to the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
 
8. Reasons to hold/discontinue treatment :   
8.1. Investigator(s) decision to withdraw patient from the study in the event of 
inter-recurrent illness, adverse events, or other reason that he deems necessary 
to discontinue study drug. Patients who discontinue from the study for AE or 
SAE will all be evaluable. Date of a nd reason for study discontinuation will be 
noted. Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due 
to an AE must be followed until reso lution or stabilization of the event, 
whichever comes first.   
8.2. Abnormal laboratory result unable to be corrected to levels acceptable for 
treatment with the study drug.  
8.3.  Patient non-compliance   
8.4. Subject withdrew consent from st udy at any time for any reason. 
 
8.5. Death. 
 
8.6. Prolongation of QTcF (see section 5.6). 
 
8.7. For patients that PANO is discontinued due to GVHD they are allowed to continue 
to be ON study. All assessment, procedures, CRF forms, correlative studies (appendix F) will be performed identically to patients that continue to take 
PANO and we will not deviate from what is stipulated in the protocol for 
patients that are receivi ng study drug on study. 
 
8.8. Special considerations for toxicity observed up to day +[ADDRESS_1236623] transplant: Due to 
unknown interactions between conditioni ng regimen and PANO, guidance is 
provided between PANO 1
st dose to day +[ADDRESS_1236624] as follows: 
8.8.1. PANO will be stopped for any non-hematological CTCAE (v4) grade 
[ADDRESS_1236625] (see table 8) seen between 
first dose of study drug and day +[ADDRESS_1236626] ug and continued until completion 
of protocol-specified dosing schedu le. In the absence of complete 
reversal of toxicity within 7 days , the study drug will be discontinued 
and the patient removed from the study. All such patients will remain 
evaluable for analysis  and not replaced.

8.10. Definition of engraftment and delayed engraftment: 
8.10.1. Engraftment: Engraftment for neutrophils is defined as the first of three consecutive days in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
is > 500/uL. Engraftment for platelets is defined as the first of three 
[COMPANY_001] Protocol No. CLBH589BUS100T 
Version 9 (04-12-2018) 
 
 
 
MCC [ADDRESS_1236628] atelet count is > 20,000/uL, without 
platelet transfusion in the prior 7 days. 
8.10.2. Delayed engraftment: In prece ding HCT trials we observed 
engraftment of WBC (defined as ANC >500 for 3 days) by [CONTACT_883924] 16 (range 11-30), wh ile engraftment of platelets occurred by 
[CONTACT_883925] 14 (range 0-71) after HCT.  In the current trial, delayed 
engraftment will be defined as either ongoing ANC <500/uL on or 
after day 23; or ongoing dependence of platelet transfusions on or 
after day 21. Patients who engraft pr ior to day [ADDRESS_1236629] delayed 
engraftment.  
 
8.11. Dosing modifications during pre-engraftm ent period: If ANC <500/uL on day 
23: HOLD PANO  until ANC > 1000, then resu me at 100% dose. If platelets 
<20,000/uL on day 21: HOLD PANO  until platelet  count > 30,000/ul 
(without platelet transfusion support x 3 consecutive days), then resume at 100% dosing.  
8.12. Dosing modifications after primary engraftment: 
8.12.1. If ANC decreases to 500–1000/uL, CONTINUE PANO at 100% 
dosing. Begin growth factor support.  
8.12.2. If the ANC decreases to <500/uL, HOLD PANO until ANC 
recovers to >1000/uL, then RESTART PANO at 100% dosing.  
8.12.3. If ANC decreases to < 500/uL again, HOLD PANO until the ANC 
recovers to >1000/uL, then RESTART  PANO at every other week 
regime(TIW QOW). May resume 100% dosing of  PANO (weekly 
dosing)  when G-CSF is discon tinued, provided the ANC remains 
>1000/uL.  
8.12.4. If the platelet count decreases to < 20,000/uL, HOLD PANO until 
platelet count recovers to >20,000/ uL (without platelet transfusion 
support x 3 consecutive days) then RESTART at 100% dosing.  
8.12.5. If platelet count decreas es to <20,000 /uL again, HOLD the PANO 
until the platelet count recovers  to >20,000/uL (without platelet 
transfusion support x 3 consecutive days), then RESTART PANO 
every other week. May resume 100%  dosing provided the platelet 
count remains >20,000/uL (without pl atelet transfusion support).

11.  Data and Safety monitoring : 
The Data Safety & Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  will ensure that this trial is well 
designed, responsibly managed, appropriately reported, and that it protects the rights 
and welfare of patients. The following intern al and external review and monitoring 
processes provide oversight and ac tive monitoring of this trial: 
 The Principal Investigators (PI) 
 The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) 
 The Protocol Review and M onitoring Committee (PRMC); 
 The Research Compliance Division (RCD) of the Cancer Center's Compliance 
Office; 
 The Institutional Review Board. 
 We will follow the Moffitt Cancer Center policy for monitoring of Investigator 
Initiated Trials ( MRI-P.PSO.03) 
 
 The protocol includes a section that specifies the following with respect to 
Adverse Event (AE) reporting: what consti tutes an AE (versus what is a serious 
adverse event), the entities to which AE  should be reported, the timing of this 
reporting, and the person or persons re sponsible for reporting. This includes 
prompt (within one day of knowledge of  the event) reporting to the IRB for 
unanticipated risks to subjects and reporting in writing within five working days to the IRB. It is required reporting of SAE to [COMPANY_001] but not AEs as indicated in 
section 9. If necessary, corrective action and/or educational programs will occur 
to ensure subject safety and data inte grity. Reports to the SRC, PMC, and IRB 
will be submitted as required. 
11.1. Initial and Ongoing Monitoring and Review : The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_883895]. Input will be 
sought from sub-investigators and other members of the BMT Program 
concerning data and safety issues.  Th e PI [INVESTIGATOR_883896].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_183597], that all 
data required for oversight of monito ring are accurately reported to a DSMB 
and/or to the PMC and I RB as required, that all adverse events are reported 
according to protocol guidelines, and that  any adverse actions reflecting patient 
safety concerns are appropriately repo rted. The investigators and members of 
the BMT Research Staff will meet at least monthly. The following data will be 
reviewed: rate of accrual, adverse even ts and protocol deviations and/or 
violations.  
11.2. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC): The Cancer Center's internal Scientific Review Committee (SRC) provide s for a formal internal peer review 
of all protocols and genera l scientific oversight of interventional clinical 
research. The Committee has a defined membership representing all of the 
[COMPANY_001] Protocol No. CLBH589BUS100T 
Version 9 (04-12-2018) 
 
 
 
MCC [ADDRESS_1236638] include a DSMP prior to approval by [CONTACT_30969]. The plan has to 
be appropriate for the phase a nd risk of the proposed study.  
11.3. The Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) : The Protocol 
Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) will monitor this trial for safety, progress, protocol compliance, accrual, adverse event reporting, and data 
integrity. The membership of the PR MC includes physician representation 
from each program area and a biostati stician. In addition to the existing 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the PRMC is authorized  to suspend a trial for non-compliance 
with a DSMP or as a result of audit findings deemed unacceptable. The PRMC 
will report significant findings to the IRB and the applicable regulatory body. Interim meetings are scheduled to ad dress specific issues that require 
immediate attention to ensure sa fety of research participants. 
11.4. The Cancer Center’s Compliance Office :  Corporate Compliance conducts 
internal audits of selected clinical tria ls conducted at the Cancer Center and its 
affiliates.  The purpose of the internal audit program is to: 
11.4.1. Assure patient safety by [CONTACT_628842] 
11.4.2. Assure regulatory compliance by  [CONTACT_883926] 
11.4.3. Assure scientific valu e by [CONTACT_883927] 
11.4.4. Monitor and coordinate research compliance activities associated 
with institutional and individual conflict of interest 
11.4.5. Make recommendations for modificat ion of research practices as 
necessary and provide education on issues that are critical to good 
research practices 
Audits are conducted by [CONTACT_883928]. Investigator initiate d trials, such as the one proposed here, 
receive the highest priority for audit.  Corporate Compliance will conduct and 
report the findings of audits to the PM C in accordance with a protocol's annual 
review. The PRMC will determine the findings to be acceptable with minor 
deviations, acceptable with corrective ac tion, or unacceptable with suspension or 
closure. The PRMC Chairperson will notify the IRB of the audit findings. The 
PRMC will be informed of all significant open follow-up items. For those observations where no action has been taken, Corporate Compliance will inform the PRMC and may conduct a focused audit.

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  Any change or addition (e xcluding administrative) to this protocol requires a 
written protocol amendment that must be reviewed by [CONTACT_883929].  A copy of 
the written approval of the IRB must be  provided to [COMPANY_001]. Examples of 
amendments requiring such approval are: 
11.5.1. increases in drug dose or dura tion of exposure of subjects, 
11.5.2. significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group), 
11.5.3. increases in the number of  invasive procedures, 
11.5.4. addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of 
safety. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action 
from being taken by [CONTACT_883930].  If an immediate change to the 
protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_883931] e IRB at the center must be informed 
immediately.   Amendments affecting onl y administrative asp ects of the study do 
not require formal protocol amendments  or IRB approval but the IRB must be 
kept informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative 
changes not requiring formal protocol amendments and IRB approval include 
either changes in the staff used to monitor trials  or minor changes in the packag ing or labeling of study drug. 
 
11.6. Institutional Review Bo ard/Independent Ethics  Committee  
 Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information to subject s, must be reviewed by a properly 
constituted Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee/Research 
Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and 
informed consent have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB mu st be given to

of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An 
SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise 
considered completely unrelate d to a previously reported one 
should be reported separately as a new event. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form as outlined per 
contractual agreement; all applicable sections of the form 
must be completed in order to  provide a clin ically thorough 
report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE 
Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] 24 hours to the oncology [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department. 
The telephone and telefax number of the contact [CONTACT_883932][INVESTIGATOR_623] 
(DS&E) are included in the contractual agreement. The 
original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet should be ke pt with the case report form 
documentation at the study site. 
Follow-up information is sent to  the same contact(s) to whom 
the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE 
Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each 
re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as  a follow-up to that event 
regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether the even t has resolved or continues, 
if and how it was treated, whet her the blind was broken or not, 
and whether the patient conti nued or withdrew from study 
participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or Package Insert (new  occurrence) and is thought to 
be related to the [COMPANY_001] study treatment, an oncology 
[COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department associate may urgently require further information from the 
investigator for Health Aut hority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may 
need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all

11.7.2. Pregnancies: To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is  on study treatment must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] within  24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birt h, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Form and reported by [CONTACT_883933][INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E). 
Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessmen t of the possible relationship 
to the panobinostat any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy mu st be reported on the SAE 
Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners 
of any males who took study tr eatment in this  study. Consent 
to report information regard ing these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother.

12. Statistical methods  
12.1. Sample Size Determination  
            In our randomized Phase II trial of TAC and SIR vs. TAC and MTX as GVHD 
prophylaxis after allogeneic transpla ntation we observed an acute GVHD 
incidence of 43% (95% CI  30-63%)  with TAC/SIR 4. Simon’s minimax two-
stage design with 10% one-sided type I e rror and 10% type II error rate is used 
for study design as follows. We will co nsider 43% incidence of grade II-IV

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  acute GVHD (aGVHD) not warranting further study. We will use 23% 
incidence rate as a promising result to pursue further study. With these study 
parameters, [ADDRESS_1236640] stage. If 7 or 
more of 15 evaluable patients experien ce the grade II-IV acute GVHD, the 
treatment will be stopped. Ot herwise, once 9 or more of 15 patients completed 
the +90 (+/-14) days follow up without  experiencing the grade II-IV acute 
GVHD 23 additional evaluable patients (a  total of 38 evaluable patients) will 
be enrolled. If the number of patients  experiencing the grade II-IV aGVHD is 
12 or less, ( ≤31.6% incidence rate at day 100 ), the null hypothesis will be 
rejected and the regimen will be cons idered promising. An evaluable patient 
for primary endpoint is defined as patie nts who receive at least one dose of 
PANO per protocol and who neither relapse nor die of any reasons without 
experiencing grade II-IV aGVHD until day 100. A non-evalua ble patient will 
be replaced and we anticipate a total of  44 patients will be accrued in order to 
account for 10% of competing risks (re lapse or death without GVHD) at day 
100. 
 
12.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883899]  
            A patient who receives at least one dose of the study drug (PANO) per protocol 
is evaluable for toxicity. As shown in Ta ble 9, the accrual will be suspended if 
c or more of n patients experience CTCAE (v.4)  grade 3 or higher toxicity 
unexpected with transplant, where n is the number of evaluable patients and c 
is the number of patients who experi ence CTCAE (v.4) grade 3 unexpected 
toxicity or higher. Assuming true toxicity rate is 20% and the type I error rate 
is 5%, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883900]49. If true toxicity 
rate is 20%, 40% and 50%, then the proba bility of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 4.9%, 79% 
and 98%, respectively.

IRB 15.09.0021 CONFIDENTIAL  confidence interval using th e approach proposed by [INVESTIGATOR_217153]50. The log-log 
transformation will be used to compute the point-wise confidence intervals. 
The death and relapse will be considered as competing risks of acute GVHD.  
 
12.5 Analysis Plan for Secondary Endpoints  
The demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics; mean, medi an, standard deviation and range for 
continuous measures and counts and fr equencies for categorical measures. 
Adverse events will be recorded, includi ng the details of th e duration and the 
severity. Time-to-event data such as overall survival (OS)  and relapse-free 
survival (RFS) is measured from the da te of transplantation. OS and RFS will 
be analyzed using th e Kaplan-Meier method51. The cumulative incidence of 
relapse and non-relapse mortality will be computed by [CONTACT_883935]. Death and relapse will be consid ered as the competing risks of chronic GVHD and 
the cumulative incidence of chronic GVH D will be measured by [CONTACT_883935]. 
The association of time-to-event data with and without competing risks will be explored by [CONTACT_883936]
52 and the Cox proportional hazards 
regression model53, respectively. 
                
For correlative studies (appendix F)  results will be compared to an external 
control patient subset that will be treated with TAC/SIR with same inclusion and exclusion criteria as this protocol except that they will not be treated with 
PANO. For the regulatory T-cell repopula tion, the profiles of regulatory T cell 
counts will be analyzed us ing generalized linear models  for repeated measures 
based on generalized estimating equations . The comparisons of profiles of T-
cells and DC cells with external contro l will be made using the Satterthwaite 
t-test.  
 
The analysis of the secondary endpoints is considered exploratory and no multiplicity adjustment is planned for it. A two-sided p-value of <0.05 is considered statistically significant.  
If we compare a total of 30 patients ( 15 in treatment group and 15 in 
external control ) that will achieve 83% power to  detect an effect size (mean 
difference divided by [CONTACT_157516]) of 1.1 between two groups. 
 If we compare a total of 40 patients ( 20 in PANO group and 20 in external 
control) will achieve 87% power to de tect an effect size (mean difference 
divided by [CONTACT_883937]) of 1 between two groups.

General Guidance:  
 In generally, medications listed in Tabl e 1 should be avoided while medications 
listed in Tables 2 and 3 are to be used with caution when co-administered with 
PANO.  
 
 It is of great importance to avoid combining drugs listed below in Table 1  and 
Table 2  (CYP3A inhibitors) especially in the presence of electrolyte abnormalities, 
notably decreased potassium or magnes ium levels commonly associated with 
diuretic usage. 
[ADDRESS_1236647] udy.  Patients may not begin PANO treatment 
with any of the medications listed in Table 1  unless this is discusse d with and approval is 
granted by [CONTACT_5343]. It may be agreed to temporarily discontinue PANO treatment (e.g., 
for 72 hours) during administration with th ese drugs or withheld medications in Table [ADDRESS_1236648] 72 hours when PANO is to be administered and missed dose(s) should be 
administered until completion of the trial specified PANO schedule.   
This is not a comprehensive list of medica tions which may prolong the QT interval or 
have a risk of causing Torsades de pointes. This list of medicati ons was developed in 
collaboration with an external cardiology c onsultant, and represents those medications 
which are deemed to have an unacceptable  risk of co-administration with PANO. 
The following website may be referenced as a supplemental guide for drugs which have 
been associated with Torsades de pointes or prolonging the QT  interval but at this point 
lack substantial evidence for causing Torsades de pointes: 
http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.htm#. 
Medications listed on the webs ite which do not appear in Table 1  may be used with 
caution at the discretion of  the investigators.  
The serotonin (5HT 3) antagonists, often used as antiemetics, such as ondansetron 
dolasetron, (also are known CYP2D6 substrates, see Table 3 ), or granisetron have been 
associated with Torsades de points and QT prolongation but have not been shown to cause 
Torsades de pointes. Therefore, 5HT 3 antagonists are not per se prohibited but close 
monitoring for signs and symptoms of QT prol ongation is recommended.  Caution is to be 
exercised when using these or other agents that may prolong QT intervals in combination 
with PANO.

3 Medications which are known CYP2D6 substrates to be used with caution 
Panobinostat was also shown to be a CYP2D6 inhibitor ( Ki 0.17 µM) in vitro .  Thus, 
clinical drug-drug interact ion study with panobinostat as CYP2D6 inhibitor and 
dextromethorpan as CYP2D6 substrate was recently conducted in study CLBH589B2109. 
Multiple panobinostat doses increased C max and AUC of dextromethorphan by a mean of 
1.8- and 1.6-fold respectivel y, but with no change in T max in [ADDRESS_1236651] a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., the ratio of toxi city exposure is ≤ 2-fold higher

  APPENDIX F  
Translational research Introduction: 
The goals of correlative studies are to test  the pharmacodynamics of PANO administered 
in for GVHD prevention.  We will determine whether PANO abrogates HCT induced 
cytokine storm, if there is a correlation between HDAC enzymatic activity inhibition and clinical GVHD prevention; we will establish wh ether there is enhanced proteins/histones 
acetylation in T-cell subsets that may be responsible for GVHD prevention and effects on 
immune reconstitution.  Samples will be co llected with the AM blood draw whenever 
possible.  Samples will be labeled with the patient's name [CONTACT_883952] (UPN), date and tim e of draw, and transported immediately by [CONTACT_883947] y no. [ZIP_CODE], in the Stabile Building at the 
Moffitt Cancer Center and/or to [COMPANY_001]  pharmaceutical (If PK performed.  Samples 
acquisition, results and statisti cs will be recorded into a Microsoft Excel database.  
 
Data for each correlative study performed fr om the whole study population (patients 
receiving TAC+SIR +PANO) will be presented over time and compared to data from 
similar “external control” patients treated TAC/SIR with identical inclusion and exclusion

Immune Reconstitution after TAC/SIR/PANO : 
 
To describe the kinetics of total T cells, CD 4+ (T helper) and CD8+  (T cytotoxic), Th1, 
Th2, Th17, regulatory T-cells (Tregs), CD19+ (B cells), CD56 (NK cells) and DCs cell subsets recovery following TAC/MTX/PANO treat ment FACS analysis will be performed 
on lysed whole blood samples with previously established multicolor antibodies panels.  
FACS Calibur flow cytometer will be used fo r acquisition and analysis will be performed 
with FlowJo software. All appropriate comp ensation tubes, including fluorescence minus 
1, will be prepared from normal donor blood cells. The absolute lymphocyte subset counts will be determined using the formula: (absolute subset count) x (percentage of events positive for the TEST). To test circulating monocytes and/or DCs we will establish a 
lineage negative (Lin-) panel consisting of CD3, CD19, CD16, 14 and CD56 antibodies. 
Monocytes will be characterized by [CONTACT_398]14+, 16+ (or CD16-), CD11c-, CD86- and CD123 
low/neg cells. Dentritic cells subsets will be gated on the Lin- and HLA-DR+ gate.  
Monocytes derived DCs (CD11c+, CD86+, CD 123-), plasmocytoid DC ( CD11c-, CD86+, 
CD123++) and 6-sulfoLacNac DC (slanDC) (M -DC8+/1c-/11c+14- 16+ 45RA+ 5aR+).

be enumerated before PANO administration (day s -30 to -5, 15(+/-3), 28(+/-3), 90(+/-14) 
and 365(+/-45)  in order to determine changes in the absolute cell num bers over time. In a 
group of patients we will correlate the flow  cytometry findings with Western blot 
acetylation analysis of PBMC at the same ti me points. Data for each cell subset from the 
whole study population will be pr esented over time and compared to data from similar

Histone acetylation of T cells a nd DC subsets with TAC/SIR/PANO 
To determine the level of protein acetyla tion and more specifically of hyper-acetylated 
histones (H3 and/or H4) in total T cells, T-re gs, CD4/CD8 and DC subsets in peripheral 
blood we will use multi parameter flow cytome try assay. In a group of patients we will 
correlate the flow cytometry results by [CONTACT_883948]. We speculate  that TAC/SIR/PANO will lead to an overall increase in 
the number of acetylated proteins. It remains to  be determined which T-cell subsets will be 
more susceptible to HDACi with PANO at th is point. In summar y, whole blood will be 
collected and separated in 100 μL aliquot and/or PBMC (5-10x10
6) will be obtained after 
Ficoll-Paque or Buffy coat/RBC lysis separa tion. For multiparameter flow staining, an 
aliquot containing at least 1 x 106 cells will be used per tube if possible.  Cells will be 
washed in PBS and fixed with 0.4% parafo rmaldehyde in PBS for 5-10 minutes at 37ºC 
and washed with buffer. The fixed cells will  be re-suspended in permeabilization buffer for 
5 minutes (0.4% Triton X-100 in wash buffer) and then washed. After fixation and 
permeabilization, cells will be stained with anti- acetylated-lysine or an ti-acetylated histone 
antibodies as well as with a variety of lymphocytes markers (CD4, CD8, CD3, CD25 
and/or CD117) and apoptosis detection mark ers including annexin, 7-AAD and/or caspase 
3. Some antibodies may be directly labeled with fluorochrome prior to their use to 
minimize secondary antibody staining backgr ound. All compensation tubes, including 
fluorescence minus 1, will be prepared from  normal donor blood cells. Test will be done 
before PANO administration on day -5, and on da ys 30 to -5, 15(+/-3), 28(+/-3), 90(+/-14) 
and 365(+/-45).  Data for histone acetyla tion and DC subset from the whole study 
population will be presented over time and compared  to data from similar external control 
patients treated TAC/SIR with identical inclus ion and exclusion criteria except that will 
not be treated with PANO.

 T reg immune-reconstitution, Foxp3+ expression and acetylation with TAC/SIR/PANO 
 
T-regs will be measured w ith the 259D Biosciences Biol egend Foxp3 kit antibody that 
identifies CD4+CD25+ Tregs and/or by [CONTACT_883949]127 
expression. Since Foxp3 requires cell membra ne permeabilization, standard viable dyes 
are not applicable. The Live/Dead Fixable De ad Cell Violet Stain (L/D) from Molecular 
Probes will be used for exclusion of dead cells. We propose that one of the benefit conferred by [CONTACT_702885]/SIR/PANO-based immune s uppression results from apoptosis of 
alloreactive donor non-Treg CD4+ cells while sparing T regulatory cells that mitigate 
GVHD risk and promote immune tolerance. Accordingly, we will study the proportion of 
Treg/total CD4+ cells. We will also measure the expression of FOXP3  and IDO  mRNA in 
PBMC by [CONTACT_937]-PCR. Test will be done before PANO administration on day -30 to -5, and 
on days 30 to -5, 15(+/-3), 28(+/-3), 90(+/-1 4) and 365(+/-45).  Data for T-reg immune 
reconstitution and acetlylation from the whol e study population will be presented over

identical inclusion and exclusion criteria ex cept that will not be treated with PANO. 
 
 
Inflammatory cytokine expression  profiling with TAC/SIR/PANO 
 
In order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883910] 40 
cytokines/chemokines and other relevant proteins in GVHD inflammation (cytokine 
storm) we will use a human inflammati on antibody array assay. The technology is 
designed based on the sandwich immunoassay princi ple. A panel of antibodies (capture) is 
immobilized in the specific spot  locations on the surface of membrane. Incubation of array 
membranes with biological samples results  in capturing cytokines by [CONTACT_883950]. The bound cytokines are detected with  a cocktail of biot inylated antibodies. 
Signals are then visualized using chem iluminescence. We hypothesize that HDACi will 
reduce the level of expression of pro-inflam matory cytokines like TNF/IFN and increase 
level of tolerogenic cytokines (TGFb-b /IL-10). We will use a Raybiotech’s Human 
inflammation antibody array (catalog #, AAH-IN F -3-8) to detect the following cytokines 
IL-1, 2, 3, 4, , 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, [ADDRESS_1236655] will be done before PANO administration on day 30 to -5, 
15(+/-3) and 28(+/-3). Data for inflammatory cytokines from the whole study population will be presented over time and compared to data from similar external control patients

GVHD Biomarkers 
ELISA-based analysis will be used to determine whether a marker panel comprised of IL-
2Rα, TNFR1, HGF, IL-8, Elafin, REG-3 α and ST2 levels tested pr ospectively at 30 to -5, 
and 15(+/-3) after allogeneic HCT is able to predict for the development of acute GVHD. 
Test will be done before PANO administrati on on day –30 to 5, and on days 15+/-1. Data 
for GVHD biomarkers from the whole study po pulation will be presented over time and 
compared to data from similar external cont rol patients treated TAC/SIR with identical

Stat-[ADDRESS_1236656] of HDAC i on PBMCs we will m easure total STAT-3,

28(+/-3), 90(+/-14) and 365(+/ -45).  T-cell STAT5 and S6 phosphorylation will also be 
measured among the external controls on day +30+/-3 and day +90+/314. Data for stat -3/stat-5and S6 phosphorylation and/or acetylat ion subset from the whole study population 
will be presented over time and compared to data from similar external control patients treated TAC/SIR with identical inclusion and ex clusion criteria except that will not be 
treated with PANO.  
 Note: The data gathered on these results will be used for future analysis not considered in 
the context of this proposal. Thus, after identifying changes in phenotype and the 
expression pattern of immune-related genes upon PANO/TAC/SIR treatment, we will expand our research to investigate th e role of PANO in their regulation.

PANO 5 MG PO TIW (3 doses about 48 hours apart in a 7 day period) QW for 26 weeks 
starting prior to stem cell infu sion. During the study, PANO will be administered orally as 
once daily dose. Patients should receive  their once-a-day oral dose of PANO 
approximately at the same time each day in AM . Each dose of PANO should be taken with 
about 8 oz / [ADDRESS_1236658] avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice and seville 
(sour) oranges during the entire study . If the patient forgets to take his/her dose on 
scheduled treatment day or cannot take it due to  mucositis and/or HCT related GI toxicities 
(nausea/vomit), then he/she should take PANO on that same day within 16 hours after the 
missed dose if possible. After more than 16 hour s, that day’s dose s hould be withheld, and 
the patient should wait to take PANO until the next scheduled treatment day (i.e., patients should be instructed not to try to make-up the missed dose after 16 hours). If mucositis 
and/or GI toxicity preclude PANO oral intake, patie nt are allowed to hold up to 3 doses 
and administration should be resumed once mu cositis and/or toxic ity resolves. Patient 
should complete missed doses and then cont inue treatment as planned per protocol 
extending PANO administration period.

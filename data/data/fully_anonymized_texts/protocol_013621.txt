Key Changes  
Original: 
[ADDRESS_1143461]  2013  • The original version of Protocol Number 13- 601, a clinical study that investigated  
PRT062070 (hereafter referred to as “cerdulatinib”), was entitled A Phase I Open- Label, Multi- Dose, Dose -Escalation Study of PRT062070 in Patients with 
Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic  
Lymphoma (SLL)  or B-Cell Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) . 
Amendment  1: 
26 September  2013  Incorporated  changes  to the protocol  as recommended  by [CONTACT_824585]  (IND) Application  118394 for  PRT062070, as  follows: 
• Changed starting  dose from  15 mg BID to 15 mg QD. 
• Clarified  DLT  criteria  regarding the exclusion of patients  for DLT  evaluation  and AEs 
leading  to treatment  discontinuation.  
• Modified  DLT hematologic  criteria  and made  additional changes  to DLT criteria.  
• Added of  CBC and serum chemistry  testing  on Days  1 and 15 for Cycles  2 through  4. 
Amendment  2: 
19 November  2013  • Added additional PK monitoring during  the first cycle.  In order  to do this the cycle 
length was  changed from  21 days to 28 days throughout.  
• Changed the schedule of tumor assessments from every [ADDRESS_1143462]  
assessment  at Cycle  3 to every  3 cycles.  This  maintained  tumor  assessments at every  
12 weeks  with the  new cycle length  of 28 days.  
• Started  QD dosing and allowed  for flexibility  to test BID dosing,  depending on 
available  PK data from  prior cohorts.  
• Added a list of strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  and inducers  and caution  the Investigator  as to 
their use.  
Amendment  3: 
02 April  2015  • Changed the design of the study  so as to conduct  Part 2 (Dose  Expansion phase)  of the 
study using a 45 mg QD dose in 2 Groups  of up to 40 patients  each:  
o Group 1 was planned for patients  with CLL/SLL who had progressed or relapsed  
on prior therapy with any Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (such as  
ibrutinib)  or any phosphatidylinositide  3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor  
(such  as idelalisib)  
o Group 2 was planned  for patients  with FL who had progressed  or relapsed  on prior  
therapy.  
• Substituted the name [CONTACT_824660]062070 throughout the protocol.  Note : The 
title of the study was not changed and still read A Phase I Open -Label, Multi- Dose,  
Dose  Escalation.  
 
Study of PRT062070 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic  
Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) or B -Cell Non -Hodgkin  
Lymphoma (NHL)  
1 Patients  with FL Grade  1 to 3A/iNHL  who have  received  ≥ 1 prior  treatment 
regimen.  
2 Patients with FL Grade 1 to 3A/iNHL  who have received ≥ 1 prior treatment  
regimen.  In addition  to receiving  cerdulatinib,  this cohort  will also receive rituximab  
IV at 375 mg/m2 during Cycle  1 on Days  1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle  1 and  during  
Cycles  4, 6, 8, and 10 on Day 1 only.

Key Changes  
 3 Patients with aggressive NHL (aNHL), defined as DLBCL, FL 3B, MCL, and  
transformed NHL.  These patients have relapsed from ≥ 1 but ≤ 3 prior cytotoxic  
chemotherapy regimens with  an anti CD20  antibody,  (e.g.,  R-CHOP,  BR).  Patients  
must have received an anthracycline based therapy unless anthracyclines were  
deemed inappropriate in the judgement  of the investigator.  
Patients  must  have  either  relapsed  following  ASCT or  not be candidates  (ineligible)  
for ASCT,  defined as meeting any  of the following  criteria  [1]: a) age ≥ 70 years;  
b) DLCO < 50% by [CONTACT_83503]; c) FEV1/FVC < 60% predicted by 
[CONTACT_83503];  d) LVEF  < 45% by [CONTACT_258071];  
e) uncontrolled arrhythmia;  f) calculated  creatinine  clearance  (Cockcroft -Gault)  
≤ 60 mL/min; g) other comorbidities (e.g., medical conditions or psychosocial  
conditions)  that would  likely  result  in an unacceptably  high probability  of treatment/ 
transplant related morbidity and mortality in the judgement of the investigator  (e.g., 
high HCT -CI, CIRS, scores);  h) refusal of  ASCT.  
(Note : Antibody drug conjugates  (ADC)  count  as cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Salvage 
chemotherapy prior to ASCT with or without maintenance therapy counts as one  
regimen.)

a new malignancy (new AE).  
• Corrected  the rituximab  infusion  timepoints  in the Schedule  of Assessments  
(Appendix 1 ) for consistency  with the protocol  body and synopsis.  
• Deleted  the post dose vital signs assessment  at C2D15 in the Schedule  of Assessments  
(Appendix 1) for consistency with the protocol body, as this was incorrectly added to 
the Schedule  of Assessments  in Amendment  7, but this assessment  is not needed.  
• Added AE assessment at C1D9 and deleted AE assessment at long -term follow -up in 
the Schedule  of Assessments in  Appendix  1 (these  were  errors  in Amendment  8).

Exploratory  Objectives  
• To evaluate the relationship  between  markers  of inflammation  with clinical outcome  and overall  health  as 
determined by [CONTACT_824589].  
• To assess Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status in CLL patients achieving a complete response/complete 
response incomplete blood count recovery/partial response (CR/CRi/PR) by [CONTACT_4133].  MRD negativity  
(MRD -) is defined as < [ADDRESS_1143474]+ (MR positivity) is defined as ≥ 1 CLL cell in  
10,000 leucocytes.  
Design  and Methodology:  This is an open -label,  Phase  1/2a, multi- dose,  multi- center  trial of orally  administered  
cerdulatinib  with 2 phases:  
• Phase 1 (closed to enrollment) : Dose -escalation, during which patients will receive single -agent cerdulatinib at 
their assigned  dose level.  
− Patients will have histologically confirmed diagnosis of CLL/SLL or B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma.  In 
addition,  they will meet all other  eligibility  criteria  as specified  in Section  4.0 and applicable  subsections.  
− The starting  dose of cerdulatinib  will be 15 mg once  daily  (15 mg QD).  
− Cerdulatinib  will be administered in increasing dose levels until the MTD/MAD is identified (see  
definitions,  Table  3). If the MTD  is not achieved, the highest  studied  dose will be declared  the MAD and 
become the recommended  Phase 2  dose (RP2D).  
− To allow for a single -dose PK assessment, patients on a QD regimen will take their first dose of cerdulatinib  
on Day 1 and their  second  and subsequent  doses  daily  beginning on Day 4. Patients  will receive cerdulatinib  
once daily for a total of  28 days (one cycle) to assess the MTD/MAD, except on Days 2 and 3, when they 
will not take cerdulatinib.  Patients in twice daily (BID) dosing regimens will start cerdulatinib on Day 1 and  
will not skip any days.  
− One patient will be enrolled  in each dose cohort  until the first report  of a Grade  2 or greater  adverse event  
(AE).  
 In the event  of any Grade  2 or greater  AE in a single  patient,  an additional  2 patients,  for a total of 3, 
will be enrolled  in that dose cohort,  and all subsequent  dose cohorts  will follow  a “3 + 3” design.  
 Dose escalation will be in 100% increments until a drug- related AE of Grade ≥ 2 occurs.  Thereafter, 
dose escalation will be in increments of up to 50% as determined following review by [CONTACT_824590].  
 If a dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT) occurs  in [ADDRESS_1143475]  6 patients.  
o If ≤ 33%  of [ADDRESS_1143476] 3 patients or ≥ 33% of patients in a cohort develop DLT, dose  
escalation  will cease, and that dose  level  will be declared  intolerable.  The prior  dose level will either  
be declared the  MTD,  and the cohort  may be expanded to as  many  as 6 patients  if fewer  than 
6 patients  had been treated previously  at that dose level  in order  to further characterize the PK and 
PD at that level.  
• The study is currently  in Phase  2a: Exploratory, consisting of 6 cohorts,  each defined by [CONTACT_824591]  
− Under Amendment 7, the starting dose of orally administered cerdulatinib is either 30, 25, or 20 mg BID.  
Subsequent de -escalations to 25, 20, and then 15 mg BID are permitted.  A patient who has been de - 
escalated may be re- escalated at the di scretion of the Investigator based upon clinical judgement and with 
Sponsor  Medical  Monitor  approval  per the Dose  Modification  Guidelines for  Phase  2a (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
− The 6 cohorts  are defined below:  
 Cohort 1: Patients with follicular lymphoma Grade [ADDRESS_1143477] received ≥ 1 prior treatment  
regimen.  
 Cohort  2: Patients with  FL Grade  [ADDRESS_1143478]  received  ≥ 1 prior  treatment  regimen.  In addition  
to receiving cerdulatinib, this cohort will also receive rituximab IV at 375 mg/m2 during Cycle 1 on 
Days  1, 8, 15, and 22 and during Cycles  4, 6, 8,  and 10 on Day 1 only.

patients have relapsed from ≥ 1 but ≤ 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens with an anti CD20 
antibody, (e.g., R -CHOP, BR).  Patients must have either relapsed fol lowing autologous stem cell  
therapy (ASCT) or not be candidates (ineligible) for ASCT, defined as meeting any of the following criteria [ 1]: a) age ≥ 70 years; b) DLCO < 50% by [CONTACT_83503]; c) forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_661980] 1 second/forced vital capacity;  (FEV
1/FVC)  < 60% predicted by  [CONTACT_824592];  d) 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by [CONTACT_231253] (MUGA) or  
echocardiogram;  e) uncontrolled arrhythmia,  f) calculated creatinine  clearance (Cockcroft -Gault)  
≤ 60 mL/min; g) other comorbidities (e.g., medical conditions or psychosocial conditions) that would 
likely result in an unacceptably high probability of treatment/transplant related morbidity and mortality  
in the judgement  of the investigator  (e.g., high Hematopoietic  Cell Transplantation  Co-Morbidity  Index 
(HCT -CI), Cumulative  Illness  Rating  Scale (CIRS) scores);  h) refusal of ASCT.  
(Note : Antibody drug conjugates  (ADC)  count  as cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Salvage chemotherapy  
prior  to ASCT  with or without  maintenance therapy  counts  as one regimen.)  
 Cohort  4: Patients  with CLL/SLL who  have  received  ≥ 1 prior  treatment  regimen.  
 Cohort 5: Patients with peripheral T -cell lymphoma (PTCL) NHL who have received ≥ [ADDRESS_1143479]

Criteria  for Evaluation:  
Efficacy  (Primary  and Secondary)  
Response Criteria:  Response in NHL patients will be evaluated using The Lugano Classification [ 4]; in CLL 
patients using the Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Guidelines for the Diagnos is and  
Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [ 2]; and in CTCL patients using the modified Severity Weighted 
Assessment Tool (mSWAT) and other measures as appropriate [ 5]. Appendix 4 provides definitions and detailed 
descriptions of response criteria as well as guidance on selection of lesions for evaluation.  Redacted copi[INVESTIGATOR_824524].  
Tumor/Lymph Node Biopsies:  If tumor or lymph node or skin biopsies (including CTCL patients) biopsies are  
obtained during the course of the patient’s treatment, redacted copi[INVESTIGATOR_824525].  In addition,  a portion  of the tumor  block  or at a minimum  of 10 unstained slides  should be  sent 
for review  as discussed  in earlier  sections  of the protocol.

achieving a CR or CRi or PR using 4- color flow cytometry.  MRD negativity (MRD -) is defined as < [ADDRESS_1143496]  positivity  (MRD+) is  defined as  ≥ 1 CLL  cell in 10,000 leucocytes.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Phase  1: Blood  samples will be obtained at frequent  intervals for  determination  of 
cerdulatinib concentration.  Parameters calculated for all patients will be:  plasma half -life (t ½); time to maximum  
observed plasma concentration (T max); maximum observed plasma concentration (C max); minimum observed plasma  
concentration  (Cmin); area under the  plasma  concentration- time curve  from  [ADDRESS_1143497]  measurable concentration  
(AUC 0-last) computed using the linear trapezoidal rule;  total area under the plasma concentration -time curve from  
time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞); clearance of cerdulatinib (CL/F); volume of distribution of cerdulatinib at steady state  
(Vss/F); amount of drug excreted in urine over the sampling interval (Ae) for those patients for whom total volume  
of urine was collected; accumulation ratio, calculated by [CONTACT_12265] 0-12 at steady -state/AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1143498] dose for  
those  patients  for whom  the 12 -hour sample  was collected.  
Phase 2a: In order to further characterize the PK of cerdulatinib (specifically, C min), serial plasma PK samples will 
be collected on  Cycle  [ADDRESS_1143499]-dose.  PK samples  will also be  
taken pre -dose at Cycle 1 Day 15 , Cycle 2 Day 1, and prior to Cycles 3, 6, 9, and every 3 cycles thereafter (to 
correspond with tumor  assessment).  Additional unscheduled PK plasma  samples may  be taken  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator (e.g.,  in the event  of an AE or dose change).  
Pharmacodynamic  Assessments: Serum  will be obtained  at various  time points  throughout  the trial to determine  
the effects of cerdulatinib on markers of inflammation.  DNA and RNA (DNA only for Phase 2a) will be isolated  
from optional tumor biopsy specimens to assess genetic mutations relevant to the disease and the mechanism of  
action of cerdulatinib.  The following will be assessed:  quantification of serum proteins, quantitative polymerase  
chain reaction (PCR) for tumor relevant transcripts; hybridization of RNA to gene arrays, and DNA sequencing to 
identify  disease -relevant  mutations.

Safety : Safety  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_824594], vital  signs, hematology  and chemistry  laboratory  studies,  
concomitant medications, and reported AEs (including deaths and other serious adverse events [SAEs] and 
treatment -related  AEs).  
Study Committee : Select study participants will comprise the Study Committee (e.g., selected Principal 
Investigators, Portola’s Medical Monitor, Clinical Study Manager, and Drug Safety Medical Monitor).  Other  
Portola  or outside  personnel may be called  or consulted as  needed.  The Study  Committee  composition and 
functions are fully defined in Section 7.6. During P hase 1, the Study Committee will meet after all patients in any  
cohort have completed Cycle 1 to determine whether it is safe to escalate to the next dose of cerdulatinib or whether 
the MTD/MAD dose has been reached.  If it is safe to continue, the committee will determine the next dose level to  
be studied.  During Phase 2a, the Study Committee will meet periodically to review available safety and efficacy  
data from the study.  Following the first meeting of the Study Committee, subsequent meetings will be held 
periodically as needed.  Data to be evaluated may include (but are not limited to):  deaths, other SAEs, AEs,  
including treatment -related AEs; reasons for treatment discontinuation or dose modification/interruption, trends in 
laboratory evaluations, and efficacy. For the combination cohort with rituximab, the Study Committee will evaluate  
(using the assessments as outline  above)  the first [ADDRESS_1143500] of the other cohorts  as above.  
Statistical  Methods:  
General Considerations:  Statistical summaries are expected to be performed using SAS software Version 9.3  
(SAS Institute,  Inc., Cary,  NC, [LOCATION_003])  or higher.  Additional software  may be used for the production  of graphics.  
Analysis Populations:  The safety analysis population will consist of all patients treated with at least 1 dose of study  
medication (cerdulatinib).  Safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994], based on the original assigned dose of  
study drug.  The efficacy analysis population for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will consist of all  
patients who have taken at least [ADDRESS_1143501] data at the required time points.  In order to determine cohort comparability, baseline and 
demographic characteristics of the Phase 1 and 2a cohorts will be summarized by [CONTACT_178895].  No 
formal  analyses  of these  data are planned,  but descri ptive  statistics  may be used to aid in interpreting  results.  
Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints:  Responses will be classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR),  
stable disease (SD), disease progression (PD), or not evaluable.  The overall response rate (ORR, defined as  
CR+PR) and clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) will be summarized along with two -sided exact 95% confidence  
intervals.  Responses will be based on computed tomography (CT) or computed tomography/positron emission 
tomography (CT/P ET), evaluated per revised IWG Criteria [3 ] for patients with lymphoma and on peripheral  
lymphocyte counts and bone marrow biopsy results for patients with CLL [ 2]. Listings of tumor response for each  
patient will also be provided.  Responses will  be summarized  separately  for each dose level  in Phase  1 and for each 
cohort and dose level in Phase 2a.  Due to differences in underlying disease and prior treatment, response rates  
considered clinically significant and that would prompt further study will depend on the cohort.  Such summaries  
will also depend on the safety and tolerability profile observed.  While it is anticipated that a 30 to 40% response  
rate will be sufficient to support  further investigation,  no criteria  for success  in this study are specified.  
In addition to the tumor response rates described above, the following efficacy endpoints will be assessed:  duration 
of response (DOR), progression -free survival (PFS), lymph node response (LNR), and time -to-treatment response 
(TTR) (see definitions  in Table  3). 
Exploratory Efficacy  – Phase  2a Only  
As an exploratory assessment, patients will be asked to complete a Global Health Assessment ( Appendix 8 ) to 
assess  whether  patients  feel their overall  health  is improving  on this study.  The correlation  between  markers  of 
inflammation  with clinical response  and the overall health  (Global  Health  Assessment)  will be assessed.  
An additional  exploratory assessment,  detection  of minimal residual  disease  (MRD)  in CLL  patients  achieving  a CR 
or CRi or PR will also be performed using at least 4 color flow cytometry by [CONTACT_824595] a designated central  
lab in blood an d/or marrow. MRD - (MRD negativity) defined as < [ADDRESS_1143502]+ (MRD  
positivity)  is defined as ≥ 1 CLL  cell in 10,000  leucocytes.

Pharmacokinetic Analyses : PK parameters will be calculated for each patient for which adequate samples are  
available  and summarized.  
Pharmacodynamic Analyses, Phase 1 and 2a: A number of PD parameters (described above) will be measured  
serially.  At each time point,  each of these  parameters will be summarized by  [CONTACT_15994].  In addition , the parameters  
over time  will be plotted for  each patient and dose  cohort.  No formal  statistical analyses  are planned.  
Safety,  Phase  1 and 2a:  For the Phase 1 portion  of the study,  the primary  safety  endpoint is  the incidence of DLT  by 
[CONTACT_824596] (classified by [CONTACT_12134]- CTCAE v5.0), clinically  
significant changes in vital signs and physical exams by [CONTACT_15994], and changes in hematology and chemistry 
laboratory parameters  by [CONTACT_15994].  The incidence  of DLT  will be summarized and listed  by [CONTACT_824597]  1. 
For the Phase 1 and Phase 2a portions of the study, AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute  
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) v5.[ADDRESS_1143503] Medical  
Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  version available  at the time of database creation. The number  and 
percent of patients with any AE will be presented by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and preferred term for each cohort  
will be summarized by [CONTACT_824598] 1 and by [CONTACT_824599] 2a.  An additional summary will include all 
patients who received the dose used in Phase 2a.  Vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECG intervals will be  
summarized and listed by [CONTACT_824600] 1 and by [CONTACT_824601] 2a.  No formal  
statistical analyses  are planned.  
Sample  Size Considerations  
Phase 1:  The sample size is based on clinical judgment and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_824526].  A total of  
approxi mately  [ADDRESS_1143504] been enrolled  with 43 dosed in sites in North  America. 
Phase 2a:  For the initial opening of this portion of the study, patients will be enrolled into 3 cohorts only:  
Cohorts 1 (FL), 3 (aggressive NHL [aNHL]), and 4 (CLL/SLL).  Further cohorts may be opened or closed and the  
starting  dose for patients  may be  adjusted  at the discretion  of the Sponsor,  and the  Sponsor  will notify  the 
Investigators/site when the other cohorts will be open or closed to enrollment or when the starting dose is adjusted.  
Initial enrollment  into any cohort will be up to 20  patients; cohorts may  be expanded  to 40-[ADDRESS_1143505] 20 patients,  enrollment in the cohort will be closed, as the upper  bound (UB)  of the 95% confidence  
interval would be approximately  25%.  If 2 or more  responses  are seen, the cohort  may be expanded.  With  
40 patients in a cohort, an observed response rate of 30% will have a 2- side d exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of  
(16.6%,  46.5%);  an observed  response  rate of  20% will have  a 2-sided exact  95% CI of  9.1%,  35.7%.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Cerdulatinib  (PRT062070) 
Cerdulatinib  (PRT062070) is an orally available, reversible, small molecule ATP competitive 
inhibitor of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) and the Janus kinase (JAK) family that will be 
developed for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies, including non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL)  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma CLL/SLL.  
 
SYK, as a key component of Fc receptor signaling and of the BCR signaling pathway, has been 
demonstrated  to be an important target  in the disruption of cell survival sign als mediated  through 
BCR.  It has been suggested that SYK may mediate survival signals in DLBCL, Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma (MCL), and FL [ 7-9]. The JAK/STAT pathway, important in cytokine signaling has 
also been reported to be activated in B cell lymphomas and the resistance of some DLBCL  
appears related to mutations that drive NFkB- mediated JAK/pSTAT3 activation [ 10]. CLL is  
another B- cell malignancy  that appears to be dependent on BCR and thus S YK signaling [ 11]. 
Additionally, several  cytokines have been reported to  be increased  in CLL and may  be important 
in promoting CLL cell survival and proliferation through interaction with the tumor microenvironment [ 12]. The cytokines, IL-2, IL 4, and INF-α have been shown  to promote 
CLL cell survival through the anti-apoptotic effects of up-regulation of BCL2 family proteins 
[13-15].  Studies have also shown that disruption of cytokine signaling via inhibition of JAK has  
the potential to reverse  the cytoprotection provided to CLL cells by [CONTACT_824603] [ 16]. 
 
Please refer  to the Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB) for more  details.  
 
1.2. Pharmacology Studies  of Cerdulatinib  
Multiple in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies have been undertaken to evaluate the activity 
of cerdulatinib. Cerdulatinib was studied in vitro against a panel of purified kinase assays  
followed by [CONTACT_824604], JAK1,  JAK2,  JAK3, and TYK2. 
Significant potency was observed against signaling pathways utilizing SYK, JAK1, JAK3, and 
TYK2.  SYK-dependent BCR signaling and functional responses were inhibited with a half 
maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC 50) in the  range of 0.[ADDRESS_1143521]  pathways  utilizing  JAK1/3  (Interleukin  (IL)-2, 
IL 4) and  JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 (IL -6) was observed, with IC50 values ranging from  0.[ADDRESS_1143522] been studied in B-cell tumor xenografts, in a rodent 
model of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and in rodent models of arthritis. In the subcutaneous xenograft study, Ramos (Burkitt’s lymphoma line) tumor growth was measured at various intervals. Inhibition of tumor growth was found to be comparable to that of vehicle 
controls. The lack of efficacy  was likely  the result  of inadequate exposure of cerdulatinib, where  
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143523] dose were below the level  known to  
demonstrate inhibition of Ramos cell viability  in vitro . 
 
In an effort to overcome the challenges of the poor pharmacokinetics (PK) in mice, an 
intravenous (IV) tumor model was utilized, in which mice received an IV injection of Ramos 
cells, followed by [CONTACT_824605] 3 days of tumor growth. Time to hind limb paralysis, a  
marker  of tumor growth  and the primary  efficacy  endpoint, was  significantly  delayed  in animals  
treated  with cerdulatinib at a  dose of 30 mg/kg twice  daily  (BID).  
 
Cerdulatinib was also studied in a model of chronic BCR stimulation and splenomegaly. BCR stimulation  and subsequent splenomegaly were induced in mice following  injections of an  
anti-mouse BCR antibody. Doses of 15 mg/kg or greater were effective in reducing the 
splenomegaly compared to that observed in vehicle- treated animals.  In a murine model of ITP, 
Fc receptor (FcR) mediated antibody -induced platelet clearance was significantly inhibited by 
[CONTACT_824606] a dose of 30 mg/kg, affirming the ability of this compound to 
interfere with SYK -dependent FcR signaling. 
 
Two rodent models of arthritis have demonstrated the ability of cerdulatinib to interfere with  
SYK and JAK- mediated inflammation.  In the mouse passive anti-collagen antibody induced 
arthritis (CAIA) model, inflammation and swelling were completely inhibited following cerdulatinib treatment at 30 mg/kg BID.  In the rat collagen -induced arthritis model (CIA), 
treatment  with cerdulatinib  was initiated  following  the observation of paw inflammation.  
Progression of the arthritis  and inflammation  were completely  suppressed in  animals  treated  with  
cerdulatinib  at doses of 5 mg/kg BID or  higher. 
 
The PK properties of cerdulatinib were evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey following IV and oral (po) dosing. Systemic clearance (CL
ss) was much higher in the mouse compared with  
CLss in rat, dog, and monkey. The volume of distribution (V ss) was also highest in the mouse 
compared to other species. The apparent terminal half -life (t ½) ranged from 1.16 to 15.9 hours 
after IV administration.  Cerdulatinib  was well absorbed in rat  and monkey (oral  bioavailability; 
F = 22.3-30.9%) and completely  absorbed in dog (F = 113%). 
 
In the rat, the PK of cerdulatinib was non-linear following both IV and po administration. 
Between  1 and  10 mg/kg IV,  the clearance of cerdulatinib  decreased  from  14.4 mL/min/kg  to 
7.81 mL/min/kg. Following po dosing at 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg, AUC 0-∞ increased greater than  
dose-proportionally from 1  to 50 mg/kg. These data suggest that  certain elimination  pathways 
may be saturated at higher doses, resulting in a greater  than dose-proportional increase 
in exposure.

Protocol  Amendment  9

In the dog, non-linear PK was observed following po dosing at 25 mg/kg. After 5 days of 
dosing, the exposure of cerdulatinib on Day 5 was higher than expected when comparing AUC
0-24 on Day 5 to AUC 0-∞ on Day 1. However, when compared to the exposure following 
administration  of single po doses of 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg, the dose- normalized AUC 0-∞ of the 
15 and 50 mg/kg were lower than that of the 5 mg/kg. Therefore, the PK of cerdulatinib in the 
dog is possibly influenced by [CONTACT_824607](es) and the 
limited  absorption of the compound. 
 
Protein  binding for cerdulatinib  in mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and  human plasma was  
91.7, 95.6, 83.2, 88.1, and 89.5%, respectively. Studies of bile-duct cannulated rats have shown that the major route of elimination for cerdulatinib appears to be metabolism.  Cerdulatinib can  
be metabolized by [CONTACT_104799] 1A1, 1B1, 2J2, and 3A4. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the 
major  route of metabolism of cerdulatinib  by [INVESTIGATOR_20325],  dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes  
and hepatocytes.  
 
The capacity of cerdulatinib to inhibit the major human liver CYP isozymes (CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) was evaluated using pooled human liver microsomes and isozyme 
specific probe substrates.  Cerdulatinib did not demonstrate significant inhibition at 
concentrations up to [ADDRESS_1143524] to time -dependent inhibition, cerdul atinib  
demonstrated significant inhibition (≥ 30%) of CYP3A4 at [ADDRESS_1143525] the levels of co-administered drugs 
that are metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4  similar to a  CYP inhibitor. 
 
1.3. Safety  Pharmacology Studies  
The cardiovascular safety of cerdulatinib was assessed in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In a 
non-Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) human ether -à-go-go- related gene (hERG) radio -ligand 
binding displacement assay, cerdulatinib (10 and 50 μM) generated 10% and 34% inhibition of 
binding to the hERG receptor. In a non- GLP in vitro patch clamp study using transfected HEK 
293 cells, cerdulatinib (50 μM) inhibited the potassium channel by 42%, compared to 69% for the positive control. In the subsequent GLP patch clamp study, 30 μM cerdulatinib resulted in a 38% inhibition of IKr tail current density. A non- GLP in vitro study of the effect of cerdulatinib  
on action potential duration was conducted in isolated Purkinje fibers from canine hearts.  
Cerdulatinib did not prolong action potential durations up to [ADDRESS_1143526] on heart rate and 
blood pressure  up to plasma  concentrations of 5 to 10 μM. In a non- GLP  study telemetrized  
dogs received 25 mg/kg cerdulatinib or vehicle. Telemetry data for QT interval, heart rate,  
systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded from [ADDRESS_1143527] study drug. Mean plasma levels at C
max were 4.7 µM and were maintained > 2 μM for up to 
6 hours. No changes in QTc  interval were observed, heart rate increased  by ~20 beats per  minute  
for 7  hours but remained  within  the normal range,  diastolic  and mean  arterial  blood pressure  
were unchanged, and systolic blood pressure showed sporadic decreases (3 and 20 hours) that were not considered biologically meaningful. A GLP cardiovascular safety study was also  
performed in dogs. Dogs maintained normal sinus rhythm and no consistent changes in QT 
morphology were observed.  A number of changes in R-R interval and in diastolic, systolic, and 
mean arterial pressure were noted, however, although statistically significant these changes were 
generally considered incidental and not adverse. The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this  
study was determined to  be 50 mg/kg. 
 
A GLP respi[INVESTIGATOR_824529]. Male rats received cerdulatinib at 0, 25, 30, 
or 60 mg/kg.  There were no  statistically  significant changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_824530]. 
Non dose-dependent but statistically significant changes in tidal volume between [ADDRESS_1143528] level  (NOAEL)  for this study was determined to  be 60 mg/kg. 
 
A GLP central nervous system (CNS) safety pharmacology study was conducted in rats. Low  
arousal/reactivity to environment was observed at dose levels of 30 and 60 mg/kg. Statistically  
significant changes in motor activity were noted for males given 60 mg/kg. Similar but not statistically  significant changes were observed in female rats. The NOAEL for  cerdulatinib was 
considered  to be 30 mg/kg in males and 60 mg/kg in females.  
 
A non- GLP Side Effect Panel screen was performed to assess the ability of cerdulatinib to  
interact with neurotransmitter related receptors, steroid receptors, ion channels, prostaglandins, 
growth factors/hormones, brain/gut peptides, and enzymes. Of the 63 tested, cerdulatinib at a  
concentration of 10 μM significantly  inhibited ligand binding to only 2 (adenosine 
[non- selective]  neurotransmitter  receptor  [58%] and  sodium [site  2] ion channel [47%]). 
 
1.4. Nonclinical Toxicology Studies  
Single dose toxicity  studies of cerdulatinib, given by [CONTACT_16759],  were conducted in mouse, rat, 
and dogs. Deaths occurred  in mice  receiving  1,000 mg/kg or more,  and in rats receiving  
300 mg/kg. Additional observations included scruffy  coat,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], and  abnormal gait  in 
mice receiving 300 mg/kg, and weight loss in rats receiving 100 mg/kg. Dogs developed 
vomiting, loose stools, and a transient decrease in neutrophils at a dose of 50 mg/kg; all symptoms/signs recovered within 24 hours.

Non-GLP repeat dose, dose-ranging studies were conducted in mouse, rat, and dog. In mice  
given 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg daily for 12 days, the NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day. Body weight 
loss, bone marrow hypoplasia, enteropathy, lack of splenic germinal centers, and thymic 
depletion were noted at doses of 100 mg/kg or greater. In a similar study, rats received 4, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day given in divided doses BID for 11 days. The NOAEL  was determined  to be 
30 mg/kg. Deaths  occurred  at 100 mg/kg/day. Additionally,  AST/ALT  increased  by 2 to 3×, 
and animals given 100 mg/kg/day were observed to have myocardial necrosis, hepatic necrosis, 
thymic lymphoid depletion, and severe bone marrow hypoplasia. Bone marrow hypoplasia was 
also observed in 25% of animals given 30 mg/kg/day, along with mild thymic lymphoid depletion and  a decrease in body  weight gain. Two non- GLP  studies were conducted  in dogs. 
Dogs were given 25 mg/kg/day for 5 days or 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg/day for 11 days. In the 5 -day 
study reversible decreases in neutrophils and total WBC were observed without clinical chemistry  changes.  In the 11- day study, dogs given 20 mg/kg/day had decreased  WBC, without 
effects  on other hematological parameters.  
 
GLP -compliant toxicology studies were conducted in the rat and dog. Sprague- Dawley rats were  
given 0, 2.5, 6.0, or 15 mg/kg/day of cerdulatinib by [CONTACT_27176] 28 days. Recovery animals  
were included in the 0 and 15 mg/kg/day groups; recovery group animals given 15 mg/kg/day died or were euthanized during the recovery period (Study Days 29 and 38), but the deaths were attributed to phlebotomy procedure. The primary finding in male rats receiving 15 mg/kg/day 
was a statistically significant decrease in body weight gain. All dose groups had fewer mean 
WBC, lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, basophil, and reticulocyte numbers compared to vehicle treated animals, however the changes were within the reference range and  
thus not considered biologically meaningful. Both male and female rats had statistically  
significant increases in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), however the magnitude of the change was < 2x and findings did not correlate with gross or micr oscopic findings. All cerdulatinib -treated rats had spleen and thymus 
weights less than vehicle- treated rats.  Changes related to the pharmacologic activity of 
cerdulatinib, or that were not dose-dependent or associated with gross or microscopic pathologic 
findings were considered  not adverse.  T-cell immune response was  also assessed in  this study. 
All main study animals were immunized with 0.5 mg Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) on 
Day 12. Analysis for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) showed both an IgM and IgG response that did not appear to be affected by [CONTACT_824608]. The  
NOAEL was considered to be 6.0 mg/kg in male rats and > 15 mg/kg in female rats. Mean  
C
max/AUC for male rats at 6.0 mg/kg/day was 445 ng/mL/4,886 ng*hr/ mL, while the mean  
Cmax/AUC  for female rats at 15 mg/kg/day was 2,737 ng/mL/31,391 ng*hr/mL. 
A 28 -day repeat dose study was also conducted in dogs. Dogs received 0, 0.75, 2.5, 5.0, or 
50/20/15 (multiple dose reductions) mg/kg/day of cerdulatinib by [CONTACT_16759]. One death  
occurred on Day 7 in the 50 mg/kg/day group; the remaining animals in this group were dose 
reduced to 20 mg/kg/day on Day 10, then again to 15 mg/kg/day on Day 13 and Days 16 to 22.

This group was terminated on  Day  22. Vomiting  and fecal  changes  were  present in  dogs treated  
at 2.5 mg/kg/day or more. Decreased activity was observed in animals receiving 5.0 mg/kg/day 
or more.  T-lymphocyte counts were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in all animals 
receiving cerdulatinib at doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day or more. B-lymphocyte counts were also 
generally lower. Reductions in indicators of erythroid mass and in reticulocyte counts were observed in the high dose group and in animals from the  2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg dose groups. 
Reductions in WBC, including neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were also seen in these 3 dose 
groups. All hematologic changes showed complete recovery by [CONTACT_283656]. 
Thymus and spleen weights were decreased in the 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg dose groups. Microscopic findings considered related to cerdulatinib included hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal glands; changes, including atrophy of the submucosal glands, of the esophagus; 
multifocal necrosis of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_824531] (5.0 and 50/20/15 mg/kg); lymphoid depletion of the cervical lymph nodes, thymus, and  spleen;  multifocal degeneration  of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_824532], and multinucleated  spermatids of the seminiferous tubules (2.5, 5.0, and 
50/20/15 mg/kg). Changes in the bone marrow, including hypocellularity, increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, and reduced total erythroid counts were observed in animals from the 5.0 and 50/20/15 mg/kg dose groups. The NOAEL for cerdulatinib was determined to be 2.5 mg/kg/day for females and 0.75 mg/kg/day for males. The NOAEL was determined to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. 
At 0.75 mg/kg mean C
max ranged from 216 to 231 ng/mL while AUC ranged from 1,219 to 
1,751 ng*hr/mL. At 2.5 mg/kg, the mean C max in females was  733 ng/mL and AUC was  
4,430 ng*hr/mL. 
 
The genotoxic/mutagenic potential of cerdulatinib was studied in both a GLP- compliant AMES  
assay  and in a GLP -compliant rat bone marrow micronucleus assay  with Liver Comet  Assay.  
Cerdulatinib showed a low potential for mutagenicity in the AMES assay. Similarly, results of  
the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay  showed a  low probability that cerdulatinib  is genotoxic 
or mutagenic (no DNA breaks or increased  nuclear fragments).  
 
For the Phase 1 trial, a starting dose of 15 mg QD has been proposed based on the STD 10 in rats  
of 15 mg/kg. This dose is predicted to provide a steady state C max and AUC of approximately 
28 ng/mL (0.06 µM) and  225 ng*hr/mL, respectively, which  is expected to  yield  Cmax and AUC  
exposures of 8-fold and 7-fold lower than the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 
dog of 0.75 mg/kg/day. 
 
Thus, the pharmacology and nonclinical safety data described above support this initial proposed 
clinical trial of cerdulatinib, which is designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),  
evaluate the safety  profile,  and assess the  pharmacokinetic (PK) profile  of cerdulatinib  in patients  
with relapsed/refractory  lymphoid malignancies.

1.5. Cerdulatinib Phase  1 Interim  Results  
The Phase 1 portion of the  study is closed to enrollment. 
 
Cerdulatinib  data were presented at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in 
June 2015 [ 17]. Doses studied included 15 to  65 mg po daily. Data for 30  patients  demonstrated  
multiple  nodal responses, and 4 patients demonstrated partial responses (PRs): at 30  mg in 
1 patient with del 17p CLL who had relapsed after 6 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; at 45 mg in 1 patient with 
CLL who had received 4 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 1 patient with follicular lymphoma (FL) who had 
received 3 prior th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and at 65 mg in 1 patient with a transformed diffuse large B- cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL; MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 expression by [CONTACT_9064] [IHC]) who 
had relapsed approximately 1 year after 1 prior therapy. No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were  
observed  as of that time.  The PK parameters, specifically  the half -life (t½ of ~24  hours) and  a 
2:1 peak-trough ratio, indicated the suitability of once-daily dosing with cerdulatinib. Evidence of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity was observed for multiple markers of inflammation and cytokines, as well  as complete inhibition  of peripheral  blood SYK and JAK signaling pathways. 
 
After evaluation of the 65 mg dose cohort was completed, dose escalation proceeded to the 
100 mg dose level.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) findings from the 100 mg daily  dose level  were  
consistent with those from the 40 to 65 mg dose levels, indicating a plateau in exposure. Further analysis  indicated the likely  cause of this  was cerdulatinib solubility.  
 
A 45 mg twice daily (BID) dosing cohort was studied, which showed an increase in AUC and 
minimum and maximal concentrations (C min and C max, respectively).  The 45 mg BID level  
roughly doubled the exposure relative to the 40 to 100 mg once daily (QD) average, achieving steady- state C
min and C max of 1.5 and 1.8 µM, respectively. Under this dose regimen, 1 patient 
with FL achieved  a PR,  with what  appeared  to be a rapid  (within  1 week)  onset of palpable 
tumor reduction. Another patient with CLL experienced rapid lymphocytosis, whereas a 
refractory FL patient demonstrated stable disease (SD).  The 45 mg BID dose regimen, however, 
resulted in 2 DLTs: [ADDRESS_1143529] exposures 
at this dose leve l. Thus, we aggregated all data from the escalation portion of the study to date to 
explore the PK  profile.  
 
All AEs of Grade 3 or higher and all SAEs (including 2 fatal SAEs) considered to be related to 
cerdulatinib reported during the Phase 1 portion of the study in 43 dosed patients are summarized 
in Table 4  and Table 5 , respectively.  (Data cutoff is of 25 March 2016; although Phase [ADDRESS_1143530] been rolled over into the Phase 2a portion of the study.)

however,  some  patients  enrolled under  Phase  1 are still receiving  cerdulatinib  in Phase 2a.  
 
 
Pharmacokinetic modeling and exploration of the PK/PD and PK/AE data from the Phase 1 
portion indicated that a dose of 35 mg BID should provide adequate exposure as well as 
inhibition  of the desired  targets  of cerdulatinib.  Further explanation  of the data and  rationale  for 
dosing during Phase 2a portion of the study is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
During Phase 1, PRs have been observed in CLL (including 17p deleted CLL), FL, and transformed follicular lymphoma.  CR was observed in [ADDRESS_1143531] been durable in several patients  [18]. 
 
1.6. Background on the  NHL  in the Study  
The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a diverse group of disorders of proliferating  B, T, or 
NK cells, and collectively, NHL is the seventh leading site of new cancer cases in the United  
States (US) in men and women [ 19]. In the US, B -cell lymphomas are diagnosed in 
approximately 85 to 90% of people, and T- cell NHL comprises the majority of the remaining  
10 to 15%. In 2015, approximately 72,000 people in the US will be diagnosed with NHL, and there will be  nearly  20,000 deaths. 
 
The overall incidence of NHL has increased since the 1970s through the 1990s, partially due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the incidence of NHL in older individuals is 
also increasing, and thus the median age of patients with NHL has increa sed as well.  Many of 
these older patients  have multiple comorbid  conditions that complicate  NHL  treatment  [19, 20 ]. 
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143532] 10 to 15 years, the treatment of NHL and CLL/SLL has changed from treatment 
regimens comprising a variety of combinations of cytotoxic therapeutics to the introduction of 
multiple  novel therapeutic modalities.  Perhaps  the most significant of these have been  the anti- 
CD20+ antibodies (most prominently rituximab); however, novel purine/pyrimidine analogues 
(fludarabine) and alkylating agents (bendamustine) have also resulted in significant changes to the treatment paradigms for both NHL and CLL/SLL. More recently, novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway (fostamatinib, 
idelalisib, ibrutinib) have entered clinical trials.  Response rates have demonstrated the 
dependency  of many of the NHL  subtypes, and particularly  CLL/SLL, on  BCR signaling 
for survival [ 20-23].  
 
1.6.1. Aggressive B- cell Lymphomas 
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for 30 to 40% of B- cell NHL [ 19, 24].  
Follicular lymphoma, Grade 3B (FL3B), accounts for < 10% of all FLs and behaves similarly to DLBCL [ 25]. Similarly, transformed NHL refers to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_824533] a more aggressive lymphoma, with varying reported rates of transformation [ 26]. 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for 6% of NHL and often can have a more aggressive 
course [ 19]. The underlying biology behind the various aggressive lymphomas is diverse and 
may involve mutations or overexpression of MYC, BCL2, and other oncogenes [ 19, 24, 26, 27].  
SYK inhibition, as well as inhibition of various cytokines in the JAK-STAT pathway, demonstrated  activity  against various B- cell lymphoma cell lines  [1]. 
 
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_824534] -CD20 antibody, 
rituximab, combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine (formerly oncovin), and prednisolone (CHOP; i.e., the R- CHOP  
regimen).  This can  produce durable remissions  in a number of patients  and lead  to cure.  
Patients  who relapse are often treated with  a variety  of salvage regimens and may  receive  
high-dose chemotherapy with stem  cell rescue,  which  in some cases  may  also be curative  
[19, 24-26].  Unfortunately, not all patients are candidates for high-dose chemotherapy  with stem  
cell rescue due to a variety of factors such as age and organ dysfunction (cardiac, pulmonary, 
renal,  hepatic); thus, these patients  are in need of alternative  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  [28]. 
 
Unfortunately, limited treatment options exist for the patient who has a disease relapse or is  
refractory  to therapy. In the case of MZL,  ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BTK,  has been  approved for 
relapsed/refractory patients [ 29]. There are limited treatment options for patients with  
relapsed/refractory DLBCL, transformed NHL, MCL, cell lymphoma, or FL3B [ 19, 26, 30, 31].  
Newer  agents are needed.  
 
1.6.2. Rituximab in  the Treatment  of B- cell NHL  
Rituximab  is a chimeric  monoclonal ant ibody directed  against  the CD20 antigen  expressed on 
normal and  malignant B- cells [32, 33].  Rituximab’s  mechanism  of action involves antibody 
Clinical Study 13 -601

Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  44  
  
 
dependent cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC), complement mediated cytotoxicity  (CDC), and direct 
induction of apoptosis [ 33]. 
 
Rituximab was originally approved by [CONTACT_40563] 1997 for the treatment of relapsed or 
refractory low -grade NHL.  Subsequently, it was approved in combination with chemotherapy 
for both front- line follicular NHL, diffuse large B -cell NHL, and as chemotherapy in previously 
treated or untreated CLL [ 32, 34, 35].  Rituximab is also approved as a maintenance therapy for 
low-grade NHL.  It has also been used in the treatment of other B- cell NHL such as relapsed  
Waldenstrom’s  macroglobulinemia (WM)  and MCL [ 19, 32, 36].  
 
The drug is given in a variety of doses and schedules and is generally well tolerated. Several  
types of adverse events  (AEs)  have been  observed  with  rituximab  administration  when  used  for 
the treatment of NHL, including infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, hematotoxicity, and increased  incidence of infections [ 33, 34 ]. 
 
In combination with chemotherapy, rituximab-containing regimens have consistently 
demonstrated  improvements in  overall  survival (OS),  and overall  response rate (ORR)  vs. 
chemotherapy  alone.  It is now a mainstay  of B- cell NHL  therapy  [19, 37 ]. 
 
1.6.3. T-cell NHL  (PTCL,  CTCL)  
T-cell NHL comprises approximately 10 to 15% of the total cases of NHL, resulting in 
approximately 7,000 to 10,000 cases/year in the US [ 19, 38].  The 2008 World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification has a multitude of subtypes of PTCL, and the majority of 
them  are peripheral T- cell lymphoma not otherwise  specified (PTCL -NOS), anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL), and angioimmunoblastic T- cell lymphoma.  In general, patients with PTCL 
have an inferior survival rate as compared to patients with B- cell NHL [ 19, 38, 39].  SYK is  
expressed in PTCL samples, a SYK -ITK fusion gene has been identified in PTCL, and the 
JAK/STAT  pathway  has been implicated in this disease  as well [40-42].  
 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_824535] -line treatment of PTCL consists of CHOP or other intense chemotherapy, albeit 
with inferior outcomes as mentioned above. There are several agents approved for treatment in  
the relapsed/refractory setting, but all have response rates of 25 to 30% and response durations of approximately 1 year or less [ 19, 38, 39, 43-45].  Both autologous and allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation  have also been  used  as salvage therapy  for relapsed  patients with  PTCL with 
some evidence of efficacy,  but little,  if any  randomized data exists  [46, 47].  
 
For patients who relapse after, or are refractory to multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the prognosis is dismal and new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683088].  
 
The cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of skin-homing lymphomas. The majority  of CTCLs comprise  Mycosis Fungoides (MF)  and Sézar y Syndrome 
(SS) [19, 48].  In the early  stages  of CTCL,  skin directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824536], 
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143533] are administered [ 19, 48, 49].  For patients whose disease has  
progressed after  treatment  with the  skin- directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824537], systemic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824538].  Several ther api[INVESTIGATOR_824539], 
vorinostat, and romidepsin [ 19, 43, 48, 50].  Systemic chemotherapy is also used as a treatment  
for patients with advanced disease and SS [ 19]. Patients with CTCL have a number of 
supportive care concerns and comorbid conditions, including pruritus and infectious 
complications.  Pruritus can have a major impact on patients’ quality of life and may be related 
to several cytokines [ 51-53].  Multiple genomic aberrations have been described in CTCL that  
involve the JAK/STAT pathways [ 54]. 
 
There  is no standard  agreed  upon algorithm for the treatment  of advanced  CTCL,  and for patients  
with advanced  disease whose disease relapses  after  standard  therapy, newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683088].  
 
1.6.4. Follicular  Lymphoma and Other Indolent  Lymphomas (iNHL); (FL/iNHL)  
Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent NHL (iNHL), accounting for about 20 to 30% 
of all B -cell NHL [ 19, 55 ]. Nearly 90% of cases have a translocation [ 15, 19 ], resulting in 
deregulated expression of BCL2. Follicular lymphoma has several grades depending on various 
histologic features; however, Grade 3B is usually treated like DLBCL [ 19, 25, 55].  Although 
they have differing histologies, the other iNHLs such as SLL (discussed below), Waldenström's 
macroglobulinemia (WM), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) often have similar clinical 
presentations, histories, and treatments as does FL, and are often included in the iNHL category along with FL [56]. 
 
Although advance d disease is not curable, effective therapy is available for this disease.  Therapy  
is usually initiated when symptoms are present or certain criteria are met [ 55]. Rituximab has 
had a major  influence on the treatment of  follicular lymphoma and other iNHLs. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_824540] -line treatments  include rituximab  as a single agent,  or combined with chemotherapy such as 
CHOP, bendamustine, or other agents  [19, 55, 57].  These agents may  also be used in the 
relapsed setting.  High dose chemotherapy with autologous or allogenic stem cell rescue has also 
been  used as  a salvage therapy  with some success  as well  [57, 58].  
 
A certain percentage of FLs will transform into DLBCL, which is associated with a poor clinical  
outcome. The underlying reasons for transformation are unknown, and the risk of transformation is about 2 to 3% per year [26]. These patients  are treated  like patients  with  DLBCL.  
 
For patients whose disease has progressed after multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], several agents have been  
used, and the PI3 kinase inhibitor, idelalisib, has been approved by [CONTACT_824612] 2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ 19, 58, 59 ]. This agent has a response rate of over 50% and a median duration of 
response of 12.5 months [ 59]. Further agents are needed for patients with multiple re lapsed  
and/or refractory  FL and other iNHLs.

1.6.5. Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukemia  (CLL)/Small  Lymphocytic Lymphoma  (SLL)  
CLL is the most prevalent leukemia in the western world.  SLL is essentially a more nodal form 
of the disease without peripheral blood involvement [ 19, 55].  In 2015, there were an estimated 
14,620 cases and  4,650 deaths from CLL/SLL. 
 
CLL/SLL is grouped with the indolent lymphomas and is incurable; however, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_824541].  Depending on the  stage,  genetic/other  prognostic factors  and symptoms  at diagnosis, 
patients may be observed initially and only treated when symptoms such as adenopathy or 
cytopenias develop [ 19, 55, 60].  
 
There are a multitude  of regimens  available for therapy  and the choice of 1 regimen  or agent  
over another depends on the patient’s  prognostic factors,  performance  status,  and symptoms. For 
more elderly patients with comorbidities, chlorambucil (alone or in combination with  
obinituzumab or ofatumumab, both anti-CD20 antibodies) can be used. The combinations have shown superior outcomes vs. single-agent chlorambucil [ 19, 60, 61].  Alternatively,  
bendamustine with rituximab can also be used. For more fit patients, fludarabine may be used in combination with rituximab and cyclophosphamide (for both upfront and relapsed/refractory 
patients)  [19, 60, 61].  
 
Unfortunately, patients will ultimately relapse or become refractory to most therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In some 
cases, patients may have a histologic transformation of their CLL to DLBCL (Richter’s 
syndrome), and these patients have a poor prognosis [ 19, 62, 63].  For patients who relapse from 
previous cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as bendamustine and rituximab, or fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, the options are limited especially if the duration of response is 
fewer than 2 to 3 years [ 64]. Newer agents are available:  Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (BTK) was recently approved for the treatment of CLL for patients with 
relapsed/refractory disease [ 21, 61, 65].  In addition, idelalisib, an inhibitor of PI3 kinase, was 
also approved for the treatment of CLL in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed  
CLL with comorbidities [ 49, 66].  Lastly, venetoclax, an inhibitor of BCL2, has shown dramatic 
activity in relapsed/refractory CLL, although the patients treated in this study had CLL that was  
relapsed/refractory to fludarabine or alkylator -based therapy [ 67]. However, patients will relapse  
from or be refractory to these newer agents, and in the case of relapse from ibrutinib, the prognosis is dismal, with a median survival of approximately 3 months [ 68]. New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824542]. 
 
In CLL, the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) is an independent predictor of OS and  
PFS in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy [ 69]. The prognostic value of achieving 
MRD negativity is unknown with newer pathway inhibitors, and it remains a patient of clinical investigation. MRD assessment has traditionally been done by [CONTACT_4133] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_824543] 1 in 10,000 cells), although other assessments that are perhaps more sensitive are being studied [ 69-71].

3.0 INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN 
 
3.1. Overall  Study  Design and Study  Schema  
This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, multi-dose, multi- center trial of orally administered  
cerdulatinib  with 2 phases: 
• Phase 1:  Dose -escalation portion, during which patients will receive single- agent  
cerdulatinib at their assigned dose level.  The starting dose for this portion of the study 
will be 15 mg QD, administered in  increasing  doses until the MTD/MAD is identified.  
• Phase 2a:  Exploratory portion, consisting of 6 cohorts, defined by [CONTACT_824615]. Five cohorts will receive single -agent cerdulatinib, and 1 cohort will receive 
cerdulatinib  plus rituximab administered IV during Cycle 1 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and 
during Cycles 4, 6, 8, and 10 on Day 1 only. The starting  dose of cerdulatinib during this 
portion of the study will be 30, 25, or 20 mg BID.  
 
The Schedule of Assessments  for Phase  2a is provided in Appendix 1.  
 
3.1.1. Phase  1 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall  Description  
Patients:  The Phase 1 portion of the study will include  patients with  a histologically  confirmed  
diagnosis of CLL/SLL or B- cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
 
Design: Eligible patients enrolled in sequential dose cohorts will receive once -daily, orally 
administered single -agent cerdulatinib at starting dose of 15 mg (15 mg po QD) in increasing 
dose levels until the MTD/MAD is identified.  An exception occurs on Days 2 and 3, during 
which patients on a QD schedule will not take study drug (see next paragraph).  If the MTD  
is not achieved, the highest studied dose will be  declared the MAD  and become the RP2D.  
(See Table 3 for definitions of cancer types.)  
 
To allow for a single-dose PK assessment, patients on a QD dosing regime will take their first 
dose of cerdulatinib on Day 1 and their second and subsequent doses daily beginning on Day 4. 
They will not take cerdulatinib on D ays 2 or 3. Starting with Day 4, patients will receive  
cerdulatinib once daily for a total of 28 days (one cycle) to assess the MTD/MAD. Patients on  
BID dosing schedules can dosing begin on Day 1 and continue cerdulatinib without interruption 
(i.e., these patients will not skip any days of the cycle). If cerdulatinib is well tolerated, patients  
may continue to  receive cerdulatinib at  their  assigned  dose in  the absence of disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or meeting  of any other withdrawal criteria (Section  4.4). 
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143536]  report of a Grade 2 or greater  
adverse event  (AE).  In the  event of any Grade ≥ 2 AE in the single patient,  an additional 
2 patients, for a total of 3, will be enrolled in that dose cohort, and all subsequent dose cohorts 
will follow a “3 + 3” design. Dose escalation w ill be in 100% increments until a drug- related AE  
of Grade 2 or greater severity occurs.  Thereafter, dose escalation will be in increments of up to 
50% as determined following review by [CONTACT_824616]. If a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT)  
occurs  in [ADDRESS_1143537]  6 patients.  
If ≤ 33% of six or more patients in a cohort experiences DLT, dose escalation may proceed. If in 
any cohort [ADDRESS_1143538] 3 patients or ≥ 33% of patients in a cohort develop DLT, dose escalation will cease,  and that dose level  will be declared intolerable.  The prior dose level will 
be declared the MTD,  and the cohort may be expanded to as many  as [ADDRESS_1143539] been dosed. The study is closed to Phase 1 
enrollment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Dose  Selection  in Phase  1 and Dose -Escalation Methods 
The starting dose for the Phase 1 portion of the study was based on the severely toxic dose in 10% of rodents (STD
10) from a [ADDRESS_1143540] sensitive species, as 
defined  by [CONTACT_941] S9 Guidance to Industry “Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer  
Pharmaceuticals.” One-tenth of the STD 10 of 15 mg/kg is recommended by [CONTACT_824617]. After allometric scaling, and accounting for the average weight of  
human patients (70 kg), the total daily starting dose for cerdulatinib was determined to be 15 mg po once daily  (QD).  The dose- escalation  methods accord  with the principles described by 
[CONTACT_824618].,  for Phase  1 clinical trials  [6]. 
 
3.1.2. Phase  2a 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall  Description,  Including Rationale for Inclusion  of T- cell Malignancies  
Patients:  The Phase 2a portion of the study will include patients with B- and T -cell malignancies  
(Table 6) who are believed to be able to tolerate therapy and who will provide interpretable 
results to further guide the development of cerdulatinib. In general, the malignancies being  
studied in this portion of the study were chosen based on the role of BCR signaling and/or the 
role of the JAK/STAT pathway in their disease as discussed in Section 1.0. The decision to 
include T-cell malignancies in the Phase 2a cohorts was based on SYK expression in PTCL, as well as the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in PTCL described in Section 1.6.3. A rituximab  
combination cohort (Cohort 2, see Table 6 ) was  added to  explore the activity  of cerdulatinib  with  
a known effective agent in the treatment  of B- cell NHL.  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  52  
  
 
Design: The Phase 2a portion will investigate 6 cohorts, each defined by [CONTACT_824619]  (Table 6).  Five cohorts will receive single- agent  cerdulatinib administered  orally, and  
1 cohort with B -cell NHL  (No. 2) will receive orally  administered  cerdulatinib  and rituximab  
administered  IV at 375 mg/m2 during Cycle 1 on Days  1, 8, 15, and 22 and  during Cycles 4,  6, 8, 
and 10 on Day  1 only. 
 
Initial enrollment into any of the 6 cohorts will be up to 20 patients; each cohort may be 
expanded for  a total of  approximately 240 patients in the Phase 2a portion of the  study. 
 
Throughout the duration of the study, Portola will inform Investigators and sites regarding which cohorts are open and what starting dose of cerdulatinib (i.e., 30, 25, or 20 mg BID) should be administered to patients at the time of enrollment.  Dose Modification Guidelines for Phase 2a 
are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Initial Starting  Dose  and Individual Dose  Reductions  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Rationale for Starting  Dose  
Under Amendment 4 the starting  dose of cerdulatinib  in the Phase 2a portion of the study was 
35 mg BID based on the PK/PD and PK/AE relationships and PK modeling of the Phase 1 study 
(Section 1.5). Clinical PK/PD evaluations demonstrated that IC 50s in the 0.2 to 0.6 µM range 
suppress BCR and cytokine JAK/STAT signaling pathways ( Figure 1).  However, under 
Amendment 5, the starting dose was changed to 30 mg BID (rationale below), with subsequent dose reductions to  25 mg  BID, 20 mg  BID,  and then 15 mg  BID permitted  (the rationale  for 
individual dose titration strategy is in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).  Under Amendent 7 starting doses of 30, 
25, or 20 mg BID may be explored to further investigate the relationships between cerdulatinib 
exposure, extent of SYK/JAK pathway inhibition, anti-inflammatory response, clinical response, 
and safety.  The data overall will be used in the final determination of the appropriate dose for 
registration  studies. 
 
IC90 for BCR signaling is approximately 0.8 µM, and for JAK/STAT  signaling ranges  from  
0.[ADDRESS_1143544] the level of  inhibition in solid tumor.

Cerdulatinib  was studied at multiple QD and BID dose levels and exhibited nonlinear PK at 
doses higher than 30 mg QD, with the exposure increasing approximately 3-fold as the dose was 
increased from 30 to 40 mg QD. Daily dose levels ranging from 40 to 65 mg demonstrat ed an  
exposure plateau above 30 mg QD, resulting in average steady- state C min and C max 
concentrations of 0.8 and 1.6 µM, respectively. The 100 mg QD dose resulted in lower overall 
exposure, possibly a consequence of drug precipi[INVESTIGATOR_824544]. The 40 to 65 mg dose levels resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of the BCR signaling pathway, and greater than 75% 
inhibition of various JAK/STAT pathways (IL2, IL4, IL6) at steady- state C
min. Two PRs were  
observed at the [ADDRESS_1143545] at the 65 mg QD dose. The t ½ at these doses  
was approximately 24 hours. Hence, the drug  properties are suitable for once daily  dosing. 
 
Based on pre- clinical tumor models, 1 µM cerdulatinib is sufficient to reduce viability in the  
majority of cell lines and primary leukemia samples tested.  Therefore, a method was sought to 
increase steady -state C min concentrations in humans to 1 µM or above. Given the saturated  
exposure achieved with QD dosing, we utilized a physiological-based PK model to determine the 
potential reasons for the plateau in the QD schedule.  This model indicated that pH-dependent 
drug solubility was likely the limiting factor and that BID dosing should overcome this plateau, resulting  in higher exposures. 
 
The 45 mg BID regimen roughly doubled the exposure relative to the 40 to 65 mg QD average, achieving steady -state C
min and C max of 1.5 and 1.8 µM, respectively. One PR was observed in a 
patient with FL, with what appeared to be a rapid (within 1 week) onset of palpable tumor reduction. Another patient with  CLL experienced  rapid  lymphocytosis, whereas a refractory  
FL patient  demonstrated  stable  disease.  This exposure  level,  however, resulted in  2 DLTs:  
[ADDRESS_1143546] exposures at this dose level. We, therefore,  
aggregated  all data from  the escalation study  to explore PK/AE  relationships. 
 
The major difference in exposure between tolerated (40-65 mg QD) and non-tolerated (45 mg 
BID) doses was the C min, increasing from 0.8 µM to 1.5 µM (steady- state C min by [CONTACT_824621] 2).  Therefore, we explored the relationship between incidences of all 
treatment -related  Grade ≥ 3 AEs  with steady -state Cmin. No relationship  was observed up to 
1.25 µM steady- state C min. However, above this concentration, there appeared to be some 
evidence (in the limited number of patients) for increased incidence of Grade 3 AEs ( Figure 3).  
In the context of tumor response, we have observed  more  consistent anti- tumor activity  in the 
0.75 to 1.25 µM steady- state C min concentration range, including 3 patients achieving PR 
(Figure 4).  Hence,  it appears that  steady -state C min of 0.75 to 1.25 µM  is likely  to be efficacious 
and well tolerated.  Furthermore, our dosing experience thus far indicates that a more consistent 
steady -state C min is obtained across patients with BID dosing. Thus, under Amendment 4 we 
recommended  a 35 mg BID dosing schedule that targets  steady -state Cmin within the  range of 
Clinical Study 13 -601

Protocol  Amendment  9

0.75 to 1.25 µM. Following an initial safety review of 12 patients dosed in the Phase 2a study, it 
was observed that whereas the majority of patients did achieve steady- state C min in the desired  
exposure range, 3 patients (25%) continued to accumulate plasma exposure to drug beyond Day 8 (the expected time to steady -state); this resulted in exposures greater than originally modeled 
from the data gathered during once-daily dosing (i.e., in the 2-4 µM range and exceeded the modeled C
max target by 1.5- to 2.5- fold).  Of these 3 patients, 2 experienced Grade 5 infections 
(i.e., with fatal outcomes), and [ADDRESS_1143547] for this unexpected  accumulation  in cerdulatinib  exposure and to provide an extra margin of safety  
for patients.

A PK model was developed to estimate steady -state concentration for BID dosing. This model 
used the average steady -state concentrations for previous BID dose cohorts at dose levels  15, 20, 
and 45 mg. In addition, the plasma concentrations from the patient who received 30 mg BID as 
part of a dose reduction was included in the model. The model incorporated the saturated clearance previously observed for cerdulatinib. The results are consistent with the data obtained  
to date for the 45 mg BID dose and are close to that observed with the single patient who  
received  30 mg BID. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Rationale for Individual  Dose  Titration  in Phase  2a 
Given the variability of cerdulatinib levels investigated to date, it is possible that some patients  
may be able to tolerate higher doses of cerdulatinib than others.  Therefore, under Amendment 4 
patients were allowed to escalate to 40 mg BID after undergoing one 28-day cycle without Grade 3 or higher clinically significant toxicity.  In addition, modeling data in Table 7  suggested 
that this dose regimen would provide C
min in the acceptable range of between 0.75 and 1.25 μM. 
As shown in the literature, this dose titration approach based on clinical tolerability has been 
used with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and patients who tolerated the higher doses often 
achieved higher response rates [ 72]. However given the SAEs observed in the first 12 patients 
dosed at 35 mg BID (the starting dose under Amendment 4), both the starting dose and dose titration s trategy  were modified. The starting  doses are 30, 25, or 20 mg BID.  
 
Dose  reductions and subsequent dose escalations back to a maximum  dose of 30 mg BID  may  be 
permitted per the Dose Modification Guidelines for Phase 2a (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  As indicated in  
Table 6, the dose reductions are expected to lower  overall exposure in a step -wise fashion. 
The dose of [ADDRESS_1143549] been discontinued (under advice of the physic ian, 
at the request of the Sponsor), have withdrawn consent, or are lost to follow-up, whichever 
occurs  first.  
 
3.1.4. Total Number of Patients, Cessation of Treatment, and Total Duration of 
the Study  
Under Phase 1 (closed to enrollment), 52 patients were enrolled, and 43 were dosed. Under 
Phase 2a, approximately 240 patients can be enrolled. Thus, a total of up to 283 patients can be 
dosed in the study. 
 
Patients enrolled under Phase 1 and Phase 2a may continue to receive cerdulatinib or cerdulatinib 
in co mbination with rituximab (in the combination cohort No. 2; see Table 6 ) in the absence of 
disease progression or intolerable toxicity, until they meet any  other withdrawal criteria,  
(Section  4.4) or until the end  of study (defined  in Section  3.1.3).  
 
The total duration of the study is expected to  be approximately 6 years.  
 
3.1.5. Assessments 
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_824622],  vital signs, hematology, and chemistry 
laboratory studies, and by [CONTACT_187031]. 
 
Blood samples will be obtained at frequent intervals for determination of cerdulatinib concentration. 
 
Serum  will be obtained for analysis  of the PD effects  of cerdulatinib. 
 
Antitumor  activity  will be  assessed  every  8 to 12 weeks according  to the revised  International 
Working Group (IWG) criteria [ 3] or the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria  [2].

4.4. Withdrawal Criteria  and Replacement  of Patients  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason; however, to the extent 
possible, all patients should continue to participate in the study once they have enrolled, even if 
they discontinue study drug. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw a patient from the 
study in case of events such as inter-current illness, AEs, progression, protocol violation, other 
procedures needed for treatment of their disease, or other medical conditions, administrative reasons  or for other reasons (detailed in Section 4.4.1).  
 
An excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study un -interpretable; therefore, unnecessary  
withdrawal  of patients  should be avoided. Should a patient  decide to  withdraw,  all efforts  will be 
made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. Reasons for all  
discontinuation of study drug and withdrawals from the study will be recorded. If a patient  
discontinues the study drug due to  an AE, that AE must be evaluated  to determine if  it is a 
serious adverse event (SAE; see Section 10.1.2).  The Investigator must report all SAEs to the 
Syneos Safety Department (the Sponsor’s Safety Designee) on the SAE form within [ADDRESS_1143562] Treatment (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be performed upon 
discontinuation/withdrawal, whenever possible. If a patient withdraws consent, no further 
information  will be collected after the  study termination visit.  
 
Normal  study termination is  defined  as the [ADDRESS_1143563] Treatment  visit in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
4.4.1. General  Withdrawal Criteria  
Discontinuation of study drug and/or withdrawal from the study will occur  if any  of the 
following apply: 
• The patient  experiences  disease progression requiring other therapy. 
• The patient  develops intolerable toxicity.  
• The patient  develops an  intercurrent  condition precluding further administration  
of cerdulatinib. 
• The patient withdraws  consent  for further participation  in the trial.  
• The patient  becomes  pregnant. 
• The patient fails to  comply  with study drug administration, dosing evaluations, or other 
requirements  of the study. 
• The patient  needs  a concomitant medication  that makes  the patient  ineligible  for further 
participation  in the study. 
• The Investigator believes it is no longer in the best interest of the patient to  
receive cerdulatinib. 
• The Sponsor discontinues the trial.

4.4.2. Specific Withdrawal Criterion  and Replacement  Procedure for Phase  1 
• Patients who discontinue from treatment prior to the completion of Cycle [ADDRESS_1143564] 80% of the intended dose in Cycle [ADDRESS_1143565] until the appropriate number of patients has  
completed  Cycle 1 at the designated dose level.  
 
4.4.3. Specific Withdrawal Criteria  and Replacement  Procedure  for Phase  2a 
• Patients  who  do not have at least [ADDRESS_1143566]  baseline assessment for  efficacy  will be  
withdrawn from the study and may  be replaced.  
• Patients  who  are found to  have protocol violations that substantially  impair  the evaluation  
of safety  and efficacy  may be replaced.  
 
4.5. Withdrawal and/or Replacement  Criteria  for Site or Principal  Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_824549]. 
 
4.6. Sponsor  Study  Discontinuation 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the  entire  study or study cohorts at any time.  Reasons for 
terminating  the study or study cohorts may include, but are not limited to,  the following: 
• Excessive toxicity  indicating  a potential health hazard to patients.  
• Poor patient  enrollment.  
 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator if the study is placed on hold (or if individual cohorts 
are placed on hold), or if  the Sponsor decides  to discontinue the study or program. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1143567] patient safety or benefit potential, or confound assessments of safety or clinical activity.  A protocol deviation is a departure from the protocol that does not meet the 
above criteria.  Protocol violations or deviations may be grouped into  the following categories:  
• Enrollment criteria.  
• Study activities  (e.g., missed evaluations or visits, data  verification  issues).  
• Noncompliance with  dose or schedule,  including dose calculation,  administration,  
interruption, reduction, or delay, or  discontinuation criteria.  
• Investigational product handling, including storage and accountability.

5.0 TREATMENTS  ADMINISTERED  
Treatments  administered  during the study are listed below.  Administration of  study drug and  
related dose modifications are described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for cerdulatinib and in 
Section  6.2 for rituximab.  
• Phase 1 ( closed ): single- agent  cerdulatinib  
• Phase 2a: 
○ Cohorts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6: single-agent cerdulatinib 
○ Cohort 2: cerdulatinib and  rituximab  
 
5.1. Cerdulatinib  Study  Drug  Administration  
5.1.1. General  Instructions  
Cerdulatinib may be taken with food, unless otherwise specified. Missed doses may be made up  
if given within 4 hours of the missed scheduled dosing time. Cerdulatinib may not be taken 
fewer  than 8 hours prior to the next scheduled  dose. Patients  who vomit following 
administration of cerdulatinib should not repeat that dose of cerdulatinib but should resume study 
drug with the next scheduled dose. In the event of toxicity, dosing may be interrupted at the discretion of the treating physician until sufficient resolution of the toxicity is attained and then 
may be restarted at a lower dose level (see Section 5.2 for guidelines for cerdulatinib toxicity and 
subsequent dose modifications).  
 
In order to assess cerdulatinib compliance, patients will be instructed to keep patient diaries to  
document self-administration of study drug doses, and will include documentation of time study  
dose was taken, any missed doses and reason(s) why missed, and/or any wasted doses and 
reason(s) why. The  diary  will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_824625].  
 
5.1.2. Phase  1 Cerdulatinib  Dosing  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Initial Dosing  with Cerdulatinib  
Following screening and confirmation of eligibility, patients will be sequentially assigned to the next open dose cohort. For QD dosing regimens, to allow for single-dose PK assessments during the Phase [ADDRESS_1143568] of this study.  Depending on the 
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  69  
  
 
PK profile, twice -daily administration (BID) may be considered during the course of dose 
escalation.  Single-dose PK assessment will not be conducted for BID cohorts. Increments of  
dose escalation will be adjusted as needed to accommodate available capsule strengths. Every  
effort  should be made to  administer study  drug at the  same times each  day. 
 
Patients who do not receive at least 80% of their cerdulatinib doses in the first 28 days of 
treatment (Cycle 1) due to non- compliance will be withdrawn from the s tudy. Beyond Cycle 1, 
dose holds may be permitted for reasons not related to disease progression or drug- related  
toxicity  (e.g., elective procedures, vacations) with the permission of the Sponsor’s 
Medical  Monitor. 
 
Intra -patient  dose escalation  will not b e permitted during Phase 1. 
 
The dose-escalation scheme described in this and the following paragraph accords with the principles described by [CONTACT_824618] [ 6]. One patient will be enrolled in each dose cohort 
until the first report of a Grade 2 or greater adverse event (AE). In the event of any Grade 2 or greater AE in the single patient, an additional 2 patients, for a total of 3, will be enrolled in that dose cohort, and all subsequent dose cohorts will follow a “3 + 3” design.  Dose escalation will 
be in 100% increments until a drug- related adverse event of Grade 2 or greater severity occurs.  
Thereafter, dose escalation will be in increments of up to 50% as determined following review by [CONTACT_56317].  If a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in [ADDRESS_1143569] 6 patients. If ≤ 33% of six or more patients in a 
cohort experiences DLT,  dose escalation may  proceed. If in any cohort [ADDRESS_1143570] 
3 patients or ≥ 33% of patients in a cohort develop DLT, dose escalation will cease. That dose 
level will be declared intolerable, and either the prior dose level will be declared the MTD,  
and/or the cohort may be expanded to as many as [ADDRESS_1143571] been enrolled in the Phase 1 (escalation) portion of this study, 
and Phase [ADDRESS_1143572] been treated for 28 days (one cycle) prior to treatment of 
patients at the next higher dose level. In addition to DLTs defined below, the safety committee 
will also take into consideration the totality of available safety data in determining whether a  
given dose level should be deemed tolerable. Additional patients may be enrolled in individual cohorts if the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or safety committee deems it necessary to obtain additional safety  information  prior to  proceeding with dose escalation.  In addition, intermediate  
dose levels may  be used  to allow for further exploration of safety.  
 
As of Amendment 4, Phase 1 dose escalation has concluded at 45 mg po BID (per Sections 1.5 and [IP_ADDRESS]).  The dose selected for Phase 2a is 35 mg po BID based on PK modeling and 
accumulated  safety  data (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

5.1.3. Phase  2a Cerdulatinib  Dosing  
Following confirmation of eligibility, patients will receive oral cerdulatinib at a starting dose of  
30, 25, or 20 mg BID. Every effort should be made to administer study drug at the same time 
each day. The drug will be administered  in cycles  of 28 days with no days off therapy  
between  cycles.  
 
In the event of toxicity (see Section 5.2.1 for the definition of toxicity ), dosing may be 
interrupted at the discretion  of the Investigator until sufficient resolution  of the toxicity  is 
attained and then restarted at a lower dose level (dose modifications to cerdulatinib are summarized  in Table 8).  The lowest dose of cerdulatinib that may  be administered  is 
15 mg BID.  
 
Dosing information for rituximab is described in Section 6.2 (for Cohort 2, the combination cohort of cerdulatinib and rituximab).

Guidance  
5.2.1. Cerdulatini b 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  of Dose -limiting  Toxicity  for Cerdulatinib  during  Phase  1 
 
DLT will be defined as any of the following toxicities, possibly or probably related to 
cerdulatinib, and clinically significant (in the judgement of the investigator) that occurs in the 
first 28 days (one cycle) of treatment. For patients to be evaluable for DLT, they must have 
received  80% of the doses in the first 28 days of Cycle 1, or been withdrawn from study therapy  
due to a drug- related toxicity.  Patients who withdraw without meeting these criteria should be 
replaced.  Toxicity  will be  graded  according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. 
 
Hematologic 
• Febrile  neutropenia (ANC <  1,000/μL and temperature ≥ 38.5°C). 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 5 days. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with  or without bleeding. 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. 
• Grade 4 anemia, unexplained by [CONTACT_27846].  
 
Non-hematologic 
• Grade 3 or greater  nausea,  vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent  despi[INVESTIGATOR_824550]-diarrheal therapy. 
Clinical Study 13 -601

• Grade 3 or greater  increase  in transaminases  lasting  > 5 days. 
• Grade 3 or greater  fatigue  persisting > 7 days in the absence of any other 
underlying cause.  
• Any other Grade 3 or greater  non-hematologic toxicity  (except  fatigue as noted  above) 
considered  clinically  significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
• Toxicity  of any grade resulting  in dose delay of more than 7 days.  
• Toxicity  resulting  in study drug discontinuation prior to the completion of Cycle 1.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase  2a: Monitoring for Toxicity in Phase  2a 
Patients will be monitored for toxicity throughout Phase 2a. For the purposes of this protocol, 
toxicity is defined as any Grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) and/or any clinically significant AE (refer to Table 8 ). Patients experiencing a toxicity may be considered for a dose interruption 
or reduction. Enrollment in a cohort may be suspended at any time depending on the overall toxicity profile within that cohort, pending a review by [CONTACT_49005], and consideration 
will be given to discontinuing enrollment in that cohort or providing a global dose reduction for 
that cohort. 
 
Physicians should monitor for infections and clinically significant decreases in leukocyte counts  
(e.g., ALC, ANC) and should consider holding cerdulatinib and/or dose modifications per Section [IP_ADDRESS] if clinically significant toxicity occurs.  Also see Section 10.1.3, Adverse Events 
that May  Indicate Potential Drug  Toxicity. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose  Modifications for Cerdulatinib  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Dose  Modifications to  Cerdulatinib During  Phase  2a 
Dose  reductions and interruptions are permitted  during all cycles.  Guidelines for dose 
modifications  are provided in Table 8.  
 
In general, for Grade [ADDRESS_1143573] of care support, and then restart dosing at the same dose after the event has resolved to baseline.  Specific guidance for management of Grade 1 and 2 diarrhea and nausea and vomiting 
is provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
For adverse events ≥ Grade 3, rather than dose interruption or dose reduction, the Investigator is encouraged to hold dosing and institute standard of care support, and then restart dosing at the same dose after the event has resolved to baseline, as clinically appropriate.  Table 8  provides 
further guidance on Grade 3 toxicities. A dose interruption does not necessitate a subsequent 
dose reduction. In the case of a dose interruption, once the toxicity  has resolved to Grade < [ADDRESS_1143574] dose level of 15 mg BID. A patient experiencing a toxicity at 15 mg BID should be 
discontinued from cerdulatinib and removed from the study (after completing  the [ADDRESS_1143575] Treatment  Visit  in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
Patients who experience dose interruptions > 28 days in duration should be permanently 
discontinued from  cerdulatinib therapy (after completing  the [ADDRESS_1143576] Treatment Visit in

[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Potential Epstein -Barr Virus  Reactivation  
EBV reactivation has been observed in connection with cerdulatinib administration and should 
be viewed as a potential adverse effect of treatment.  For this reason, peripheral blood 
quantitative EBV polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) has been added to the baseline assessment of subjects and should be performed post-baseline for any unexplained fevers if there 
is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_824552].  
 
If unexplained fever  and increased  EBV  PCR raise clinical  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_824553], the investigator should take the following action  *: 
1. Hold  cerdulatinib  dosing. 
2. Continue monitoring the patient’s  EBV  viral load with  quantitative  PCR per local  
standard  of care (typi[INVESTIGATOR_824554]).  
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143583] of care.  
4. Consider therapy with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 once weekly until normalization 
of the patient’s viral load.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], one to four doses of rituximab are used [ 73, 74].  
The use of rituximab does not require study discontinuation. 
5. After  symptoms resolve,  resume cerdulatinib  treatment at  the same dose level or  one dose 
level below the current dose level and continue monitoring the patient ’s EBV viral load  
with quantitative  PCR per  local standard of care (typi[INVESTIGATOR_824555]). 
 
* Cerdulatinib dosing may continue while rituximab therapy is administered, with the Medical 
Monitor approval. For asymptomatic  increased  EBV  PCR,  consider treatment  with  rituximab  
(per local standard of care) and continuing cerdulatinib.

○ In the event of a study drug interruption or dose-change, pre-dose PK samples should 
be collected the day  study drug is restarted  or a new dose is started, as well  as 
7 days later.  
• Cohort 6 - CTCL patients only (local laboratory ): 1, ≥ 5 mm skin punch biopsy of a 
representative lesion as clinically indicated may be performed; subsequent biopsies 
should be from the same  general site, if possible.

7.3.3. Visit  Windows 
Due to scheduling conflicts and the burden of study visits, patients may  attend  their  scheduled  
visits  within a  visit window as  indicated in Appendix 1. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Visit Window and Timeline  Guidance 
• A standard  treatment  cycle is defined  as 28 days of  treatment,  and each  new cycle should 
start 29 days from the  previous Day 1 visit (e.g., C2D1  starts 29  days from  C1D1). 
• Each  new cycle “resets” the timeline.  This means  that C2D15 is  measured from  C2D1. 
• Dose  interruptions that extend beyond the end  of a cycle (e.g.,  after Day  28 of that cycle)  
will delay  the start of  the next cycle.  Cycles should not be started  during an interruption. 
• Subjects  should continue to administer study drug daily until the new  cycle is started.  
• For safety  monitoring purposes, if a scheduled  visit must be  changed it is preferred  that a  
patient  comes in for a visit early  instead of late.  
 
7.4. Blood Collection  
The maximum amount of blood to be drawn at a visit is ~104 mL and the total amount of blood 
to be drawn over a 50-week study period (including the 2- week screening period and through 
Week 48 of the study including a possible end-of-therapy visit) is ~548.5 mL. For a 40-kg person (the smallest participant expected to enroll in the study), this equates to maximum blood volume per body weight per visit of ~2.4 mL/kg and a total blood volume per body weight per average 6- week  period of ~1.6 mL/kg. These quantities of blood are within accepted  limits of  
3.0 mL/kg  of body weight for a single blood draw and 7.0 mL/kg of body weight for a 
6-week  period [ 76]. 
 
7.5. Concomitant Medications  and Other Guidance  
All concomitant medications used during the study and within [ADDRESS_1143601] 
be reported on the appropriate CRF.  
 
7.5.1. Prohibited  Medications/Procedures  
• Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or any investigational anti-neoplastic 
agent  for the  active  treatment  of cancer  are prohibited. Patients  may continue on 
adjuvant hormonal therapy for prostate or breast cancer, as long as there is no detectable disease at  study entry. 
• Systemic steroids, at doses greater than the equivalent of 20 mg prednisone daily, with the exception of intermittent use for the treatment of emesis, are pro hibited. Steroid  
inhalers for medical conditions are permitted.  Patients needing pulse corticosteroids for 
other medical conditions should be discussed  with the Sponsor’s  Medical Monitor. 
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  86  
  
 
• Nasal flu vaccine is prohibited because the nasal vaccine is a live, attenuated virus;  
however, flu injections,  which  are nonviable antigens, are permitted  (see Section 7.5.2).  
 
7.5.2. Permitted  or Mandated  Medications  
• Anti-emetic  agents  for the treatment  of nausea and  vomiting are permitted.  
○ No constraint will be placed on the use of growth factors during subsequent 
treatment; however, prophylactic use is discouraged and adherence to American  
Society  of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  guidelines is recommended. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Antimicrobial Prophylaxis 
• Pneumocystis prophylaxis is required in all patients receiving cerdulatinib, and study patients should be monitored closely with frequent cell counts for evidence of infection or bone marrow suppression. Bactrim™ (sulfamethoxozole /trimethoprim) 1 DS tab/day  
is the recommended prophylaxis regimen and will cover both Pneumocystis jirovecii and  
Nocardia. Other recommendations may  be found in the National  Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) guidelines [ 77]. For patients unable to take Bactrim, atovaquone, or 
pentamadine (inhaled or IV) may be considered. Dapsone is not recommended because 
of the potential for drug interactions and methemoglobinemia. 
• Patients should also receive prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus infection per NCCN  guidelines [ 77]. 
• Immunizations or vaccinations (for such things as influenza or pneumonia) are encouraged prior to study entry. Note that nasal flu vaccines should not be administered 
to patients because the nasal vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, whereas flu shots are 
nonviable antigens (see Section 7.5.1).  
• Prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome is permitted at the discretion of the treating 
physician, based on clinical characteristics.  
 
7.5.3. Cerdulatinib  and CYP3A4  
Cerdulatinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and may also decrease expression levels of CYP3A4 
enzyme activity in patients, thus potentially augmenting the AE profile of other drugs. To avoid 
possible drug-drug interactions, strong inhibitors, CYP3A sensitive substrates, and inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided in patients receiving cerdulatinib. An inhibitor of CYP3A4 would 
reduce the metabolism of cerdulatinib and could result in high concentrations that could cause 
AEs.  An inducer of CYP3A4 could result  in lower than  desired levels  of cerdulatinib  and lessen  
the likelihood of efficacy. Additionally, cerdulatinib can cause other medications to accumulate to levels that result in toxicity  due to lower levels of CYP3A4 being expressed. Because of this  
effect CYP3A sensitive substrates need to be considered. If the Investigator feels that use of a 
strong inhibitor or strong inducer of CYP3A4 is necessary, this should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical  Monitor. Appendix [ADDRESS_1143602] of such CYP3A4 substrates  and strong

inhibitors/inducers. Physicians should monitor for potential drug- drug interactions, and a dose  
adjustment (lowering) for CYP3A sensitive substrates should be considered on a case -by-case 
basis by [CONTACT_56951]. 
 
7.6. Study  Committee  
Select study participants will comprise the Study Committee (e.g., the selected Principal 
Investigators, Portola’s Medical  Monitor, Clinical Study Manager,  and/or Drug  Safety  Medical  
Monitor). Other  Portola or outside personnel may be called or consulted as  needed.  
• Phase 1:  Upon the completion of the initial 28- day treatment period (Cycle 1) for all  
patients in any cohort, the Study Committee will convene via teleconference or in person 
to review  all available DLT, AE,  and any other clinical  or laboratory  data for the patients  
in that cohort. The Study Committee will determine whether it is safe to escalate to the  
next dose level of cerdulatinib or whether the MTD or MAD has been reached. If it is  
safe to continue, the Study Committee  will determine the  next dose level to be studied. 
• Phase 2a:  The Study Committee will meet periodically to review available safety and 
efficacy data from the study.  Following the first meeting of the Study Committee,  
subsequent meetings will be held periodically as needed. Members of the Portola study team, such as representatives from Biostatistics, Drug Safety, Clinical Development, and 
Clinical Operations may participate in the meetings as needed.  Data to be evaluated may  
include (but are not limited to): deaths, other SAEs; AEs, including treatment- related  
AEs; reasons for treatment discontinuation or dose modification/ interruption, trends in laboratory evaluations, and efficacy. 
• For the combination cohort with rituximab, the Study Committee will evaluate (using the assessments as outline above) the first [ADDRESS_1143603] of the other cohorts as above.

8.0 ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
 
8.1. Response  Criteria  
Response in NHL  patients  will be evaluated  using The Lugano Classification  [4]; in CLL 
patients using the Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [ 2]; in leukemic forms  of PTCL  
(ATLL, PLL, LGL) using disease appropriate response criteria [ 77]; and in CTCL patients using 
the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) and other measures as appropriate [5]. Appendix 4 provides definitions and detailed descriptions of response criteria as well as 
guidance on selection of lesions for evaluation. Redacted copi[INVESTIGATOR_824565].  
 
8.2. Exploratory Efficacy  
8.2.1. Global Health  Questionnaire  
Patients will be asked to complete a Global Health Questionnaire ( Appendix 8) to assess whether  
patients feel their overall health is improving on this study. The correlation between markers of  
inflammation  with clinical response and the Global  Health Assessment will be evaluated.

9.0 PHARMACOLOGY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1. Pharmacokinetic Assays 
Plasma  samples  will be obtained  at selected  time  points (detailed  in Appendix 1) and analyzed  
for the concentration of cerdulatinib and possible metabolite identification. Sample assay for  
drug concentrations will be performed using a validated LCMS method. Details on the  
collection,  processing, storage,  and shipment of samples  are contained  in the Study 
Laboratory Manual.  
 
9.1.1. Phase  1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The following PK parameters  of cerdulatinib  will be calculated  for all  patients:  
• Plasma half -life (t ½), determined by [CONTACT_824631]- time curve.  Terminal half -life is calculated  
as ln(2)/(-β), where β is the slope of the terminal portion of the log concentration- time 
curve.  
• Time  to maximum  observed plasma  concentration  (Tmax). 
• Maximum observed plasma concentration  (Cmax). 
• Minimum observed plasma concentration (C min). 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from  [ADDRESS_1143604] measurable concentration  
(AUC 0-last) computed using the linear trapezoidal rule.  
• Total area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞), 
computed as:  
AUC 0-∞ = AUC 0-last + C plast /(- β) 
 
where AUC 0-last is the area under the curve from time [ADDRESS_1143605] 
measurable concentration above the quantitation limit; C plast is the last measurable  
concentration  above the quantitation  limit; and β is defined as  above. 
• Clearance of cerdulatinib (CL/F).  
• Volume of distribution of cerdulatinib at steady  state (V ss/F). 
• Amount of drug excreted in urine over the sampling interval (Ae) for those patients for 
whom total volume of urine was collected.  
• Accumulation ratio, calculated by [CONTACT_12265] 0-12 at steady -state/AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1143606] 
dose for those patients for whom th e 12 hour sample was collected.

9.1.2. Phase  2a Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
In order to further characterize the PK of cerdulatinib (specifically, C min), plasma samples during 
the Phase 2a portion of the study will be taken pre- and post-dose at various visits during the 
study as described in  Appendix 1. 
 
The date and time  of last cerdulatinib  dose prior to  any PK assessment  should be recorded.  
 
Unscheduled plasma samples  may  also be collected  at the discretion  of the Investigator (e.g., in  
the event of an  AE) as described in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
9.2. Pharmacodynamic Assays 
Serum will be obtained at various time points throughout the trial (detailed in Appendix 1) to  
determine the effects of cerdulatinib on markers of inflammation.  DNA and RNA will be  
isolated from optional tumor biopsy specimensto assess genetic mutations relevant to the disease and the mechanism  of action  of cerdulatinib (see Appendix 1 and the Study Laboratory Manual).  
• Quantification  of serum  proteins. 
• Quantitative  PCR for tumor  relevant  transcripts.  
• Hybridization of RNA to  gene arrays.  
• DNA sequencing to identify disease- relevant mutations.

10.0        ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY  
Safety and tolerability will be monitored and determined by [CONTACT_824622], vital signs, 
hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, and reported AEs (including deaths and other serious adverse events  [SAEs] and  treatment- emergent  AEs).  
 
10.1. Safety  Parameters  and Definitions  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious  
adverse events and pregnancies; performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments;  
measuring protocol-specified vital signs; and conducting other protocol- specified tests that are  
deemed  critical to the safety  evaluation of the study. 
 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Syneos Safety Department, as outlined in Section 10.2.1. 
 
10.1.1. Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event (AE) is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, which may or  
may not have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can be any  of the following: 
• Unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with  the use of the study drug, whether  or not 
it is considered to be study drug- related  
• Any newly  occurring event or exacerbation o f previous condition (e.g., increase in  
severity  or frequency) since the administration of  study drug 
• Recurrence of an  intermittent medical  condition (e.g., headache)  not present  at baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X- ray) that is  
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug.  
• AEs that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior 
to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies). 
 
10.1.2. Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is  any AE, occurring at  any dose of any study medication,  regardless  of causality  that: 
• Is fatal  (i.e., the adverse event  actually  causes  or leads  to death).  
• Is life-threatening  (i.e., in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_824566], the patient  
was at immediate risk of  death  from the  reaction as it occurred).  
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707].  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  92  
  
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a  
substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life  functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother who was 
exposed to study drug or where the father was exposed to study drug before conception. 
Is an important medical event in the investigator's judgment (i.e., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to p revent one of the outcomes listed 
above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
 
Clarification should be made between the terms “serious” and “severe,” since these terms are 
NOT synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a 
specific event (according to NCI CTCAE criteria per section 10.2.2); the event itself, however, 
may be of relatively minor medical significance.  This is NOT the same as “serious,” which is  
based on the strict regulatory  definitions listed above and serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. A severe adverse event does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE if the event does not meet the serious criteria.  On the other hand, a 
stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted serious criteria. Thus, severity and seriousness need 
to be independently assessed for  each AE  recorded  on the eCRF. 
 
10.1.3. Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs are serious AEs that are both unexpected (i.e., the nature or severity is not expected from the information provided in the IB) and assessed by [CONTACT_824632] a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to the investigational medical product(s). S[LOCATION_003]Rs require reporting to the Competent Authorities, and Ethics Committees within an expedited timeline (7 calendar days for fatal / life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs, 15 calendar 
days for all other S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  Thus it  is required  that the Investigator complete  the SAE  form  and 
report all SAEs within 24 hours of his/her awareness of the event to the Syneos Safety Department.  Additionally, Syneos Safety Department, on behalf of Portola, will immediately 
notify the Investigator if any additional safety or toxicology information that impacts patient 
safety becomes available during the study. All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be provided to all Investigators for 
submission to their respective IRBs per local requirements and when information that impacts  
patient safety becomes available during the study. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to  
promptly notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Com mittee (IEC) of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs involving risk to  
human patients.

10.2. Methods  and Timing  for Capturing  and Assessing  Safety  Parameters  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (Section 10.1.1 for definition) are 
recorded  on the Adverse Event eCRF  and reported  to the Sponsor in  accordance with  instructions 
provided in this section.  
 
For each AE recorded  on the Adverse Event eCRF,  the investigator will make an assessment  of 
seriousness (Section 10.1.2), severity  (Section 10.2.2), and causality  (Section  10.2.3).  
 
10.2.1. Adverse Event  Reporting  Period  
To comply with regulatory requirements, all SAEs, regardless of causality, that occur from the date of signing of informed consent until [ADDRESS_1143607] study drug treatment (or initiation 
of the next therapeutic regimen prior to the 30 days), must be reported to Syneos Safety 
Department  within 24 hours from  Investigator awareness of  the SAE.  
 
After  informed  consent  has been obtained but  prior to initiation  of study  drug , only SAEs  
caused by  a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, 
discontinuation of medications)  should be reported to Syneos Safety  Department.  These 
pre-dose adverse events will be collected on the AE eCRF and assessed as not related to study 
drug, but will be assessed  for relationship  to study procedures/tests and  interventions. 
 
After initiation of study drug , all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), regardless of  
relationship to study drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_1143608] include at minimum the  
following: patient  number, study drug(s) received,  the event  term, the  serious criteria  met for the  
AE, a narrative description of the event, and an assessment by [CONTACT_824633]/intensity of the event and relationship to study drug(s).  The SAE report should be sent 
to Syneos Safety Department by [CONTACT_6968] (see contact [CONTACT_31307]). Follow-up information on the SAE should be sent promptly by [CONTACT_824634], or as requested  by [CONTACT_824635].  
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143609]  determine both  the severity  of the  event  and the 
relationship of the  event to study drug.  
 
10.2.2. Assessmen t of Severity  of Adverse Events  
The AE severity  grading scale for  the NCI  CTCAE (v5.0) will be  used  for assessing  AE severity. 
The table below will be used for assessing severity for AEs that are not specifically listed in the  
NCI CTCAE.  
 
 
NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology Criteria for  Adverse  Events.

10.2.3. Assessment  of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient,  the circumstances surrounding the event,  
and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse 
event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly. The 
following guidance should be taken into consideration: 
• Temporal  relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of  dose reduction, discontinuation 
of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  
• Known  association of the event  with the study drug or with similar treatments  
• Known  association  of the event  with the disease  under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the  event  
• Presence of non -treatment -related fact ors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
 
 
The following categories  should be used in the causality  assessment of  adverse events:  
Related  
The AE: 
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time  of study drug administration; 
and/or 
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug; and  
• Cannot be explained  by [CONTACT_1604],  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state, therapeutic  
intervention, or concomitant therapy. 
• The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible and 
the event reoccurs on rechallenge if patient is re -exposed. 
 
Probably Related  
The AE: 
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time  of study drug administration; 
and/or 
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug; and  
• Was unlikely to have been  produced by [CONTACT_1604],  such  as the subject’s  clinical state,  
therapeutic intervention, or  concomitant therapy. 
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  96  
  
 
Possibly Related  
The AE: 
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time  of study drug administration; 
and/or 
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug; but 
• Could have been  produced by [CONTACT_1604],  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state,  
therapeutic intervention, or  concomitant therapy. 
 
Unlikely  
The AE: 
• Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug 
administration; and  
• Was most likely  produced by [CONTACT_1604],  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state,  therapeutic 
intervention, or concomitant therapy. 
 
Unrelated  
This categ ory is applicable to  those AEs that are judged to be clearly  and incontrovertibly due 
only to extraneous causes (e.g., the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention or 
concomitant therapy) and do not meet the criteria for study drug relationship listed under Probable, Possible, or Unlikely. 
 
An AE with causal relationship not initially determined will require follow -up to assign 
causality.  
 
10.2.4. Procedures  for Recording  AEs 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one AE term should be 
recorded  in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open-ended question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic 
procedures will be  recorded on the appropriate forms in the eCRF. 
 
Only one AE term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.  When  
possible, a unifying diagnosis, or signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying 
pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For example, the combination of 
general malaise, mild fever, headache and rhinitis should be described as a “common cold” rather  than listing  each symptom separately.

Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  97  
  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diagnosis versus  Signs  and Symptoms  
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases; record Tumor Lysis Syndrome rather than hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, 
hyperuricemia, etc.). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_824636], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date 
of the first symptom of the  eventual diagnosis. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  that are Secondary to Other  Events  
In general, AEs that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae)  
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A medically  significant secondary  AE that is separated  in time  from  the initiating  event  
should be recorded  as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
• If vomiting  results  in mild  dehydration with  no additional treatment  in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting  should be reported on the eCRF  
• If vomiting  results  in severe dehydration, both events  should be reported  separately  on 
the eCRF  
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads  to renal  failure,  both events  should be 
reported  separately  on the eCRF  
• If dizziness  leads  to a fall and consequent fracture,  all three  events  should be reported  
separately  on the eCRF  
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF  
 
All AEs should be recorded  separately  on the Adverse Event  eCRF  if it is unclear  as to whether  
the events are associated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Persistent  or Recurrent  Adverse Events  
A persistent  AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between  patient  evaluation  
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF with the  
severity  (intensity  or grade) of the events recorded at the time the  event is  first reported.  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  98  
  
 
A recurrent AE is one that resolves between patient evaluation time points and subsequently 
recurs, or  notes a change in severity or seriousness. Each recurrence of an AE should be 
recorded  as a separate event on  the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
• If Grade 1 vomiting has worsened to Grade 2 five days after onset, the Grade 1 vomiting 
is resolved on the date when this severity changed, and Grade 2 vomiting is recorded as a 
new event on the eCRF with onset date reflecting the change  in severity.  
• If non -serious event of neutropenia required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824567], the 
event  is resolved  on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824568],  and a new SAE  of neutropenia is  recorded  
on the eCRF  with start date reflecting  when the event required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every  laboratory  abnormality  qualifies  as an  AE. A laboratory test result must be reported as  
an AE if it meets any  of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied  by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results  in a change in study treatment  (e.g., dosage modification,  treatment  interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results  in a medical  intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a 
change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically  significant in the investigator’s in the investigator’s judgment 
○ Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may  not qualify as AEs.  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific  
judgment should be exercised in deciding  whether an isolated laboratory abnormality  should be 
classified  as an  AE. 
 
If a clinically  significant laboratory abnormality  is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline  
phosphatase and bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with  cholestasis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholestasis)  should be recorded  on the Adverse  Event eCRF.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result must be reported as an 
AE if  it meets any  of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied  by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results  in a change in study  treatment  (e.g., dosage modification,  treatment  interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results  in a medical  intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically  significant in the investigator’s judgment

It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific  
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be 
classified  as an  AE. 
 
If a clinically  significant vital sign abnormality  is a sign of a  disease or syndrome (e.g., high 
blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
 
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should  
only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (Section [IP_ADDRESS] provides details on recording persistent AEs).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Liver  Function  Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3 × baseline value) in combination with either an elevated  total bilirubin  (> 2 × ULN)  or clinical jaundice  in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes  of hyperbilirubinemia is  considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury. 
Therefore,  investigators  must report  as an AE the occurrence of either  of the following: 
• Treatment -emergent  ALT o r AST  > 3 × baseline  value in combination with total bilirubin  
> 2 × ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin)  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 × baseline value in combination with 
clinical  jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor immediately  
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning  of the event). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deaths  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. All deaths (including deaths due to progression of the underlying malignancy) that occur during the protocol- defined adverse  
event period should be reported as SAEs, regardless of attribution to study drug. The event or 
condition th at caused or  contributed to the fatal  outcome should be recorded  as the single 
medical concept (e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) with a fatal outcome. When the event that led to death  
cannot be identified (e.g., sudden death of unknown origin) report “sudden death”  as the adverse  
event and update it when new information clarifies the event that led to death. Only one AE can be reported with a fatal outcome for each patient who dies. Other AEs that continued up to time of death should be reported with an outcome of not recovered/resolved. In the event that the death is attributed solely to progression of the underlying malignancy, the AE term should be 
reported  as “Disease Progression.”

[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack  of Efficacy or Worsening  of Underlying  Malignan cy 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying 
disease should not be recorded as AEs (except deaths; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Example: a patient  
with disease progression documented by [CONTACT_824637]/new tumors in the liver also has concurrent 
increases in transaminases.  Every effort should be made to document progression through use of 
objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether a change in the patients condition, is 
due to disease progression, it should be reported as an AE. Example:  a patient with disease 
progression documented by [CONTACT_824637]/new tumors in the liver also has concurrent new onset 
kidney failure  (scan does not reveal kidney metastas is). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Preexisting  Medical  Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse 
Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "more  frequent  headaches").  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824569]: 
• Admissions per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824570], unless they occur at a time other than the planned date for a reason such as a 
worsening of the underlying disease/illness/symptoms.  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy). 
• Medical/surgical  admission  for purpose other than remedying ill health  state  and was 
planned prior to entry into the study.  Appropriate documentation is required in 
these cases.  
• Admission  encountered  for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing  on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  Associated  with an  Overdose or  Error in  Drug  Administration  
Overdose is defined as  any dose in excess  of the assigned dose of cerdulatinib  greater  than or 
equal  to 90 mg total dose in one day or greater  than 375 mg/m2 of rituximab per day. 
All overdoses meeting  the above criteria  must be recorded  as an AE (Verbatim  term  = accidental  
overdose) on the eCRF. All overdoses must be reported to the Syneos Safety Department within  
[ADDRESS_1143611] also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF and reported on the  
SAE  form (medically  important event) as separate adverse event(s) (see Section  10.2).  
 
Any dose that exceeds the assigned dose of cerdulatinib but is less than the 90 mg total dose in 
one day threshold for Overdose should be reported  to the Sponsor Medical Monitor and  captured  
appropriately in the Cerdulatinib Administration eCRF.  
 
All other significant dosing or medication  errors  that may  not meet  AE criteria (e.g., inadvertent 
dosing of non-study subject) should be reported to  the Syneos Safety  Department within  
24 hours of awareness.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  in Individuals Not Enrolled  in the Study  
If an AE inadvertently occurs in an individual not enrolled in the study (e.g., during 
administration of study drug), the Adverse Event Form provided to investigators should be 
completed  and submitted  to Syneos SafetyDepartment, by [CONTACT_824638]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events  
If a female study patient becomes pregnant during study drug administration or within [ADDRESS_1143612] urgently email a completed  
Pregnancy  Form to Syneos Safety  Department (Section 10.2).  
 
If a female partner of a male study patient is pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by [CONTACT_824639] (between study drug administration and up to 16 weeks after the termination visit), 
the Investigator should be informed immediately. The Investigator must advise the male patient 
to have his female partner inform her treating physician immediately, and the Investigator must urgently email a  completed Pregnancy  Report Form to Syneos Safety D epartment.  
 
In all cases, the pregnancy must be followed up through delivery or other fetal outcome. Newborns should be monitored until at least 8 weeks of age for any potential congenital 
anomalies.  The Investigator should promptly report any abnormal fetal outcome (i.e., congenital 
anomaly or birth defect, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, pre-mature birth or 
outcome other than live normal birth) on an SAE form.

11.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
11.1. General  Considerations 
It is anticipated  that all statistical summaries  will be performed  using SAS software  Version  9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or higher. Additional software may be used for the 
production of graphics. 
 
11.1.1. Analysis Populations 
The safety analysis population will consist of all patients treated with at least 1 dose of study  
medication  (cerdulatinib). Safety  data will be summarized  by [CONTACT_15994], based  on the original 
assigned  dose of study drug. 
 
The efficacy analysis  population for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will consist of 
all patients who have taken at  least  [ADDRESS_1143613] data at the required time points.  Any windows for timing of measurements,  
etc., will be  specified in the SAP.  
 
11.1.2. Cohort Comparability 
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized for Phase 2a by [CONTACT_178948].  No formal statistical analyses of these data are planned, but descriptive statistics may be 
used to aid in interpreting  results.  
 
11.1.3. Efficacy  Endpoints  and Analyses 
Responses will be summarized with patients classified as CR, PR, SD, PD, or not evaluable. 
The overall response rate (CR+PR) and clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) will be summarized  
along with [ADDRESS_1143614] 95% confidence intervals.  Responses will be  based  on CT  or CT/PET,  
evaluated  per IWG  Criteria  [3] for patients with  lymphoma and on peripheral  lymphocyte counts 
and bone marrow biopsy results for patients with CLL [ 2]. Listings of tumor response for each 
patient will also be provided. Responses will be summarized separately for each dose level in  
Phase 1 and for each  cohort and dose level  in Phase  2a. Due to differences  in underlying disease 
and prior treatment, response rates considered clinically significant and that would prompt further study will depend on the cohort. Such summaries will also depend on the safety and 
tolerability profile observed. While it is anticipated that a 30 to 40% response rate in a future 
study will be  sufficient to support further investigation, no criteria for success in this study 
are specified.  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  103  
  
 
In addition to  the tumor response rates  described above, the following efficacy  endpoints will be 
assessed  (defined in Table 3  and reproduced below): 
• DOR (duration of response) – defined as the time from the first documentation of PR or 
CR to the earlier  of the first documentation of disease progression or death  from  
any cause.  
• PFS (progression- free survival) – defined as the time from the start of cerdulatinib  
treatment  to the earlier  of the first  documentation of disease progression or death  from  
any cause.  
• LNR (lymp h node response) – defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥ 50% 
decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters  
(SPD)  of index lymph nodes. 
• TTR (time -to-treatment response) – defined as the time from the start of cerdulatinib  
treatment  to the first documentation of CR or PR.  
 
11.1.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses,  Phase  1 and 2a 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (described in Section 9.1.1 and Section 9.1.2) will be  
calculated  for each patient  and summarized  for patients  with  sufficient  samples  available.  
During Phase 2a, plasma samples will be  taken  as described  in Appendix 1.  
 
11.1.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses, Phase  1 and 2a 
A number of PD parameters will be measured serially as described in Section 9.2. At each  
time point, each of these parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994].  In addition, the 
parameters over time will be plotted for each patient and dose cohort. No formal statistical 
analyses  are planned. 
 
11.1.6. Safety  Analyses, Phase 1  and 2a 
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of Grade 3 or higher clinically significant toxicity 
by [CONTACT_15994],  and the secondary safety  endpoints are as  follows: 
• Adverse event  profile (classified  by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v5.0). 
• Clinically  significant changes in vital signs, physical exams by [CONTACT_15994].  
• Changes in hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters by  [CONTACT_15994].  
 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher clinically significant toxicity will be summarized and listed  
by [CONTACT_824598] 1. 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (Phase 1) and 
NCI_CTCAE v5.0 (Phase 2a)  and coded  according  to the latest  MedDRA  version available at 
the time  of database creation.  The number and percent of patients  with any AE will be  presented  
by [CONTACT_493693]  (SOC) and  preferred term  for each cohort will be summarized  by [CONTACT_824640] [ADDRESS_1143615] of approximately 20 to 50 patients with relapsed or refractory 
disease.  Initial enrollment into  any cohort will be up to  20 patients; cohorts may be expanded  to 
[ADDRESS_1143616] 20 patients, enrollment in the cohort will be closed, as the upper bound (UB) of the 95% confidence interval would be approximately 25%. If [ADDRESS_1143617] provide the following documentation 
required by [CONTACT_1260], including but not limited to, (copi[INVESTIGATOR_244090]): 
1. FDA  Form  1572. 
2. Curriculum vitae  of the Investigator. 
3. A signed copy of the IRB or Ethics  Committee  approval notice for protocol and informed 
consent. 
4. A copy of the IRB or Ethics Committee  approved informed consent. 
5. Completed  financial  disclosure form  for the Investigator. 
 
12.2. Data  Reporting  and Case  Report  Forms  (CRF)  
eCRFs are to be completed using a Sponsor- designated EDC system.  Sites will receive training  
and have access to help text for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted  
electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the 
Sponsor. Data entered into an eCRF will be processed in a US 21 CFR Part 11-compliant 
system.  
 
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site staff. It is the Investigator’s  
responsibility  to ensure the accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the da ta reported  
on the subject’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the 
patient’s participation in the study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs,  and patient’s clinical status.  
 
The Investigator or designated  representative should complete  the eCRF  as soon as  possible after 
information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination.  eCRFs should be reviewed and 
electronically  verified, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_18370]. 
 
12.3. Deviation from  the Protocol 
The Investigator should not deviate from  the protocol. In medical  emergencies,  the Investigator 
will use medical judgment and will remove the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the  
Sponsor’s MM, the Safety Monitor, and the IRB immediately regarding the type of emergency 
and course of action taken. Any action in this  regard will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
The Sponsor will not assume any  responsibility  or liability  for any  deviation or change from  
the protocol.

Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  106  
  
 
12.4. Study  Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the stu dy, a representative of Portola will 
visit the investigational study site to perform the  following: 
• Determine  the adequacy  of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Portola or its representatives. This will be  
documented in  a Clinical  Study Agreement between  Portola and the Investigator. 
 
During the study, a monitor from Portola or representative will have  regular  contacts  with  the 
investigational site, for the  following: 
• Provide information  and support  to the Investigator(s). 
• Confirm  that facilities  remain  acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability  checks are  being performed. 
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant  to the study. This will require  direct  access  to all original records for  
each patient (e.g., clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to  Portola. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any  SAEs  
have been forwarded to Portola and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwa rded to the IRB.  
 
The monitor will be available between  visits if  the Investigator(s) or other staff  needs 
information  or advice.  
 
12.5. Audits  and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Portola, a regulatory agency, an Independent Ethics Committee or 
an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a Portola audit or inspecti on is to systematically and  
independently examine all study- related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according  
to the protocol, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_824641] a regulatory agency  about an inspection. 
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143618]  (IRB) or  Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC) 
The Investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval for the investigation. Initial IRB/IEC approval,  
and all materials approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC for this study including the patient consent form and 
recruitment  materials  must be maintained  by [CONTACT_824642]. 
 
12.7. Drug  Accountability  
The Investigator must maintain accurate records of the amounts and dates study drug was received from Portola and dispensed to the patients. All drug supplies must be accounted for 
during the study and at the termination of the study and a written explanation provided for any 
discrepancies.  All partially used or unused drug supplies will be destroyed at the site in 
accordance with site standard operatin g procedures approved by [CONTACT_824643] 
(or designated depot) after written authorization is obtained. The Investigator will maintain a  
record  of the amount, reason and dates  when unused supplies were either  destroyed  or returned  
to Portola .  All records will be retained as noted in  Section 15.2. 
 
12.8. Disclosure of Data  
Individual patient medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential and disclosure to third parties other than those noted below is prohibited. Patient  
confidentiality will be further assured by [CONTACT_824644]. The study personnel, employees of the regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the study Sponsor, Portola, and its agents and representatives will need to review patient medical records in order to accurately record  
information  for this study. If results  of this  study are reported  in medical  journals or at  meetings,  
the patient’s identity  will remain confidential.  
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143619] submit written approval to Portola before he or she can enroll any 
patient/patient into the study. 
 
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising 
used to recruit  patients for  the study. The protocol must be re-approved by [CONTACT_824645], as local regulations require.  
 
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious  
adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product. Portola will provide this information to the Investigator. 
 
Progress  reports  and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions  will be provided to  the IRB 
or IEC according to local  regulations and guidelines. 
 
14.2. Ethical  Conduct  of the  Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the  
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, applicable regulatory requirements and the Portola’s policy on Bioethics. 
 
14.3. Written  Informed  Consent  
The Investigator(s) at  each  center  will ensure that the patient  is given full and  adequate oral and  
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Patients  
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The patient  
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
 
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  
 
The Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed Informed Consent Form. A copy of the 
signed Informed Consent Form  must be given to the patient.  
Clinical Study [ADDRESS_1143620] editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a 
Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  
 
Authorship will be determined  by [CONTACT_824646] (ICMJE) authorship requirements. Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be 
considered  as a joint publication by [CONTACT_66361]. 
 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know-how originating from the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the 
Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.

The collection window for  
vital signs is ± [ADDRESS_1143630] all medications  including  over the  counter preparations,  herbals,  and vitamins taken in  the 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 
Dosing begins on Day 1 and continues daily until treatment interruption or study discontinuation.  
Rituximab  dose is 375 mg/m2. Rituximab infusion should  start immediately  after cerdulatinib  is taken.  
After  Cycle 1, rituximab should  be administered  on Day  1 only of Cycles  4, 6, 8, and 10.

Quantitative immunoglobulins: quantitative levels of IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM Lymphocyte subsets:  quantitation of absolute numbers (or %) of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16/56+, and CD19+ by [CONTACT_20369].  
Results  obtained  within  60 days prior to C1D1  may be used in lieu of the Screening  assessment.  
For IgVH,  results  obtained within  3 months  prior  to C1D1 may  be used.  
Skin punch biopsy is mandatory for all patients with CTCL and should be a ≥ 5 mm punch biopsy of a representative lesion.  A biopsy should be obtained from 2 different areas of disease if possible (e.g., plaque and nodular lesions).  Subsequent biopsies should be from the same general site if  
possible.  At least 10  unstained  slides or a FFPE tissue  block  should  be submitted.  
Serial PK samples will be collected on C1D1 and C1D8 at pre- dose (i.e., within 60 minutes prior to the dose), and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and [ADDRESS_1143633] -dose (collection window is ± [ADDRESS_1143634] -dose timepoint [± 30 minutes]).  The [ADDRESS_1143635] -dose PK samples collected  
on C1D2 and C1D9 should be collected prior to dosing in-clinic that day.  If a patient is not dosed at a particular visit but is due to be dosed, a trough PK assessment should stil l be performed.  In addition to times specified in this row, obtain a PK sample whenever a patient experiences a dose 
reduction/interruption,  study  drug discontinuation, and any AE that may  indicate potential drug  toxicity.  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  provides additional  information.

SENSITIVE  SUSBSTRATES  
 
To avoid possible drug-drug interactions, strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP3A 
sensitive  substrates should be avoided in patients  receiving  cerdulatinib  (Table  A3-9 and  
Table A3-10).  If the Investigator feels  that use of these medications  is necessary,  this should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor. A dose adjustment (lowering) for CYP3A sensitive 
substrates  may  be considered on a case-by- case basis.

 APPENDIX 4. RESPONSE DEFINITIONS FOR B -CELL NHL AND PTCL, CLL,  
AND CTCL  
 
1. Response  Criteria  for NHL  
Radiographic (including PET scan)  and clinical  assessments  will be evaluated  in accordance with 
The Lugano Classification  [4]. The criteria are  summarized  in Table A4 -11. 
 
PET- CT is preferred for FDG -avid lymphomas and CT scan is preferred in other lymphomas. 
For patients staged with PET-CT, focal uptake in nodal and extranodal sites that is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_824578], according to the distribution and/or CT characteristics, is considered involvement with lymphoma, including spleen, liver, bone, thyroid, etc. 
 
For patients  staged with  CT: 
• Selection  of target (measured)  lesions is  as follows: 
○ Up to [ADDRESS_1143636]  nodes, nodal masses,  and extranodal lesions selected  to be 
clearly  measurable in 2 diameters:  
○ A measurable node must have a longest transverse diameter of  a lesion  (LDi) 
> 1.5 cm. 
○ A measurable extranodal  lesion  (e.g., hepatic nodules) should have an LDi > 1.0 cm.  
○ Preferably,  nodes should be disparate regions of the body and should include, where 
applicable,  mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas.  
○ Non-nodal lesions include those in  solid  organs (e.g., liver,  spleen,  kidneys, and  
lungs), gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on 
palpation. If possible, they should: 
○ Be from  disparate regions  of the body. 
○ Include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas  of disease whenever  these sites 
are involved. 
• Selection  of non- target  (non- measured)  lesions: 
○ Any lesions not selected as target (measured) and truly assessable lesions should be 
considered  not measured. 
○ These lesions include any  nodes, nodal masses,  and extranodal lesions not selected  as 
target (measured) or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable lesions, which are any sites of 
suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement,  
(e.g., cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, 
ascites, leptomeningeal lesions/dise ase) and other lesions that cannot be confirmed 
and followed by [CONTACT_9661].

It is recognized  that in Waldeyer’s  ring or extranodal  sites with high 
physiologic  uptake  or with activation within  spleen  or marrow  
(e.g., with chemotherapy or myeloid colony- stimulating factors),  
uptake may be greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver.  In this  
circumstance,  complete  metabolic  response  may be inferred  if uptake  
at sites of initial involvement is no greater than surrounding normal  
tissue even if the tissue has high  physiologic uptake.  Target nodes/nodal masses must regress to < 1.5 cm in

dominant  lesions: Up to  six of the largest  dominant  nodes,  nodal  masses,  and extranodal  lesions selected  to be clearly  measurable  in two  diameters.  Nodes  
should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal  areas.  Non-nodal lesions  
include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation.  Nonmeasured lesions:  
Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured.  These sites include any nodes,  
nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quant itatively with measurement,  
includ ing pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by

 2. Response  Criteria  for CLL  
Radiographic and clinical assessments in accordance with the criteria established by [CONTACT_36104] [ 2] 
will be used to determine response. CT scan is the preferred method for evaluating tumor 
response. The spleen and liver  shoul d also be assessed by  [CONTACT_5292].  
• Selection  of target (measured)  lesions for imaging  or physical examination: 
○ Up to six of the largest nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be 
clearly  measurable in  2 diameters at baseline.  
○ A measurable node must have a longest transverse diameter  of a lesion  (LDi) 
> 1.5 cm.  A measurable  extranodal lesion  (e.g., hepatic nodules) should have an LDi 
> 1.0 cm. 
○ Nodes should preferably be from  disparate regions of the body and should include, 
where applicable, mediastinal and  retroperitoneal areas.  
○ Non-nodal lesions include those in solid  organs (e.g., liver,  spleen,  kidneys, and  
lungs), gastrointestinal (GI)  involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted 
on palpation. 
○ If possib le, they  should be  from disparate regions of the body. 
○ If possible, they  should include mediastinal and  retroperitoneal  areas  of disease 
whenever these sites are involved. 
• Selection  of non- target  (non -measured)  lesions for imaging  or physical examination: 
○ Any lesions not selected as target (measured) and truly assessable lesions should be 
considered  not measured. 
○ These lesions include any  nodes, nodal masses,  and extranodal lesions not selected  as 
target (measured) or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still 
considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable lesions, which are any sites of 
suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement,  
(e.g., cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, leptomeningeal lesions/disease)  and other lesions that cannot be confirmed 
and followed by [CONTACT_9661].  
 
3. Complete Response  (CR)  
To satisfy the criteria for CR, all of the following criteria must be met and must persist  
for ≥ 8 weeks:  
• No evidence of new disease  
• ALC  in peripheral blood of < 4 x 109/L 
• Regression of all target nodal masses to normal size (i.e., ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1143643] diameter for
 nodes that were considered large at baseline and ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1143644] perpendicular 
diameter  for nodes that were considered small at baseline)  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  127  
 • Normal  spleen  and liver size 
• Regression to normal of all nodal non- target disease and disappearance of all detectable 
non-nodal, non- target disease  
• No disease -related  constitutional symptoms 
• Peripheral  blood counts meeting  all of the following criteria:  
○ ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without need  for exogenous growth factors  (e.g., G- CSF)  
○ Platelet  count ≥ 100 x 109/L without need for exogenous growth factors 
○ Hemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) without red  blood cell  transfusions or need  for 
exogenous growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin) 
Notes : 
• Morphologically negative bone marrow is defined as < 30% of nucleated cells and no  
lymphoid nodules in a bone marrow  sample  that is normocellular  for age.  
• Patients  who  fulfill  all the criteria  for a CR (including bone marrow criteria) but  who  
have a persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia that is related to prior or 
ongoing drug toxicity (and not to CLL) will be considered as a CR with incomplete 
marrow  recovery  (CRi).  
 
4. Partial Response  (PR)  
To satisfy  criteria  for PR,  all of  the following criteria  must be met  and must persist for 
≥ 8 weeks:  
• No evidence of new disease  
• Decrease in peripheral blood ALC  by ≥ 50% from  baseline  
• A decrease by ≥ 50% from  the baseline in the SPD (sum  of the products) of the target  
nodal lesions 
• In patients  with  enlargement  of the spleen  or liver at  baseline:  
○ Normal spleen size, or a decrease by ≥ 50% from baseline in the pretreatment 
enlargement  of the vertical  dimension below the left costal margin  (by [CONTACT_23302]) or 
in total vertical dimension (by  [CONTACT_9661]) 
○ Normal liver size, or a decrease by ≥ 50% from baseline in the pretreatment enlargement of the liver total vertical dimension at the right costal margin (by  
[CONTACT_824650]) or a qualitative decrease in liver  size (by [CONTACT_9661]) 
• No increase in  the size of the liver or spleen  
• No increase  in the size of non- target  disease  
• No persistent  (lasting  > 4 weeks)  worsening of disease- related  constitutional symptoms 
• Peripheral  blood counts meeting  any of the following  criteria:  
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  128  
 ○ ANC  ≥ 1.5 x 109/L or ≥ 50% increase  over baseline without need for exogenous 
growth factors  (e.g., G- CSF)  
○ Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L or ≥ 50% increase over baseline without need for 
exogenous growth factors 
○ Hemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) or ≥ 50% increase over baseline without red  blood 
cell transfusions or need  for exogenous growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin) 
 
Note : Patients who achieve a PR by [CONTACT_36104] 2008 criteria [ 2] in all parameters  
except lymphocyte count will be considered PR with lymphocytosis.  Patients  
with  a PR  with  lymphocytosis  will not be considered  to have achieved  a PR  until  
there is a 50% reduction in ALC  from  baseline  was achieved or ALC  
< 4 × 109/L. 
 
Note : Marrow should have at least  a 50% reduction  in marrow infiltrate or 
B-lymphoid nodules  
 
5. Stable  Disease  (SD)  
To satisfy  the criteria for  SD, the following  criteria  must be met: 
• No evidence of new disease, i.e., there is neither sufficient evidence of tumor shrinkage 
to qualify for PR nor sufficient  evidence of tumor growth to qualify for definitive  disease 
progression. 
 
6. Progressive Disease (PD) 
• The occurrence of any of the following events indicates definitive PD: 
Evidence of any new disease that was  not present as baseline:  
• A new node that measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter  
• A new node that measures > 1.0 cm to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1143645] diameter and > 1.[ADDRESS_1143646] perpendicular diamete r 
• New hepatomegaly  or splenomegaly 
• New  non- target  disease (e.g., effusions, ascites,  or other organ abnormalities related  
to CLL)  
Note : Isolated new effusions,  ascites,  or other organ abnormalities are not  sufficient  
evidence alone of PD unless histologically confirmed. Thus, a declaration of PD 
should  not be made if this  is the only  manifestation  of apparently new disease.  
 
• Evidence of worsening of lymph nodes, spleen  or liver,  or non- target disease:  
○ Increase by ≥ 50% from the nadir in the SPD  of target  lesions. 
Clinical Study 13 -601 
Portola  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Cerdulatinib  
Protocol  Amendment  9 
14 October  2019  Confidential  Page  129  
 ○ Increase by ≥ 50% from the nadir in the product of the perpendicular diameters for 
any individual node; progression of a single lesion requires that the lesion 
demonstrates a ≥50% in the product of its diameters and tha t the lesion now meets the  
definition of abnormal (a node that was considered large at baseline must now measure > 1.[ADDRESS_1143647] now measure > 1.[ADDRESS_1143648] diameter  perpendicul ar to the long 
diameter  of the lesion).

10. Modified  Severity  Weighted  Assessment  Tool (mSWAT) for CTCL  
D. Total Body Surface Area  (TBSA)  Involvement by [CONTACT_824654] 12 regions with pre-assigned %TBSA based on the burn literature. The  
extent  of skin disease in each  region is  quantified by [CONTACT_552599]’s palm to measure the 
%TBSA involvement within region: patient’s palm with 4 fingers (excluding the thumb) is 1% 
of TBSA.  Patient’s palm without fingers is 0.5% of TBSA. The patient’s palm with 4 fingers is  
traced  on a transparency  sheet at  the baseline visit,  using a permanent  marker that  will not rub  off 
or smear.  The transparency of the patient’s palm should be used in all mSWAT assessments  
during the course of the clinical study. The transparency will be labeled with the patient’s study  
ID number kept in the patient’s study file on site. Using the baseline visit transparency of the patient’s palm, the investigator will measure and record on the electronic case report form 
(example of table from eCRF is given below) the %TBSA for each lesion type within each of the 
12 regions. 
 
E. Severity  Weighting Factor 
The severity  weighting factors will be  the following: 
1. = patch (flat erythema  or erythema with mild  infiltration), multiply  by 1. 
2. = plaque (elevated  erythema or erythema with moderate infiltration), multiply  by 2. 
3. = tumor or ulceration (erythema with fissuring, ulceration or tumor), multiply  by 4. 
 
Patch is defined as abnormal skin not elevated from normal skin. A plaque is defined as 
abnormal  skin elevated from normal skin by < 5 mm.  A plaque elevated ≥  5 mm is a  tumor.

 F. Calculating  Skin Scores  
The sum of %TBSA by [CONTACT_552600] %TBSA from all regions affected by 
[CONTACT_552601]. The sum of %TBSA across lesion types (patches, plaques, and tumors) within each region cannot exceed the %TBSA for the region. For example, the %TBSA for the head region 
is 7%.  The sum of %TBSA across lesion types from head can only range from 0 to 7%. The 
skin score subtotal by [CONTACT_552602] %TBSA for patches 
from  all regions by 1, sum of %TBS of plaques from all regions by 2, and the sum of %TBSA  of 
tumors or ulcers from all regions by 4. The skin score total is derived from summing the skin 
score subtotals for patches, plaques, and tumors or ulcers. The skin score total is dimensionless  
with a scale of  0 to 400. See Table A4 -19.

1.1 Background  
 
Heart  failure  (HF) is  the leading  cause  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91129]  >[ADDRESS_100665] in excess of $[ADDRESS_100666] preserved EF (HFpEF) with a left ventricular EF of ≥50%. The prevalence of HFpEF  
relative to HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) is increasing by 1% per year.[ADDRESS_100667] to HFrEF,  
where 7 drugs/devices have been shown to improve mortality, there is no proven treatment  
that improves outcomes in HFpEF.[ADDRESS_100668] a benefit in HFpEF. One possible reason  
for the failure of prior clinical trials is the complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology of  
HFpEF, and enrolling patients with different underlying mechanisms into the same study  
may mask any real benefits.3–6 
 
While multiple cardiovascular abnormalities are known to contribute to the pathophysiology  
of exercise intolerance in HFpEF, chronotropic incompeten ce (CI) is one consistently  
observed finding across studies.7–[ADDRESS_100669] identified CI in  
20-57% of HFpEF patients, and in the recently completed RELAX trial, the prevalence of CI  
was 77%.[ADDRESS_100670] ™ is a 
market -approved  dual-chamber  pacemaker  (pulse  generator),  Class  III Device,  Category  B. It 
will be used with atrial and ventricular leads, Medtronic CapSureFix MRI ™ model number  
5086.  
 
Medtronic Azure XT DR MRI ™ model W1DR01 is a permanent, dual -chambe r cardiac  
pacemaker with the ability to continuously monitor and record patient activity, and respond  
to activity by [CONTACT_91146] (rate adaptive atrial pacing). It will  
be programmed in AAIR  mode  to pace  the right atrium.

 1.3.1 Study  Rationale  
 
Heart rate (HR) response to exercise is closely correlated with exercise capacity in HFpEF9, 
but it remains unknown whether improving HR responses will translate to improvements in  
exercise tolerance and quality of life in HFpEF. Guideline statements and review articles  
frequently recommend HR reduction, rather than higher heart rates in HFpEF.13 This is based  
on the idea that a slower  HR will increase  time available  for diastolic  filling.  
 
There  is some  evidence  to support  this approach.  In a human  invasive  study,  Westermann  
and colleagues reported that stroke volume dropped in HFpEF during atrial pacing (120  
bpm) - an effect related principally to a 28% reduction in LV end diastolic volume  
(LVEDV).14 However, as pointed out by [CONTACT_91147], this is not an unexpected finding with isolated  
pacing in healthy people and HF patients.15 In a separate acute pacing study, Wachter et al.  
observed less enhancement in LV re laxation velocity (dP/dt min) coupled with reduced stroke  
volume and end diastolic volumes in HFpEF compared with controls.16 But again, the  
relevance of these observations to exercise physiology is unclear, because pacing was not  
performed during exercise,  where venous return is markedly increased. Indeed, in the  
Westermann study, pacing was also associated with a significant reduction in LV filling  
pressures in the HFpEF group (16.1 to 7.7 mmHg, p<0.0001), and it is possible that if venous  
return were enha nced (as with exercise), pacing would have been associated with stable  
filling pressures and stable or even enhanced stroke volume response, which would increase  
cardiac  output and improve  exercise  capacity.  
 
While it is commonly believed that exercise lim itation in HFpEF is predominantly caused by  
[CONTACT_91148] (ventricular filling abnormality),[ADDRESS_100671] recently shown that it is  
rather inadequate cardiac ejection reserve that is the dominant culprit.7 People with HFpEF  
display less increase in cardiac output (CO) for any increase in metabolic demand (oxygen  
consumption, VO 2), with no deficit in the increase in preload volume. The abnormality in CO  
reserve is caused by [CONTACT_91149] (SV) enhancements during  
exerci se.[ADDRESS_100672] exercise  
capacity —in other words, this remains an unanswered fundamental question for  which there  
is currently clinical equipoise.  
 
Permanent pacemaker implantation is approved for the treatment of patients with  
symptomatic  chronotropic  incompetence  (CI).[ADDRESS_100673] cardiologists are  
reluctant  to or do not  consider  referring  HFpEF  patients  for pacemaker  implantation.  
Rate-adaptive  Atrial Pacing  In Diastolic  Heart Failure  (RAPID -HF)  
Page  [ADDRESS_100674] of employing rate -adaptive pacing in patients  
with HFpEF.  
 
Pacemaker implantation is routinely performed and study subjects may be exposed to the  
same  risks faced  by [CONTACT_91150]  a pacemaker, which  can include:  
• Air embolism  
• Atrial  or ventricular  arrhythmias  
• Bleeding  
• Cardiac  perforation,  valve  damage,  and tamponade  
• Death  
• Failure  of the device  or leads  after placement  requiring  repeat procedure  
• Hematoma  or fluid accumulation  
• Heart  block  
• Infection  
• Pneumothorax  
• Venous  thrombosis,  stroke,  pulmonary  embolism  
• In placement of the right ventricular lead in a dual -chamber pacemaker system, there  
may be worsening of tricuspid regurgitation. This risk was carefully considered  
against the alternative of use a  single -lead (atrial only) pacemaker system. However,  
dual-chamber pacemakers including a ventricular lead are currently standard of care  
and have been shown to be as safe as single -lead systems.19 In another study,  
approximately 2% of patients per year re quired an additional procedure to place a  
ventricular lead due to development of AV nodal disease.20 The presence of atrial  
fibrillation (AF) also requires the placement of a ventricular lead. A recent study  
showed that up to two thirds of patients with HF pEF will develop AF at some point in  
the natural history of  the disease.21 
 
As discussed previously, there may be possible adverse effects of rate -adaptive pacing in  
patients  with HFpEF related to  increasing the  heart rate:  
• Arrhythmias  
• Death  
• Inappropriately  high pacing  rates due  to sensor  malfunction  
• Pulmonary  edema  
• Worsening  heart  failure  
 
Possible  adverse  effects  associated  with cardiopulmonary  exercise  (CPX)  testing:  
• Arrhythmias  
• Chest  pain and difficulty  breathing  
• Death  
• Heart  attack  or stroke  
• Fainting  (syncope)  or near-fainting

 Every effort has been made to minimize these potential risks through careful study design,  
patient selection, and close monitoring. The incidence of adverse effects during CPX testing  
in heart failur e patients is low (less than 1%) and is generally safe.22–[ADDRESS_100675] of  exercise  stress  tests in patients with  HFpEF.  
 
1.3.3 Potential  Benefits  
 
We are studying a group of highly symptomatic patients with HFpEF. Pacing may im prove  
exercise capacity, daily activity tolerance, and overall quality of life by [CONTACT_91151]. Future patients with symptomatic HFpEF with  
chronotropic incompetence may also benefit from the results of this study. If pacing is found  
to significantly improve symptoms in HFpEF, without excessive risk, it may become  
common  practice  for this population.  
 
2 Study  Objectives  
 
This investigation constitutes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_91130] (RAP) in subjects with chronotropic incompetence and heart failure with a preserved  
ejection fraction in a double blind, crossover study design, examining effects on exercise  
capacity,  symptoms,  chronic  daily  activity  tolerance,  quality  of life and neurohormone  levels.  
 
We anticipate it will take 20 weeks per patient to complete this study. During this time there  
will be 6 study visits to  Mayo Clinic.  
 
2.1 Objective  1 
 
To determine the effects of rate adaptive atrial pacing on exercise capacity in HFpEF.  
People  with HFpEF  and chronotropic  incompetence  (CI) will undergo  permanent  pacemaker  
implantation, and exercise capacity will be assessed by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_91131] a crossover  design.  
• Our primary hypothesis is that rate -adaptive atrial pacing will improve exercise  
capacity  in HFpEF with CI.  
• Our secondary  hypotheses  are that pacing  will reduce  symptoms  of dyspnea  and 
fatigue  during exercise  and improve  ventilatory efficiency.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_100676]  will be  
performed  with pacing on versus off.  
• Our primary hypothesis is that daily activity (minutes active per day assessed by  
[CONTACT_91152])  will be greater  during  the pacing -on period  as compared  with pacing  
off. 
Rate-adaptive  Atrial Pacing  In Diastolic  Heart Failure  (RAPID -HF)  
Page  11 of 32 
Mayo  Clinic  and Medtronic,  Inc. CONFIDENTIAL   
 • Our secondary hypothesis is that 6 minute walk distance will be greater with pacing  
on compared  with pacing  off. 
 
2.3 Objective  3 
To determine the effects of rate adaptive atrial pacing on quality of life and biomarkers in 
HFpEF. People with HFpEF  will complete quality of life questionnaires with blood testing  
with pacing on/off.  
• Our primary hypothesis is that quality of life will be improved with pacing on as  
compared  with pacing off.  
• Our secondary hypothesis is that NT -proBNP levels will be lower  with pacing on  
versus  off. 
 
[ADDRESS_100677].  
 
We plan to enroll 50 subjects with HFpEF  and CI meeting entry criteria to allow for  
complete  endpoint data  in 30.

 3.2 Primary  Study  Endpoints  
Assessment  of exercise  performance and  symptoms  (Objective  1) 
Volumes of oxygen consumed (VO 2), carbon dioxide produced (VCO 2), breathing frequency  
(fb), tidal volume (V T), minute ventilation (V E), partial pressure of end -tidal oxygen and  
carbon  dioxide  (PETO2 and PETCO 2, respectively)  and derived  variables  (e.g. V E/VCO 2 slope)  
will be measured using a low resistance, open -circuit automated metabolic system (Medical  
Graphics) integrated with a mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, model 1100) as previously  
utilized by [CONTACT_27156].7–9,[ADDRESS_100678]  
(and determining when peak exercise has been achieved) will be blinded to the  
electrocardiogram to limit potential for bias. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) will be  
determined as the ratio of VCO 2/VO 2. VO 2 at anaerobic threshold (VAT) will be determined  
using the V -slope method. Peak VO 2 will be determined as the final 30 second average at  
peak  exercise.  
 
Assessment  of Daily  Activity  Tolerance  (Objective  2) 
While peak exercise capacity is a valid, clinically relevant intermediate endpoint in HF trials,  
it provides relatively little insight into changes in activities of daily living, which are of more  
concern to the individual pa tient. The pacemaker devices used in this trial contain  
accelerometers that provide highly quantitative data (such as hours active each day) and have  
been used to characterize activity and to assess the impact of interventions on activity levels  
in patient s with  other  chronic  diseases  such as COPD, obesity and  arthritis.  
 
Quality  of life and biomarker  assessment (Objective  3) 
Quality of life will be assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire  
(KCCQ).27 NT-proBNP  levels will  also be obtained  at multiple  time points.  
 
3.3 Primary  Safety  Endpoints  
 
Data  will be collected  to determine:  
• Overall  survival  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91132],  and for heart  failure  in particular  
• Symptoms  of worsening  heart  failure  
• Incidence  of all serious  adverse  events  including unanticipated  adverse  device  effects  
• Incidence  of all device  failures and  malfunctions  
 
[ADDRESS_100679]  Selection,  Enrollment  and Withdrawal  
 
Patients with HFpEF  and chronotropic incompetence will be the target population of this  
trial. We plan to  recruit  50 subjects  for this study  to allow  for complete  endpoint  data in 30.

of the invasive nature of this study, investigators will do everything possible to avoid  
withdrawing patient s from this study after implantation. Some reasons to withdraw may  
include:  
• Subject  safety  issues  and adverse  device  effects  or complications

5.1 Description  
 
Permanent pacemaker implantation is approved for treatment of symptomatic sinus node  
dysfunction  with chronotropic  incompetence  (Class I  indication).18 
 
We will use the following devices/components:  
• Pacemaker  pulse  generator:  Medtronic  Azure  XT DR  MRI ™ model  W1DR01  
• Leads:  Medtronic  CapSureFix  MRI ™ model  number  [ADDRESS_100684] location at the time of implant. The pulse generator is  
connected to a right atrial lead, and a right ventricular lead. These leads are usually inserted  
into the left subclavian vein an d anchored by [CONTACT_91154]. The  
position  after placement is confirmed by X -ray. 
 
The pacemaker is able to monitor the electrical activity of the atria and ventricles  
independently to determine the rhythm and heart rate. The pulse g enerator also contains an  
accelerometer that records patient motion. If activity is sensed on the real time accelerometry  
data,  the pacemaker  will increase  the rate of pacing.  The pattern  of rate  increase  and return  to 
baseline  will be programmed  to achieve a  30 bpm increase  in rate with vigorous  walking.

 This model  of pacemaker employs  a dual-slope  rate response  curve  that allows  two stages  of 
increase  for activities of  daily  living, and active  exercise.  
 
Each device (pulse generator and leads) has a manufacturer assigned serial number that will  
be documented in the  patient chart as per  routine  clinical practice.

5.3 Preparation  and Administration/Implantation  of Investigational  Device  
 
All participants  will receive  the same  device;  there will  not be a sham  procedure  or device.  
The device should be implanted within [ADDRESS_100686]  
of care testing during the implantation procedure to determine acceptable pacing and sensing  
thresholds,  and later  placement will  be confirmed  on X -ray. 
 
Immediately following completion of the implant, the pacemaker should be set to inactive or  
minimal pacing modes such as VVI or AAI (50 ppm). Prior to discharge, the pacemaker will  
be programmed to AAIR mode with a lower rate limit of [ADDRESS_100687] with the patient to arrange for study visits, and to monitor for adverse events,

 Pacemaker  and leads  will be distributed  to the implanting  physicians  and their team  before  
the procedure. The specific serial numbers will be  recorded in the patient’s chart. Devices  
will only be  distributed immediately  before  the procedure.  
 
5.8.4 Return  or Destruction  of Study  Device  
 
At routine intervals and at the completion of the study, there will be a reconciliation of  
devices shipped, devices utilized, and devices remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged  
on the Device Accountability form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be  
documented,  the sponsor -investigator  will be notified  and an investigation will  be conducted  
to determine the cause of the discrepancy.  Devices destroyed on site will be documented in  
the study files.  
 
6 Study  Procedures  
6.1 Visit  1: Screening  to determine  eligibility  + Baseline  visit 
• The consent  form  should  be reviewed  and signed  before  proceeding with  screening  
• Patient history will be reviewed for complete medical history, physical examination,  
EKG, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, a pregnancy test if applicable, review of  
current  medications and  NT-proBNP results.  
• Prior to implantation , consult with an electrophysiologist to determine eligibility and  
rule out contraindications to pacing or exclusion criteria (such as preexisting AV  
nodal  disease).  
 
6.2 Visit  2: Pacemaker  Implantation  
• If patient is eligible, they will undergo implantation wi th a Medtronic Azure XT DR  
MRI™ dual-chamber permanent pacemaker with MRI compatible atrial and  
ventricular leads. Placement will be verified on X -ray and the device will be tested to  
ensure  it is functioning correctly.  
• Following  placement,  there  will be a 4 week  recovery  period  with the pacemaker  off. 
6.3 Visit  3: Randomization  
• During this visit patients will take their baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy  
Questionnaire  (KCCQ),  NT-proBNP,  and a  limited  echocardiogram.  
• In pacemaker clinic the device function will be verified and patients will undergo a  
hall walk or treadmill walk to titrate rate responsiveness to achieve about 30 bpm  
greater  HR with pacing during vigorous walking.  
• At this visit, half the participants (gr oup 1) will have their pacemakers turned on,  
while  the other  half (group 2)  will have  them  off until the next follow -up 4 weeks  
later.  
 
6.4 Visit  4: Follow -up 1 
• At this visit there  will be an exercise  stress  test, a six-minute  walk  test, a repeat  
KCCQ,  and NT-proBNP.  
Rate-adaptive  Atrial Pacing  In Diastolic  Heart Failure  (RAPID -HF)  
Page  19 of 32 
Mayo  Clinic  and Medtronic,  Inc. CONFIDENTIAL   
 • Pacemaker  function  will be checked  and both groups  will have  their pacemakers  
turned  off for 4 weeks for  a wash out period.  
 
6.5 Visit  5: Follow -up 2 
• At this visit a repeat  KCCQ  and NT-proBNP  will be obtained.  
• Pacemaker function will be checked, and then subjects will be switched to the  
opposite setting. If pacemaker was off at the randomization visit, it will be turned on.  
If pacemaker  was on at the  randomization visit, it  will remain off.  
 
6.6 Visit  6: Follow -up 3 
• Pacemaker function will be checked. They will undergo an exercise test, a six -minute  
walk  test, a  KCCQ,  and NT-proBNP.  
• After the final visit, all patients will have their pacemakers turned on and will follow - 
up for standard  clinical care  with their cardio logist.

[ADDRESS_100690] deviation of the change in ventilator anaerobic threshold (VAT)  
between two CPX tests in subjects receiving placebo in the RELAX trial was 1.14  
ml/kg/min. Assuming this degree of variability, a sample size of 30 subjects will pro vide 
90% power to detect a change in VAT of 0.70 ml/kg/min or greater with pacing, assuming a  
two-sided significance level of 0.05 in a crossover study design. This detectable difference  
corresponds  to approximately  10% of the baseline mean  VAT  observed  in RELAX.  Peak

 HR in the RELAX  trial was 109±[ADDRESS_100691] based upon our algorithm for pacemaker  
programming (based upon observed vigorous hall walk) that HR at anaerobic threshold will  
be ~30 bpm greater  than resting HR.  
 
7.2 Statistical  Methods  
Descriptive  Statistics  
Univariate  descriptive  statistics  and frequency  distributions  will be calculated,  as appropriate  
for all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary  
and secondary) will be tabulated for the treatment groups.  These analyses will help identify  
potential  confounding variables  to be  used as  covariates in  sensitivity analyses.  
 
Handling  of Missing Data  
 
Every effort will be made to ensure missing data is kept at a minimum. When entering data  
into the database,  outliers or  invalid  data will be investigated  to check accuracy.  Because  of 
the relatively small size of this study, it should be feasible to keep missing data below 5%  
and avoid  the use of imputation.  
 
Multiplicity  
 
No correction will be made for multiple comparisons as we are evaluating a relatively small  
number  of variables.  
 
Objective 1:  Determine effects of rate adaptive pacing on exercise capacity  
Primary  Hypothesis:  
VO2 at anaerobic threshold (VAT) within [ADDRESS_100692]. 
 
Secondary  Hypothesis:  
Other measures of exercise capacity, including treadmill exercise time, peak VO 2, and  
VE/VCO 2 slope, will be improved with pacing on as compared to pacing off. Self -reported  
symptoms  of breathlessness  and fatigue  during  CPX  (Borg  scores) are  lower  with pacing  on 
versus  off. 
 
Objective  2: Identify  effects  of rate adaptive  pacing  on daily  activity  tolerance  
Primary  Hypothesis:  
Daily activity assessed by [CONTACT_91157] 28 day period of pacing -on 
is greater  than with pacing off.  
Rate-adaptive  Atrial Pacing  In Diastolic  Heart Failure  (RAPID -HF)  
Page  21 of 32 
Mayo  Clinic  and Medtronic,  Inc. CONFIDENTIAL   
 Secondary  Hypothesis:  
The six minute  walk  test distance  is greater  with pacing  on vs pacing  off. 
 
Objective 3:  Determine effects of rate adaptive pacing on quality of life and biomarkers  
Primary  Hypothesis:  
KCCQ scores are higher after 4 weeks of pacing on versus pacing off (indicating improving  
quality  of life) 
 
Secondary  Hypothesis:  
NT-proBNP  levels  are lower  after [ADDRESS_100693]  Population(s)  for Analysis  
 
Subject  population  for analysis  will be any subject  who is randomized,  implanted  with the 
device,  and completed both halves of  the crossover study.  
 
[ADDRESS_100694] (UADE) will be recorded on the appropriate case  
report form.  Records of these events will be maintained and reports submitted to the FDA  
and IRB according to the regu latory requirements.  Expected clinical adverse events and  
nonsignificant (not serious) clinical adverse events will not be reported. Expected clinical  
adverse events  and anticipated adverse  device  effects  are those  listed  in Section 1.5.2.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_100695]  (UADE)  
A UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or  
death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not  
previously  identified  in nature,  severity,  or degree of  incidence  in the investigational  plan or 
IDE application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated  
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare o f 
subjects.

Page  [ADDRESS_100696]  involved  in clinical  study  of an investigational  
device; regardless of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable,  
other  study related treatment(s).  
 
General  Physical  Examination  Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting  
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that  
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse  
event.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  Prolonged  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91137].  Any condition responsible for surgery should be  
documented  as an adverse  event  if the condition  meets  the criteria  for an  adverse  event.  
 
Neither  the condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  nor surgery  are reported as  
an adverse  event in the  following circumstances:  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91138] a preexisting condition.  
Surgery  will not  be reported  as an  outcome  of an adverse  event if  the purpose  of the 
surgery  was elective  or diagnostic  and the outcome  was uneventful  
 
Post-study  Adverse  Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_91158], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the  
last scheduled visit, the local investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the local  
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the  subject’s personal physician,  
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The local investigator  
should notify the study regulatory sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any  
time after a subject has discontinued or te rminated study participation that may reasonably be  
related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the local investigator should  
become aware of the development of problems, cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a  
subsequently  conceived  offsp ring of a subject  that has participated  in this  study.  
 
Preexisting  Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition  
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the  
condition  worsens during  the study period.  
 
Unanticipated  Problems  Involving  Risk  to Subjects  or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated  problem  or adverse event  that meets  all of the following  three  criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or event s that results in significant harm, (which may be  
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the  
subject  or others  (including  individuals  who are not research  subjects).  These  include:  
(1) death;  (2) life threatening  adverse experience;  (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  - inpatient,  new,

 or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth  
defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new  
informat ion (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling  
change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846],  
safety,  or welfare  of the subjects  or others,  or substantially  compromise  the research  
data,  AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already  
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the  
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event  is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or  
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased  
severity  than expected,  AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is pos sibly related to the research  
procedures.  
 
Adverse  Event  Reporting  Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period will end at the final visit (Visit 6). As  
this is approved therapy for chronotropic incompetence, no further monitoring for adve rse 
events  will be  performed  after the final visit.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_100697] seek information on adverse events by  
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Study subjects will be routinely  
questioned about adverse effects at study visits. Information on all adverse events should be  
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event  
section of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related sig ns, symptoms, and abnormal  
diagnostic,  laboratory or procedure  results  should  recorded in  the source  document.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  All observed or  
volunteered adverse effects (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless of  
the treatment group if applicable or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device  
or if applicable  other  study  treatment  or diagnostic  product(s)  will be recorded  in the 
subjects’ case history.  For all adverse effects sufficient information will be pursued and or  
obtained as to permit; an adequate determination of the outcome, an assessment of the casual  
relationship between the adverse effect and the investigational device or, if applicable other  
study treatment or diagnostic product.  The clinical course of each event should be followed  
until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study  
treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse event s that are still  
ongoing  at the end of  the study period  must  be followed up,  to determine  the final outcome.

 10 Study  Monitoring,  Auditing,  and Inspecting  
10.1 Study  Monitoring  Plan  
 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator  
will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given  
access to all the study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy,  
diagnostic  laboratory, etc.), and  has adequate  space  to conduct the  monitoring visit.  
 
This study will be monitored on a routine basis during the conduct of the trial.  The Mayo  
Clinic  Office  of Research  Regulatory  Support  will provide  clinical  monitoring  for the trial as 
a service for the sponsor -investigator.  Clinical trial monitoring requires review of the study  
data generated throughou t the duration of the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the  
data along with the protection of human research subjects.  This will assist sponsor - 
investigators  in complying  with Food and  Drug  Administration  regulations.  
 
10.2 Auditing  and Inspecting  
The sponsor -investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_91161], the monitor, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g.,  
source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, s tudy data etc.).  The 
sponsor -investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related  
facilities  (e.g., pharmacy,  diagnostic  laboratory,  etc.).  
 
Participation as a sponsor -investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection  
by [CONTACT_91162].  
 
[ADDRESS_100707] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal  
approval of the study.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will b e 
made  in writing  to the  sponsor -investigator  before  commencement  of this study.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and  
providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review  
and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal consent of a subject, using the Approved  
IRB consent  form,  must  be obtained  before  that subject  undergoes  any study  procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally authorized  
representative,  and the  individual obtaining  the informed consent.

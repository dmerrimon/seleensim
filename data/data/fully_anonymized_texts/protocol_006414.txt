V. 29Dec2021 Page 4 of 212.0 Objectives
The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_900019], wide-field imaging of 
indocyanine green ingress and egress during total shoulder arthroplasty.
The long-term goal of this work is to use DCE-FA for the assessment of subscapularis 
tendon perfusion and to determine potential relationships between perfusion and patient 
reported outcomes and subscapularis failure.
Primary Research Question:
To what degree does the relative perfusion of the subscapularis tendon—measured using 
DCE-FI—change after tenotomy vs peel technique and subsequent intra-operative repair? 
Hypothesis: Perfusion of the subscapularis tendon will be reduced from baseline after 
tenotomy and peel techniques during shoulder arthroplasty.
Secondary Question:
Does DCE-FI with indocyanine green, used in a real time, intra-operative setting, 
highlight technique-dependent variations in subscapularis tendon perfusion during 
shoulder arthroplasty?
Aim: To determine if intra-operative ICG administration during shoulder arthroplasty can 
be coupled with an intra-operative surgical fluorescence detection device to determine 
alterations in subscapularis tendon perfusion before and after repair using peel and 
tenotomy takedown techniques for a deltopectoral approach.
3.0 Background*
Shoulder arthroplasty is a commonly utilized and routinely successful surgery 
performed for management of glenohumeral joint arthritis. Upwards of 90% of 
primary anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty surgeries are considered successful 
(Lapner et al., 2020). Albeit rare, complications do occur. Complications include 
glenoid or humeral component loosening, periprosthetic fracture, infection and 
rotator cuff failure. Of the four muscles that comprise the rotator cuff, the 
subscapularis is of particular concern in total shoulder arthroplasty surgery due to 
the approach used to access the glenohumeral joint. The deltopectoral approach is 
the standard approach used for shoulder arthroplasty and necessitates performing 
a subscapularis takedown in order to obtain adequate visualization of the 
glenohumeral joint. Three techniques to perform a subscapularis takedown are 
common, with an absence of consensus in the literature as to which technique is 
superior (Buckley et al., 2014). The techniques include a subscapularis peel, a 
subscapularis tenotomy and a lesser tuberosity osteotomy. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page 5 of 21Each subscapularis takedown technique requires repair at the conclusion of the 
procedure when performing shoulder arthroplasty. Repair is crucial for proper 
force coupling of the shoulder to keep the humeral head implant centered on the 
glenoid component (Shields et al., 2017). Takedown is still performed in a reverse 
total shoulder arthroplasty but repair is not required to maintain stability. Each 
takedown technique is reliant on either tendon to tendon, tendon to bone, or bone 
to bone interface for healing. Failure of the subscapularis tendon repair can result 
in pain, instability, decreased functional outcomes and ultimately the need for 
revision surgery (Choate et al., 2018). Subscapularis tendon failure can 
sometimes be asymptomatic, however it can also be symptomatic and present 
with the aforementioned signs. Subscapularis failure rates may approach 50% in 
long term studies although symptomatic cases likely occur in less than 1% of total 
shoulder arthroplasties (Entezari et al., 2020). Due to the devastating impact on 
patients with symptomatic subscapularis failure, there is interest in investigating 
which subscapularis takedown technique produces the best outcomes. Prior 
randomized controlled trials as well as systematic reviews have previously been 
conducted looking at these different takedown techniques, but demonstrated no 
statistically significant difference in primary endpoints of subscapularis strength 
at various time endpoint and no statistically significant difference in patient 
reported outcomes (Lapner et al., 2020). These prior studies did not evaluate 
subscapularis perfusion post repair, adequate perfusion is necessary for healing to 
occur with any subscapularis takedown technique.
The takedown method of the subscapularis has previously been shown to have no 
statistically significant differences with regards to strength, or patient reported 
outcomes, however if there was a difference noted in tendon perfusion post repair 
this may provide rationale to choose one technique over another as improved 
perfusion may correlate to lower risk of repair failure. As this study aims to 
monitor subscapularis perfusion pre and post repair, the two techniques that the 
involve the tendon itself for healing will be utilized, peel and tenotomy.
The indocyanine green based DCE-FI will NOT be used to guide treatment or 
patient care. The data acquired using the SPY Elite or SPY PHI or EleVision will 
be anonymized and exported to a secure PC for additional analysis and 
processing. The analysis techniques will be more sophisticated than the current 
commercial system, and involve a correction for the patient-specific arterial input 
function (AIF) (Elliott et al., 2020)—the cardiac and circulatory variations that 
can modify the time and manner in which the ICG dye arrives in the imaging 
field-of-view.
Indocyanine green (ICG) is a well-studied water soluble, light absorbing tracer 
that has been used in other capacities to help quantify tissue perfusion during 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page [ADDRESS_1261945] several minutes (Faybik and Hetz, 2006). The concentration of 
ICG in specific tissue is able to be quantified as a surrogate for tissue perfusion. 
ICG due to its IV administration and quick metabolism is able to help quantify 
perfusion in real time, such as intra-operatively (Lutken et al., 2021). Systemic 
reviews as well as case studies, most commonly in plastic surgery, have been 
performed showing its utility to determine adequate or inadequate perfusion in 
downstream tissue in situations where microanastomoses are performed, such as 
with flaps (Krishnan et al., 2005) and in hand surgery (Li et al., 2018). Other 
studies have also been conducted showing the ability to use ICG as a surrogate for 
tissue perfusion in the achilles paratenon in humans and in rabbits who had 
undergone rotator cuff repair to determine tissue perfusion after different types of 
repair. The use of ICG imaging in orthopaedic surgery is relatively nascent, and 
our institution (Gitajn et al., 2020) as well as other collaborators (Sepehri et al., 
2021) have demonstrated its promise in these applications.
4.0 Study Endpoints*
Primary end point:
To assess the technology and its ability to see blood supply in the subscapularis 
tendon before takedown and after employed repair. The benchmark for this is the 
rise and fall of fluorescence signal approximately 10-40 seconds after injection. 
Given our experience in DCE-FI for bone fractures, it will be more or less self-
evident whether the DCE-FA signal is sufficient for further analysis.
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent
5.1 Description:
This study is neither a drug nor a device trial. Patients will be administered FDA 
approved ICG through intravenous injection and imaged by a FDA approved 
surgical fluorescence imaging device (Spy Elite or SPY PHI or Medtronic 
EleVision) which is 0.[ADDRESS_1261946] been used for routine clinical practice for many 
years. ICG fluorescence imaging utilizes intravenously injected ICG, which is a 
fluorescent dye that is FDA-approved for clinical use, illuminated with near-
infrared light. The ICG dye is indirectly activated and the dynamic fluorescence 
due to tendon perfusion can be captured by a video rate imaging system. The 
subscapularis takedown technique will alternate between tenotomy and peel for 
every other patient taken to the operating room. There is no reason 
intraoperatively to choose one technique over the other and therefore this puts 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page 7 of 21the patient at no added risk. If the surgeon feels that neither of these techniques 
are appropriate for the treatment of the patient then the patient will not be 
approached for enrollment. 
5.2 Drug/Device Handling
Indocyanine green (ICG) used in this study will be ordered from the investigational 
pharmacy and supplied through the usual pharmacy dispensing mechanisms.
ICG is FDA approved for routine clinical practice in is currently available through the 
investigational pharmacy at DHMC. The results of this study are not intended to 
produce a new indication for the drug and will not be reported to the FDA. Nor will the 
results of this study significantly change the way that the drug is marketed in the United 
States. The medication will be utilized for an indication, and in a clinical setting, where 
it is currently utilized as part of usual care at this institution. ICG is lawfully marketed 
in the [LOCATION_002]. The research will be conducted in compliance with the marketing 
limitations described in the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.7).ICG is 
FDA approved for routine clinical practice. No return or destruction of study drug is 
needed for this study.
The pulse dye densitometer (PDD) device used in this study is developed and tested by 
[CONTACT_900022]. It is a modified pulse oximeter 
which is considered under the abbreviated IDE mechanism (see Section 6.2 for more 
information).
5.3 Dose Rationale
We plan a sample size of 10 patients in this open label prospective observational study of 
ICG fluorescence imaging for assessment of subscapularis tendon blood flow. 
After the subscapularis tendon is visualized during the surgical approach, 0.1 mg/kg ICG 
will be injected intravenously. Video rate ICG fluorescence images will be acquired 20 
seconds before and 4 minutes after ICG injection. This process will be repeated towards 
the end of the procedure after the subscapularis is repaired, but prior to skin closure.   
This dose has been used to effectively assess bone perfusion in a previous study at our 
institution which was an IRB-approved pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  A total does of 0.2 mg/kg is within 
the range of previous studies. Indeed, this is 10 times less than the maximum 
recommended dose by [CONTACT_667692] 2 mg/kg. 
6.0 Procedures Involved*
The research design for this study is a single cohort longitudinal study employing a 
consecutive sampling methodology. Eligible patients regardless of ethnicity or health 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page [ADDRESS_1261947] to inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in 
section 10.  Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be asked to participate in the trial.  
If they agree written informed consent will be obtained from the patient or their legal 
authorized representative. To obtain informed consent, study personnel (surgeon or 
research coordinator) will adhere to the following procedures: (1) present study 
information in a manner that is understandable to the patient; (2) discuss the study with 
the patient and answer any questions; (3) allow the patient an opportunity to discuss 
participation with their family; (4) confirm that the patient understands the risks and 
benefits of participating in the study and that their participation is voluntary; (5) complete 
the consent process and obtain signatures from the patient and research team.  The 
process of obtaining and documenting informed consent forms will be completed in 
accordance with local Good Clinical Practice (GCP) recommendations.
If the research team member obtaining consent is at all unsure about the patient's ability 
to consent, s/he will consult with the study PI.
Patients will be randomized to undergo either a subscapularis peel or subscapularis 
tenotomy. 
Recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, the study team will encourage the 
participants to ask additional questions that may arise during the course of their 
participation in the study.
On the surgery day, the patient will be prepared and transported to surgery as per routine 
at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. In the OR, patient positioning, preparation of the surgical field, 
and drapi[INVESTIGATOR_900020].

which is used clinically both in the operating room, in inpatients as well as outpatients to 
assess oxygen saturation.  This is completely non-invasive.  In the context of this study 
the pulse dye densometer collects data on the ICG injection parameters so that the kinetic 
curves can be normalized to injection-related differences. The PDD will be placed on the 
patient’s finger to acquire an arterial blood input function during ICG injection.  
After the subscapularis tendon is visualized during the surgical approach, 0.1 mg/kg ICG 
will be injected intravenously.  Video rate ICG fluorescence images will be acquired [ADDRESS_1261948]-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) where they are monitored

V. 29Dec2021 Page 9 of 21continuously by [CONTACT_900023].  During this entire time vital 
signs (including temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_49842]) are collected as 
standard of care.  All clinical data will be reviewed for adverse events for a period of [ADDRESS_1261949] operatively.
6.2 Pulse Dye Densitometry Device
A Pulse dye densometer (Pulsion Medical Systems), similar to a pulse oximetry probe, 
which is used clinically both in the operating room, in inpatients as well as outpatients to 
assess oxygen saturation. This is completely non-invasive. In the context of this study the 
pulse dye densometer collects data on the ICG injection parameters so that the kinetic 
curves can be normalized to injection-related differences. We have a manuscript that was 
submitted for publication recently demonstrating the importance of collecting this data.
Data obtained as part of this study will not be submitted to or held for inspection by [CONTACT_1556]. The device is a custom device and is not being used to determine safety or 
effectiveness for commercial distribution.
Exemption Status: The device used is being evaluated on an observational basis. 
However, it is not exempt due to the fact it introduces energy into the subject. We request 
an abbreviated IDE under 21 CFR 812, given it is a non-significant risk device.
Description: The device comprises of a single [LOCATION_007] Instruments AFE4490SPO2EVM 
connected to (1) a Microsoft surface (Windows OS) and a (2) Nihon-KodhenTL-301P 
finger probe. The TI AFE4490SPO2EVM is an evaluation board with analog front-end 
that allows control and digitization of detected signal from a pulse oximeter. These 
devices come with a standard 660nm/900nm pulse oximeter finger probe, however, the 
Nihon-Kodhen probe (805nm/900nm) is used instead. A custom interface is built to

PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page [ADDRESS_1261954] identifiers from improper use 
and disclosure as information will only be used by [CONTACT_392072] a  
patient may be eligible. Information will only be communicated and stored using D-HH approved 
secure platforms. Information is only being used to determine if a patient is eligible  for the study, 
for recruitment purposes. Once approached, if a patient is not interested, information will be 
destroyed. Protected health information will not be re-used or disclosed for another purpose. It 
will only be used for recruitment. This research could not practically be  done without a partial 
waiver of HIPAA. This information is needed for recruitment. Patients will sign a full HIPAA 
Authorization when consenting to the study.
Upon identification, study personnel will screen the patient for eligibility and if eligible, 
the study will be introduced to the patient by a member of their care team. If the patient 
agrees, a member of the study team will approach them for informed consent. Screening 
will occur from the daily orthopaedic patient clinic schedule for the principle 
investigator. Study participants will be enrolled in the clinic setting prior to their surgical 
procedure. 
To obtain informed consent, study personnel will adhere to the following procedures: (1) 
present study information in a manner that is understandable to the patient; (2) discuss the 
study with the patient and answer any questions; (3) allow the patient an opportunity to 
discuss participation with their family; (4) confirm that the patient understands the risks 
and benefits of participating in the study and that their participation is voluntary; and (5)

The process of obtaining and documenting informed consent will be completed in 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice. 
Potential recruits are instructed that their participation is completely voluntary and that 
their medical care will not be altered in any way should they elect not to participate at 
any time prior to surgery. 
No advertisements or other promotional material will be used. No finder fees or 
recruitment incentives will be offered. 
There will be no honorarium or payment in association with this study.
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*
Participants will be removed from the protocol if:
1) Concern for subscapularis tendon tear or insufficiency occurs.
2) The subject withdraws consent.

imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page 13 of 213) The subject has an occurrence of a significant clinical event that precludes 
proceeding with surgery.
4) Imaging cannot be completed for any reason
If a participant is withdrawn from the protocol, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262995] 
"withdrawn" and will add a detailed explanation about the cause of withdrawal in the 
database. 
For subjects who withdraw after the intraoperative imaging, but prior to their first post 
operative appointment, we will follow-up to see if they still complete their clinical follow 
up at the 1-month interval, and provide them an opportunity to report any adverse events. 
We will acquire their follow up results to include these subjects in the statistical analysis 
portion that only involves the intraoperative image data and infection status.
15.0 Risks to Subjects*
The risks to subjects are minimal in relation to anticipated benefits and/or knowledge that 
might reasonably be expected from the results of this clinical trial.
Risk of ICG injection:  ICG (Indocyanine Green) will be administered intravenously 
twice: once before and once after the repair. ICG is FDA approved for human use in 
angiography for ophthalmology and cardiology applications and is given routinely to 
patients in these clinical settings. The risks are considered minimal and consist of nausea, 
vomiting, hives, increased heart rate in subjects with particular sensitivity to the dye. ICG 
does contain sodium iodide and patients with a history of allergy to iodides will be 
excluded. Anaphylactic or urticarial reactions are rare but have been reported in patients 
both with and without a history of allergy to iodides. Anaphylactic deaths have been 
reported following IGG administration during cardiac catheterization. Reported rates of 
mild, moderate and severe adverse reactions to ICG are 0.15%, 0.2% and 0.05%.  Every 
effort will be made to minimize this risk as much as possible.  It is the standard of care at 
this institution to obtain information related to allergies, sensitivities and past medical 
histories upon patient arrival.  Patients will also be monitored throughout their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as is the standard of care, by [CONTACT_392074].  Additionally, at all 
times ICG fluorescence imaging assessments are taking place, both surgical and 
anesthesia staff will monitor patients closely for any adverse reaction to ICG. Surgical 
and anesthesia staff will also monitor patients for at least [ADDRESS_1261955] of care 
treatments will be provided including but not limited to treatment with appropriate agents 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page [ADDRESS_1261956] is administered to women of child-bearing age.
Prolonged operating room time: Because the ICG fluorescence assessments will take 
place in the operating room, participation in this study may increase the amount of time 
spent under surgical anesthesia in the operating room.  For the average case, an additional 
[ADDRESS_1261957] while other required operative 
procedures are being performed.
Risk of confidentiality breach:  As with any protected health information, loss of 
privacy may lead to problems with insurability or social stigmatization.  The risk to 
subjects is low and members of the research team will make every effort to ensure that 
information is kept private and protected to the fullest extent possible. Any and all 
information will be stored and managed in a secure manner, following all applicable 
federal regulations and guidelines and according to institutional policies and practices.  
Any electronic information collected will be stored on password protected, HIPAA 
compliant computers maintained in private, locked offices within secure areas of 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center with limited access.  Any non-electronic records 
collected will be stored likewise, as well.  Any discussions between patients and the 
research staff will be conducted in a private location.
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). Risk of breach of confidentiality of the medical records and status of 
participants will be minimized. Databases which are used to store subject-sensitive 
information are password-protected and encrypted during file/data transfers from viewing 
terminals. Access will be limited to research team members who have undergone CPHS 
training at Dartmouth. Whenever possible and practical standard-of-care clinical data 
used in the research will be de-identified when under analysis.
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects*
Patients enrolling in this study will not benefit directly because no diagnostic or 
therapeutic decisions will occur based on the study, and thus, administration of the study 
is not intended to alter the surgical procedure. However, future patients may benefit from 
the knowledge gained from the study since this study may provide an objective, 
intraoperative, and real-time methodology to assess subscapularis tendon perfusion and 
potential for correlation to outcomes.
17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality
Data Confidentiality:
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page [ADDRESS_1261958] the confidentiality of the subjects through the following 
actions: 
Patients will be assigned a unique study identifier (study ID) based on the order in which 
they are recruited and a list of study IDs and the patients they correspond to (PHI) will be 
kept on a Dartmouth-Hitchcock secure server accessed by a DH laptop (the “H:/” drive). 
This is the only ‘key’ to matching patients and their corresponding study ID, and is only 
used to retrieve patient outcomes for the data analysis, and in the unlikely event that there 
is a reported adverse effect, to investigate the event.
A secured DH laptop will also store, in a separate document, a table containing the study 
date and anonymous study ID will be listed, along with any outcome information as it 
becomes available. This file will be kept separate from the file containing the study ID 
keys, to minimize the chance it will be inadvertently shared with unauthorized 
individuals.
The file containing the study IDs and which patients they correspond to (ID Key), will be 
destroyed once all outcomes have been recorded and/or the follow-up period has passed, 
unless required by [CONTACT_900025]. In that case, the ID Key will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with 
federal regulations.
Protected health information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity,

18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*
Since the PDD device does not meet the exempt criteria for an IDE, we request an 
abbreviated IDE determination from the IRB.  Kevin McGuire, MD will serve as 
an independent research monitor for this study. He has expertise consonant with 
the nature of the risks identified within the research protocol and meets all of the 
following criteria:
a) Is independent of the team conducting the research involving human 
subjects.
b) Can stop the research, remove individual subjects, and take steps to 
protect subjects until the IRB assesses the monitor’s report.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page 16 of 21c) Will promptly report observations and findings to the IRB or other 
designated official.
d) Has an IRB approved written summary of duties, authorities, and 
responsibilities based on specific risks or concerns about the research.
e) Has confirmed in writing his/her duties, authorities, and responsibilities
With regards to patient safety, ICG will be administered by [CONTACT_900026].  Post-
operatively, they are transferred to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) where they are 
monitored continuously by [CONTACT_900023].  During this 
entire time vital signs (including temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_49842]) 
are collected as standard of care.  All clinical data will be reviewed for adverse events for 
a period of [ADDRESS_1261959]-
infusion

Blood Pressure X X
Temperature X X
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581] X X
Adverse Events X
With regards to data monitoring, the program manager at D-H will be responsible for 
ensuring that all patient data is complete.  This will be monitored on a week-by-week 
basis and appropriate clinicians and/or research coordinators will be queried to complete 
incomplete patient data.
19.[ADDRESS_1261960] the Privacy Interests of Subjects
All identifying data will be kept in a restricted file on a secure DHMC server that can 
only be accessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_683956]. Participant data will also be entered 
in the "OnCore” database, which is a secure, password protected data collection system. 
Individual participants are assigned a random ID number within the OnCore database. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_900018]-enhanced fluorescence 
imaging to guide total shoulder arthroplasty approach
V. 29Dec2021 Page 17 of 21This database has restricted access, and the ability to view participant data is limited to 
specific members of the research team (e.g. PI [INVESTIGATOR_683956]). 
No information will be disclosed to others without written permission from the patient, 
except:     
• If necessary to protect the rights or welfare of the participant (for example, if the 
participant is injured and in need of emergency care); or    
 • If required by [CONTACT_2371].
Any discussion between the patient and the research staff will be conducted in a private 
location. 
When the results of the research are published or discussed at conferences, no 
information will be included that would reveal participant identity. Authorized 
representatives of the D-HH IRB, Dartmouth College, and DHMC may need to review 
records of individual participants to ensure the accuracy of findings and to monitor the 
safety and welfare of study participants. The research imaging will not go into the 
patient’s medical record and will not be used for any clinical decision-making.
20.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury
This is an imaging study with minimal risk. We do not anticipate any injury or sickness 
happen due to the study. If in any case subjects are injured or become ill as a result of 
research procedures, the subjects will be provided with medical treatment, but the 
following organizations do not plan to pay for this treatment.

  1  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214371]-Related Eating Disorder (SRED)  Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_3673] W. Winkelman, MD PhD Detailed Protocol Version Date: 6/8/2016  Background and Significance  Sleep-Related Eating Disorder (SRED) is a parasomnia characterized by [CONTACT_214429], compulsive consumption of food, poor sleep quality, and morning anorexia. SRED is generally more prevalent in females, with onset in early adulthood. SRED is thought to be closely related to Night Eating Syndrome (NES), another night-time eating disorder. It is thought that SRED and NES are related processes in which night-time eating occurs along a variable spectrum of arousal; individuals with NES are fully conscious during their night-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], whereas individuals with SRED are only partially conscious during their night-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]1.  This nosology is reflected in the most recent diagnostic criteria for SRED in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Second Edition (ICSD-2) in which the level of consciousness is not a diagnostic criteria, stressing rather, that the sleep-related eating behavior is involuntary in nature.     Night Eating Syndrome was first reported in [ZIP_CODE], however the syndrome was not further investigated and defined until almost [ADDRESS_257669] diagnostic criteria. Its prevalence in the general population is uncommon, estimated at 1.5%, but more common in the severely obese population, with estimates ranging from 9 to 43%3. Onset of the syndrome has been linked to stressful life experiences. Individuals with NES experience morning anorexia, consume over half of their daily caloric intake after [ADDRESS_257670] full awareness of their night-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; however, the binge eating is compulsive and difficult to suppress5.   Sleep-Related Eating Disorder has only been reported in the last decade. It has been estimated that approximately 1% of young adults have exhibited this behavior, which usually occurs nightly, sometimes several times a night. Patients with SRED may have variable level of awareness during an epi[INVESTIGATOR_214372], often describing their eating occurring while they are “half awake” or “half asleep”. Amnesia may be present the morning after an epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and thus the occurrence of such an epi[INVESTIGATOR_214373]. Individuals tend to eat high calorie foods, and some consume inappropriate foods (e.g. frozen foods, non-nutritive substances) during epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Weight gain is often associated with this behavior. Sleep disorders such as Restless Legs Syndrome and somnambulism are common among these patients.  Current treatments for SRED have been directed towards treating any underlying sleep disorder, eating or psychiatric disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), dopaminergic agonists, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], anorectics, hypnotics and opi[INVESTIGATOR_214374], but success in treatment has varied.      
  2  Preliminary Reports with Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214375] a beneficial in the treatment of these syndromes. In an open-label study of four subjects (two with NES, two with SRED), one subject had complete elimination of night eating (NES subject), two had a 75-<100% reduction in night eating, and one had a 50-<75% reduction in night eating5. The dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214376] [ADDRESS_257671] been two larger case series published examining the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214377]8,9. In the case series of 17 patients conducted by [CONTACT_214430], topi[INVESTIGATOR_214378]/substantially controlled in all 11 subjects who were able to continue with topi[INVESTIGATOR_214379] [6 subjects discontinued the medication; 4 due to lack of efficacy and 2 due to side effects (purtiris, weight gain)]8. In the retrospective case series conducted by [CONTACT_214431], over two-thirds (17/35) patients treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_214380]9. These reports suggest that further investigation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214381] a potential treatment for SRED is warranted.   Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214382] a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide derived from fructose. It is structurally distinct from any other anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_7377]10. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_24157] a structurally novel compound that is an effective anticonvulsant with a good safety profile after oral administration in animals and humans. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214383], Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It has also been approved as monotherapy in some countries. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214384] a number of other disorders including migraine, bipolar disorder, and essential tremor. For a complete profile, see the package insert11.  Nonclinical Studies  Pharmacologic Profile11 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214385]-convulsant properties, as well as its potential therapeutic effect in other Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. First, the drug inhibits voltage gated sodium channels and thus suppresses action potentials associated with sustained repetitive cell firing. Second, topi[INVESTIGATOR_214386] g-aminobutyrate (GABA). This is not blocked by [CONTACT_214432][INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Third, topi[INVESTIGATOR_214387] (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]) AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor. It has no effect on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype. Fourth, topi[INVESTIGATOR_214388]-activated (L-type) calcium channels. It is also a weak inhibitor of some isoenzymes of carbonic anhydrase.  Toxicology The data for preclinical toxicology studies were obtained for dosage levels up to the maximum tolerated doses. Female rats and male and female dogs have received higher systemic exposure to topi[INVESTIGATOR_214389]. It is notable that the female rat appears to provide the best animal model for human metabolism of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].  
  3  In general, acute and long-term oral exposure of mice, rats, dogs, and rabbits to topi[INVESTIGATOR_214390]. Hyperplasia of the gastric and urothelial cells seen in shorter term studies did not progress to neoplasia after lifetime exposure in rats or mice and has not been reported during clinical studies. Smooth muscle tumors of the urinary bladder in mice appear to be unique to the species. There is no known clinical counterpart; therefore, these tumors were not considered to be of relevance to man. As with many other anticonvulsants, topi[INVESTIGATOR_214391], rats and rabbits. The teratologic effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214392]. Reductions in weight of progeny were also indicated by [CONTACT_214433], but no effects on fertility were observed for male or female rats. Based on results of in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity assays, topi[INVESTIGATOR_214393]. For further background on the toxicology of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], see the Investigator’s Brochure.10  Pharmacokinetic Profile Studies in humans show that topi[INVESTIGATOR_214394], with peak concentrations occurring at approximately 2 hours following an oral dose.

The major route of elimination is via the kidneys.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214398] (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Six metabolites have been identified, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. Overall, plasma clearance is approximately 20 to 30 mL/min in humans following oral administration.

Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug or device trial within the [ADDRESS_257675] of 25 mg or 100 mg of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214407], or matching placebo, prepared in identically appearing capsules by [CONTACT_214438]. The medication will be titrated over a 9-week period according to the following suggested schedule:  Titration Schedule * Double-Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] / Placebo Dosing Days Study Medication Total Daily Dose 25 mg Tablets 100 mg Tablets Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214408] 1-7 1 capsule   25 mg Matching capsules 8-14 2 capsules  50 mg 15-21 3 capsules   75 mg 22-28 4 capsules  100 mg 29-35 5 capsules  125 mg 36-42 6 capsules  150mg 43-49  2 capsules 200mg 50-56 2 capsules 2 capsules 250 mg 57+  3 capsules 300 mg  Subjects will be instructed to take the study medication one hour prior to bedtime (h.s.). Subjects will be informed during the consent process that they may be asked to take up to six pi[INVESTIGATOR_214409].  The study medication will be titrated to 300 mg/day or the subject’s minimum effective dose (MED).   At the investigator’s discretion the titration rate may be adjusted. However, after the second week of titration, subjects must take at least 25 mg/day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214410]-blind phase. During the maintenance period, subjects should remain at the dose attained at the end of the titration period, however dose adjustments will be permitted at the discretion of the investigators.   Subjects will taper their study medication by [CONTACT_214439] 30% every three days over approximately a 14-day period until they are no longer taking study medication.  *Subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance <70 but >[ADDRESS_257676] 6 weeks of the titration period the investigator will dispense bottles with sufficient 25mg capsules for 7+[ADDRESS_257677] reaches a dose of 150 mg the medications will be packaged in bottles as prescribed by [CONTACT_214440]. All study medication will be dispensed in child-resistant packaging. Bottles will be labeled with the patient name [CONTACT_214457]. Bottles will be clearly labeled as containing either 25 mg or 100 mg matching placebo or topi[INVESTIGATOR_214407]. 
  8  Subjects will be dispensed the appropriate number of tablets needed until they return for their next office visit. Study medication should be stored at room temperature 15-30°C (59-86°F), be protected from moisture, and be maintained in a secure area.  Study Medication Accountability and Compliance Starting at Visit 2 (Day 1), study medication will be dispensed to each subject with instructions to return all unused medication and packaging (including empty bottles) at the next study visit in order to assess compliance. Returned study medication bottles may be redispensed to the same subject if appropriate. Additional bottles will be dispensed to each subject as needed.  All study medication dispensed by [CONTACT_214441]. Information about subject dosing and compliance will be recorded in the subject’s study records.   Subjects who are noncompliant with medications (according to pi[INVESTIGATOR_214411]) may  be removed from the study at the discretion of the investigators.   The investigator agrees not to allow access to the study medication to any person except those named as sub-investigator(s) or clinical care staff, and dispense only to qualified subjects participating in the study.   Randomization  Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.  At the time of Screening (Visit 1A), subjects will be assigned a three-digit subject number, in ascending sequential order beginning with 001. The subject number will be retained by [CONTACT_214442]. The MGH IDS Pharmacy will provide and maintain randomization and blinding. Subjects will be randomized to receive either topi[INVESTIGATOR_214412] a 1:[ADDRESS_257678] completed and the database has been finalized.  To maintain the blind, sealed envelopes containing the study drug identification (e.g., active or placebo) will be provided to the investigator. These sealed envelopes will be kept together, in a limited access area that is accessible [ADDRESS_257679].   Medication Side Effects The package insert for Topamax includes warnings and precautions related to the following side effects or adverse events: acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma, oligohidrosis, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration, speech or language problems (word-finding difficulties in particular), somnolence, fatigue, kidney stones, paresthesia, dizziness, ataxia, difficulty with memory, and diplopia. Dose-related adverse events at doses greater than 200mg per day also include nervousness, confusion, depression, anxiety, anorexia, and weight loss.   STUDY EVALUATIONS  General Considerations Starting at Visit 1, subjects will be required to keep a daily sleep and eating diary for the duration of the study. The following information will be collected: bedtime, time to fall asleep, whether the subject awoke during the night to eat, number of times the subject awoke to eat, duration and level of consciousness of each awakening, whether the subject remembers all of his/her night eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], final wake time and time spent asleep. The diary will also capture the number of tablets of study medication taken. In addition, the diary includes an optional section for a bed partner or family member to provide information about witnessed night eating events.  Assessment scales included in this protocol will be administered/completed as outlined in the visit schedule. Evaluations for each phase of the study will be performed as described below.  Once a subject is randomized and is taking the study drug capsules, all visits must occur within a window of +/- [ADDRESS_257680] up to 42 days based on washout requirements, not including a 14-day prospective baseline period. At Visit 1A (up to Day -42), the study will be explained and subjects will provide informed consent to participate in the study.

  [ADDRESS_257684]-Taper Visit 9 (Day 105) in approximately 2 weeks  Taper Period  After completion of the titration and maintenance periods (13 weeks), subjects will taper their study medication by [CONTACT_214446] 30% every three days. Subjects will return for Visit 9 (Day 105) and the following procedures will be performed:  Visit 9 (Day 105) 1. Assess concomitant medications 2. Obtain weight 3. Record adverse events 4. Collect study medication and perform drug accountability  Early Withdrawal Subject participation may be terminated based upon subject choice, protocol violation (e.g., non-compliance), adverse event, or if a subject is lost to follow-up. The primary reason for withdrawal should be clearly indicated in the subject’s study file.  In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely, final visit procedures will be performed at the time of discontinuation, if possible. Subjects who discontinue prematurely should be scheduled promptly for final visit (Visit 8, Day 91) procedures, preferably within [ADDRESS_257685] concurrent illnesses that require prescription or over-the-counter medication during the course of the study. All exclusionary medications taken within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to Visit 1 (Day-14), with the exception of flurazepam and protriptyline which should be recorded within 5 weeks (35 days) and 6 weeks (42 days), respectively, of Visit 1, as well as those continued at the start of the study or started during the study (other than study medication), including the drug name, dose, duration and indication for use, should be recorded in the subjects’ study files.  If the patient is taking a prohibited medication, the investigator and patient will discuss the risk and benefits of a trial of tapering and discontinuation of the medication.  Any potential medication discontinuation will also be discussed with the prescribing physician.    Modifications to a subject’s pre-existing treatment and regimen are not to be made for the explicit purpose of entering this trial, but should be done only where deemed clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_093].

ADVERSE EVENTS This study follows Partners Health Care guidelines regarding the definitions and reporting policies of adverse events. Definition: An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research 
  16  (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice).  This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including laboratory test abnormalities. Any such event is considered an adverse event if it meets any of the following conditions: • results in discontinuation from the study; • requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention; • requires further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to confirm the abnormality); or • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by [CONTACT_8127] a significant clinical impact.  Adverse events may or not be related to the study medication or research procedures. Those that are considered related meet the criteria listed below and those that are unrelated are all others that do not. Adverse events may be serious or non-serious. Serious adverse events include those that meet the criteria listed below, and non-serious adverse events include all others. Adverse events may also be unexpected or expected. Unexpected adverse events meet the criteria listed below and expected adverse events are all others that do not.  Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that meets the above definition and any of the following conditions: • results in death;  • is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  • results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  • results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  • any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse). Note: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations; for example, important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above.  Unexpected (Unlisted) Adverse Event • Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: • the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, 
  17  and the current IRB-approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  • the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event. Associated with the Use of the Drug An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable or very likely by [CONTACT_8128]:  Attribution Definitions  • Not related An adverse event which is not related to the use of the drug.  • Doubtful An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely.  • Possible There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event, incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459] (modified from the definition of associated with use of the drug in FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.32(a)). A reasonable possibility is defined as more likely than not related to the research procedures or, in other words, there is a > 50% likelihood of the event having been caused by [CONTACT_3459].  • Probable An adverse event which might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (e.g., confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  • Very likely An adverse event which is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed by [CONTACT_35719]).   All Adverse Events All adverse events that occur between the first study-related procedure and within [ADDRESS_257686] dose of study medication will be reported. Adverse events will be reported to the PHRC according to their guidelines.  Subjects should report any adverse events voluntarily or in response to general, non-directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?). For each adverse event reported by [CONTACT_423], the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete documentation in the subject’s research file.  All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, must be recorded using medical terminology in the subject’s study documents. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, 
  18  runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). The investigator must document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_204219]. All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document.  Pregnancies Pregnancies occurring during the study will be reported by [CONTACT_214447]. Any subject who becomes pregnant during participation in this study will be promptly withdrawn from the study. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be  required.  Compensation Subjects will be compensated $30.00 for each study visit, for a total of up to $300.00 for those who complete the entire study. Subjects will not be compensated for phone calls.   STATISTICAL METHODS  Sample Size Determination The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_214415].  Efficacy Analyses The efficacy analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects who were dispensed study medication and for whom one post-baseline efficacy measurement is available. Efficacy analyses will be conducted separately for subjects with night eating syndrome or sleep-related eating disorder, and across all subjects with either of these two diagnoses. The primary efficacy parameter will be the change in the number of nights per week of the specified nocturnal eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The primary efficacy parameter of number of nights per week with nocturnal epi[INVESTIGATOR_214416] a co-variate. Diagnostic procedures will be conducted to determine whether the statistical assumptions are met.  The MOS, SDS, TFEQ, HAM-D, HbA1C, body weight and Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_214417] a covariate.   Information obtained from the sleep diaries will be summarized.  Safety Analyses  Adverse Events The percent of subjects with specific treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Additional tabulations will be conducted to summarize those subjects who have discontinued treatment due to an adverse event or who experienced a severe or a serious adverse event.  Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_214448].

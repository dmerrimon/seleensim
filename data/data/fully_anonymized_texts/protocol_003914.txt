Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, [LOCATION_011], MA  
Study Period  Planned enrollment duration – 36 to 4 0 months  
Planned duration of study for each participant – 180 ± 7 days  
Planned duration of the study – 36-48 months  
Study Population  Patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)  
Study Design  A prospective, multi -center, double -blind, randomized, place bo-controlled, phase -II clin i-
cal trial . Subjects will be randomized to either deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) at 32 
mg/kg/day (up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), or saline placebo, given by [CONTACT_632853] 3 consecutive days. Treatment will be initiat ed within 24 hours after ICH sym p-
tom onset. Randomization will control baseline imbalances associated with baseline ICH 
score, ICH onset -to-treatment time (OTT), ICH volume, baseline NIHSS score, and warf a-
rin use. All subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_845021] of care therapy 
while participating in the study. Throughout the study, we will continue to assess the saf e-
ty of DFO. At the conclusion of the study, the proportion of DFO -treated subjects with a 
good clinical outcome at 3 months  (defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 -2) 
will be compared to  the placebo proportion in a futility analysis to determine if it is futile 
to move DFO forward to Phase III efficacy evaluation . 
Primary Objectives  1-TO assess whether it is futile to move DFO into Phase III evaluation as a therapeutic i n-
tervention for ICH, by [CONTACT_632854] -treated subjects to placebo -treated
subjects with respect to good outcome (defined as mRS of 0 -2 at 90 days), in a fut ility
analysis. The futility hypothesis specifies that if the difference in good outcome propo r-
tions is less than 12% in favor of DFO, then it would be futile to move DFO forward to
Phase III evaluation.
2-TO assess the safety of DFO infusions (at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum da i-
ly dose of 6000 mg/day), given for [ADDRESS_845022] more data on treatment -related adverse events in order to a s-
certain that patients with ICH can com plete this dose given over 3 -day duration of infusion
without experiencing unreasonable neurological complications, mortality, or other serious
adverse events related to DFO use, in particular adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]
(ARDS).
Secondary Objectiv es 1-TO explore the differences between early (≤12h) and late (>12 -24h) time windows in
DFO treatment effect on functional outcome .
2-TO determine the overall ordinal distribution of scores on mRS at 3 months in DFO - and
placebo -treated subjects; and to perform a dichotomized analysis considering the propo r-
tion of DFO - and placebo -treated subjects with mRS 0 -3
3-TO perform dichotomized analyses considering the proportion of DFO - and placebo -
treated subjects with mRS 0 -2 and 0 -3; and to determine the over all ordinal distribution of
scores on mRS at 6 months.
4-TO determine mortality during the 90 - and 180 -day follow -up periods (all causes and
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
8 ICH -related) . 
5-TO obtain data on the changes in NIHSS between presentation and day -90, and Mo n-
treal Cognitive As sessment (MoCA) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) -16 scores at 3 months
to explore the effects of DFO on neurological, functional, and cognitive functions.
Exploratory Objectives  1-TO explore the effects of treatment with DFO on relative perihematoma edema (PHE)
volume progression between baseline and post -treatment CT scans in DFO -treated p a-
tients compared to placebo as potential markers of DFO’s biological activity on brain ti s-
sue.
2-TO explore whether the effect of DFO on outcome is dependent on initial ICH volume,
after adjusting for other confounding variables that can affect outcome, to determine if
specific limits for ICH volume should be specified as exclusion/inclusion criter ia for future
studies.
3-TO explore the effects of DFO on the size of ventricular enlargement in patients with
intraventricular extension of ICH, not requiring an external ventricular drain, as a potential
marker of treatment utility in intraventricular h emorrhage.
4-TO explore the effect of DFO on the incidence of symptomatic cerebral edema (une x-
plained increase in NIHSS >4 points or decrease in GCS >2 points) during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
up to day 7 or discharge, whichever is earlier.
5-TO explore whether p rogression of PHE can be a radiological/biological marker of activ i-
ty that can be correlated with clinical outcomes and treatment effect of DFO.

1.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
 TO assess whether it is futile to move deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) into Phase III evaluation as a therapeutic inte r-
vention for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), by [CONTACT_632854]-treated subjects to
placebo-treated subjects with respect to good outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-2 at 90
days), in a futility analysis. The futility hypothesis specifies that if the difference in good outcome proportions is less

TO assess the safety of DFO infusions (32 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), given for [ADDRESS_845025] more data on treatment-related a d-
verse events in order to ascertain that patients with ICH can complete this dose given over 3-day duration of inf u-
sion without experiencing unreasonable neurological complications, increased mortality, or other serious adverse
events related to DFO use, in particular adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) .
1.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
As secondary analyses of the primary outcome, we also plan to:   
 Explore the differences between early (≤12h) and late (>12 -24h) time windows in DFO treatment effect on fun c-
tional outcome.
 Determine the overall ordinal distribution of scores on mRS at [ADDRESS_845026] <13% in favor of
DFO.
In addition, we will: 
 Perform dichotomized analyses considering the proportion of DFO- and placebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-2 and
0-3; and determine the overall ordinal distribution of scores on mRS at 6 months.
 Determine mortality during the 90- and 180-day follow-up periods (all causes and ICH-related).
 Obtain data on the changes in NIHSS between presentation and day-90, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)-16 scores at 3 months to explore the effects of DFO on neurological, fun c-
tional, and cognitive functions.
1.3 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES 
Additional planned exploratory analyses include assessments of:   
 The effects of treatment with DFO on relative perihematoma edema (PHE) volume progression between baseline
and post-treatment CT scans in DFO- treated patients compared to placebo as potential markers of DFO’s biolog i-
cal activity on brain tissue.
 Whether the effect of DFO on outcome is dependent on initial ICH volume, after adjusting for other confounding
variables that can affect outcome, to determine if specific limits for ICH volume should be specified as excl u-
sion/inclusion criteria for future studies.

11  The effects of DFO on the size of ventricular enlargement in patients with intraventricular extension of ICH, not r e-
quiring an external ventricular drain (EVD), as a potential marker of treatment utility in intraventricular hemorrhage
(IVH).
 The effect of DFO on the incidence of symptomatic cerebral edema (unexplained increase in NIHSS >4 points or
decrease in GCS >2 points) during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], up to day 7 or discharge, whichever is earlier.
 Whether progression of PHE can be a radiological/biological marker of activity that can be correlated with clinical
outcomes and treatment effect of DFO.
2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 RATIONALE 
2.1.1 I NTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM  
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major public health problem. Approximately 70,000 patients are diagnosed with 
ICH in the [LOCATION_002] (US), and up to 400,[ADDRESS_845027], each year [Qureshi 2009; Zhang 2003], and the number 
of patients with ICH is rising with the aging of the population. ICH is a frequent cause of disability and mortality and 
confers a substantial burden on the healthcare system and society [Russell 2006]; approximately 40% of ICH patients 
die within one month, and more than 70% of the survivors are left with serious and permanent disability. The financial 
burden of ICH is enormous; it is estimated that the overall annual costs for ICH patients in the US alone exceed seven 
billion US dollars. 
At present, there is no specific treatment for ICH beyond supportive general medical care. Attention has been focused 
on medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatments targeting hematoma and its expansion [Mendelow 2005; Mayer 2008]. 
However, the utility of these approaches alone is likely to be limited to only a selected subset of ICH patients, since ICH 
expansion often occurs early within the first few hours of onset [Brott 1997; Flaherty 2005]. Although the hematoma 
gradually resolves after ICH, restoration of function is usually incomplete, indicating that n euronal injury after ICH is not 
only relat ed to direct tissue damage and hematoma expansion [Brown 2005]. Other processes including apoptosis, n e-
crosis, iron -mediated oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, and edema formation contribute to secondary ne u-
ronal injury and disability after ICH  [Regan 1993 -1996; Castillo 2002; Goldstein 2003; Huang 2002; Wu 2003; Wagner 
2003; Leira 2004; He 2008].  
There is an unmet need for safe and effective neuroprotective strategies to target the secondary effects of ICH in order 
to limit brain injury, facilitate neuronal repair, and improve functional outcome. The iron chelator, deferoxamine me-
sylate (DFO), is potentially promising as a candidate therapeutic intervention to improve the overall outcome of ICH 
patients.  
2.1.2 T HE ROLE OF HEMOGLOBIN DEGRADATION PRODUCTS AND IRON IN SECONDARY NEURONAL INJURY 
AFTER ICH 
Hemolysed red blood cells release their hemoglobin into the brain parenchyma after ICH. The time course for hem o-
globin hemolysis is approximately 2-3 days [Macdonald 2004]. Hemoglobin is a potent neurotoxin, and its toxicity is 
largely iron-mediated [Regan 1993-2003; Hua 2002; Goldstein 2003; Xi 1998; Huang 2002]. Hemoglobin degradation 
products include the iron-containing heme, which is metabolized by [CONTACT_632856]. The released 
iron is implicated in neuronal injury and delayed brain edema formation after ICH via several mechanisms including: 
activation of lipid peroxidation, exacerbation of excitotoxicity, inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and catalysis of H a-
ber-Weiss/Fenton reaction {Fe+++ H 2O2  Fe++++ OH◦+ OHо}, in which superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) are  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
12 converted into highly reactive toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH ◦) leading to oxidative stress and cell death [Regan 1993-1996; 
Winterboum 1995; Goldstein 2003; Huang 2002; Wu 2003; Wagner 2003; Winterbourn1995; Nakamura 2005].  
Experimental studies examining the time course of iron’s role in brain injury after ICH dete cted an increase in iron-
positive cells, heme oxygenase protein, and markers of DNA damage in the peri-hematoma area within the first day 
after ICH, peaking by [CONTACT_4475] 3 [Nakamura, 2003-2005; Wu 2003]. Emerging evidence also links iron to neuronal injury in 
ICH patients. Serum ferritin upon admission correlates with the relative PHE on day-3 (which coincides with the timing 
for hemoglobin hemolysis), but not at baseline [Mehdiratta 2008], and functional outcome at 3 months [Perez 2010]; 
and the iron content within the hematoma, estimated by [CONTACT_9268], correlates with the relative PHE volume [Lou 2009]. 
These studies indicate that iron accumulates in the brain after ICH, and that its toxicity contributes to neuronal injury 
over many days following ICH. This delayed time window can have important therapeutic implications.   
2.1.3 D EFEROXAMINE MESYLATE  
[IP_ADDRESS] P HARMACOKINETICS –  
Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) [N- (5-C3-L (5 aminopentyl) hydroxycarbamoyl)-propi[INVESTIGATOR_632800])pentyl)- 3(5-(N-
hydroxyacetoamido)-pentyl)carbamoyl)-proprionhydroxamic acid] is a hydrophilic, water-soluble, chelator. It comple x-
es almost exclusively with ferric iron, at physiologic pH values, chelating iron from ferritin and hemosiderin; and forms a 
stable c omplex that prevents iron from entering into further chemical reactions. The drug’s serum protein -binding rate 
is less than 10%, and it is distributed throughout all body fluids. It has a volume of distribution of 0.8-1.35 L/kg [Lee 
1993]. The initial distribution half-life of DFO is approximately 5-10 minutes in humans [Perrone 2002]. Peak plasma 
concentrations between 80 and 130 µmol/L are measured 3 minutes after IV injection of DFO at a dose of 10 mg/kg [A l-
lain 1987]. During IV infusion of 50 mg/kg/day, steady state concentrations are generally obtained between 6-12 hours 
with a mean concentration of 7.4 ± 2.73 µM. The drug has a biphasic elimination pattern; the half-life is 1h in the first 
rapid phase and 6h in the second slow phase [Allain 1987]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a molecular weight of 560.7 daltons (656.8 as mesy l-
ate) and low lipid solubility, the drug can diffuse into the brain down a concentration gradient, and there appears to be 
specific mechanism(s) of uptake by [CONTACT_632857]. DFO accumulates in the brain at a significant concentration quickly 
after injection [Keberle 1964; Yokel 1991; Palmer 1994; Hershko 1988; Brancaccio 1991] and reduces cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_632801], indicating that it crosses the blood brain barrier after ICH [Wan 
2006-2009].

13 enough data to support an estimate of their frequency:  At the injection site: localized irritation, pain, burning sens a-
tion, swelling, induration, infiltration, itching, erythema, or wheal formation. These injection site reactions may be a s-
sociated with arthralgia, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, or abdominal pain. Systemic allergic and hypersensitivity 
reactions: rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction with or without shock, or angioedema. Cardiovascular system: tachy-
cardia, hypotension, and shock.  Impairment of cardiac function has also been reported in patients with severe chronic 
iron overload following concomitant treatment with DFO and vitamin C in excess of 500 mg per day. Digestive system: 
abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Hematologic system: thrombocytopenia and leucopenia.  Musc u-
loskeletal system: muscle cramps. Nervous system: dizziness, paresthesias, tinnitus, high-frequency sensorineural hea r-
ing loss, or visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16578], visual field d e-
fects, and cataracts. The ocular and auditory disturbances were reported when DFO was administered over prolonged 
periods of time, at high doses, in patients with low ferritin levels. These disturbances were reversible upon immediate 
cessation of treatment, in most cases. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]: acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_632802] l-
lowing treatment with excessively high doses of intravenous DFO in patients with acute iron intoxication or thalass e-
mia. Urinary system: dysuria and impaired renal functions. In addition, rare infections, such as Yersinia and M u-
cormycosis have been reported in patients with iron-overload. These are thought to be attributed to iron-induced i n-
creased susceptibility to infections particularly in patients with low ferritin levels, and are unlikely to occur in patients 
without iron overload. In a recent study, the most frequent adverse events of DFO (40-50 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week, for 
48 weeks) in adult patients with transfusion related iron overload were abdominal pain (34%) , diarrhea (26%), fever 
(26%), joint pain (13%), vertigo (13%), and dyspepsia (8.7%) [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99331] 2006]. Other less frequent adverse effects of DFO 
were local reactions at the site of injection, such as pain, swelling, or erythema. There were no serious adverse events 
related to DFO use, and the gastrointestinal symptoms were mild and resolved spontaneously within a few days wit h-
out drug interruption.  
Serious adverse effects are uncommon and are seen primarily with IV doses higher than 125 mg/kg/day, daily doses e x-
ceeding 6000 mg, and chronic long-term use [Porter, 1989]. Hypotension and shock have been reported in up to 2% of 
patients using IV DFO [Westlin 1971]. They were mostly seen with rapid intravenous infusions, and rarely reported when 
the drug is given at a rate ≤1 mg/kg/minute, and a dose ≤125 mg/kg/day [Westlin 1971; Porter 1989]. We will use a slo w-
er infusion rate ≤7.5 mg/kg/hour and limit the maximal dose that any subject can receive to [ADDRESS_845029] similar co-
morbidity profile to that of stroke patients, such as patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and elderly 
subjects with Alzheime r’s disease [Duffy, 2001; Hattori, 2002 -2003; Crapper, 1991], and healthy volunteers [Allain; 
1987]. The doses used varied from 10 to 80 mg/kg body-weight-adjusted or [ADDRESS_845030] i-
opulmonary by[CONTACT_632858] 50 to 100 mg/kg 
[Tamary 1994; Davis, 2000; Ioannis, 2004]. Gordeuk et al. also used DFO infusions (100 mg/kg per day for 72 hours) in 
non-iron overloaded volunteers with asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and patients with cerebral m a-
laria [Gordeuk, 1992].  These various dose regimens resulted in no serious adverse events to treatment in these studies.  
Because DFO is not approved by [CONTACT_632859], the primary investigator was granted a 
research (non-commercial) Investigational New Drug (IND) by [CONTACT_632860] (IND #77,306). The supporting data section below (section 2.2.4 ) details our experience with DFO use in ICH 
patients. Our Phase I study indicated that repeated IV infusions of DFO in doses up to 62 mg/kg/day with a maximum 
daily dose of 6000 mg/day in patients with ICH were largely safe and tolerable. The most observed adverse events were 
injection site reaction (irritation, pain, or erythema; 15%) , IV infiltration (20%) and a modest decrease in blood pressure 
which did not require any medical intervention (40%). While hypotension may be an undesirable side effect in patients 
with ischemic stroke, a modest reduction in blood pressure may prove to be beneficial, and is often advocated, in  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845031] part of phase II investigation of DFO in ICH ( HI-DEF  trial, where subjects were treated with a continuous inf u-
sion of DFO at 62 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days), however, we observed [ADDRESS_845032] 42 partic i-
pants; 6 of these cases were in the DFO treatment arm, and 2 of these were fatal . An expert blinded to treatment a s-
signment review ed all these cases and concluded that a plausible cause for ARDS, other than the study drug or ICH i t-
self, was identified in 4 cases, while no other explanation, other than the study drug or ICH, was apparent for the r e-
maining 3 cases. HI -DEF was terminated due to safety concerns, given the imbalance in the frequency of ARDS b e-
tween the DFO- and placebo-treated groups.  This prompted further review of 2 cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], reported as 
the result of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499], in Phase I study; both in the 62 mg/kg/day dose-tier. An expert review concluded 
that one of these cases was an undiagnosed case of ARDS, and that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3333] a plausible explanation for it. We 
have undertaken considerable precautions to minimize the potential pulmonary toxicity of DFO and ARDS risk and to 
enhance the safety of future participants in the current modified protocol by [CONTACT_632861] 62 
mg/kg/day to 32mg/kg/d ay, decreasing the duration of treatment from [ADDRESS_845033]-feeding will be excluded from this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF DFO  –  
By [CONTACT_12789] a stable complex with ferric iron, DFO decreases free iron’s availability for the production of hydroxyl rad i-
cals. DFO also alters iron regulatory genes and proteins binding activity, thereby [CONTACT_632862] 
[Chen 2010; Messer 2010].  However, DFO has multiple and diverse neuroprotective properties, which may be only par t-
ly related to its iron chelating abilities. DFO also prevents apoptosis induced by [CONTACT_632863] a signal transduction pathway leading to activation tra n-
scription factor 1/cAMP response element-binding protein (ATF-1/CREB) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1), and e x-
pression of genes known to compensate for oxidative stress [Zaman 1999]. It inhibits prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, 
which may lead to protection from oxidative stress-induced cell death [Siddiq 2005; Ratan 2008]; induces transcription 
of heme oxygenase-1; suppresses the upregulation of activated c-Jun N-terminus kinase (JNK) seen after ICH [Wan 
2009]; exerts anti-inflammatory effects by [CONTACT_632864] [Tanji 2001]; blocks the neurotoxic effects of 
hemoglobin via inhibition of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity [Regan 1996]; and exerts anti-phagocytic effects in a n-
imal models of ICH [He 2008]. Our phase I study also suggests that DFO has a modest blood pressure lowering effect 
when administered by [CONTACT_16228], which might be beneficial in patients with ICH [Anderson 2008; Suri 2008].  
2.2 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE 
2.2.1 S UPPORTING EVIDENCE THAT DFO  ATTENUATES NEURONAL INJURY AFTER ICH 
[IP_ADDRESS] I N VITRO STUDIES  
Several studies have shown that DFO can reduce hemoglobin-induced neurotoxicity in experimental models of ICH. 
Regan and Rogers [Regan, 2003] showed that delayed treatment with DFO markedly attenuates the production of r e-
active oxygen species and neuronal death induced by [CONTACT_632865]/astrocyte cell cultures. In 
another study, Regan and Panter [Regan, 1993] showed that DFO completely blocked hemoglobin-induced neuronal 
death in neocortical cultures derived from fetal mice. Regan and Panter [Regan, 1996] also showed that hemoglobin 
potentiates the neurotoxicity of glutamate agonists in primary murine cortical cultures, and that this effect was  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
15 attenuated by [CONTACT_632866]. Goldstein et al [Goldstein, 2003] showed that treatment with DFO significantly reduces the pr o-
duction of reactive oxygen species and cell death induced by [CONTACT_632867]-like cells. Similarly, Levy et al 
[Levy, 2002] showed that DFO diminishes hemin-induced cell death in pheochromocytoma (PC12) and neuroblastoma 
(SH-SY5Y) cell lines.       
[IP_ADDRESS] I N VIVO STUDIES  
Bilgihan et al [Bilgihan, 1994] studied the effects of DFO on lipid peroxidation and Na-K ATPase activity after exper i-
mental ICH in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and found that DFO treatment reduces brain malondialdehyde content and induces recovery 
of Na-K ATPase activity, suggesting that DFO can exert potential neuroprotective effects to counteract the deleterious 
effects of ICH. Pelit et al [Pelit, 2003] examined the effects of systemic treatment with DFO on the pathological chan g-
es in the optic nerve after experimental retrobulbar hematoma in rabbits, and were able to detect ultrastructural 
changes and abundant iron pi[INVESTIGATOR_632803]. These m i-
croscopic changes were significantly less pronounced in DFO-treated rabbits. Huang et al [Huang, 2002] examined the 
effects of intraperitoneal administration of DFO (500 mg/kg) on brain edema in rats pre-treated with hemoglobin de g-
radation products via stereotactic infusion into the brain; they found that DFO significantly attenuated the brain edema 
induced by [CONTACT_632868]. In similar studies, Nakamura et al [Nakamura, 2004] investigated 
the effects of repetitive administration of DFO (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 12 hours), starting 2, 6, and 24 hours 
after induction of ICH in rats, on markers of DNA oxidative damage and repair. They found that treatment with DFO 
ameliorated ICH-induced changes in 8-hydroxyl- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, and 
increased levels of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox effector-factor 1 (APE/Ref-1), a protein involved in DNA 
repair following oxidative damage, indicating that DFO may be a potential therapeutic agent for ICH by [CONTACT_632869]. 
Several experimental studies investigated whether DFO can reduce ICH-induced brain injury, by [CONTACT_632870], severity of neurological deficits, and performance on sensorimotor behavioral tests [Nakamura, 2003-
2004; Wan 2006-2009; Gu, 2009; Okauchi 2009]. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_632804], ICH resulted in development of a reddish per i-
hematoma zone, and iron accumulation, ferritin upregulation, and neuronal death within that zone, which were all r e-
duced by [CONTACT_632871] 50 mg/kg bid for 3 or 7 days after ICH [Okauchi 2009] (Figure 2.2. 1.2- 
A-C).

2.2. 2 S AFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF DEFEROXAMINE IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE 
(R01  NS  057127) 
OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIV ES - This was a prospective, open-label, multiple-tier, dose-finding, multi-center, preliminary 
clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated treatments with DFO in patients with ICH. The study 
was planned to evaluate DFO dose-tiers ranging from 7 to 125 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum dose of 6000 mg/day) u s-
ing the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). The initial dose of the drug was administered within 18h after stroke 
symptom onset by [CONTACT_22671] a rate of 7.5 mg/kg/hour and repeated daily for 3 consecutive days. Four clinical sites 
participated in the study (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Medical College of 
Wisconsin, and Hartford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). The Division of Biostatistics and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632805].  Subject recruitment began in July 2008.  
THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  were: 1) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated IV infusions of DFO in patients with 
spontaneous ICH; and 2) To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DFO (highest dose regimen ≤ 125 mg/kg 
that can be safely administered and tolerated) in patients with ICH to be adopted in subsequent studies to test the eff i-
cacy of DFO in ICH.  
Enrollment into every dose tier, starting with 7 mg/kg daily for 3 days, was completed before enrollment into the next 
tier began. Each subsequent dose level was determined using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_37341]-modified CRM (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_37341] 1998). The 
dose-toxicity curve was re-estimated based on safety data generated throughout the study. At least 3 patients were 
enrolled in each dose-tier. The safety information, guiding transition from one dose tier to the next, was based on the 
number of subjects in a cohort who experienced pre-defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 7-day period 
or until discharge, whichever occurred first, following initiation of DFO treatment. The acceptable probability of DLT  

 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
17 was set at 0.40. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was pre-defined as any of the following adverse events, fatal or non-
fatal, occurring within [ADDRESS_845034], of treatment initiation: 1) Anaphylaxis (at any 
time point during DFO infusion); 2) Hypotension (defined as a decrease in SBP > 20 mm Hg or DBP > 10 mm Hg, or a 
SBP ≤ 85 mm Hg, confirmed by 3 consecutive readings, requiring medical treatment at any time point during DFO inf u-
sion that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_22714]); 3) Worsenin g neurological status (defined as an increase ≥ 4 points on 
NIHSS, or a decrease of ≥ 2 points on GCS, that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_22714], compared to baseline values o c-
curring at any point during DFO infusions); 4) Mortality within 7 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and 5) Any adverse event pr o-
longing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], resulting in emergent medical therapy, or resulting in death. All of these events were considered 
SAEs for the purpose of this study. Patients underwent repeated clinical (neurological, visual and auditory, and general 
physical examinations) and laboratory evaluations at regular intervals throughout their participation in the study, from 
the day of enrollment until day 90, for adverse events. The 30-day neurological and functional status was determined 
by [CONTACT_550325], extended Glasgow outcome scale (eGOS), Barthel index (BI), and mRS. The patients or their surrogates were 
contact[CONTACT_132299] 90±7 days to compute mRS, eGOS, and BI, and to assess 3-month mortality.  
STUDY STATUS AND R ESULTS : Enrollment was completed in January 2010; the last subject completed the 90-day a s-
sessment in April 2010. A total of 20 subjects were enrolled into 5 DFO dose tiers, ranging from 7 mg/kg/day to 62 
mg/kg/day. Because the recommended subsequent dose was within 5% (a pre-specified convergence criterion) of the 
62 mg/kg/day dose, the study was concluded with the 62 mg/kg/day dose as the recommended MTD.  
Number of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_2715]-tier : 7 mg/kg = 4; 32 mg/kg = 3; 47 mg/kg = 3; 57 mg/kg = 4; 62 mg/kg = 6. An add i-
tional cohort of 3 subjects was treated at 62 mg/kg once it was determined to be the MTD to ascertain the safety and 
tolerability of this dose before proposing its use in the current study). The detailed results are included in Appendix I. 
The main results are summarized below.  
SAFETY DATA : Sixteen non-serious adverse events were possibly or probably related to the study drug. The most 
common were injection site irritation and IV infiltration. Six subjects experienced 12 SAEs and 3 subjects had 4 DLTs. 
Three subjects (15%) died during the 90-day follow-up period: one subject died in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 7 days of ICH onset 
and two between 7-30 days after ICH onset. None of the SAEs, DLTs, or mortalities was adjudicated to be related to the 
study drug. There were 2 cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]; both in the 62 mg/kg/day do se-tier and were thought to be related 
to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_632806]. However, a recent expert review found 
that one of these cases was an undiagnosed ARDS, and agreed that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3333] a plausible explanation for it.       
PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA : Laboratory data - There were no differences in routine laboratory values and in the inc i-
dence of abnormalities and change from baseline in EKG parameters. Overall, daily DFO infusions at a rate of 7.5 
mg/kg/hour up to 62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 6000 mg/day) were well tolerated without significant alterations 
of hemoglobin or hematocrit, hematological parameters, and renal or hepatic functions. Treatment with DFO for [ADDRESS_845035] DFO infusion were as follows: serum iron (3.5 ug/dl; 95% CI -23, 45); transferrin (-18 
ng/ml; 95% CI -43, 5); total iron binding capacity (8.5 ug/dl; 95% CI -47, 30); and ferritin (32.5 ng/ml; 95% CI 6, 74). We 
found no relationship between DFO dose and changes in serum iron studies. Vital signs (heart rate; respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; 
oxygen saturation; and temperature) - Overall, DFO administration did not result in important alterations in these var i-
ables. Blood pressure: DFO had a moderate BP-lowering effect. Overall, the median mean BP at baseline was 95.8 
mmHg (95% CI 84, 100.3) vs. 93.2 mmHg (95% CI 87.6, 98) during the infusions. A total of 8 patients (40%) experienced 
a maximal drop in mean BP >20% (median 0.29; 95%CI 0.27, 0.39) at some point during the infusions compared to 
baseline values. One subject required vasopressors; his hypotension was thought to be related to intubation and ane s-
thesia. None of the remaining 7 subjects required any medical treatment.       
RADIOLOGICAL DATA : We found no radiological evidence to suggest that treatment with DFO exacerbates the 
natural enlargement of ICH or PHE over 72h after treatment. The overall median change in relative PHE volume from 
screening to post-3rd DFO infusion was 0.48 (95% CI 0.10, 0.76) and from screening to day-7 or discharge (whichever  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845036]) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.51, 1.28). These exploratory results contrast with previous studies of the natural hist o-
ry of relative PHE evolution [Mehdiratta 2008; Gebel 2002], which showed that the relative PHE volume almost doubles 
by 72h.        
FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME DA TA: Two subjects withdrew consent, one after the 7-day visit (mRS =5), and one after 
the 30-day visit (mRS =1). Among the remaining 18 subjects, 9 subjects (50%) had mRS scores of 0-2; 2 (11%) had a 
score of 3; and 7 (39%) had scores of 4-6.The 90-day mortality rate was 15%.   
CONCLUSIONS : Repeated daily infusions of DFO at doses up to 62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 6000 mg/day) in p a-
tients with acute spontaneous ICH for 3 consecutive days after ICH onset are feasible, well tolerated and do not increase 
serious adverse events or mortality.    
2.2.3 HIGH DOSE DEFEROXAMINE IN INTRACEREBRAL H EMORRHAGE (HI-DEF  IN ICH)   
(U01 NS074425) 
OVERVIEW A ND OBJECTIVES  - Part [ADDRESS_845037] a-
cebo-controlled, phase-II clinical trial. Subjects were randomized to either DFO at 62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum da i-
ly dose of 6000 mg/day), or saline placebo, given by [CONTACT_165625] 5 consecutive days. Treatment was init i-
ated within 24 hours after ICH symptom onset. Randomization controlled for baseline imbalances associated with bas e-
line ICH score (0- 2 vs. ≥3), ICH onset -to-treatment time (OTT) window (≤1 2h vs. >12-24h), and concurrent warfarin use. 
All subjects were followed for [ADDRESS_845038] of care therapy while participating in the study. 
THE M AIN OBJECTIVES WERE : 1- TO assess whether it is futile to move DFO forward as a therapeutic intervention for ICH 
into Phase III evaluation, by [CONTACT_632854]-treated subjects to placebo-treated subjects with respect 
to good outcome (defined as mRS of 0-2 at 90 days), in a futility analysis; and 2 - TO assess the safety of DFO infusions 
(at a dose of 62 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), given for [ADDRESS_845039] more data on treatment-related adverse events in order to ascertain 
that patients with ICH could complete this dose given over 5-day duration of infusion without experiencing unreason a-
ble neurological complications, mortality, or other serious adverse events related to DFO use. 
STUDY STATUS AND S AFETY RESULTS - Throughout the study, we continued to assess the safety of DFO. Enrollment was 
placed on hold after enrollment of 42 subjects to investigate a potential safety concern – Adult Respi[INVESTIGATOR_129639] (ARDS) . ARDS is reported as a potential side effect of prolonged intravenous infusions of high dose DFO in 
the product’s package insert. Five cases of ARDS were reported. An expert in ARDS, blinded to treatment assignments, 
reviewed all 5 cases as well as 3 cases reported as respi[INVESTIGATOR_1444] 3 cases reported as pulmonary edema. The ex-
pert concluded that 2/3 cases reported as pulmonary edema were possibly/probably ARDS, suggesting a total of 7 
ARDS cases . The expert review identified a plausible cause for ARDS, other than the study drug or ICH itself, in 4 cases, 
while no other explanation was apparent for the remaining 3 cases. After careful review of the data, the DSMB unblin d-
ed the investigators to the treatment assignment. Six of the 7 cases of ARDS occurred in the DFO-treated group. Three 
of the 42 enrolled subjects died (7%); all had ARDS, and the cause of death was attributed to ARDS in 2 subjects. No 
other safety concerns emerged.  A total of 36 SAEs were reported in 15 subjects; 22 of which occurred in 9 DFO-treated 
subjects. One MedWatch report was submitted for hypophosphatemia as it was judged to be severe, unexpected, and 
possibly related to the study drug. Overall, hypophosphatemia was reported as an AE in 3 subjects (2 in the DFO- and 1 
in the placebo group).  Other analyses are yet to be performed. 
CONCLUSIONS -  The NINDS-appointed DSMB concluded that: “although the ARDS cases in the treatment group were in 
the ballpark frequency of at least one paper in the literature on ARDS in patients with ICH [Elmer 2013], the imbalance 
in the frequency of ARDS cases between the treatment and placebo groups suggested that pulmonary toxicity of the  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
19 drug was highly likely ”. HI-DEF  was therefore terminated due to safety concerns, and the initial protocol has been mo d-
ified to minimize the potential for pulmonary toxicity of DFO and to enhance the safety of future participants.  
2.3 SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Collectively, the above data indicate that: 1) extensive preclinical investigations, in vitro and in vivo, by [CONTACT_632872] s-
tigators and in different species, show that treatment with DFO confers neuroprotection after ICH; 2) although DFO 
may work directly by [CONTACT_632873], it also has several other neuroprotective properties which can be beneficial after 
ICH;  3) repeated daily administrations of IV infusions of DFO to ICH patients is feasible and largely well-tolerated; and 
4)the potential for pulmonary toxicity and ARDS is higher in ICH patients treated with continuous IV infusions of DFO
at  62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum total dose of 6000 mg/day), for 5 consecutive days; a lower dose and shorter dur a-
tion of treatment might help to ameliorate this toxicity to improve the benefit/risk ratio.
These findings indicate that DFO is a potentially promising candidate intervention to target the secondary effects of 
ICH, and provide a rationale for its therapeutic use to improve the overall outcome in patients with ICH, particularly i f 
the safety concerns encountered in part 1 (HI-DEF) of this study can be ameliorated by [CONTACT_632874]-
age of DFO and improved selection of subjects to exclude those at high risk for ARDS.   Because hemoglobin degrad a-
tion starts hours-days after ICH onset, the potentially delayed and slow pace of hemoglobin- and iron-mediated injury 
may facilitate treatment at a delayed time window after ICH onset. This could extend the potential utility of DFO as a 
therapeutic intervention to a large proportion of ICH patients. DFO is relatively inexpensive and is likely to be a highly 
cost- effective therapy for ICH and complementary to ongoing efforts targeting hematoma and its expansion. We ge n-
erally hypothesize that treatment with DFO would minimize ongoing neuronal injury after ICH, via several diverse 
mechanisms, and would improve the outcome in these patients. As a prelude to test this hypothesis, thi s Phase II study 
will assess the futility of DFO as a therapeutic intervention in ICH before embarking on a large Phase III trial. In addition 
to allowing us to assess the futility of moving DFO forward to phase III efficacy testing as a potential therapeutic inte r-
vention in ICH, this study will allow us to gain experience with logistical aspects of trial conduct, and the data and r e-
sults from this study will be used to guide our planning for a possible future Phase III study.  
2.4 SIGNIFICANCE 
This study will provide a crucial “go/no -go” signal to determine if embarking on a large -scale, costly phase III trial to in-
vestigate the efficacy of DFO as a treatment for ICH is worthwhile. This study will also provide important information to 
guide the planning and conduct of a future phase-III trial, if it is determined that the treatment with DFO is not futile. It 
will allow us to gain experience with logistical aspects of trial conduct, such as blinding and randomization, prior to 
phase-III testing. Furthermore, results from this study can provide valuable information regarding the dichotomized 
mRS outcome rate among control subjects, the potential for a differential treatment effect in the ≤12 vs. >12 -24 hour 
time windows, and appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria (HI-DEF has been already informative in this regard) ; 
information which can guide the design of a potential future Phase III trial. In addition, we plan to collect data on 
various outcome scales (mRS, NIHSS, SIS-16 [Duncan 2003], and MoCA [Pendlebury 2010]), which will allow us to 
explore the utility of these various outcome measures in phase-III.  
If successful, this study can potentially result in new means to improve the outcome of patients with ICH. A successful 
study demonstrating the efficacy of DFO in ICH would be of considerable significance to the field and the society. A 
wealth of data, generated from various planned exploratory analyses in this study, can still help to advance our 
knowledge and understanding of the pathophysiology of ICH, such as the relationship between PHE volumes and ou t-
come and the relationship between ICH and cognitive function, even if DFO is found to be futile.  These additional ana l-
yses can generate novel hypotheses for future investigations in ICH. The potential advantage of novel treatments for 
ICH and better understanding of its pathophysiology and relationship to outcome with regard to patients' welfare, pu b-
lic health and cost containment is noteworthy.

20 3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
THE STUDY HAS TWO PRIMARY AIMS : 1- To determine if it is futile to move DFO forward to Phase III evaluation, using mRS 
0-[ADDRESS_845040] ≥12% in favor of DFO ; and 2- To fu r-
ther assess the safety of DFO infusions, at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day, given over a consecutive 3-day period, in particular
serious adverse events including ARDS .
THE SECONDARY AIMS are to:  1- Explore the differences between early (≤12h) and late (> 12-24h) time windows in DFO 
treatment effect on functional outcome; 2-  Determine the overall distribution of ordinal scores on mRS at 3 months in 
DFO- and placebo-treated subjects, and to perform a dichotomized analysis considering the proportion of DFO- and 
placebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-3;  3- Perform dichotomized analyses considering the proportion of DFO- and pl a-
cebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-2 and 0-3; and to determine the overall ordinal distribution of scores on mRS at 6 
months; 4- Determine mortality during the 180-day follow-up period (all causes and ICH-related); and 5- Obtain data on 
the changes in NIHSS between presentation and day-90, and MoCA and SIS-16 scores at 3 months to explore the e f-
fects of DFO on neurological, functional, and cognitive functions.   
ADDITIONAL PLANNED EXPLORATORY ANALYSES include assessments of:  1- The effects of treatment with DFO on relative 
PHE volume progression between admission (i.e. screening) and post-treatment CT scans in DFO-treated patients a s 
potential markers of DFO’s biological activity on brain tissue [Gebel 2002; Mehdiratta 2008; Leira 2004; Okauchi 2009 -
2010]; 2- Whether the effect of DFO on outcome is dependent on initial ICH volume, after adjusting for other progno s-
tic variables, to determine if specific limits for ICH volume should be specified as exclusion/inclusion criteria for future 
studies; 3- The effects of DFO on the size of ventricular enlargement in patients with intraventricular extension of ICH , 
not requiring EVD, as a potential marker of treatment utility in IVH [Chen 2011]; 4- The effect of treatment with DFO on 
incidence of symptomatic cerebral edema (unexplained increase in NIHSS >4 points or decrease in GCS >2 points) du r-
ing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], up to day 7 or discharge whichever is earlier; and 5- Whether progression of PHE can be a radiolog i-
cal/biological marker of activity which can be correlated with clinical outcomes and treatment effect of DFO. 
3.2 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN 
This is a  prospective, multi-center, double-blind ed, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-II clinical trial. The total 
sample size required is 294 subjects with ICH. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DFO at 3 2 
mg/kg/day (up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), or a matching saline vehicle (placebo), given by [CONTACT_632875] 3 consecutive days, in a blinded manner. Treatment will be initiated within 24 hours after ICH symptom onset. Su b-
jects will undergo repeated clinical, imaging, and laboratory evaluations at regular intervals throughout their particip a-
tion in the study, from the day of randomization until day 180. All adverse events will be assessed until day-7 or di s-
charge (whichever is earlier), and new SAEs until day- 90. Mortality and continuing SAEs will be assessed until day 180. 
Functional status will be determined by [CONTACT_632876], in person at 30±7 and 90±7 days; the patients or their surrogates 
will be contact[CONTACT_585070] 60±7 and 180±7 to assess mRS [Merino, 2005].  
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS  
The rationale for the proposed dose regimen, therapeutic time window, duration of treatment, study design, inclusion 
of a placebo group, and surrogate measures of DFO efficacy is as follows: 
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
21 Dose Reduction and New Dose Selection:  The 62 mg/kg/day dose was identified in our Phase I study as the MTD in 
ICH subjects and was the dose used for the 42 participants enrolled in HI-DEF. This was based on safety data from the 
phase I study, where DFO did not appear to increase the overall rate of SAEs or mortality compared with placebo-
treated patients in previous ICH trials [Mayer 2005; Mayer 2008; Lyden 2007; Haley 2005], and the notion that the eff i-
cacy of a drug often has a monotonically non-decreasing dose-response relationship. However, the observation of 6 
cases of ARDS among DFO-treated participants in HI-DEF , and the reported association of prolonged high-dose intr a-
venous infusions of DFO with the development of ARDS [Tenenbein 1992] prompted us to reduce the dose to 32 
mg/kg/day (up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg per day) in the current protocol to maximize safety and minimize 
harm . Pre-clinical studies in aged rats compared 3 dose regimens of DFO; 10 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg every 12 
hours [Okauchi 2009]. Based on mass constant conversion factors and the FDA guidance for the industry for estimating 
the human equivalent dose (HED) in clinical trials, the calculated HEDs are approximately 3, 16 and 32 mg/kg/day, r e-
spectively [ http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceCompliance RegulatoryInfmation/Guidances/ ucm078932. 
pdf]. The latter dose regimens (HEDs 16 and 32 mg/kg/day) were superior to the first dose regimen in improving pe r-
formance on sensorimotor behavioral tests at days 28 and 58 following induction of experimental hemorrhage . We now 
opt for a dose of 32 mg/kg/day based on the following considerations: 
I. This dose, while assuring increased tolerability and safety of the drug, represents the upper limit of effective doses in
animal models - Data from rat models of ICH indicate that HEDs ranging from 16 to 32 mg/kg/day are effective in
reducing brain edema formation and brain tissue atrophy, and improving neurological and functional recovery
[Okauchi 2009].
II. This dose provides a better safety margin - No cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632807] 10
participants who received DFO in doses ranging from 32 to 57 mg/kg/day in our Phase I study (32 mg/kg/day, n=3; 47
mg/kg/day, n=3; 57 mg/kg/day, n=4).
III. Equivalent dose in pi[INVESTIGATOR_632808]. It reduced the perihematomal
reddish zone, white matter injury, iron accumulation, ferritin upregulation, and neuronal death within that zone [Gu
2009].
The 6000 mg/day limit, irrespective of body weight, is based on FDA recommendations and the manufacturer’s br o-
chure to avoid the risk of serious adverse effects of higher dose-regimens.  
TIME-TO-TREATMENT WINDOW : The decision to initiate DFO treatment up to 24h after ICH symptom onset and not b e-
yond, and to balance randomization based on OTT, is based on data from animal studies. Okauchi et al [Okauchi 2010] 
examined the effects of DFO when administered within 2h, 4h, 12h, 24h, and 48h after the induction of ICH on brain 
edema formation, forelimb placing and corner turn scores, and brain atrophy in aged rats. They found that: 1) Regar d-
less of the time- to-treatment window, DFO improved forelimb placing and corner turn scores compared to vehicle 
treatment, and the differences in rats’ performance of these tests between these various time points w ere not signif i-
cant; 2) DFO effects on functional recovery, however, were seen faster when the treatment was begun within 24h as  
opposed to 48h (28 days vs. 56 days); and 3) DFO reduced brain tissue loss and atrophy when administered within 24h 
after induction of ICH compared to 48h delayed treatment. The faster improvement of function noted in these studies 
is suggestive of greater efficacy for earlier treatment and might also translate into potentially significant cost savings 
from reduction in healthcare related expenses and earlier ability of the patients or their caregivers to return to work and 
avoid lost wages. In addition, very few patients in the phase I study presented more than 24h after ICH onset, indicating 
that only few additional patients are likely to be enrolled by [CONTACT_632877] 24h at this stage.  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
22 Conversely,  animal data do not strongly support limiting treatment to an earlier time window, such as within 12h. Al t-
hough Okauchi et al [Okauchi 2010] reported that the optimal therapeutic window of DFO to reduce PHE formation 
was about 12h, the correlation between PHE and deficits on sensorimotor behavioral tests weeks- to-months after ICH 
was weak, which they attributed to the sensitivity of their assays. Previous studies have shown that PHE formation co r-
relates with forelimb placing during the acute phase of ICH [Hua 2002]. A serial MRI study of the natural history of PHE 
in patients with ICH reported similar results; PHE correlated with worsening neurological status at 48h, but not 3-month 
functional outcome [Venkatasubramanian 2011]. Indeed, the influence of PHE on long-term recovery of ICH patients is 
debatable [Inaji 2003; McCarron 1999 ; Sansing 2011 ; Sykora 2009 ; Zazulia 1999]. Therefore, restricting the time- to-
treatment to 12h or even less, for the sole purpose of its potential effect on PHE, seems unnecessary. In addition, very 
few patients presented within 12h in the phase-I study. Attempting to restrict the OTT window to less than 12h could 
limit recruitment into the study as well as the generalizability of the results to the wider ICH population. Therefore, OTT 
time  is incorporated into the randomization algorithm in order to achieve an acceptable treatment balance. Similar to 
animal studies, this would also allow for further exploratory analysis to assess the effect of early vs. delayed treatment 
with DFO on PHE and outcome.     
DURATION OF TREATMENT :  Pre-clinical studies that examined the optimal duration of treatment with DFO following ICH 
produced variable results. In one study, treatment with DFO (HED ~ 16 mg/kg/day) for 2, 5, 7, or [ADDRESS_845041] at days 28 and 56 [Okauchi 2010]. However, residual neur o-
logical deficit was present on corner turn test in animals treated for less than 7 days, and the 7-day treatment was ass o-
ciated with less adverse reactions than the 14 days, leading the investigators to conclude that the optimal duration of 
treatment in this model was 7 days. In other studies, treatment with DFO at HEDs of 16 and 32 mg/kg/day for 3 days 
resulted in significant improvement in rats ’ performance on both forelimb placing and corner turn tests and reduced 
brain atrophy at 56 weeks compared with placebo [Okauchi 2009]. In pi[INVESTIGATOR_1515], treatment with DFO for 3 or 7 days had 
similar protective effects on perihematomal reddish zone, white matter injury, iron accumulation, ferritin upregulation, 
and neuronal death within that zone [Gu 2009]. In other experiments, treatment with DFO at 200 mg/kg/day for 3 or 7 
days after ICH also improved forelimb placing and corner turn scores and reduced brain edema [Nakamura 2003-2004]. 
Collectively, these results suggest that treatment with DFO for any duration ≥2 days results in improved functional pe r-
formance, compared with vehicle treatment.   
The phase I study assessed varying doses of DFO administered over a 3-day infusion period.  The 3-day infusion dur a-
tion was chosen for the following reasons: 1- Edema growth is fastest in the first 2-3 days after ICH onset and this initial 
growth (and not the later one) is associated with neurological deterioration [Venkatasubramanian 2011; Inaji 2003; 
Zazulia1999]; 2- The time course for hemoglobin hemolysis and release of its degradation products including iron is a p-
proximately 2-3 days [Macdonald 2004]; and 3- Iron in the perihematoma tissue peaks at day 3 after experimental ICH 
[Wu 2003]. Extending the duration of treatment to 5 days in HI-DEF was based on the above data in aged rats [Okauchi 
2010]. The pulmonary toxicity of DFO is believed to be related to prolonged intravenous infusions of high doses of the 
drug, and a review of the 6 cases of ARDS in the DFO arm in HI-DEF revealed that the mean time from treatment to 
ARDS onset was ~ 78 hours, median ~ [ADDRESS_845042] contributed to increased 
pulmonary toxicity of the drug observed in HI-DEF, where 6/21 (28.6%) subjects in the treatment arm developed ARDS  
compared with 1/6 (16.7%) of patients who received the 62 mg/kg/day dose in phase I. Lowering the duration of trea t-
ment would decrease the total dose of the drug and might help to minimize the pulmonary toxicity of the drug without 
compromising the potential effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, we chose t o decrease the duration of treatment to 3 
days in this revised protocol .  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
23 Overall, a 3-day treatment provides the potential for improved drug safety and tolerability without significantly jeop-
ardizing its efficacy.  The 3-day treatment with DFO was superior to saline vehicle in improving functional outcome in 
rat models of ICH [Okauchi 2010]; although iron release from the hematoma continues for days- to-weeks, the time  
course of iron release from the hematoma may not directly correlate with the timing of iron toxicity. With time, there is 
an up-regulation in endogenous iron chelators after ICH which may limit iron toxicity and the need for more extended 
treatment with DFO; and the 32 mg/kg/day dose proposed in part 2 of this study exceeds the animal dose (100 
mg/kg/day; HED 16 mg/kg/day) used in studies examining the optimal duration of DFO therapy after experimental ICH, 
and it is possible that the higher dosage and route of administration (IV as opposed to intramuscular in animal studies) 
might be as effective within a shorter treatment period.  
STUDY DESIGN AND P LACEBO GROUP:  The futility design directly addresses the question of whether or not DFO at a dose 
shown to be effective in animal models of ICH given over a clinically feasible duration of [ADDRESS_845043] the efficacy hypothesis. Furthermore, non-futility in this phase-II study does 
not guarantee a positive phase-III result, which is important in preserving clinical equipoise for Phase III. Lastly, the futi l-
ity hypothesis differs from hypotheses specified in traditional phase III efficacy trials and the probabilities of type-I and -
II errors are interpreted differently. In futility analysis, we are less concerned about falsely concluding an ineffective 
treatment is possibly effective.  
The advantage of the proposed two-arm design over a single-arm phase-II futility design is that it avoids the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207] a s-
sociated with the use of historical data (temporal changes in other aspects of patient management, variations in data 
quality and protocol adherence, and differences in the eligibility criteria and specification of primary outcome measure 
between the various studies). These confounding variables can distort estimates of the historical reference proportion 
and are difficult to account for in a single arm study. Besides addressing these concerns, the inclusion of a placebo arm 
allows us to conduct secondary exploratory imaging analyses to determine the natural history of PHE progression and 
the effects of DFO on PHE  as a surrogate marker of its biological activity on brain tissue. Furthermore, the proposed 
two-arm design allows us to configure and evaluate the logistics of randomization and blinding processes.  
CHOICE OF FUTILITY THRESHOLD : The Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in ICH is to some extent arbitrary 
and is largely derived from Traumatic Brain Injury literature, where demonstration of effectiveness was set at a 10% 
increase in the percentage of patients with favorable outcome in many clinical trials of head injury. Indeed, previous 
and ongoing Phase III trials in ICH, such as ATACH-2, used MCID of 10% or greater in the absence of data supporting 
that lower magnitude of difference will change practice patterns. For example, in the GAIN International and GAIN 
America Studies of the glycine antagonist, Gavestinel, the rate of mRS 0-2 was approximately 4%- to-5% higher in 
Gavestinel-treated patients, compared with placebo, but this difference was not considered encouraging to further d e-
velop the drug as a therapy for ICH [Haley 2005]. We relied on data from previous ICH studies, the NINDS rt-PA trials in 
ischemic stroke, and outcome data from the phase-I study to derive a threshold for futility, based on mRS score of 0- 2 
at 3 months, in the current study. In phase-II study of factor VIIa in ICH, the proportion of treated patients with mRS 0- 2 
at 3 months was 12.8% to 17% (depending on the dose) greater than the placebo patients [Mayer 2005]. In the NINDS 
rt-PA trials, the proportion of rt- PA-treated patients with mRS scores of 0-2 at 3 months was 12% greater than their  
placebo-treated counterparts. Taking these numbers into consideration, the fact that no specific treatments exist to 
prevent disability after ICH, and the frequent observation of “winner’s curse” in pr evious stroke trials (a phenomenon by 
[CONTACT_632878]-phase III trials, only to become smaller in larger Phase III trials which 
involve more sites and greater heterogeneity), a 12% difference in the proportion of DFO-treated subjects who achieve  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845044] size of 12% 
for the current proposal provides a balance between setting the bar too high (leading to rejection of a potentially effe c-
tive therapy) or too low (leading to further testing of a marginally-effective mediocre therapy with its associated e x-
pense and resources, which could hinder the development of truly effective treatments for ICH). 
CHOICE OF EFFICACY OUTCOME MEASURE : The mRS was chosen for the primary outcome assessment because of its high 
inter-rater reliability and to be consistent with previous ICH trials. The decision to use a dichotomous outcome aims to 
increase the sensitivity of detecting meaningful differences by [CONTACT_632879] n-
ment. Favorable outcome, as opposed to poor outcome, was specified based on careful review of the putative benef i-
cial mechanism(s) of DFO and expected lack of an effect from treatment on reducing hematoma growth, a major pr e-
dictor of mortality and significant disability after ICH [Davis 2006], as well as the phase-I outcome data. However, it is 
possible that DFO might result in an increase in the proportion of patients with mRS 0- 3 (and hence a decrease in the 
proportion of patients with mRS 4-6) instead of mRS 0-2. Although mRS 0-[ADDRESS_845045] ≥13% in favor of DFO . Given increased acceptance of ordinal analysis of mRS in the 
stroke field and recognition that ICH patients may take longer to recover, we added ordinal analysis across all mRS 
scores and extended the follow up period to include assessment of mRS by [CONTACT_1555] 6 months as secondary outcome 
measures. 
SURROGATE MEASURES OF DFO  BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY : We plan to examine the effect of treatment with DFO on relative 
PHE volume and progression at days 3-[ADDRESS_845046] 24h after ICH is related to red blood cells’ lysis and hemoglobin - and iron-mediated 
toxicity [Xi 1998/2002; Lee 1996; Qing 2009]. Treatment with DFO reduces brain edema, CSF free iron levels, iron de p-
osition in the perihematoma region, and residual cavity volume after experimental ICH [Nakamura 2003-2004; Wan 
2006-2009; Gu 2009; Okauchi 2009]. Human studies suggest that PHE continues to grow for weeks after ICH, and that 
edema progression is fastest during the first few days [Venkatasubramanian 2011]. Although the influence of PHE on 
long-term recovery after ICH is debatable [Hua 2002; Inaji 2003; Zazulia1999; McCarron 1999; Sykora 2009; Sansing 
2011], there is evidence that early edema progression correlates with early neurological deterioration [Venkatasubr a-
manian 2011; Inaji 2003]. Therefore , secondary analyses will examine the effects of treatment on PHE immediately fo l-
lowing completion of the infusion and not weeks later, since PHE growth during the early time period seems to be more 
clinically relevant. Regardless of the clinical impact of PHE, demonstrating an effect of DFO on this variable would at 
least provide secondary evidence of the agent’s biological activity under the chosen dosing regimen. The relative PHE 
volume (the absolute PHE volume divided by [CONTACT_632880]) was chosen as it has been used previously to d e-
tect serial changes in edema volume while adjusting for subsequent hematoma expansion or retraction [Gebel 2002; 
Mehdiratta 2008].

4.3 STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES 
4.3.1 S CREENING FOR POTENTIAL SUBJECTS   
The majority of patients is expected to be recruited upon initial evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED).  Ther e-
fore, the ED staff, members of the stroke team, and Neurology/Neurosurgery residents should be made aware of this 
study and in-serviced about its protocol to facilitate recruitment.  It is expected that the stroke team and study coord i-
nator (or other designated members of the study staff) will be informed about all patients who present to the ED with 
ICH, as confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]; and, that these patients will be reviewed by [CONTACT_632882].  All participating sites have an acute stroke response 
team, and it is expected that potential eligible candidates will be examined and interviewed within 60-90 minutes of 
their arrival to the ED.   
The investigators at each site will be required to maintain a screening log for ICH patients who are found ineligible to 
participate in the study or those who are enrolle d into another research study, documenting the patients’ age, d e-
mographics, and the reason(s) for exclusion from the current study. The study coordinator at each site is required to 
enter the screening log data into the WebDCUTM study database on a monthly basis.
4.3.2 S CREENING EVALUATIONS  
The following clinical, laboratory, and radiological assessments will be carried out upon screening of potential study 
subjects: 1) Demographic data; 2) Medical history; 3) Review of medications; 4) General physical examination and vital 
signs; 5) Neurological examination, including visual auditory assessment, NIHSS, and GCS; 6) Review of head CT scans 
and chest x-rays; 7) Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria; 8) Determination of ICH score and pre-ICH mRS score; 9) 
Laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistries, serum albumin, coagulation parameters, renal and hepatic function 
tests and urine analysis).   
A baseline pre-treatment plain (non-enhanced) brain CT confirming the presence of ICH is required to establish the d i-
agnosis of ICH.  The head CT should be reviewed by a Radiologist or a stroke-trained Neurologist experienced in the 
interpretation of CT scans. The need for additional diagnostic tests, such as CTA, conventional angiogram, or MRI/MRA 
to rule out secondary causes of ICH in suspected cases should be based on the judgment of the investigators according 
to the standards of clinical practice at each participating institution and the guidelines from the Stroke Council of the 
American Heart Association [Morgenstern, 2010; please refer to appendix II].  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845048] is required for all women of childbearing potential prior to enrollment into the study. 
4.3.3  INFORMED CONSENT  
Upon confirmation of patient’s eligibility based on the initial screening evaluation above, an informed consent will be 
obtained.  In accordance with US FDA regulations (21 CFR 50) and ICH-GCP Consolidated Guidelines, a witnessed, IRB-
approved, informed consent is required from all subjects, their legal representative, or family member (as defined in 
21CFR50.3(m)) (legal representative and family members are also referred to as surrogates in this protocol) prior to pa r-
ticipating in this study.  At the initial contact [CONTACT_4490] a potential candidate, the investigator(s) should provide a compr e-
hensive explanation of the purpose, procedures, possible risks/benefits of the study in language that is understandable 
to a non-medically trained person; as well as participant responsibilities and the fact that his/her participation is volu n-
tary, that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and that the decision not to participate or to withdraw will 
not affect subject’s care in any way.  Potential participants or their surrogates should be given ample opportunity to ask 
questions and to consider their decision.  If the subject or the surrogate on behalf of the subject expresses a sustained 
interest, a signed and dated written informed consent will be obtained.  Patients with a known history of dementia 
should be excluded from self-consent, thereby [CONTACT_632883]. A copy of the 
consent form must be given to the participant or the surrogate, and another copy placed in the subject’s medical re c-
ord. The informed consent must be obtained by [CONTACT_632884] [INVESTIGATOR_632809].  
4.3.4 E NROLLMENT  
Clinically and radiological ly eligible patients for whom informed consent is obtained (from the subject or a legal repr e-
sentative or family member) will be randomized. Calculation of the ICH score [Hemphill 2001; please refer to appendix 
III] is required prior to randomization. Administration of the study drug to eligible candidates will only be permitted a f-
ter completion of liver function tests and urine analysis , if not done upon presentation.
Participants should be reassessed immediately prior to the study drug administration to obtain a pre-treatment GCS 
and baseline NIHSS. Patients who exhibit significant clinical and neurological deterioration (i.e. develop fixed and dila t-
ed pupi[INVESTIGATOR_632810] ≤ 6) prior to administration of the first dose of the study drug should not receive the study 
drug, and their  participation in the study should  be terminated.    
To ensure that all eligible subjects presenting within 12h of ICH onset are enrolled in a timely fashion without delay: 1) 
enrollment and time from door (arrival- to-emergency room)- to-infusion will be monitored on an ongoing basis, and 
every attempt will be made to ensure that subjects are treated as soon as possible from symptom-onset; and 2) if e n-
rollment into the early (≤12h) window is disproportionately low, we will implement a strategy of forced recruitment 
whereby [CONTACT_632885] (>12- 24h) window (or maintain its overall ratio of ≤12h to >[ADDRESS_845049] 1:1) before subsequent enrollment 
into the later time window is permitted at this site.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_845050]’S BODY WEIGHT  
The subject’s body weight will be obtained by [CONTACT_6270] -report from the subject or his/her accompanying person to the ED, or 
estimated by [CONTACT_1963], if actual body weight cannot be determined during the acute phase of evaluation in 
order to prevent delays in administering the study drug.  However, it is expected that all subjects will have their actual  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845051] u-
al body weight.  
4.3.6 TREATMENT A LLOCATION AND RANDOMIZATION  
Once it is determined that a patient meets all the eligibility criteria, the investigator(s) will log on to the secure, study-
dedicated electronic database (WebDCUTM) to enter demographics and required randomization data. The database will 
generate a randomization code. The investigator will then provide the site’s pharmacy with the randomization code 
and subject weight. The pharmacist will retrieve the label with the corresponding randomization code from the Study 
Randomization Binder maintained separately in the pharmacy.  The pharmacist will prepare the study drug for blinded 
administration. The pharmacists will be specifically instructed not to reveal treatment assignment to the investigators 
and not to break the blind. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] I study, the reconstituted solution of DFO was colorless, and there were no 
specific treatment-related changes in laboratory tests including hematology, urine color, or adverse events to suggest 
that the active drug can be identified from placebo. The following additional measures will be taken to assure that the 
integrity of the blinding will remain intact: 1) An independent, unblinded statistician from the DCU, not involved in the 
operations of the study, will create the randomization algorithm; 2) Randomization codes will be numeric and will not 
contain any reference to the type or dose of treatment to be administered; and 3) The randomization binders will be 
kept in secured and locked cabinets in each pharmacy. There is no specific antidote to DFO. Therefore, unblinding is 
unnecessary in most cases. In cases of extreme emergency when the treating physicians request unblinding of trea t-
ment assignments for therapeutic purposes, the unblinding will only be revealed to the treating physicians but not the 
investigators. The treating physicians must be instructed not to reveal the blind to the subjects or study investigators. 
The study personnel (pharmacist) will be required to inform the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632811] 
24h in the event of unblinding. In cases where the treating physician is one of the study investigators, he/she also will be 
required not to reveal the identity of the study drug to other members of the study team, and not to perform subs e-
quent study-related outcome assessments.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
5.1 INTERVENTIONS, ADMINISTRATION, AND DURATION 
The active study drug (DFO) will be supplied in vials containing 2 gm of sterile, lyophilized, powdered deferoxamine 
mesylate. The drug will be reconstituted for injection, by [CONTACT_134708] 20 ml of sterile water, then the volume of the 
reconstituted drug required for a dosing of 32mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 6000 mg/day) will be calculated based on 
the subject’s body weight and added to normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) for administration by [CONTACT_16228] . The 
drug will be reconstituted immediately prior to use to ensure microbiological safety. The matching placebo will be an 
isotonic saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) . Subjects will receive weight-adjusted intravenous infusions of the study 
drug. The maximum daily dose will not exceed [ADDRESS_845052]’s weight . The study drug will be 
administered using an intravenous cannula, dedicated to drug infusion, inserted into an antecubital vein preferably in a 
non-paralyzed limb, and a variable speed infusion pump. Alternatively, a central line, with a port dedicated to the drug 
infusion, may be used. It is important to maintain a dedicated line for the study drug infusion because it may be inco m-
patible with other drugs. Applying warm compresses to the site of IV injection throughout each infusion period is 
strongly encouraged as a precaution to minimize the potential for local injection site reactions. The initial dose of the 
study drug must be administered within 12-24 hours (as appropriate) of ICH symptom onset.  Every effort should b e 
made to initiate drug administration in consenting subjects as soon as possible after their arrival to the ED. The infusion 
of the study drug must be administered daily during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] 3 consecutive days by [CONTACT_22671] a rate not to 
exceed 7.5 mg/kg/hour. The date and time of drug preparation and administration, as well as rate of infusion, will be 
recorded. Ideally, the IV infusions of the study drug should occur without any interruptions. However, it is possible that  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845053] 24 hours after completion of the infusions, in Neurological Intensive or Stroke Care Unit(s), staffed by 
[CONTACT_84639]-trained neurologists and nursing staff. Patients will be monitored for all adverse events from the time of study 
drug initiation until day-[ADDRESS_845054]; and, all new SAEs will be monitored until day- 90 or res o-
lution of the SAE. Continuing SAEs beyond day-90 will be monitored until day-180.   
The patients will be closely observed during the initial 30 minutes of the infusion for possible adverse effects, such as an 
allergic/anaphylactic reaction, symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension. If there are no adverse effects, the infusion 
will continue. If a patient’s neurological  status deteriorates during the infusion, the NIHSS score and GCS will be rea s-
sessed by a member of the stroke team/study staff. Significant neurological worsening will be defined as an increase in 
NIHSS score of ≥ 4 points or a decrease of ≥ 2 points in G CS, compared to pre-treatment baseline values, that cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_22714]. A change of this nature lasting >4 hours could lead to premature discontinuation of the drug 
infusion based on the judgment of the local primary investigator(s). Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and neurolo g-
ical functions will be assessed at least once every 4h during intravenous drug infusion. Daily urinary output checks will 
be carried out every day until the day following the last infusion. An unexplained drop of >20% in mean arterial pressure 
will trigger review by [CONTACT_632886]. Fluid support 
will be used to prevent or treat hypotension. In more severe cases, use of inotropic agents may be required.  
The skin at the infusion site will be examined at the same time points to assess for the presence and extent of local site 
reactions/irritation. If evidence of mild erythema/irritation or swelling emerges during the infusion, more frequent mo n-
itoring will be instituted depending on the severity and observed rate of change to ensure that the reaction does not 
progress further. The use of local anti-inflammatory agents may also be considered. In the event that local irritation 
continues to progress along with worsening edema, and development of pain or papular/vesicular eruption, the infusion 
will be terminated at that site and restarted in a different location. Close monitoring of the new infusion site, as well as 
the original site, will continue. If irritation develops at the new site or progresses at the original site, the infusion will be 
terminated and will not be re-started in this patient. In cases of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, the use of antihist a-
mines and steroids is often sufficient; ACLS airway management may be required in severe cases. Appropriate trea t-
ment and monitoring will proceed according to the standard clinical practice at each institution until the reaction has 
resolved. Routine physical and neurological examinations will be carried out on a daily basis during the infusions, and 
the NIHSS and GCS scores will be determined. Safety laboratories (Hematology; Coagulation; Serum chemistry; Kidney 
and liver functions; and urine analysis) will be performed on the day following the last infusion of the study drug. Labor-
atory studies that are abnormal or worsen from baseline will be repeated. The frequency of subsequent evaluation of 
safety laboratories will be determined by [CONTACT_632887] a patient- by-patient case. 
All patients must be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], including ARDS (based on 
Berlin criteria – see appendix VII). A diagnosis of ARDS will lead to premature discontinuation of the drug infusion. Any 
evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632812]-DCUTM within [ADDRESS_845055] once daily for all intubated patients (or more frequently in patients with changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_632813]) throughout day-7 or discharge and entered into Web-
DCUTM: 1) PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio; 2) Plateau and peak pressures; and 3) Chest X-ray results (when available). A CHEST X-RAY

5.3 HANDLING OF STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
5.3.1 S UPPLY , STORAGE , PREPARATION , AND DISPOSITION OF STUDY DRUG  
The active drug (DFO) will be purchased by [CONTACT_9092] (DHHS) from the manufa c-
turer and shipped to the Program Support Center, Supply Service Center, Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS-SSC), in Perry Point, MD. The DHHS-SSC will serve as the drug distribution center, purchase the study drug p e-
riodically during the trial, and resupply the sites as recruitment progresses . The research pharmacist at each clinical site 
will receive the study drug in shipments.     
The active study drug (DFO) will be supplied in vials containing 2 gm of sterile, lyophilized, powdered deferoxamine 
mesylate. The drug will be reconstituted for injection by [CONTACT_134708] 20 ml of sterile water, then the volume of the 
reconstituted drug required for a dosing of 32 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 6000 mg/day) will be calculated based on 
the subject’s body weight and added to normal saline ( 0.9% sodium chloride) in an IV bag to achieve a final concentr a-
tion of 7.5 mg per ml for IV administration. The infusion rate will not exceed 7.5 mg/kg/hour. The matching placebo will 
be an isotonic saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride). The drug will be reconstituted immediately prior to use to ensure 
microbiological safety. However, the reconstituted solution may be stored at room  temperature  for approximately 24h 
before use. In the phase I study, the reconstituted solution of DFO was colorless, and there were no specific treatment-
related changes in laboratory tests including iron, hematology, urine color, or adverse events to suggest that the active 
drug can be identified from placebo. 
The shelf half-life of the drug is [ADDRESS_845057] (15ºC-25ºC) away from direct light and heat. The 
drug should be stored in a secured and locked location.  The storage room temperature should be recorded at least dai-
ly, and a temperature log should be maintained.  Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be i m-
mediately communicated to the Project Manager and the PI.  The study drug affected by [CONTACT_632889].  Any materials remaining after each infusion should be discarded by [CONTACT_632890]. 
5.3.2 S TUDY DRUG TRACKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_632814]/her site, which will be carried out in a c-
cordance with ICH/GCP and individual clinical site’s Standard Operating Procedures.  Upon receipt of the study drug, 
the research pharmacist will inspect and count the study drug supply and confirm receipt of the study drug in the We b-
DCUTM study database.  The pharmacy at each clinical site also must maintain records of the amount of study drug r e-
ceived, dispensed to study subjects, and destroyed or returned at the end of the study. Drug accountability records and 
storage temperature logs will be inspected by [CONTACT_632891] a u-
thorities as well.  Study drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at each site during monitoring visits and at the end 
of the study.    
5.4     CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS 
Concomitant medications will be recorded during the study period from the time of study drug initiation until day-7 or 
discharge (whichever is earlier) . There are few restrictions on the use of concomitant medications for study  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
31 participants.  The use of prochloroperazine (compazine), a phenothiazine derivative, is not allowed before treatment, 
during treatment, or up to 72 hours after completion of the study drug infusion, since the combination of DFO and 
compazine can lead to impairment of consciousness [Blake, 1985].  Concurrent use of other experimental therapy is not 
allowed.  Vitamin C supplements will not be allowed in patients with heart failure during treatment with DFO.   
All standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_632815]. 
These include volume expansion with normal saline or crystalloids, vasopressors, antiedema agents such as steroids or 
mannitol, anti-hypertensives including diuretics, anti-convulsants, anti-arrhythmic agents and anti-emetics, except for 
phenothiazine derivatives.   
In order to minimize the variability in care and to assure consistency in management across sites, the general care of ICH 
patients should conform to the guidelines from the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association [Morgenstern, 2010], 
and the European Stroke Initiative Guidelines [Steiner, 2006].  Pertinent issues are detailed in Appendix II and II I. 
6 CLINICAL AND LABORATORY EVALUATIONS 
6.1 PATIENT EVALUATION AND DATA COLLECTION SCHEDULE 
All study data will be collected using Case Report Forms (CRFs) designed specifically for the study. Patient confidential i-
ty will be maintained throughout, as participants will only be identified on the CRFs by a unique study ID number.  P a-
tients’ identifying information and source  documents for the CRF data should be kept by [CONTACT_632892].  The data obtained will include: 1) Demographics; 2) Previous medical history; 3) Concomitant 
medications; 4) Vital signs; 5) Results of laboratory tests; 6) NIHSS and GCS scores; 7) ICH score; 8) mRS, SIS-16, and 
MoCA scores; 9) Adverse events; 10) Surgical and non-surgical treatments; and 11) Imaging findings, including chest x-
rays, and CT and MRI scans identifying the location of ICH, presence of IVH or hydrocephalus, and etiology of ICH (after 
completing diagnostic work-up).  
6.1.1 C LINICAL AND LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
The following assessments will be carried out throughout the 90-day study period: 
Upon screening  of potential study subjects: 1) Review of head CT and determination of the time of ICH onset or the 
time the patient was last known to be without presenting deficits; 2) Demographic data; 3) Medical history; 4) Review 
of medications; 5) General physical examination; 6) Neurological examination, including NIHSS and GCS; 7) Visual and 
auditory assessment (which includes assessments for cataracts, visual loss or field cut, disturbed color vision, hearing 
loss, and presence of tinnitus), whenever possible in awake patients; 8) Determination of pre-morbid mRS; 9); Review 
of admission laboratory tests - Hematology [hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count and platelet count] ; Coag u-
lation [partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio]; and serum albumin; and 10) Review of all incl u-
sion/exclusion criteria. A baseline ch est x-ray is required to rule out the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or 
pulmonary edema. A pregnancy test is required for all women of childbearing potential prior to enrollment into the 
study. Subjects in whom all eligibility criteria are met should be considered for enrollment, and those who agree to pa r-
ticipate via signed and dated informed consent should be enrolled.  
Participants should be reassessed immediately prior to the study drug administration to obtain a pre-treatment bas e-
line. The Pre-treatment baseline reassessments include:  1) Vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate; 2)  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
32 Neurological examination, including NIHSS and GCS to confirm stability of their neurological status and to obtain pre-
treatment baseline scores; and 3) Assessment for new adverse events since screening.   Patients who exhibit significant 
clinical or neurological deterioration (i.e. develop fixed di lated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_632810] ≤6) prior to administration of 
the first dose of the study drug should not receive the study drug, and their participation will be terminated .  
Administration of the study drug should only be permitted after obtaining pre-treatment blood sample for serum 
chemistry and glucose, hepatic function tests, and urine analysis (if not already done upon arrival to the ED). 
Subjects who receive the study drug(s) will be evaluated daily for the first 3 days (during study drug infusion while in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and on day-[ADDRESS_845058] on days 30±7 
and 90±7. Telephone interviews will be conducted on day 60±7 and 180±7.   
The following assessments should be performed after each daily infusion (every 24±6h) and through the day following 
completion of the last infusion: 1) General physical examination; 2) Visual and auditory assessments; 3) Neurological 
examination, including NIHSS and GCS; and 4) Vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate. A repeat head CT 
scan and blood samples for hematology, serum chemistry, renal and hepatic function tests, coagulation studies, and 
urine analysis should be obtained within 24±6h following the last infusion of the study drug. Vital signs (blood pressure 
and pulse) and neurological functions should be assessed at least once every 4h during intravenous drug infusions. Daily 
urinary output checks should be carried out every day until the day following the last infusion. In addition, the following 
data must be checked at least once daily for all intubated patients (or more frequently in patients with changes in re s-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_632816]) throughout day-7 or di s-
charge and entered into Web-DCUTM: 1) PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio; 2) Plateau and peak pressures; and 3) Chest X-ray results 
(when available). A chest x-ray is required if the PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio is <300.  
On day -7 or Discharge (whichever comes first),  the following assessments are done: mRS, NIHSS, GCS, MoCA and 
visual and auditory assessments.  
During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the NIHSS and GCS should be done any time a subject’s neurological status deteriorates, or whe n-
ever the investigator believes it is prudent to do an assessment. Laboratory assessments beyond those required for th e 
study should be done whenever clinically indicated.     
The Day -30 (±7) will be an in-person visit comprised of a general physical examination, visual and auditory asses s-
ments, review of SAEs, and assessments of NIHSS, SIS- 16, MoCA and mRS.  
The Day -60 (±7) assessments, which will be completed via telephone, will be comprised of a functional assessment to 
obtain a score on mRS and query for SAEs.  
The Day -90 (±7) visit will be an in-person visit comprised of a general physical examination, visual and auditory asses s-
ments, and assessments of NIHSS, MoCA, SIS- 16, and mRS. However, a telephone interview to obtain a score on mRS 
(the primary outcome measure) may be allowed on a case- by-case basis, after consultation with the PI, if the subject is 
unable to return for an in-person evaluation. 
The Day -180 (± 7) assessments, which will be completed via telephone, will be comprised of a functional assessment to 
obtain a score on mRS.  
A study staff member certified in NIHSS and mRS and experienced in administering GCS, SIS-16, and MoCA should perform 
the assessments at all time points. We require that all assessments at all time points be performed by [CONTACT_632893]  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845059]’s functional status (mRS and SIS -
16) can be obtained from a proxy if the subject is unable to provide the information. Please refer to Appendix V for details of
NIHSS, GCS, SIS-16, and MoCA scales.
Concomitant medications and non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_632817]. All adverse events (serious and non-serious) should be assessed until day-[ADDRESS_845060] confirming the presence of ICH is required to establish the diagnosis 
of ICH. The need for additional diagnostic tests, such as CTA, MRI/MRA, or a conventional angiogram to rule out se c-
ondary causes of ICH in suspected cases should be based on the judgment of the investigators according to the stan d-
ards of clinical practice at each participating institution and the guidelines from the ASA [Morgenstern 2010; refer to 
Appendix II]. The volume of ICH on admission scan must be determined by [CONTACT_632894]/2 
method ( please refer to Appendix IV for instructions)  before randomizing the subject in WebDCUTM. A repeat non-
enhanced brain CT scan should be obtained within 24±[ADDRESS_845061]  x-ray is required in intubated patients whenever 
the PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio is <300.

6.3         Blood Banking Repository Sub-Study 
The main study provides an opportunity to “bank” blood samples from the participants for future innovative ICH r e-
search, particularly if the    efforts to develop DFO as a therapy for ICH are successful. Future pharmacogenetic studies 
may be considered to help define other therapeutic targets and responders vs. non-responders to DFO therapy. We, 
therefore, plan to collect additional blood samples at baseline and after the last DFO infusion (approximately 30 ml) to 
be stored and analyzed in the future. Subjects’ participation in this blood -banking repository will be optional; they do 
not have to participate in the repository sub-study in order to participate initially or to continue their participation in the 
main study. The blood samples from all participating sites will be sent to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (The 
Coordinating Center) by [CONTACT_9338]. All samples will be stripped of identifiers and randomly assigned a unique code 
number. The key linking code numbers and identifying information will be kept in a secure location accessible only to 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632818], on a password protected network drive. All samples will be

terms of either severity or frequency.  When evaluating possible adverse events, an assessment should be made regar d-
ing its seriousness, severity and temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug.  An adverse event is co n-
sidered serious if it is life-threatening, prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requires re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in significant disabi l-
ity, leads to death, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other listed outcomes.  An asses s-
ment should be made regarding the seriousness, severity and relationship to the administration of the study medic a-
tion as well as to the ICH.  The following factors should be considered when evaluating possible adverse events: 1) the 
temporal sequence from drug administration; 2) patient's response after drug discontinuation or re-introduction; and 3) 
severity of the event.  The investigators, on the basis of their clinical judgment and guided by [CONTACT_632896], 
should determine the relationship of an adverse event to the study drug(s) as: definitely related, i.e. following in a re a-
sonable temporal sequence, known to be a complication of DFO, and having no other explanation; probably related, i.e. 
following i n a reasonable temporal sequence and not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other ther a-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; possibly related , i.e. could have been explained by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_632821]’s clinical state; or unlikely or  not r e-
lated.  The severity of adverse events should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or fatal.  
All adverse events or complications will be entered into WebDCUTM and assigned to a system-organ class and preferred 
term using the MedDRA coding dictionary. Each subject must be monitored closely throughout his/her hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632822] (SAEs). All adverse events (serious and non-serious) should be assessed until day-7 or di s-
charge, whichever occurs earlier, and serious adverse events until day- 90 or withdrawal of consent, whichever is earlier . 
7.2     POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY INTERVENTION  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845066] scan imaging studies, and injections of the 
study medication(s). There are no additional risks for any of these procedures other than those present in any routine 
clinical situation, especially for blood draws and CT scans. Patients may experience some temporary discomfort, brui s-
ing, or, rarely, infection or the formation of a small clot or swelling at the site of the needle puncture in the process of 
drawing blood or starting the intravenous drip. The condition of ICH, in itself, carries a high risk for secondary complic a-
tions including serious life-threatening adverse events, and even death, whether or not the active study drug (DFO) is 
used. Recent studies indicate that approximately 40% of patients with ICH have a serious adverse event during hosp i-
talization, of which approximately 26% can be fatal [Haley, 2005; Mayer 2005; Mayer 2006; Lyden 2007].  
DFO has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than [ADDRESS_845067] observed adverse events in our Phase I study in ICH patients were injection site reaction (irritation, pain, er y-
thema, infiltration) and a modest decrease in blood pressure, which did not require any medical intervention. One su b-
ject developed visual hallucination during IV infusion of DFO. Almost all of these adverse events were mild, self-limited, 
did not require specific treatment, and resolved spontaneously. There were no deaths or serious adverse events related 
to DFO use. There were 2 cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], both of which occurred in the 62mg/kg/day dose-tier. They were 
thought to be related to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499], and unrelated to the study drug. However, a recent expert review found 
that one of these cases was an undiagnosed case of ARDS, and concurred that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3333] a plausible explanation 
for it.   
In the first part o f phase II investigation of DFO in ICH ( HI-DEF  trial, where subjects were treated with a continuous inf u-
sion of DFO at 62 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days), [ADDRESS_845068] 42 participants. A 
detailed expert review of reported cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632823] 2 more cases of undia g-
nosed ARDS.  Overall, 6/7 of the ARDS cases in HI-DEF were in the DFO treatment arm ; 3 were fatal and the cause of 
death was ARDS-related in 2/3 cases. The expert who was blin ded to treatment assignment identified a plausible cause 
for ARDS, other than the study drug or ICH itself, in 4/7 ARDS cases, while no other explanation, other than the study 
drug or ICH, was apparent for the remaining 3 cases. Although the overall rate of ARDS was in line with published r e-
ports in ICH patients [Elmer 2013], the imbalance in the frequency of ARDS between the DFO- and placebo-treated 
groups raised concerns that the pulmonary toxicity of the drug was likely. There were no other safety concerns. A 
MedWatch report was filed with the FDA and Health Canada for an AE of hypophosphatemia that was judged to be s e-
rious (potentially life-threatening), unexpected, and possibly related to the study drug. Overall, hypophosphatemia of 
varying severity was reported in 3 subjects in HI-DEF; [ADDRESS_845069] before participating in the study.  
7.3   PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Aseptic and sterile techniques should be used during blood draws, which shou ld be performed by [CONTACT_632897] t-
omists. Application of warm compresses to the site of IV infusion throughout the infusion period is advised to minimize 
the potential for injection site irritation. In order to maximize safety during this study, we are using a slow infusion rate 
of < 7.5 mg/kg/hour and are limit ing the maximal dose that any subject can receive to [ADDRESS_845070] be carefully monitored throughout their participation in the study as detailed above. Any medical complications

 05/15/[ADDRESS_845071] clinical practice at participating institutions. There is no 
specific antidote to DFO. General symptomatic and supportive measures should be applied. 
Subjects should be admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care or Stroke Unit, undergo repeated clinical (neurological 
and general physical examinations) and laboratory evaluations at regular intervals throughout their participation in the 
study for safety monitoring, and receive standard medical management for ICH based on the American Stroke Associ a-
tion Guidelines [Morgenstern 2010].  Pertinent issues, including blood pressure management, are detailed in the a p-
pendix II and III. Laboratory studies that are abnormal or worsen from baseline should be repeated.   
It is important that investigators ensure maintenance of intravascular volume prior to administration of the drug inf u-
sions, especially in hypovolemic patients, to minimize DFO-induced hypotension; and to carefully observe the subjects 
during the initial 30 minutes of the intravenous infusion for possible adverse effects, such as an allergic/anaphylactic 
reaction, arrhythmias, or hypotension.  If there are no adverse effects, the infusion should continue.  All patients should 
be kept hydrated and, if necessary, fluid support should be used to prevent or treat hypotension. In more severe cases, 
use of inotropic agents may be required.  
The skin at the site of IV infusion must be carefully inspected periodically for signs of irritation, induration, or inflamm a-
tion during physical examinations, coincident with the times of all assessments of vital signs, during the infusion of the 
drug and for [ADDRESS_845072] follow the fo l-
lowing guidelines by [CONTACT_632888] [ http://www.ardsnet.org/system/ 
files/Ventilator%20Protocol%20Card.pdf ]– please refer to appendix VI:  Ventilator settings – 1) Tidal volume (V T)= ≤8 
cc/kg PBW (predicted body weight); 2) Plateau Pressure (P plat) <30 cm H 2O; 3) Peak Pressure (P peak) <50 cm H 2O; and 4) 
Positive End-Expi[INVESTIGATOR_13955] (PEEP): at least [ADDRESS_845073] also implement a Ventilator Associa t-
ed Pneumonia prevention protocol  – 1) Head of bed elevation at least 30 degrees or greater; and 2) Regular clorhex i-
dine mouth wash and oral care. In addition, a conservative fluid management strategy that aims to minimize or elim i-
nate positive fluid balance and cautions against indiscriminate use of blood transfusion unless hemoglobin concentr a-
tion drops below 7 g/dL is recommended. All patients must be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of respir a-
tory compromise, including ARDS (based on Berlin criteria – see appendix VII). A co nfirmed diagnosis of ARDS should 
lead to premature discontinuation of the drug infusion. Appropriate treatment and monitoring, including the use of i n-
vasive mechanical ventilation, low tidal volume, permissive hypercapnea, or high PEEP, should proceed according to 
the standard clinical practice at each institution. In patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], strategies that decrease oxygen 
utilization, such as antipyretics to control fever and sedatives to control agitation; and appropriate use of neuromusc u-
lar blockade when asynchrony with the ventilator persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_632824].   
Infections with Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotubeculosis have been reported in DFO-treated patients. Although 
these are unlikely to occur in patients without significant systemic iron overload, appropriate bacteriological tests 
should be performed, and suitable antibiotic coverage for Yersinia should be instituted if a patient in the study develops 
fever accompanied by [CONTACT_632898], abdominal pain, or pharyngitis. Appropriate treatment and monitoring should 
proceed according to the standard clinical practice at each institution.  
7.4 CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATIO N 
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
38 The investigators may terminate the study drug infusion if, in their judgment, its continued administration poses harm 
to the patient’s medical condition.  The only pre-established criteria for premature discontinuation of the study drug 
are: 1) severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis; 2) worsening of renal functions, defined as serum creatinine >2 mg/dl on 
2 repeated measures 8 hours apart ; 3) development of ARDS based on Berlin criteria/definition (see appendix VII); or 4) 
if the patient or his proxy voluntarily withdraws consent. Subjects whose study drug is discontinued but who do not 
withdraw consent should still be followed for 180 days. 
7.5 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
In order to ensure prompt reporting of adverse events, all adverse events (as well as all related study data) must be e n-
tered into the WebDCUTM within five working days following the completion of the Baseline, Treatment, and D ay-7 or 
discharge (whichever occurs first) trial phases . All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported on the WebDCUTM 
within [ADDRESS_845074] being made aware of its occurrence . The 24-hour reporting requirement for 
SAEs applies to all study phases.   The investigators are required to provide relevant information, including description 
of the adverse event, date/time of onset and resolution, severity and seriousness, action taken, and suspected relatio n-
ship to the study drug. Similarly, all adverse events of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], whether serious or not, must be repor t-
ed in WebDCUTM and the relevant CRF completed within [ADDRESS_845075] Manager (PM), the independent MSMs, and appropriate members of the Executive Committee 
(EC). The MSMs will conduct an independent review of each of these events to determine its relatedness to the study 
drug along with other elements, and to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ARDS in cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] . 
Within 72 hours of receipt of these events for review, the MSMs will enter into the trial’s database their opi[INVESTIGATOR_632825] d-
ing whether the adverse event is, in fact, serious, and if it is unexpected and related to the study drug. If the MSMs b e-
lieve all three elements are present in the SAE, an expedited safety report (MedWatch) will be filed with the FDA within 
the stipulated regulatory guidelines: for fatal or life-threatening SAEs, no l ater than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s 
initial receipt of information, and for SAEs outside those categories, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor 
determines that the event requires expedited reporting (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)). If the study site investigator(s) and the 
MSMs are not in agreement on these issues and fail to resolve their disagreement after direct communication, the opi n-
ion of the MSMs will be considered as the final adjudication. When a MedWatch Report is filed with the FDA, a copy of 
the MedWatch Report (or a link to a secure file in the trial database) will be sent to the DSMB through the NINDS lia i-
son. 
Each clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_632826] a MedWatch Report has been 
filed with FDA. The email notification will contain instructions for accessing the report. It is the responsibility of each 
clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_632827]/her IRB in compliance with their institution’s local requirements. After the 
submission of the initial MedWatch Report, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632828] i-
ble for obtaining follow-up information about the event and reporting it in the WebDCUTM. 
7.6 MONITORING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
Two independent Medical Safety Monitor (MSMs), appointed in consultation with the NINDS program director, will 
monitor the study with regard to safety on an ongoing basis to identify any safety concerns. The MSMs will review all 
cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632829], and 
to ascertain the diagnosis of ARDS in cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]. They will communicate with the investigators  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845076] 7 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or until di s-
charge, whichever is earlier).  Should such monitoring uncover issues that may threaten subject safety (e.g. 
unexpectedly high rate of adverse events), the study statistician and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a report to be 
submitted to the DSMB for their review and further actions to be taken, if any.  
Two statistical reports will be generated semiannually (unless requested at a more frequent interval by [CONTACT_632899]) – an open report to be distributed to the Executive Committee and MSMs, and a closed report to be distributed 
only to the NINDS-appointed DSMB.  Each semi-annual report will provide cumulative summary statistics on enrol l-
ment, subject status in the study, baseline characteristics, protocol violations, safety data (including a summary of the 
most frequent and most serious adverse events, a summary of all MedWatch Reports, and a listing of all subjects who 
were terminated from the study and the reason for termination) , and data management/quality information. The st a-
tistics will be provided for the overall study. For the closed report only, the statistics will also be provided by [CONTACT_632900] (A vs. B). If the DSMB wishes to be completely unblinded for these reports, a sealed identific a-
tion envelope will be provided to the NINDS DSMB liaison; this envelope can be opened at the discretion of the DSMB. 
An annual report will be submitted to the FDA and Health Canada. 
7.[ADDRESS_845077] 40 subjects; 10 at any 
time during the recruitment of subjects 41-80; 12 at any time during the recruitment of patients 81-120; or if the diffe r-
ence in the number of confirmed ARDS cases between the groups is statistically significant after 40, 80, or [ADDRESS_845078] completed the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632830] a Pocock-adjusted, one-sided, 0.05 alpha level. This one-sided hypot h-
esis is consistent with our concern for patient safety, wherein early termination is considered only if ARDS incidence is 
higher on the DFO arm than on the control arm.  
These analyses will be based on the occurrence of confirmed ARDS cases (according to the Berlin criteria) thought to be 
at least possibly related to study drug. The ARDS cases will be reviewed on an ongoing basis throughout the trial by [CONTACT_632901] (who will adjudicate all cases together to provide a consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_632831], severity, and possible 
plausible causes other than the study drug). . The DSMB will be notified of each individual ARDS occurrence upon co n-
firmation by [CONTACT_632902], per their request.   Given that a common definition for the diagnosis of ARDS will be used, we 
do not anticipate much discrepancy between the site’s assessment and the MSM’ s assessment. However, in the event 
of disagreement, the MSM’s assessment will be used.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
A combination of minimization and biased coin methodologies will be used to randomize participants to either DFO or 
placebo [Pocock 1975; Taves 1974]. The minimization method aims to control imbalance in the treatment groups with 
respect to pre-specified baseline characteristics; the biased coin approach is adopted to avoid deterministic assig n-
ment. Throughout the trial, the probability of treatment assignment will take into account the imbalance associated  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
40 with clinical site, baseline ICH score, OTT , baseline ICH volume, baseline NIHSS score, and concurrent use of anticoag u-
lants at the time of ICH onset .  
8.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS AND DATA ANALYSIS 
8.2.1 CLINICAL ENDPOINTS   
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the mRS, dichotomized to define good functional outcome as mRS score of 0-
2 at 90 days. At the conclusion of the study, the proportion of DFO-treated subjects with a good outcome will be co m-
pared to the placebo proportion in a futility analysis. The primary futility hypothesis is tested via generalized linear 
model relating the probability of a good outcome to the treatment. Adjustment for OTT, ICH score, baseline ICH 
volume, NIHSS score, and anticoagulant use are included in the model to obtain proper significance due to the inclusion 
of these variables in the randomization scheme. The binomial distribution for Y, with the identity link, is used to derive 
an estimate of the adjusted risk difference for good outcome. The primary futility hypothesis, H 0: (π DFO-πplacebo ) ≥0.12, 
will be tested at one-sided alpha (the probability that an effective intervention will be called ineffective, or futile) 0.10. 
The corresponding alternative hypothesis,  H A: (π DFO-πplacebo ) <0.12, defines futility as a treatment effect less than 
absolute 12% in favor of DFO. The futility analysis will be conducted using a one-sided 90% upper confidence bound on 
the risk difference, which is consistent with the one-sided alternative hypothesis and stated level of significance. To 
declare futility, the entire interval must lie below the value 0.12, indicating that the true difference in risk of good 
outcome is less than 0.12 with 90% confidence. Under this design, a significant result would suggest that it would be 
futile to move DFO forward to Phase III testing.  
As secondary analyses of the primary outcome, the presence of a differential treatment effect in the OTT windows will 
be explored. The generalized linear model described above for the primary analysis will be expanded to include an 
interaction between treatment and OTT window. While the Trial will be underpowered to definitively address this 
question, the magnitude of the treatment effect, and corresponding confidence interval, will be estimated for each 
time window. A dichotomized analysis considering the proportion of DFO- and placebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-[ADDRESS_845079] <13% 
in favor of DFO. We will also perform similar analyses at 180 days and ordinal analysis across all mRS scores as secon d-
ary outcome measures. 
8.2.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS:  
All adverse events will be assessed until day-7 or discharge (whichever is earlier), and SAEs until day- 90. Mortality (all 
causes and ICH-related) will be assessed until the end of the study (day-180). Safety endpoints of particular interest i n-
clude all DFO- related adverse events until day-7 or discharge (whichever is earlier), all SAEs through day-90, and deaths 
(all causes and ICH-related) through day-[ADDRESS_845080]  (AEOSI) for safety surveillance during this 
study: 1) Anaphylaxis (at any time point during study drug infusion); 2) Hypotension (defined as a decrease in blood 
pressure requiring medical intervention at any time point during drug infusion that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_632903] s-
es); 3) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_632832]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392166] (day-7 or discharge, whichever is earlier); and 
4) Development of new and unexplained visual or auditory changes after initiating treatment with the study drug.
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845081] infusion. We anticipate no missing safety 
data regarding adverse events, since patients will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632833]-7 or discharge 
(whichever is earlier). The cumulative incidences of each AEOSI, as well as mortality, will be compared via 95% conf i-
dence intervals.  Mortality will also be assessed via the log rank test for comparing survival curves. 
Analysis of the safety data regarding the occurrence of ARDS will be carried out continuously throughout the trial by 
[CONTACT_632904], who will notify the EC and DSMB if recruitment must be stopped.   The DSMB will be 
notified of each individual ARDS occurrence upon confirmation by [CONTACT_632902], per their request.Analysis of other safety 
data by [CONTACT_632905] (or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_4318]). If any of these analyses r e-
veal serious emerging concerns, the EC, in consultation with the DSMB, may implement modifications to assure safety 
as necessary . Apparent, consistent and persistent evidence of net harm that tends to overwhelm any benefit may allow 
for premature termination of the study. 
8.3 STUDY SAMPLES 
ALL analyses will involve data from two samples: 
1- Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT): Outcome data from all subjects who are randomized and in whom the study
infusion begins, even if it is discontinued prematurely, will be analyzed. Classically, ITT analysis is used in Phase III trials
and includes all subjects randomized, regardless of whether they receive the treatment or not. However, in order to
evaluate the efficacy of DFO as administered, randomized subjects in whom the study infusion is never initiated will be
excluded from the primary analysis. As a sensitivity analysis, the futility hypothesis will also be assessed according to
the ITT principle. All subjects randomized will be included and considered in the treatment group to which he/she was
randomized, regardless of the treatment actually received. The outcomes for subjects in whom treatment is never init i-
ated will be imputed based on available baseline data.
Safety analysis will involve data from all patients in whom study infusion begins, even if it is discontinued prematurely 
(i.e. the mITT sample). 
2- Per-protocol sample, i.e. all subjects who have at least one post-treatment assessment and no major protocol viol a-
tions that affect the analysis. The Executive Commit tee (EC) will adjudicate major protocol violations and patients’ i n-
clusion in the per-protocol population before unblinding. Analyses based on the per-protocol sample will be supportive
in nature.
8.4 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION 
The sample size is calculated to achieve 80% power for the futility analysis described above using a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.10. It is anticipated that approximately 28% of control subjects will have mRS 0-2 at 3 months; this is based on 
the weighted average of the good outcome proportions reported in the placebo-treated subjects of the Factor VII, 
FAST, GAIN, and CHANT trials [Haley 2005; Lyden 2007 ; Mayer 2005-2008]. If the true good outcome proportions in 
the DFO and placebo arms are identical (π tx=0.28, πctrl=0.28, a truly futile situation), 254 subjects (127 in each arm) are 
required to test the futility hypothesis with 80% power. This calculation takes into account the 0.12 null value specified 
in the futility hypothesis [Chow, 2003]. The primary analysis will be conducted according to a modified Intent- to-Treat 
(ITT) principle, wherein subjects in whom the study drug infusion is not initiated will be excluded from the analysis.  
Therefore, the final sample size was inflated by a factor of 1. 11 (Friedman, Furberg, and DeMets) to account for dilution 
of the treatment effect associated with a conservative drop-out rate of 5% (due to loss- to-follow-up (LTFU) and  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
42 withdrawal of consent), and an additional factor of 1.04 to account for randomized subjects in whom the study drug is 
not initiated.  Therefore, the final sample size is 294 subjects.  
8.5 LOSS- TO-FOLLOW-UP AND MISSING DATA  
Extensive efforts will be made to keep missing data, particularly the primary outcome (mRS at 90 days), to a minimum, 
and to ensure near complete follow-up. Missing primary outcome data will be imputed via standard multiple  
imputation (MI) methods (i.e. via logistic regression model predicting outcome based on pertinent baseline and trea t-
ment data). As a sensitivity assessment, we will use the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach, wherein 
the last available score will be carried forward for missing day [ADDRESS_845082] to reach similar conclusions via these imputation methods, particularly for minimal missing data (<5%). 
9 STUDY MONITORING 
9.1  MONITORING FOR STUDY PROGRESS AND RECRUITMENT  
The Executive Committee will monitor recruitment progress at each site on a monthly basis to address individual site 
issues and concerns. To minimize unnecessary delays in enrolling eligible subjects into the early time window (≤12h 
from ICH onset), we will monitor the time-from-door- to-infusion on an ongoing basis and make every effort to ensure 
eligible subjects are enrolled as quickly as possible after ED arrival. If we observe that enrollment into the early (≤12h) 
time window is disproportionately low compared to the >12-24h window, we will implement a strategy of forced r e-
cruitment whereby [CONTACT_632906] (>12- 24h) window (or maintain its overall ratio of ≤1 2h to >12-24h to at least 1:1) before subsequent e n-
rollment into the later time window is permitted by [CONTACT_779]. If frequent delays are observed at a particular site, the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632834]. The Executive Committee additionally may 
require that the infusion of the study drug must be started within a certain time window following the subject’s arrival 
to the emergency room, at a particular site or across all sites, if necessary.  
The Executive Committee will also monitor accrual of subjects on an ongoing basis throughout the study, and will co n-
duct formal reviews of the overall recruitment across all sites and site- by-site on a yearly basis (or at more frequent i n-
tervals, if needed).  For sites whose recruitment is less than 75% of their expected rate (approximately 4-6 subjects per 
year), the local principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632835]/her own analysis of the barriers to recruitment at 
his/her site and corrective actions and plans. The “low” enrolling sites will be monitored closely at 3 -month intervals to 
determine if further corrective actions or dismissal from the trial are warranted. 
       9 .2  QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND DATA CONTROL 
The Data Coordination Unit (DCU) in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the Medical University of South 
Carolina (MUSC) serves as the Statistics and Data Management Center (SDMC) for the trial, coordinating all statistical, 
data and project management responsibilities. The study data will be managed (including data queries) by [CONTACT_632907]™ system. This user -friendly web-based database system, developed and validated by [CONTACT_133065], 
will be used for regulatory document management, subject randomization, data entry, data validation, project progress 
monitoring, subject tracking, user customizable report generation and secure data transfer. In addition to the study d a-
tabase, the SDMC will provide the clinical site staff access (via password) to a standard set of web-enabled tools, inclu d-
ing subject visit calendar, subject accrual status, case report form completion status, and outstanding DCR status pe r-
taining to their respective clinical sites. Furthermore, all approved study materials, such as the protocol, informed co n-
sent template and manual of procedures, will be housed on the website to ensure that the clinical sites always have a c-
cess to the most current trial documents.  
 IDEF  
 05/15/2014 
43 Data should be independently entered by [CONTACT_632908] k-
ing days following the completion of any trial phase – Baseline, Treatment, day-7 or discharge (whichever occurs first), 
Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, and Month 6. Enrollment data, however, must be entered into the WebDCU database b e-
fore the subject can be randomized. The SAE and adverse events of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632836] U within 24 hours of the site staff’s first awareness of the event.  It is critically important to the effective and  
efficient conduct of the study that ALL data be entered in a timely manner. An electronic copy of the CRFs will be made 
available to the clinical sites prior to initiation of the study to be used as worksheets to capture the required data for th e 
study. The SDMC staff will perform range verification, consistency checks, and quality assurance on the data. The staff 
at the SDMC will contact [CONTACT_632909]. They will maintain direct contact [CONTACT_632910]. 
Experienced clinical research monitors will be contracted through the SDMC to perform on site source data verification 
(SDV) during the study. The first visit will take place after enrollment of the first subject by [CONTACT_632911] 100% of the data. For subsequent subjects, a checklist of key outcome and safety data 
variables requiring SDV will be developed based on the trial’s endpoints.  The checklist ensures that a target of no less 
than 40% of the clinical data submitted to the Hi-Def database are verified against source documents at the perfo r-
mance sites prior to finalization of the database. Of the data on the checklist, the safety and efficacy variables repr e-
sent approximately half of the data to be verified. The remaining half of source monitored data include: 100% of deaths 
and 100% of serious adverse events and source data reviews based on the per-patient evaluation of safety parameters 
defined in the protocol . All informed consent and HIPAA documents will be verified by [CONTACT_632912]. 
Subsequent visits to each site will depend on the number of patients recruited at the site as well as other issues. Mon i-
toring will also involve, as appropriate, correspondence and telephone contacts. In addition to data verification, the 
monitor will evaluate drug accountability, site facilities, and regulatory documents. The CRFs and corresponding source 
documents should be made available to the study monitor at each site visit.  It is also expected that the PI, or a desi g-
nated member of the research staff, will be available during the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any qu e-
ries.  The close out monitoring visit will take place after the study is completed. 
The SDMC will prepare, at selected intervals, a summary report of screened and enrolled patients, completeness and 
quality of CRF data, status of enrolled patients, a listing of SAEs, and a table of event-specific cumulative rates. The E x-
ecutive Committee and the independent Medical Safety Monitors will review these reports and monitor the study pe r-
formance (recruitment, compliance, protocol violations, and follow up) and safety data on an ongoing basis. The study 
statistician will also generate a comprehensive statistical report bi-annually to the DSMB, unless requested at more fr e-
quent intervals.   
       9.3  ONGOING SAFETY MONITORING DURING THE STU DY   
Two independent Medical Safety Monitors (MSMs), appointed in consultation with the NINDS program director, will 
monitor the study with regard to safety on an ongoing basis to identify any safety concerns. As mentioned above in 
section 7.6, the MSMs will review all SAEs and cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632837], and will communicate with the investigators for any questions or clarifications regarding 
an event. Periodically throughout the study, the EC and the M SMs will review reports on the incidence rates of all 
reported adverse events, whether serious or not, with particular attention to SAEs, ARDS, and mortality during the first 
7 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or until discharge, whichever is earlier).  Should such monitoring uncover issues that may 
threaten subject safety (e.g. an unexpectedly high rate of adverse events), the study statistician and principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a report to be submitted to the DSMB for their review and further actions to be taken, if any.  
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845083] be stopped (please refer to section 
7.7 for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]).   The DSMB will be notified of each individual ARDS occurrence upon confirmation by [CONTACT_632901], per their request.Analysis of the overall safety data by [CONTACT_632913] i-
al. The first analysis is planned after the first [ADDRESS_845084] semiannually (unless requested at more frequent intervals by [CONTACT_632914]). Two statistical reports will be generated – an open report to be distributed to the Executive Committee and 
MSM, and a closed report to be distributed only to the NINDS-appointed DSMB.  Each semi-annual report will provide 
cumulative summary statistics on enrollment, subject status in the study, baseline characteristics, protocol violations, 
safety data (including a summary of the most frequent and most serious adverse events, a summary of all MedWatch 
reports, and a listing of all subjects who were terminated from the study due to adverse events, whether or not study 
drug-related), and data management/quality information. The statistics will be provided for the overall study. For the 
closed report only, the statistics will also be provided by [CONTACT_632915] (A vs. B). If the DSMB wishes 
to be completely unblinded for these reports, a sealed identification envelope will be provided to the NINDS DSMB lia i-
son; this envelope can be opened at the discretion of the DSMB. An annual report will be submitted to the FDA. 
[ADDRESS_845085] OF THE STUDY 
This study will be conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki, and in compliance with the protocol, applicable 
regulatory requirements, and GCP/ICH guidelines (please refer to appendix VI II).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_632838]-up of the patients throughout their participation in the study.  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_632839], he/she will leave instructions for other members of the study staff and a telephone number where he/she 
can be reached, if needed.   
10.[ADDRESS_845086] (IRB) REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT 
This protocol, the ICF, and any subsequent modifications must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_632916]. A signed and dated ICF must be obtained from the subject, his/her legal representative, or 
family member as defined in 21CFR50.3(m).  The ICF must also be signed and dated by a member of the study staff 
qualified to be delegated the authority to obtain informed consent, and a witness (if required by [CONTACT_1036]).  A copy 
of the ICF must be given to the subject, his/her legal representative or family member and the consent process must be 
documented in the subject’s medical record.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_18970] -Investigator is responsible for ensuring that i n-
formed consent is obtained from each patient, his/her legal representative, or family member prior to conducting any 
study-related activities.  
No deviations from or changes to the study protocol should be initiated except when necessary to eliminate immediate 
hazard to the patient.  However, the IRB and PI [INVESTIGATOR_632840].  It is the study 
site PI’s responsibility to report SAEs occurring during the study and MedWatch/Safety Report to their IRB, as required 
and as soon as possible.       
10.[ADDRESS_845087] (HIPAA). All records re 
 IDEF  
 05/15/[ADDRESS_845088] access to these records. Personal 
medical information, however, always will be treated as strictly confidential. All SDMC personnel are certified by [CONTACT_632917] (OHRP) of Human Research Subjects course, or other training 
courses acceptable to the NIH OHRP. 
In order to maintain the confidentiality of subjects who elect to participate in the blood bank repository, as well: 1) the 
results of any genetic analyses performed on samples collected from this repository will not appear in the medical 
records and will not be released to the subjects or their healthcare providers; 2) the samples will be coded and the key 
will be kept in a separate locked file; and 3) in the event of future second or third party use of the samples, all codes wil l 
be removed so that there will be no method by [CONTACT_632918]. 
10.4 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
The DSMB , appointed by [CONTACT_632919], will be responsible for the 
oversight of safety of trial participants, review of the safety reports, requesting additional data/information (if 
necessary), and advising the NINDS regarding continuation/ discontinuation of the study. The study may be modified or 
discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_194304], the FDA, or the Executive Committee to ensure that research subjects are 
protected. All ARDS cases will monitored continuously throughout the trial by [CONTACT_632904], who will 
notify the EC and DSMB if recruitment must be stopped (please refer to section 7.7 for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]).  The DSMB 
will be notified of each individual ARDS occurrence upon confirmation by [CONTACT_632902], per their request. Analysis of the 
overall safety data by [CONTACT_632920]. The first analysis is planned after the 
first [ADDRESS_845089] completed the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632841] (day-7 or discharge, whichever is earlier). The DSMB 
will meet to review the accumulated safety data, with particular attention to mortality, SAEs, and adverse events of 
special interest (AEOSI) including ARDS, from initiation of treatment to day-7 or discharge (whichever occurs first) to 
ensure that there are no emerging safety concerns. Unblinding of treatment assignments will only be allowed by [CONTACT_632921], if felt necessary, but the unblinded data will be confidentially maintained within the DSMB. Enrol l-
ment will continue with the recommendation of the DSMB, including necessary modifications, if needed, to address 
any safety concerns early on.  
After this meeting, the DSMB will regularly meet at least once approximately every 6 months or at more frequent 
intervals if needed to review recruitment and safety data. Analyses of the safety data will be carried out on an ongoing 
basis throughout the trial, as mentioned above. All AEOSIs, all SAEs, deaths, and adverse events will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_632922]. There will be no limit on the number and timing of analyses aimed at guaranteeing 
the safety of the patients.  An apparent, consistent and persistent evidence of net harm that tends to overwhelm any 
benefit may allow for premature termination of the study. Please refer to section 7.7 from the pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_632842]. 
10.5 STUDY MODIFICATION/DISCONTINUATION 
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_194304], the OHRP, the FDA, or a study site IRB (but only 
for that individual study site) as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected.

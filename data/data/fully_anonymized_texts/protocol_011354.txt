Protocol
Objectives
Overall objectives
The central hypothesis is that immersive virtual reality opi[INVESTIGATOR_836997]-person trainings at libraries.
Background
Since 2000, the [LOCATION_002] has experienced a 200% increase in the rates of deaths by [CONTACT_837014][INVESTIGATOR_2438], including opi[INVESTIGATOR_836998]. Since 2010, deaths from heroin overdose 
have more than tripled. In response to this epi[INVESTIGATOR_836999], the state of 
Pennsylvania, along with more than [ADDRESS_1161905] enacted standing orders of 
Naloxone (Narcan®), a fast acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_174499]. This means that Naloxone, which has been shown 
to prevent death by [CONTACT_837015][INVESTIGATOR_75178], is available for anyone, without a visit with a healthcare 
provider, to request and ﬁll a prescription at local pharmacies. As the opi[INVESTIGATOR_837000], there is an urgent need to prepare individuals to be competent actors in cases of opi[INVESTIGATOR_837001]. Providing access to optimal education on naloxone administration is an important 
intervention in the effort to reduce deaths by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_46211]. Library patrons are uniquely positioned 
to reduce preventable overdose deaths in their communities if properly trained to know when and how 
to respond. Penn researchers recently developed a nurse led, evidence-based 9 minute virtual reality 
(VR) naloxone administration educational training. Preliminary results indicate that healthcare 
profession students participating in VR training at Penn preformed just as well as those who received in 
person high-tech, high-cost simulation training in regard to their knowledge and attitudes about 
administering naloxone. Compared to in-person trainings, VR offers an engaging informative naloxone 
training that requires less manpower and has fewer geographic or time constraints. Assuring optimal 
education to these key personnel is an important intervention in the ﬁght to reduce deaths by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_46229]. In September 2019, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health will offer "Narcan Handout 
Days" at libraries across the city. Health Department staff are present at libraries, sitting at display 
booths providing training materials and free naloxone kits to library patrons interested in learning more 
about how to help address the public health crisis. We want to leverage this unique opportunity 
occurring in September to evaluate the use of virtual reality to provide comprehensive opi[INVESTIGATOR_362703].
Study Design
Design
This study will utilize a cluster-randomized trial design. Entire libraries will be randomized to either 
offer community members the virtual reality training or the standard educational offerings (e.g. 
handouts, online videos). V olunteers will be asked to complete the brief, anonymous, and validated 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_837002] & Opi[INVESTIGATOR_837003] (pretest) and then again immediately after (posttest). Neither participants nor investigators 
will be blinded. Library patrons who do not participate in the study will be offered current standard 
training materials. Regardless of the library's randomization, to either virtual reality or standard 
training, all patrons completing pre and post test surveys will have the opportunity to view the virtual 
reality training or other public health department materials.
Study duration
The new project dates of the proposed study are September 2019-August 2020. This will enable 
enrollment to occur throughout September at "Naloxone Handout Days" as well as at once monthly 
trainings offered by [CONTACT_837016].
Page 7 of 11Characteristics of the Study Population
Target population
Our target population includes library patrons voluntarily attending the department of public health's 
"naloxone handout days" and monthly educational trainings. This enrollment strategy across free 
libraries and zip codes will provide ample opportunities for local city residents living in diverse settings 
to attend and receive valuable opi[INVESTIGATOR_362736].

Subject recruitment
The investigators and personnel listed on this study protocol will be present at each library sitting next 
to the Department of Public Health staff at a table in each library's lobby. For recruitment of library 
patrons in September 2019, the investigator or study personnel at the library site on "Naloxone Handout 
Days" will read a pre-developed script describing the study, explaining potential risks and beneﬁts, and 
making clear that participation, choosing not to participate, or withdrawing from the study will not 
inﬂuence a patron's ability to use the library or department of public health's resources. This script will 
be used to guide a brief talk given by a study investigator. A large ﬂyer will be posted next to the table 
promoting the Virtual reality training for individuals who are interested in learning more and talking to 
an investigator or study personnel about anonymously participating.  Informed consent will be obtained 
via participants signing the ﬁrst page before beginning the pre-test survey. After obtaining informed 
consent, respondents will be asked to complete the pretest baseline assessments. Participants can 
contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_837004].
Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media avenues (examples include: Facebook, Twitter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does 
the study team plan to directly use social media to recruit for the research?

Procedures
During the study period we will be committed to testing the [ADDRESS_1161907] educational materials (e.g. online videos, printed handouts) on knowledge 
retention and attitudes will be evaluated according to the study procedure schema (uploaded separately). 
As shown in the study procedure schema, all voluntary participants in both experimental and control 
libraries will complete informed consent documents, provide demographic data, and complete pretest 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_837002] & Opi[INVESTIGATOR_837005], a secure 
online survey system maintained by [CONTACT_837017] ﬁrewall protected 
servers. No identiﬁers will be collected. The surveys are anonymous.  Virtual Reality Education 
(Intervention): The experimental group of libraries will receive the virtual reality simulation, which is 
guided by [CONTACT_837018], and lasts [ADDRESS_1161908] Educational (Control): The public health 
department's training includes printed handouts on how to administer naloxone and youtube videos on 
how to spot signs and symptoms of overdose and administer naloxone. Additionally, staff are on hand to 
provide one on one verbal educational trainings to local community members voluntarily seeking 
education.  All individuals approaching the table at the library will be introduced to the study and its 
purpose. If an individual attending the free training is interested in participating the study they will be 
consented by [CONTACT_837019]. After consenting all individuals will be asked to 
complete a brief pre-survey. If the library is randomized to a virtual reality cluster, participants will be 
asked to view the educational training using provided virtual reality headsets. If the library is 
randomized to a control cluster the participants will be offered training materials provided by [CONTACT_837020] (e.g. youtube videos, printed handouts, on narcan administration). All participants, 
regardless of cluster will be asked to complete the same survey immediately after either the virtual 
reality or public health department training. All individuals who participate in the study will have the 
opportunity to view the virtual reality training or public health department materials at any library 
regardless of cluster assignment following completion of post-test survey. Those who do not wish to 
participate in the study will have the opportunity to revieve the public health department's training 
materials.

Subject Con®dentiality
Sources of research material will include data obtained from the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_837007]. Data will be collected via an 
anonymous Qualtrics Surveys. Data will be managed by [CONTACT_079] [CONTACT_138365] ﬁrewall 
protected Penn Nursing servers. The minimal risk associated with this study is the risk related to 
identity protection. Because this study requires measurement of pretest and posttest data, participants 
data must be matched. Therefore, participants will be given unique identiﬁcation numbers to use in 
place of their names to mark their pre- and posttest surveys. In the event of the Qualtrics Survey not

Risk / Bene®t
Potential Study Risks
The risk associated with this study is the risk related to identity protection. Because this study requires 
measurement of pretest and posttest data, participants data must be matched pre to post. 
Therefore, 
participants will be given unique identiﬁcation numbers to use in place of their names to mark their pre- 
Page [ADDRESS_1161912] access. All electronic and digital data will be stored on a secure survey at the 
University of Pennsylvania.
Potential Study Bene®ts
Subjects may personally beneﬁt from increased knowledge retention and attitudes towards intervening 
in Narcan administration and opi[INVESTIGATOR_837011]. This study will produce important 
knowledge about the comparison of virtual reality simulation and standard education regarding 
knowledge retention and attitudes about Narcan administration and opi[INVESTIGATOR_837011]. 
Participants also beneﬁt from the opportunity to interact with cutting edge virtual reality simulation 
technology.
Risk / Bene®t Assessment
With the knowledge gained from this study, we can determine the optimal means of immersive 
education, improve Narcan carry-rates, and turn the tide of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103572]. Because there 
is minimal risk to the research participants, the opportunity to gain this important knowledge should be 
supported.

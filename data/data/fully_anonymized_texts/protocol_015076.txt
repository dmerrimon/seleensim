estimates indicate that a loss of approximately 500 mL is average, with a range of about 
250-700 mL.[1,2] Some of this bleeding arises from birth canal lacerations or surgical 
incisions (i.e., epi[INVESTIGATOR_82878]), but most derives from the vessels exposed in the uterine 
wall at the placental site once the placenta has separated.  
 
Under normal circumstances, shortly after placental separation intense myometrial 
contractions occur. These raise the pressure within the myometrial wall above that of 
the blood pressure in the vessels that traverse it, vessels that opened into the 
intervillous space. Flow in these vessels is thus mechanically attenuated by [CONTACT_82884], allowing for the formation of intravascular thrombi.  
 
This mechanism for controlling postpartum uterine blood loss works well most of the 
time. If, however, the uterus remains hypotonic or atonic after delivery, excessive blood 
loss can occur. In the worst cases, severe uterine hemorrhage ensues. Postpartum 
hemorrhage is, in fact, the leading cause of maternal mortality in the world, accounting 
for at least 100,000 deaths annually.[3] Even in the absence of frank hemorrhage, 
postpartum blood loss can result in maternal anemia. Recuperation of iron stores to 
recover from this blood loss takes time, and may not occur, especially in low 
socioeconomic areas where dietary iron consumption is often deficient, and 
pregnancies tend to occur in close succession.  
 
Postpartum anemia is a significant contributor to short- and long-term morbidity.[5-7] It 
increases the risk of infection and poor wound healing.  Also, the associated fatigue 
may interfere with the mother’s ability to administer child care and to bond appropriately 
with her infant. Anemic mothers tend to have more difficulty with nursing, and may 
produce iron-deficient milk. There is thus a strong rationale to minimize postpartum 
blood loss.  
 
In most US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], parturients receive a high dose of intravenous or intramuscular 
oxytocin immediately after delivery. This approach has been shown in several studies to 
reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, [8-11] and is practiced routinely at Queens 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246]. We employ an intravenous infusion of oxytocin (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933]®) at a rate of 
about 50-100 mU/minute. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_82879], there is still substantial blood loss at 
delivery, based on our preliminary observations shown below. This provides the 
rationale to determine whether use of an adjunctive drug, namely misoprostol 600 µg 
rectally, administered after delivery, might reduce blood loss further than does oxytocin 
alone, thus decreasing the risk of morbidity related to postpartum anemia.

 Preliminary Data 
 
We examined the hemograms of a randomly chosen consecutive sample of 53 
spontaneous vaginal deliveries performed at Queens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82880] 15 and October 1, 2010. 
 
Among these patients, the admission hemoglobin concentration was 11.9±1.2 g/dL and 
that on the first postparutum day was 10.9±1.3. The mean fall was 1.02 (95% CI 0.74, 
1.29), a statistically significant decrease (P<0.0001). Hematocrit levels fell in parallel, by 
[CONTACT_5554] 7.8% of the predelivery value. The mean fall in hemoglobin and 
hematocrit levels after delivery (1.02 g/dL and 2.81%) is consistent with an average 
blood loss of about [ADDRESS_90381] prophylactic intravenous oxytocin immediately after delivery with a 
group that received oxytocin and adjuvant misoprostol.  
 
Sample size and analysis 
 
A total of 800 subjects will enter this two-treatment parallel design study. With that 
sample size, the probability is 90% that the study will detect a treatment difference at a 
two-sided 0.05 significance level if the difference in hemoglobin concentration between 
treatments is 0.3 g/dL. This analysis is based on the assumption that the standard 
deviation of the postpartum and intrapartum hemoglobin concentrations is not larger 
than 1.3 g/dL. 
 
Comparison of intrapartum and postpartum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be 
done using a paired t-test. A probability level of 0.05 will be used as the threshold for 
significance.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
This study will include adult pregnant women regardless of age.  P regnant minors under 
the age of 18 will not be eligible. 
 
A patient will be considered for inclusion in the study if she meets all of the following 
criteria: 
 She has a term (≥37 completed weeks) live singleton gestation in cephalic 
presentation and has been admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit  
 She is in the latent phase of labor or has been admitted for induction of labor or at 
prenatal clinic visit 
 She has had fewer than four prior vaginal deliveries. 
 She reports no allergy to misoprostol. 
The following factors or conditions will exclude a patient from consideration as a 
subject: 
 The fetus has a known major fetal malformation or chromosome abnormality  
 The gestation is multiple. 
 There is a breech or other malpresentation  
  The patient reports involvement in another clinical trial currently or previously in 
this pregnancy. 
 The patient is expected to have a cesarean delivery. 
 The patient had a prior cesarean delivery. 
 There has been an intrauterine fetal death. 
 There is polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index >22 cm). 
 Presence of acute or chronic renal disease 
 Presence of preeclampsia 
 
Of subjects who enter the study, the development of certain conditions will exclude 
them post hoc from receiving misoprostol under the protocol, and from the data 
analysis. These conditions include: 
 Unanticipated cesarean delivery. 
 Performance of epi[INVESTIGATOR_82878] (third and fourth degree extensions will be excluded) . 
 Vaginal or cervical laceration, or perineal laceration of more than second degree in 
depth. 
 Severe postpartum hemorrhage requiring intervention immediately after delivery. 
 Uterine rupture 
 Placental abruption. 
 Patient withdrawal of consent.

envelope in sequence. If it contains an odd number, the patient will be assigned to the 
intervention group and will receive oxytocin and misoprostol. If the envelope contains an 
even number, the patient will be assigned to “oxytocin only” group.  
 
Characteristics of Medication 
Nature of misoprostol 
Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog. It is marketed primarily as a drug to 
prevent the development of gastric ulcers associated with use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, and is part of the Queens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82881]. Originally 
marketed as Cytotec®, misoprostol is available in a generic form as tablets containing 
contain either 100 µg or 200 µg. Misoprostol protects the gastric mucosa through 
several mechanisms. It also has the property of stimulating myometrial smooth muscle 
contraction.[12] That effect has resulted in the drug’s common use in obstetrics for 
termination of pregnancy, cervical ripening prior to induction of labor and, in large 
doses, for prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage from uterine atony. [13-
19]

after dosing, the milk concentration was about 67% of the maternal serum level; by [CONTACT_82885], the misoprostol concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/mL. While no 
specific data exist for misoprostol concentrations in colostrum, given the very small 
ingested volume over the first few hours of life, neonatal exposure to the drug in our 
study can be expected to be minimal. There are no published reports of adverse effects 
of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol  
 
Misoprostol is classified by [CONTACT_4760] a Pregnancy Category X drug. This label is 
related to its possible association with congenital anomalies when used in the first 
trimester, as well as its abortifacient properties. In our study, patients will no longer be 
pregnant when they receive the drug. 
 
The use of misoprostol to enhance uterine activity postpartum is an off-label method, 
but one that has gained wide acceptance, and for which there is considerable 
experience.[8-10, 12-19] The drug can cause nausea, headache, dyspepsia, vomiting, 
and constipation or diarrhea with multiple doses. These side effects are usually mild to 
moderate and generally subside within a week. Serious side effects after a single dose 
are quite rare. In one study of 327 women who received 600 µg rectally (the dose we 
propose to use), the most common side effects were transient shivering (26%) and 
pyrexia (15%). Both were mild and short-lived. [16] 
 
 
 
Benefits and Risks to Study Subjects  
There will be no certain medical benefit to the subjects who participate in the study. It is 
possible that they will benefit from reduced postpartum blood loss.  
Risks to the subjects are those associated with administration or misoprostol. 
These include the following adverse events that have been reported in subjects 
receiving misoprostol for ulcer prophylaxis: diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, 
flatulence, headache, dyspepsia, vomiting, and constipation. All occurred in fewer than 
5% of patients. Other reported effects that occurred in clinical trials of misoprostol, but 
for which no cause-effect relation has been established included fatigue, fever, chills, 
rash, alopecia, pallor, breast pain, abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis,

they occur, they will probably disappear within an hour.  
 
 
Oxytocin commonly causes vomiting and nausea.  Oxytocin has the potential to cause 
muscle contractions.  In rare cases, Oxytocin can cause heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (rapid 
heartbeat) and allergic reaction of a rash or swelling. 
 
 
It is unknown whether Misoprostol and/or Oytocin are excreted in human milk. There is 
an unconfirmed relation with Misoprostol and/or Oytocin  causing digestive problems, 
such as diarrhea, and abdominal cramps in breast-fed newborns.  Pariticipants will be 
advised to discard breast mild for the first [ADDRESS_90386] will then be assigned randomly to the control (oxytocin alone) or 
the study (oxytocin + misoprostol) group, as described above. The subject and her 
medical caretakers will be informed of which group she is in. If the labor eventuates in a 
vaginal delivery, all subjects will receive the standard dose of intravenous oxytocin, 
begun within one minute of delivery. Subjects in the study group who have not incurred 
any of the post-hoc exclusion criteria (epi[INVESTIGATOR_82878], major laceration, etc) will receive a 
dose of [ADDRESS_90387] practices, for 
treating postpartum hemorrhaging of more than 500cc estimated blood loss.    The 
patient’s vital signs will be recorded after delivery according to standard protocols of the 
obstetric service. The Data Collection forms will be filled out after the delivery by [CONTACT_82886] 1, 2017 10
the investigators. The measurement of postpartum hemoglobin and hematocrit (H & H) 
is automatically ordered at 06:00am for all patients who have delivered the day prior, 
constituting this measurement at "Postpartum Day 1", which is at a minimum of 6 hours 
after delivery and is enough time for H & H levels to stabilize. 
Within 36 hours of delivery, additional information will be collected from the patient’s 
record, including the postpartum hemogram and information about any symptoms or 
signs related to the misoprostol. 
 
Confidentiality 
 
After a subject has given informed consent, she will be assigned a Study Number. This 
number will be used on the study data collection form as the sole patient identifier, i.e., 
the form will not contain the subject’s name [CONTACT_82888][INVESTIGATOR_7965]. A single hard copy list 
of the subjects’ Study Numbers and their medical record numbers will be kept in a 
locked cabinet in the Principal Investigator’s sponsor’s office ([CONTACT_82889]).  This list will be 
destroyed once the study has been accepted for publication. Only [CONTACT_82889] will have 
access to this list.  
 
Costs 
The cost of each 600 µg dose of misproostol will be $4.80. There will be no charge to 
the patient. The drug will be paid for through the research fund of the Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology at Queens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246].

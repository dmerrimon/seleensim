Informed Consent Form 
Date of the 
Document:  July 3, 2018  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
 
Overview: The study will: 1) Obtain input  on feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using mHealth in 
behavior change by [CONTACT_78389] a device for rural older adults; 2) Develop, refine  and tailor  MOWI  in research 
settings; 3) Conduct  MOWI in subjects’ homes. The overall goal is to improve older  adult  physical function in 
rural areas and use the results as a basis for an R01 randomized trial testing the MOWI’s delivery in the home.  
 
Study Setting /Population: Dartmouth -Hitchcock (D -H) serves 1.5 million persons from a circumscribed area 
of rur al New Hampshire/Vermont. The site of Lebanon, NH, is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_78379] (16.2% aged 
≥65 years; 95.4% Caucasian83). Of 13,293 p rimary care patients ≥65years old at D -H, 3,987 are study eligible 
(~30% obese84). The Center  for Health & Aging (CHA)  has rooms for  study assessments. In-home evaluations 
will use CHA video equipment .  
 
Recruitment: As a Geriatrician working with an interdisciplinary team, I 
have ready access to potential subjects from a practice panel of ~[ADDRESS_667533] review and e- mailed/mailed letters 
describing the study (after HIPAA waiver). Posters/ handouts will be placed 
strategically at D- H. Colleagues  will give information materials to patients  
requesting permission for contact [CONTACT_78390] r esearch assistant . With 
respect to the qualitative component, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78380] 6 clinicians (from 87 in the provider network) to participate in interviews. [CONTACT_78409] will use the 
CHA’s extensive aging services network to recruit 4 leaders of aging services organizations for study participation.  
 
Selection Criteria: Focus groups, interviews, and usability testing will target English -speaking obese older 
adults (age≥65years and BMI ≥30kg/m217 or waist circumference ≥88/102cm85 in females/males).  Excluded 
from eligibility are adults with severe mental or life -threatening illness, dementia, substance use, history of 
bariatric surgery, suicidal ideation, unable to provide consent/perform measures, or residing in a nursing home. Aim 1a provider interv iews will target English -speaking, licensed, outpatient, primary care clinicians and 
community aging service program directors. Older adult participants in Aims 2 & [ADDRESS_667534] less  than a 5% weight loss in the past 6 months, and 
be without advanced co- morbidity, exercise restrictions88 or involvement in other research studies. 
 
Screening/Consent : Subjects expressing  interest will be mailed/emailed forms, evaluated by [CONTACT_78391] , and t hose meeting criteria invited to an RA -led session to verify final eligibility, review and 
complete consent forms, and answer queries. Competence for consent will be assured by: [CONTACT_78392] (all Aims) and a Callahan score ≥4 (Aims 2 & 3). Written consent will be obtained before enrollment. 
The RA will obtain screening/baseline measures, and provide a list of contact [CONTACT_8972] (see Human Subjects).    
 
Aim 1a (Qualitative  assessment) : Determine the acceptability, utility, and perceived value of mHealth in 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_515128] : Semi -structured interviews  and focus 
groups will inform modification of existing interventions ensuring MOWI is acceptable  and useful for rural 
elders. MOWI is based on caloric restriction, activity, and intensive behavioral therapy23,24,26,28,89-95 and includes 
weekly individual diet ary counseling, 2x/week  group exercise visits, and Amulet, a mHealth device. I  will 
conduct  4 focus groups  (6-8 people each) and 6-8 interviews  (60-90 min each) , audiotaped  and transcribed by 
[CONTACT_515131] . A supportive group context  will: facilitate identification of sensitive issues (ie: barriers to 
behavior change ); solicit advice on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]’s  acceptability  and feasibility ; provide input on feedback messages 
(see Appendix) based on activation and self -monitoring domains with short, simple words (≤2 syllables) ; 
identify  program improvement; and offer ideas for improving the technology interface.  The RA will demonstrate 
the use of the Amulet to subjects allowing specific feedback rather than hypothetical suggestions . A codebook 
based on converging themes  will be guided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Carpenter -Song . I will conduct  semi -structured interviews 
with 6 clinicians  and 4 community leaders  (senior centers; local programs ) explor ing barriers to delivering rural 
wellness  interventions , input on MOWI and its possible challenges, audiotaped and transcribed by [CONTACT_21118].  FIGURE 2:  STUDY OVERVIEW  
 

Recruitment and Retention Strategies  
Participants  will be recruited from referrals  from Family  Medicine/General Internal  Medicine providers  
(Primary  Care),  providers  from the Dartmouth  Weight  & Wellness  Center,  and community  members  attending 
the Dartmouth  Center  for Health  and Aging  (DCHA).  I will inform  clinicians  of Family  Medicine and General  
Internal  Medicine and the staff at the Weight  & Wellness  Center  of the proposed study  during section 
meetings.  [CONTACT_78409]  has an extensive network  of community -care providers  and will send e- mails/le tters to 
the CHA’s  listserv  and mailing  list requesting  participation.  Posters  will be placed in each examination room,  in 
the patient  waiting  areas  and in common  areas  of the DCHA.  All posters  will have been pre-approved by 
[CONTACT_78394]/family  advisors  and the Committee  for the Protection for Human  Subjects.  Additionally,  postings  
in the DCHA  quarterly  newsletter,  the DHMC weekly  D-H Today  online bulletin,  the weekly  Geisel  School  of 
Medicine  at Dartmouth newsletter,  and electronic  mailing  lists will promo te the study.  We anticipate advertising  
in the local newspaper  as well. A dedicated phone number  and e-mail will be assigned to this study.    
Patients  will be i dentified  from the PI’s clinical practice group at D-H, word  of mouth,  or other  means  as 
indicated below.  We will also identify  prospective individuals  fulfilling  basic  eligibility  criteria  after obtaining  a 
HIPAA waiver  for electronic  record  review  from the Committee  for the Protection of Human  Subjects.  A pre-
assessment eligibility  would  be performed to limit the burden on patients  should they be ineligible  after full 
informed  consent  for the requisite  aims.  This will allow  the investigators  to query  our electronic  medical  record  
and if necessary  send  targeted  messages  and/or  letters  to individuals  that may possibly  qualify  for this study.  If 
needed,  the study  staff will send a letter  to prospective individuals  requesting their involvement  either  by [CONTACT_78395]  (through the electronic  medical  record).  This letter  will describe the study  and provide contact  
[CONTACT_78396].  The CTO  will also have details  of the study.  Any individuals  that have  
expressed interest  will be contact[CONTACT_78397].  A pre-screeni ng questionnaire or electronic  link to RedCAP  (See  below)  or by 
[CONTACT_78398]/emailed to participants  (depending  on patient  preference).   
As part of Aim 1a, eligible  patients  will be asked  to participate in qualitative  focus  groups  and individual  semi-
structured  interviews  with a member  of the team.  It is anticipated  that the focus  group  will occur  4-[ADDRESS_667535]  for clinicians  and community  leaders  of health  and senior  centers.  At the time of 
communication,  the consent  form will be sent to these  individuals  for review  (paper  or electronic)  and if they 
agree to the terms  of the consent,  the individuals  will attend these  sessions  at a mutually  convenient  time for 
the study  participants  and the Research  Team.  A reminder  letter  will be sent either  via myDH  (through  the 
electronic  medical  record)  by [CONTACT_978], and/or  a hard copy  letter  to the patient’s  address.    
As part of Aim 1b, eligible  patients  will be asked  to attend the DCHA  to confirm  eligibility  and informed consent  
process  by [CONTACT_21118]/PI  (See  Section on Informed  Consent  Procedures  for Full details).  Those  ineligible  will be 
informed  by [CONTACT_78399].  We anticipate  that eligibility  to study  onset  will be 
roughly  4-6 weeks  after screening.   
As part of Aim 2 and 3 (including  the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_78382] 2), eligible  patients  will be asked  either  to attend  a baseline 
visit with the RA or PI [INVESTIGATOR_78383]/PI  (See  Section on Informed  Consent  Procedures  for Full Details ). Those  ineligible  will be 
informed  by [CONTACT_78399].  We anticipa te that eligibility  to study  onset  will be 
roughly  4-6 weeks  after screening.  The patient’s  primary  care provider  will provide medical  clearance prior to 
study  enrollment  and sign a paper  or electronic  form allowing  the individual  to undergo this intervention.  They  
will be kept informed of any abnormal  symptoms  or problems  throughout  the study.   
The investigators  recognize  that this intervention may lead to attrition.  To reduce the risk of participant  
drop- out, participants  will be reminded of sessions  with a phone call, e- mail,  and Amulet  messaging  reminder  
from the RA. Individuals  will be compensated  with sandwiches/snacks  plus $[ADDRESS_667536] for the focus  groups  of 
the qualitative  aim (Aim 1a), $[ADDRESS_667537]  semi -structured  interviews,  a nominal  $10/hour  
payment  for the prevalidation phase of Aim 1b (cash,  gift-card),  a $[ADDRESS_667538] each for Aim 1b, $100 for 
completing  >80%  of the visits  and assessments  for the three -month  program  (Aim 2) - $25 per assessment,  
and $200 for completing >80%  of the visits  and assessments  at 6-months  (Aim 3). Payment  will be made at 
study  conclusion according to institutional  policies.  They  will also receive a fixed  schedule of items  (pens,  
notepads,  thank  you cards)  to recognize their participation to date.  Participants  will have the option of declining  
such incentives  at any time.  We will provide a $[ADDRESS_667539] or equivalent  for each visit (Aim 4).  
 No involvement  of special  vulnerable population such as fetuses,  neonates,  pregnant  woman,  children,  
prisoners,  institutionalized individuals  or others  who may be considered  vulnerable will be included in this 
study.  The study  will be a single -arm study  and there will be no assignment  to a study  group for this study.   
 
Retention  
We recognize that a ttrition  rates  in obesity  studies  range between 25-50%.  For Aim 1a (qualitative  
studies),  we will target  4 focus  groups  of 6-8 individuals  (24-32 individuals  total),  6-[ADDRESS_667540]  for Aim 1, two waves  for Aim 2, and in 4 waves  for 
Aim 3 to reach target  enrollment  and completion.  Should we exceed target  enrollment  and completion,  we will 
continue gathering  measurements  on all individuals.  With the new arm (MOWI -P), we anticipate recruiting  an 
additional 16 subjects.  For Aim 4 (Weight  Maintenance),  we anticipate  recruiting 60% of each  of the original  
sample for Aim 2 (ie: 4 waves  @ 8 = 32 x 0.6 = approximately  19 subjects).   
 
PROTECTION  OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  – AMENDED  
This Human  Subjects  Research meets  the definition  of a clinical trial. The Dartmouth  Committee  for the 
Protection of Human  Subjects  (CPHS)  has approved the study,  CPHS#[ZIP_CODE] (see Appendix)  and includes  a 
partial  waiver  of HIPAA authorization to collect  the minimum  information  required  to identify,  contact  [CONTACT_353139].  This proposal  has been  discussed with [CONTACT_353168],  Geisel  School  of Medicine at 
Dartmouth  health care ethicist,  and [CONTACT_353169],  our technology  information security expert  and Chair  of the 
Department  of Computer  Science,  who will both serve  as advisors  to guide  the development  of the responsible 
conduct  for research.   
 
Human Subjects Involvement,  Characteristics and Design: 
Justification  of Use of Human  Individuals  
The proposed  intervention requires  human involvement  to develop a mobile health Obesity  Wellness  
Intervention (MOWI).  MOWI  consists of a 3x/week  in-person intervention at the Dartmouth Center  for Health  
and Aging,  comprising  of three  components:  an individu al weekly  nutritional  counseling  session led by a 
dietician,  2x/week  group  exercise visits  led by a clinical physical  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  and a patient -self-monitoring 
mHealth  device capable of remote  sensing (Amulet).  The intervention is based on previous  studies  
demonstrating the importance of intensive behavioral therapy  and caloric  restriction16,19,21,80-82 and the 
emerging  evidence of the importance  of group  meetings161. We will also use focus  groups  and semi -structured  
interviews  to obtain input  into the utility,  acceptability  and perceived value of Telehealth modalities  (Aim 1a); 
adapt  Amulet  in older  adults  to assess  geriatric  functional  measures  (Aim 1b); develop,  refine,  and tailor  MOWI  
to evaluate its effectiveness  (Aim 2); and conduct  and assess the feasibility,  acceptability  and preliminary  
effectiveness  of a video- delivered home -based program  (Aim 3). It is impossible  to assess  study  feasibility,  
acceptability  or effectiveness  without  human involvement.  The MOWI -P arm will consist of an additional  [ADDRESS_667541] Population  
 We will recruit  older  motivated adults  with obesity  (aged ≥65years)  to participate in the three  separate 
aims  of this study.  Aim 1a will recruit  up to 50 individuals,  Aim 1b will recruit  100 individuals  (pre-validation and 
validation),  Aim 2 aims  to recruit  and retain  10 individuals,  and Aim 3 aims  to recruit  and retain 40 individuals.  
No special  or vulnerable populations,  including older  adults  with cognitive  impairment,  will be included in this 
study.  No assignment  to study  group will occur.  For Aim 1b (pre-validation)  on younger  local 
personnel/students,  we approximate ~30-[ADDRESS_667542]  (age,  race,  
ethnicity,  employment  status,  ability  to communicate in English, marital  status,  education level,  number  and 
names  of medications,  co-morbidities,  smoking  status,  admissions  to the nursing home  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  BMI, 
documented  dementia,  weight  loss of >5% in the past year,  recent  angina/coronary  events,  bariatric  surgery).  
Self-reported  data from questionnaires  will be obtained including  Katz86 and Lawton87 activities  of daily living  
scales, PAM137, PROMIS139, CHAMPS144, Social  Support  with Exercise145 , Social  Support  and Eating Habits, 
Readiness  to Change,  and number  of household members.  Objective  outcome measures  will be assessed 
including  grip strength127, Five Times  Sit-to-Stand106, Six Minute Walk Test130, gait speed135, weight,  and waist  
circumference.  Field  notes  from the physical  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_353116]  (detailing  the experience of the 
intervention,  reactions  from the participants,  aspects  that work  well or need improving upon,  insights  etc.),  and 
questions  regarding  patient  satisfaction  will be assessed.   
All qualitative  data from focus  groups  or semi -structured  interviews  will be recorded,  transcribed and/or  
videotaped by [CONTACT_21118]. Satisfaction questionnaires  will be completed by [CONTACT_4317].  This information will 
subsequently  be imported  for analysis  and review  using Dedoose and STATA,  R or SAS.   
All questionnaire  data wi ll be either  in paper  format,  or populated by [CONTACT_353140]  
(Research  Electronic  Data  Capture)   software.  Study  data will be collected and managed  using  REDCap  
electronic  data capture  tools  managed  at Dartmouth College  through  the license from the Clinical and 
Translational Science Institute  (SYNERGY)146. REDCap  is a secure,  web-based application designed to 
support  data capture  for research  studies,  providing 1) an intuitive  interface for validated data entry;  2) audit  
trails  for tracking  data manipulation and export  procedures;  3) automated export  procedures  for seamless  data 
downloads  to common  statistical packages;  and 4) procedures  for importing data from external  sources.  
 
Study  Personnel  with Access to Identifiable Data 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_353117].  All data would be considered protected health information  
(PHI)  subject  to HIPAA and D-H regulations.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_353118] -level 
data and to the electronic  medical  record  (eDH)  which  has pertinent  PHI and laboratory  assessments  obtained.  
Drs. Kotz & Pletcher  and their teams  will also have access to technology -related data that will be 
communicated to the RA and study  team.  This is necessary  in the capacity  of the RA to serve  as a health 
coach102 to be aware of such  information.  All other  data communicated  to other  study  personnel will be de-
identified  and communicated only in aggregate.  
 
 The MOWI  comprises  of a multidisciplinary  treatment  strategy,  including nutritional,  behavioral,  and 
physical interventions,  augmented  by [CONTACT_353141]  (telemedicine,  mHealth  and remote  sensing).  The 
confidentiality  of focus  group or individual  data cannot  be guaranteed.  We will encourage and ask our study  
participants  not to share  the information  discussed within  the session.  
 
 
Str
ategies  for Protecting Personal  Information  
All investigators  will have  completed the requisite  Human Individuals  protection training,  CITI,  or 
training as required  by [CONTACT_353142].  All Dartmouth investigators  would abide by [CONTACT_353143],  
and as such, would have  full understanding  of privacy  rules.  Access to medical  records  would be from private  
D-H work  computers  accessed using  a unique electronic  portal  identifier.  A password- protected  datafile  on 
password -protected computers  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_353119].  All written  material  will be 
coded using  a unique  identifier  and not by [CONTACT_353144].  All questionnaires  or other  study -related 
documents  will be kept in the PI’s locked  office. All consent  forms  (paper  or electronic)  will be kept separately  
in the PI’s locked  office (or in a secure electronic  location).  All data will be accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_353120] a D-H password protected computer.  Data  from audio recordings  will be transcribed  by [CONTACT_21118], 
other  study  personnel or by [CONTACT_353145] (ie: rev.com). A non-disclosure  agreement  will be 
signed by [CONTACT_978].  
Data  from the Amulet  will be transmitted to a Wi-Fi- secure  cloud- based repository  via HTTP  post,  
decrypted and stored  on an Amazon virtual  machine running  a MySQL  database.  The data can be downloaded 
by [CONTACT_21118]. Individual  data in Aim 1b and [ADDRESS_667543]  allergy  with 
the fitness  device is possible,  although we anticipate this risk being  quite  low, and if indeed this does  occur, a 
communication with the patient’s  primary  care provider  will be made.  Should the contact  [CONTACT_353146], 
the patient  will be treated  symptomatically  or withdrawn from the study.  
 
Potential  Physical  and Psychological  Risks to Individuals (including  possible  alternative treatments)  
and Mitigation  of Such Risks.  
 The MOW I comprises  of a multidisciplinary  treatment  strategy,  including nutritional,  behavioral,  and 
physical  interventions,  augmented  by [CONTACT_353141]  (telemedicine,  mHealth  and remote  sensing).  The 
confidentiality  of focus  group or individual  data cannot  be guaranteed.  We will encourage and ask our study  
participants  not to share  the information  discussed within  the session.  
Physical  activity  interventions  may lead to mild muscular  fatigue or soreness  but will be monitored  in a 
setting  by [CONTACT_112408].  Risk of falling  is elevated in older  adults178 and will need to be supervised.  
Physical  activity  is recommended,  even in sedentary  individuals  who may be at risk for cardiovascular  
events179,[ADDRESS_667544]  the participant’s  primary  care 
provider  to ensure  prompt  evaluation.  Should the primary  care provider  not be available,  the participants  will be 
transported,  if deemed medically  necessary,  to the closest Emergency  Department.  A member  of the study  
staff will remain with the participant  until there is a safe transfer  of care.  For Aim 3, additional safety  measures  
have been established to ensure  the safety  of participants  while  participating in at home  exercise classes 
where an RA or physical  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_353121] a physical  symptom  may 
arise.  (See  attached saf ety flowchart)  Lastly,  rarely  during  focus  groups  or semi -structured  interviews  would 
individuals  become uncomfortable;  however,  they will be reminded  that they are participating voluntarily  and 
may leave the group  at any time.  Our Institution  Review  Board expects  notification of any incidental findings,  
as well as about  any unanticipated problems  involving  risk to subjects.  Any newly  identified psychiatric  disorder  
will be referred to the primary  care provider  for assess ment  and treatment.   
Data  from the A mulet  and its applications  will be password protected,  and only study  personnel  would 
have access to the complete  data.  All data will be HIPAA- compliant.  Additionally,  we deliberately  chose Vidyo  
as this is a software  platform  that has been  used by [CONTACT_353147]-
compliant.  The investigators  will discuss this with the eligible  subjects  and ensure they are fully aware  of these 
minimal,  but possible  risks.  The risk of a contact  [CONTACT_353148],  although we anticipate this risk 
being  quite  low, and if indeed this does  occur,  a communication with the patient’s  primary  care provider  will be 
made.  Should the contact  [CONTACT_353146],  the patient  will be treated  symptoma tically  or withdrawn from 
the study.  
Venipuncture will be considered in all participants  in Aim 2 – this will be performed  at the Dartmouth-
Hitchcock  laboratory  under  standard  clinical conditions.  We expect  minimal risk from this procedure.  Volume of 
blood work  will be <500cc  in this population.  Bloodwork  will be obtained at baseline and again  at [ADDRESS_667545].  Competence to provide informed consent  will be assured  by a review  of personal  
history/medical  record  (all Aims  for subje cts) and the Callahan Cognitive  screener  score ≥4 prior to informed  
consent  evaluation for Aims  2 & 3 (Appendix ). No chart r eview  will be performed  for clinicians/leaders  in Aim 
1a or the pre-validation in Aim 1b.  
After  the study par ticipant  expresses  interest  and is eligible  based  on inclusion/exclusion criteria  (see 
Recruitment  & Retention Strategies  above),  they will be presented  with a written  consent  form (paper  or 
electronic  form) and initiation  of the informed consent  discussion will occur  by [CONTACT_351201] [INVESTIGATOR_353122].  Participants  will be encouraged to ask questions  about  the study  or research process.  If the 
participants  need more  time to consider  enrolling, a follow -up telephone call to continue this consent  process  
will occur  according to IRB-approved procedures  for telephone consent  by [CONTACT_978]/RA  with contact  [CONTACT_353149].  Participants  will be encouraged  to ask questions  about  the study  or 
research  process  and be given  ample time to review  the informed consent  form.  A telephone script will be 
available which  will encourage questions  and clarification  of the study  procedures  as needed.  All individuals  
agreeing will be asked to sign an informed consent  document  (paper  or electronic),  or if done  by [CONTACT_756],  a 
return  postage envelope will be used to return  the consent  form.  The individual  who agrees  by [CONTACT_353150].  The form will be s canned into the Dartmouth -Hitchcock 
Electronic  Medical  Reco rd and the encounter  will be documented.  Once targeted  enrollment  for a given  
iteration occurs, the PI/RA  will arrange and notify  the patient  the time and date of the first session.  Primary  
care provider  permission will be necessary  prior to commencing  this study  for Aims  2 and 3.  
All consent  pr ocesses  will be performed at the Dartmouth  Centers  for Health  and Aging,  the Amulet  
laboratory  on campus,  or a mutually  convenient  location as designated  by [CONTACT_2299]/PI.  The overall  
purpose of the research will be presented  to the participant  and the specific component  they will be recruited 
for will be discussed.  The reason  why the individual  was asked  to be involved will be provided.   The anticipated  
outcome  will be explained to the individuals.  We shall emphasize to the prospective subject  that their 
involvement  is entirely  voluntary  and will not influence nor impact  their care at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. 
Individuals  will be encouraged  to discuss the study  with their family  and friends  and take their time to make 
such a decision.  We will emphasize that their participation in all aims  is based  on their willingness  to engage  in 
the requisite  technology.  
The time commitment  for the research project  will be described  and the anticipated discomforts  and 
risks (both  physical and nonphysical).  The potential  benefits  to the participant  and the potential  benefits  to 
others  will be provided (see below).  A description of their confidentiality  will be provided,  including  how their 
information  will be treated,  stored,  maintained (and for what  duration)  and how the materials  will be disposed 
of.  They  will be provided  with the freedom  to participate in research  and/or  withdrawal  of the research 
permission at any time and the institutional  processes  for doing so. The sources  of information that data can be 
collected will be given,  along with the contact  [CONTACT_353151]’s name,  address,  phone number.  Any costs or description for compensation for injury  will be described.  
The grantor  for this research will be given  as well and any potential  conflicts  of interest  that the investigators  
may have.   
 
A separ a
te consent  form will be provided for Aim 4. 
For Aim 1a: Qualitative  Assessment  (Focus Groups/Semi -Structured Interviews)  Subjects:  The 
Dartmouth  CPHS  considers  this type of research minimal risk. An information page  and consent  form (paper  or 
electronic)  will be provided to each participant.  The RA will explain  the purpose of this component  of the study  
and answer  any questions  that any of the participants  may have.  Each  individual  will have the opportunity  to 
answer  questions  in the group (or individually  for the semi -structured  interview),  in a non-pressured  manner.  
Should the participant,  following  discussion of the study  purpose  and consent  not be willing  to participate,  the 
subject  shall be thanked  for their time but not included in the group.  None  of their information  shall be used and 
any information to date will be destroyed.     
 
For Aim 1a: Qualitative  Assessment  (Clinician  & Community  Leader Semi-Structured Interviews):  The

not be willing  to participate,  the subject  shall be thanked  for their time but not included in the group.  None of 
their information  shall be used and any information  to date will be destroyed.     
 
The completed form will be scanned into the Dartmouth -Hitchcock  Electronic  Medical  Record (Aims  2+3) and 
the encounter  will be documented  for study  subjects. For community  leaders,  clinicians  and pre-validation 
subjects,  the consent  forms  (paper  or electronic)  will be kept in the PI’s locked office.  
 
Adequacy
 of Protection Against Risks  
Participants  are informed  that information  obtained through  research  interviews  and assessments  are 
confidential.  Talking  about  life experiences  may cause discomfort.  If participants  feel uncomforta ble they are 
encouraged to take a break  and continue again  later or are offered  to stop the interview  or assessment.  
Participants  may also choose not to answer  certain  questions.  The interviewer  also may offer to call the 
participant’s  family,  a program  staff member,  or concerned others  (such as a close friend)  to make sure he or 
she has someone  to talk with about  the program.   
The team  will also encourage continual  communication with the primary  care provider  if any medical  concerns  
are raised by [CONTACT_4317].  Should any participant  endorse  any symptoms, we will immediately  contact  [CONTACT_353152]’s  primary  care physician at Dartmouth-Hitchcock or to the individual’s  local 
community  provider  to communicate this risk. On site, there will be individuals  and other  members  that are 
certified  in Basic  Life Support  by [CONTACT_353153].  Urgent  
care can be provided in the event  of an emergency  prior to calling  9-1-1 for an ambulance to arrive.   
Any other  medically -related questions  will be referred  to the patient’s  primary  care provider  during  normal  
business  hours  (Monday  to Friday  8am-5pm)  and after-hours  on-call coverage  is available through the Family  
Medicine/General Internal  Medicine  practices  or to the local community  practice.  All study  activities  will be 
performed  during  normal  clinic  hours  (8am  to 5pm)  and hence  access  to participant’s  primary  care team  is 
possible.  Study -related  questions  can be communicated to the Principal  Investig[INVESTIGATOR_136]or  [INVESTIGATOR_136] [PHONE_1846] or by e-
mail at [EMAIL_6763].  Additionally,  the patient’s  emergency  contact  [CONTACT_353154].  Our team  intends  on collaborating  with each  participant’s  primary  care provider  
to determine an appropriate action plan to minimize  any risk. 
 
Potent
ial Benefits of Proposed Research  
 Research participants  have  an opportunity  to engage  in a medically  supervised Obesity  Wellness  
Intervention using novel  technologies  and would benefit  from the discussions with other  participants  in similar  
situations.  For the intervention development,  participants  will participate in this program  which  has the potential  
to improve  their overall  function,  aerobic  and resistance activity  and wellness.  Approximatel y 150minutes  
weekly  of aerobic  physical  activity  is recommended166,167. While  our program  focuses  primarily  on resistance  
training,  we will encourage  individuals  to achieve the aerobic  objective  on their own.  Individuals  will obtain data 
that could potentially  be used in clinical settings.  The monetary  appreciation is another  benefit  of this proposed  
research  that will offset  travel  costs.   The overall  risks of this study  are quite  minimal, yet in line with 
recommendations  from major  medical  societies.  Obesity  interventions  are recommended even in older  
adults168, yet we believe  that any benefits  received from this intervention far exceed those  risks.  The 
components  of the obesity  intervention would be considered medically  necessary  for older  adults  with obesity.   
 
Importance of the Knowledge  to be Gained 
The information  gained in this study  will allow  the investigators  to ascertain the benefits  from a 
technology -based  wellness  program  and anticipate furthering  our understanding  of the implications  of this 
program  on functional  and biological  biomarkers.  Understanding  these  relationships  in a clinical setting  will 
allow  further  refinement  into a wellness  program  for obese  older  adults  with the goal of limiting  the acceleration 
of sarcopenia and improving  function.  The program  engages  and empowers  patients  in altering  their lifestyle,  
thereby  [CONTACT_353155],  proper  nutrition,  physical  activity,  and maintenance of function.  The risks of 
the study  are minimal to individuals  in relation to the potential  benefits  they may receive.   
Additionally,  the Amulet  is intended on becoming  a commercially  available  device intended on 
improving  physical  health and wellness.  The device  has been  granted  a Non-Significant  Risk exemption (NSR)  
according  to published intent  of Amulet100 and review  of the protocol  by [CONTACT_353156],  dated 7/23/2015 based on 21 CFR 812.2(b)(ii)  (Appendix).  
 
Confidentiality  and Data Integrity:   
Confidentiality  protections  include confidentiality  training  for all new employees  and refresher  seminars  
annually  for all employees;  coding subjects  by [CONTACT_6227];  filing code  sheets  separately  from data;  removing  or 
obscuring  names  from data forms;  using  an acronym  in return  addresses  on correspondence  to subjects; 
storing  all data in locked  file cabinets;  and password- protected computer  databases.   
All data collected by [CONTACT_353157] (standard  MicroSD  card)  but 
can only be accessed by [CONTACT_353158]  (by [CONTACT_353159])  and then read by [CONTACT_353160]-card adapter.  This approach  provides  a secure and reliable  means  of collecting  data and 
transferring it to the researcher’s  computer  when the su bject  returns  the Amulet  at the end of the study.  There  
will be automated upload  of live data via standard  Bluetooth wireless  protocols  to a computer  server  in the Kotz 
lab (or virtual  server  in the Amazon Cloud).  This transfer  of data will be conducted over authenticated and 
confidential  channels  using standard protocols  (https  – which  is used by [CONTACT_353161]  e-commerce  and banking 
websites).  Fitbit  data will be collected through  the application or through  a 3rd party  vendor  (Fitabase).

STATISTICAL DESIGN AND POWER  
Aim 1 (Qualitative assessment ) will use mixed -methods to adapt Amulet and MOWI for use in rural 
older obese adults. Aim 2 (Develop/refine MOWI ) and Aim 3 ( Evaluate home -based MOWI ) will explore 
feasibility/acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the above outcomes. Data will be analyzed as 
follows:  
Aim 1a ( Qualitative assessment) : Determine the acceptability, utility and perceived value of mHealth : 
Qualitative data will be managed and analyzed using Dedoose informed by [CONTACT_941] ‘grounded theory’ approach. 
Two researchers will read data and will develop codebook operational definitions from transcript coding, a validated approach on rigor in this type of research which allows for  multiple perspectives. Codes will be 
assigned to text, grouped, and checked for themes. The codebook will consist of a priori  researcher -driven 
codes, derived from interview and focus groups and inductively derived codes from qualitative data. The iterati ve process involves labeling segments reflecting experiences with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The query tool will retrieve 
text by [CONTACT_515132]. Analyses will assess within group consensus or disagreement. Themes, including 
patient -engagement, allow for refining the manual and determining feasibility/acceptability.

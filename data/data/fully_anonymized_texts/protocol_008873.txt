Title An Open -Label Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Higher
 Infusion Parameters of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous 
(Human), 20% Liquid (Hizentra®) in Subjects with Primary 
Immunodeficiency 
Study Number  IgPro20_4004

Study Product IgPro20 (Hizentra®) 
Indication  Primary immunodeficiency 
Study Summary  This multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm, non-randomized study is 
designed t
o evaluate safety and tolerability of higher infusion parameters 
of IgPro20 in subjects with primary immunodeficiency ( PID). The study 
will include 3 cohorts with a minimum of 15 subjects each as follows:  
• Pump -Assisted Volume Cohort (weekly infusions): Volume per 
injecti
on site of 25  mL up to 50 mL . 
• Pump -Assisted Flow R ate C ohort (weekly infusions): Flow rate 
per injection site of 25 mL/hour up to 100 mL/hour. 
• Manual Push Flow Rate Cohort (2 to 7 infusions per week): Flow 
rate per
 injection site of 25 to 30 mL/hour up to 120 mL/hour 
(equivalent of approximately 0.5 mL/minute up to 2 mL/minute) . 
Each cohort will test 3 (for pump- assisted  fl ow rate cohort – 4) infusion 
parameter levels, repeated at least 4 times over a duration of 12 (for flow 
rate cohort – 16) weeks. After 4 infusion weeks at  each level, qualifying 
subjects (responders) will switch to the next infusion parame ter level (eg, 
from 25 to 50 mL/h). During the study, the weekly dose will remain 
unchanged (as prescribed by [CONTACT_301607], usually within 
100 to 200 mg/kg per week range); only the respective infusion parameter under evaluation will change.  
Primary Objective(s)  The primary objective of this study is to determine  the respo nder rate at 
higher infusion parameters of IgPro20 under the following conditions: 
• Pump -Assisted: Volume per injection site of 25 mL, 40 mL, and 
50 mL . 
• Pump -A
ssisted: Flow rate per injection site of 25  mL/h, 50 m L/h, 
75 mL/h and 100 mL/h . 
• Manual Push (manual infusion using syringe without a pump): Flow rate per injection site of 30  mL/h, 60 mL/h, and 120 mL/h 
(0.5 mL/min, 1  mL/min, and 2  mL/min, correspondingly).

Secondary Objective(s)  The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety of pump-assisted IgPro20 infusions at higher infu
sion parameters (volume and flow rate).  
• To evaluate the safety of manual push IgPro20 infusions. 
• To evaluate the tol erabilit y of higher infusion parameters of 
IgPro20. 
Secondary Endpoint(s)  The secondary endpoints are as follows: 
• The rate of total adverse even ts (AEs) per subject and per 
infusion by [CONTACT_301608].  
• The rate of local reactions per subject and per infusion by [CONTACT_301609].  
• The time to onset of local reactions per subject and per infusion by [CONTACT_301610]. 
• Severity of local reactions per subject and per infusion by [CONTACT_301609].  
• Duration of local reactions per subject and per infusion by [CONTACT_301609].

 Confidential  Study Design  This multicenter, open -label, parallel -arm, non -randomized study is 
designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of higher infusion parameters 
of IgPro20 in subjects with PID. 
Number of Subjects  Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled into the study . A target  of 
45 
evaluable subjects (ie, 15 subjects per cohort) is needed . Enrolled 
subjects will include a target of  14 (30%) pediatric subjects ≤ 17 years of 
age and a target of 9 (20%) obese subjects with BMI of  ≥ 30 kg/m2. 
Pediatric and obese subjects may be distributed across any or all of the 
treatment cohorts without respect to balanced enroll ment within the 
cohorts for these subpopulations.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for an individual subject is expected to be 
[ADDRESS_368373] in the Manual Push Flow Rate and Pump- Assisted 
Volume Cohorts, and 4 months in the Pump-Assisted Flow Rate Cohort. The overall study duration (ie, first subject’s S creening visit to last 
subject’s End of Study visit) will be approximately [ADDRESS_368374]

 Confidential  1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Primar
y Immunodeficienc y 
Primary immunodeficiency (PID) represent s a variety of disorders characterized by [CONTACT_301618], 
which may be fatal if left untreated. Major clinical manifestations include multiple in fections 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_301586], opportunistic infections and failure to thrive ( Cooper et al, 
2003). PID constitutes a spectr um of more than 300 innate defects in the body’s immune 
system. They can be divided into 9 groups: disorders of humoral and cellular immunity, 
combined immunodeficiency with associated or syndromic features, predominantly antibody 
deficiency syndromes, diseases of immune dysregulation, congenital phagocyte defects , 
defects in intrinsic and innate immun ity, auto -inflammatory disorders, complement disorders, 
and phenocopi[INVESTIGATOR_301587]. Predominantly antibody deficiency syndromes are the most 
common PID subtype ( Yong et al, 2008; Bousfiha et al, 2015; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224762], 2015). P ID is 
consider
ed to be a rare disease , with the prevalence depending on the type of 
immunodeficiency ( Raje and Dinakar, 2015). Registry data from various countries estimated 
the overa
ll prevalence of PID at 1.94/100,000 (U nited Kingdom ) or 2.3/100,000 (Japan) to 
5.38/100,000 ([LOCATION_009]) and up to 30.5/100,000 (Turkey) ( Ishimura et al, 2011; Bousfiha et al, 
2013; Kilic et al, 2013).  However, current epi[INVESTIGATOR_301588] a higher overall 
preval
ence than previously thought, being estimated at up to 83.3/100,000 ( Bousfiha et al, 
2013).  
Patients with PID are not only at a higher risk for infections, but also to develop other 
conditions s
uch as chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancies and 
autoimmune diseases ( Morimoto and Routes, 2008). For the past 3 decades, immunoglobulin 
replacement
 therapy has been used for patients with all PID conditions, to prevent infections 
and infection -related complications ( Sriaroon and Ballow, 2015).  
1.1.[ADDRESS_368390] ment therapy is the  lifelong treatment for patients with PID and can 
be administered through intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous  (SC) routes ( Sriaroon and Ballow, 
 Study Number:  IgPro20_4004 
Study Product:  IgPro20  
 
CRD -TPL-077 2 December 2017  Page 22 of 76 
 Confidential  2015) , usually with special pumps . Prov iding passive immunity and ma intaining consistent 
serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations controls most of the recurrent infections and 
results in an improved quality of life for these patients ( Borte et al, 2011).  
Although both IV and SC treatment regimen s in equal doses provide a similar efficacy in the 
prevention of serious bacterial infections, there are some advantages of the SC route ( Chapel 
et al, 2000
; Sriaroon and Ballow, 2015). With SC treatmen t regime ns, smaller doses of IgG 
are given more frequently, resulting in altered pharmacokinetics (PK) with lower peak and 
higher trough levels of IgG as compared to the large boluses given less frequently, usually 
once every 3 -4 weeks, with IV infusions ( Berger, 2004). This increased stability of IgG 
concentrat
ion improves the patients’ well -being, since it reduces symptoms such as fatigue 
and myalgia at the end of the dosing cycle ( Berger, 2008). Unlike IV immunoglobulin 
(IVIG),
 SC immunoglobulin (SCIG) does not require a good venous access and therefore 
does not lead to potential problems with venous access in the fu ture due to frequent IV 
infusion ( Jolles et al, 2015). Since an IV port is also not required for SC ther apy, this is 
associated with lower risk of various infusion complications, from thrombo- embolic events to 
septicemia ( Sriaroon and Ballow, 2015).  Other  important aspect s of SCIG  treatment, since it 
can be administered at home, are  the improved quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and 
therapy convenience, in both children and adults ( Gardulf et al, 2004; Nicolay et al, 2006).  
1.1.3 Manual Push Technique  
The conventional mode of SCIG administration has been a n infusion pump, delivering IgG 
volumes of up to 25 mL per injection  site, which  can take  up to 2 hours ( Berger, 2008; 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152], 2010). Infusion pumps may be difficult to use for some patients and the potential costs mi 
ght be unfavorable ( Misbah et al, 2009). As an alternative, the manual push 
technique
, also called rapid push, has been established  in recent years for the administration 
of SCIG. It is a simple method where SCIG is given manually by [CONTACT_301619] 
a short tubing with a butterfly needle . The total weekly dose is divided into several  smaller 
doses , depending on each patient’s dose and preference. Compared to weekly pump- assisted 
infusions, infusion times are much shorter, ranging from [ADDRESS_368391]- efficient drug delivery, improved 
patient au tonomy and convenience ( Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2010 ; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013a ; Martin et al, 2013). Based 
on a retr

improving treatment satisfaction and supporting patient adherence ( Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013a ; Misbah et 
al, 2009; Shapi
[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013b; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013c ). 
1.1.4 SCIG Infusion Parameters  
The currently approved Hizentra® infusion parameters in the U nited States (US)  and abroad 
include a volume per injection site of up to 25  mL, and a flow rate of up to 25  mL/h per site 
(US package insert , European Union [ EU] package insert ), as outlined below:  
‘Volume – For the first infusion of Hizentra, do not exceed a volume of 15 mL per injection 
site. The v
olume may be increased to 20 mL per site for the fifth infusion and then to 25 mL 
per site as tolerated. 
Rate – For the first infusion of Hizentra, the recommended flow rate is 15 mL per hour per 
site. For s
ubsequent infusions, the flow rate may be increased to 25 mL per hour per site as 
tolerated’. 
Higher infusion parameters, such as an increased flow rate  and volum e per injection site , 
reduce the time needed for infusion  and decrease the number of injection sites , independent 
of the method used. An infusion of up to 60  mL per site and a flow rate of more than 60  mL/h 
using the manual push method have  been previously described . In retrospective analyses of 
adult and pediatric patients using the rapid push method, the majority of subjects reported an 
infusion time of 9 minutes or less . With a mean volume per site of 15.8  mL in adults, an 
average flow rate of 1.75  mL/min or 105  mL/h can be assumed. In the age group of 10 to 18 
years, an even higher flow rate of 1.9 mL/min (114  mL/h) can be assumed with a mean 
volume per site of 17.1 mL.  Furthermore, in obese adults (body mass index [ BMI ] ≥ 30 
kg/m2) a mean volume per site of 17.8 mL was documented, providing an average flow rate 
of 1.97  mL/min (118.67 mL/h)  without tolerability issues ( Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013a ; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013b; 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] 2013c ).

and short infusion times, a more detailed analysis of average flow rates , based on data from 
available publications, is presented in Table 1.

clinical studies with IgPro20 ( Hizentra ). In the US PID extension study, IgPro20_3001, the 
protocol allowed for up to 40  mL per site and an infusion rate of up to 35 mL/h. In the EU 
PID pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], ZLB06_001CR, the maximum infusion parameters allowed were 25  mL 
per site and 35  mL/h ( Jolles et al, 2015). The same infusion parameters have been 
successf
ully tested in IgPro20  studies conducted in Japan ( Kanegane et al, 2014). In all o f 
these studi
es, there were no safety issues related to the higher injection site volumes or rates, 
although they were not evaluated in a systematic manner and there were not enough data 
collected to be able to draw robust conclusions. Additionally, in the  recently completed  
IgPro20 study in subjects with chronic i nflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 
IgPro20_3003, injection site volumes and rates of 50 mL/site and 35 mL/h/site, respectively, 
were  allowed. A substantial number of study subjects have already used these higher infusion 
parameters without safety issues.  
In a recently published study of 20% SCIG administered to PID subjects in the US, the 
reported m
edian infusion rate was 60  mL/h/site ( range 4.4 -180) and the median infusion 
volume per injection site was 39.50  mL (range 6.4- 76.0), with 71.6% of subjects reaching a 
flow rate of at least 60  mL/h and 10.8% of subjects receiving a volume of at least 60  mL/site 
(Suez Det al, 2016). In the c orresponding EU study, 41.6% of subjects reached a maximum 
infusion rate of ≥ 40 mL/h/site, with a number of study participants injecting 20% SCIG at 
60 mL/h/site and with a volume of up to 48  mL/site  (Borte Met al, 2016).

 Confidential  The above -mentioned publications , as well as numerous personal communications from 
immunologists treating PID patients demonstrate that, in current clinical practice, Hizentra 
infusions are sometimes conducted at significantly higher than currently approved flow rate 
and volume per injection site, with or without infusion pump (by [CONTACT_301620]). The s afety 
and tolerability of these new infusion parameters and techniques has not be en evaluated in a 
systematic manner.  
Therefore, the aim of this study is to obtain safety and tolerability data of higher infusion 
paramete
rs of IgPro20 (Hizentra) in PID patients, for both pump- assisted and manual push 
techniques, allowing for greater flexibility and convenience of Hizentra infusions . 
1.2 Background Information on IgPro20 
1.2.1 Overview  
IgPro20 is a ready -to-use formulation of polyvalent SCIG. The IgG portion represents all IgG 
subclasses present in human plasma and retains all IgG function (ie , Fc receptor interaction 
site [Fc] and antigen binding fragment [Fab] mediated activity). The sterile 20% IgG solution 
is stabilized with 250 mmol/L L -proline at pH 4.8. IgPro20 also contains 8 to 30 mg/L 
polysorbate 80 (P80). IgPro20 has a low sodium content (<  10 mmol/L) and an osmolality of 
approximately 390 mOsmol/kg. 
The protein moiety of IgPro20 is highly purified IgG (≥  98% purity) . More than 90% of the 
IgG consists of monomers and dimers. IgPro20 is prepared from large donor pools and 
represents th e antibody spectrum present in the donor population. Careful selection of donors, 
as well as testing of each individual donation and the plasma pool for viral markers, helps to ensure viral safety of the finished product. 
The manufacturing process (IgG iso lation) f
 or IgPro20 is based on the manufacturing process 
for Privigen® (IgPro10). After production of the active substance solution, the final IgPro20 
product is formulated and concentrated to the higher protein content of 20%. 
IgPro20 was approved for PID in the US, the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, and 
several o
ther countries under  the trade name [CONTACT_301652].

between species. Nonclinical studies with IgPro20 focused on its SC use (local tolerance, 
PK), functionality (in vitro Fab and Fc function, in vivo efficacy in experimental allergic 
encephalomyelitis [EAE] rat model), safety regarding hypotensive effects, and repeated SC 
administrations.  
Fab and Fc functions of IgPro20 are comparable  to those of  Privigen and other marketed 
IVIG products. In the EAE rat model (a nonclinical model of human multiple sclerosis) 
IgPro20 administered SC attenuated the symptoms of EA E and led to a lower mortality.  
The bioavailability of IgPro20 was assessed after SC administration to rats on 5 consecutive 
days; a dos
e-dependent increase in area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) and 
maximum serum concentration of human IgG was found. In [ADDRESS_368395] human IgG in a dose dependent 
manner. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_301589], human IgG was detected in the serum of the 
animals; serum concentrations inc reased to a steady -state (28 -day study) with a slight decline 
in the second half of the in -life phase of the [ADDRESS_368396] level.  
IgPro20 was also tolerated locally after SC, IV, parav
 enous, and intra -arterial application in 
rabbits. 
IgPro20 contains 250 mmol/L of the non- essential amino acid L -proline as a stabilizer. 
Studies on L -proline in safety pharmacology, multiple dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity 
and in juvenile animals were conducted during development of Privi gen. Studies with IV and 
SC administration of L -proline were included. L -proline is a suitable excipi[INVESTIGATOR_301590]:  IgPro20_4004

 Confidential  the specified concentrations which was confirmed in clinical studies conducted with Privigen . 
These results were confirmed in a 28 -day repeated -dose toxicity study in rats with daily SC 
administration of L -proline performed during IgPro20 development. Considering the lower 
amount of L -proline infused with  IgPro20 compared with Privigen , due to sm aller doses in 
average weekly SCIG vs. average 3 - or 4-weekly IVIG dosing regimens and the good 
tolerability of IgPro20 administered SC to rabbits, it can be concluded that L -proline can be 
safely used as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_301591]20.  
1.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
The approval of IgPro20 for the treatment of patients with PID was based on data from 
3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_301592], Europe, and Japan (ie, studies ZLB04_009CR, ZLB06_001CR, 
and ZLB06_002CR, respectively ). In addition, extension studies to the [ADDRESS_368397] been conducted and completed: 1 study each in the US (US 
extension study IgPro20_3001), in Europe (European extension study ZLB07_002CR), and 
in Japan (follow -up study ZLB07_001CR ). A further long- term extension study in  Japan 
(IgPro20_3006) has also been completed . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 PID Study ZLB04_009CR (US Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] S tudy) 
This prospective, open- label, phase 3 study was conducted in the US and investigated the 
efficacy, safety, local tolerability, and PK of SC IgPro20 in 49 subjects with PID. Subjects previously receiving monthly treatment with IVIG were switched to weekly SC 
administration of IgPro20 for 15 months. Subjects were initially treated with 1.30 times their 
previous IVIG dose during a 12- week wash -in/wash -out period and had their IgPro20 dose 
further adjusted based on the results of the PK substudy for the subsequent 12 month efficacy period. Doses were adjusted to ensure equivalent systemic IgG exposure to IVIG as measured 
by [CONTACT_301621].  
The primary efficacy variable was the annualized rate of serious bacterial infections (SBIs, as defined i
n the Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ] Guidance for Industry [ FDA, 2013]).  
None of t
he subjects had an SBI and the annualized rate of total infections per subject was 
2.76. Overall, SC infusions with IgPro20 provided a high level of efficacy in subjects with PID in terms of passive immunity and maintaining adequate and consistent serum IgG levels. 
There were no safety concerns with the use of IgPro20.

 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 PID S tudy ZLB06_00 1CR (European Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] S tudy) 
This prospective, open- label phase 3 study was conducted in Europe that investigated the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of SC IgPro20 in 51 subjects with PID. The study 
consisted of a 12- week was h-in/wash -out followed by a 28- week efficacy period. The 
IgPro20 weekly doses administered during this study were generally equal to the subjects’ previous weekly equivalent IVIG or SCIG doses. The primary efficacy variable was a 
descriptive comparison of IgG trough levels at 6 consecutive weeks at steady -state within the 
study. During the study, the mean of individual median IgG trough levels increased by 8.1% with IgPro20 treatment (from 7.49 g/L with the previous IgG therapy to 8.10 g/L during 
Infusions 12 to 17). None of the subjects had an SBI during the efficacy period of this study  
(after washout of the previous IgG product), and only one subject had an SBI during the wash -in/wash -out period, resulting in an annualized rate of 0.03 SBIs/subject. The a nnualized 
rate of total infections was 5.18 infections/subject. Overall, it was demonstrated that SCIG 
therapy with IgPro20 is a highly effective treatment for adult and pediatric subjects with PID 
when administered at approximately 100% of the weekly equivalent doses during the 
subjects’ preceding therapy. There were no safety concerns with the use of IgPro20.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 PID study ZLB06_002CR (Japan Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] S tudy) 
This phase 3 study was conducted in Japan including 25 subjects, with a PK sub-study including 8  subjects, to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of IgPro20 in 
subjects with PID. The weekly dose of IgPro20 was the weekly equivalent dose of the previous IVIG treatment, and IgPro20 treatment included a 12- week wash -in/wash -out period  
followed by a 12- week efficacy period. The primary efficacy variable was maintenance of the 
mean of individual median IgG concentration at trough level (C
trough) values expressed via the 
ratio of geometric mean concentrations. I gG C trough values increased  by 9% with IgPro20 
treatment, from 6.53 g/L in the IVIG period to 7.15  g/L during the SCIG efficacy period, 
meeting the primary objective. I gG C trough values <5  g/L on IgPro20 therapy during the Japan 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_301593] 1 of 24 subjects. In this study, none of the subjects had an SBI. A total of 52.4% of subjects had an infection in the efficacy period, resulting in an 
annualized rate of 2.98 infections/subject. Overall, it was demonstrated that SCIG therapy 
with IgPro20 is an effective treatm ent for adult and pediatric subjects with PID in Japan when

preceding IVIG therapy. There were no safety concerns with the use of IgPro20. 
Long -term extension and follow- up studies , as outlined in Section 1.2.3, have further 
confirmed
 the high efficacy and safety of IgPro20 at steady -state dosing. In addition to safety 
data from the clinical development program, postmarketing experience with IgPro20 has 
shown the product to be well tolerated, with a similar safety profile in pediatric and g eriatric 
patients as documented for adult patients.  
1.3 Study Overview  
This is a multicenter, open- label, parallel -arm, non -randomized study designed to evaluate 
safety and tolerability of higher infusion parameters of IgPro20  in subjects with PID. 
The primary objective of this study is to characterize the responder rate at higher infu sion 
param
eters of IgPro20. Subjects will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts : Pump -Assisted 
administration with [ADDRESS_368398] volume titrations (25 mL, 40 mL, and 50 mL); Pump- Assisted 
administration with [ADDRESS_368399] flow rates per injection site (25 mL/h, 50 mL/h, 75 mL/h and 
100 mL/h) and Manual Push administration (manual infusion using syringe without a pump) 
with upward titration of flow rate per injection site of 30 mL/h, 60 mL/h, and 120  mL/h 
(0.5 mL/min, 1 mL/min, and 2 mL/min, correspondingly).  
Furthe r details of  the st udy design can be found in Section  3. 
1.[ADDRESS_368400] all adverse events ( AEs) (99% ) were mild or moderate in intensity. 
There was no dose -dependent increase in the overall rate of AEs, within the range of doses 
and flow rates tested in these studies , and there was no evidence in either study of severe 
systemic AEs.  
Adverse reactions such as local reacti ons, heada che, fatigue, nausea, pain, pruritus, rash, 
vomiting, and pyrexia  were observed during the clinical development program. In addition, in 
the postmarketing setting, reactions such as hypersensitivity, tremor, and burning sensation 
were reported, as well as rare events such as anaphylaxis, as eptic meningitis syndrome and

 Confidential  thrombotic events. SC infusions generally result in lower rates of headache and other 
systemic adverse reactions than IV infusions, which is  attributed to the more stable serum 
IgG concentrations attained with SCIG treatment.  
The risk that products manufactured from plasma could transmit an infectious agent has been 
reduced by
 [CONTACT_301622]. In addition, different complementary virus elimination processes used during the manufacture of IgPro20 
(incubation at pH 4, virus filtration, fractionation, and depth filtration) eff ectively reduce the 
potential for viral transmission. The manufacturing process was also investigated for its capacity to eliminate hamster -adapted scrapie agent 263K, which is considered to be a model 
for Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease and variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease. The results demonstrated 
substantial removal of the infectious agent by [CONTACT_301623]. To date, no viral infection related to the infusion of IgPro20 was reported. However, 
the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded.  
As previously noted, Hizentra infusions at higher than currently approved volume and flow 
rate par
ameters per injection site have been used in both clinical research and clinical practice 
without apparent safety si gnals  (see Section 1.1.4 [SCIG Infusion Parameters]). However, 
there are 
insufficient  data to allow for objective quantification of any potential increase in 
safety  risks associated with these higher infusion parameters.  
The b enefits of manual push include the use of smaller volumes per infusion compared to less 
frequent infusion schedules . Other advantages associated with manual push include the 
ability to maintain more even serum IgG concentrations with higher trough l evels compared 
to weekly or twice weekly schedule s, which could potentially confer better protection against 
infections , as well as l ower time per infusion and total time per weekly/monthly dose 
compared to  pump- assisted infusions . The u se of manual push is also associated with a 
simpler infusion technique ( ie, there  is no requirement  to load and handle a pump) and 
reduced healthcare costs as  there is no expenditure  on a pump. The b enefits of the higher 
flow rate s and volumes, as proposed for the current study, include reduced infusion time , and 
fewer injection sites per infusion.

 Confidential  A number of disadvantages are associated with use of the manual push technique, including 
the difficulty to control the  syringe to deliver a stable flow rate and the manual strength 
required to operate the syringe for several minutes.  
Overall , the associated benefi t-risk assessment of the study is considered acceptable for 
subjects enrolled in the study .

3. Study Design 
3.1 Study Design and R ationale 
This multicenter, open- label, parallel -arm, non- randomized study is designed to evaluate 
safety and tolerability of higher infusion parameters of IgPro20  in subjects with PID . The 
study will include 3 cohorts with a minimum of  15 subjects each as follows:  
• Pump -Assisted Volume Cohort (weekly  infusions):  Volu me per injection site of 
25 mL up to 50 mL . 
• Pump -Assisted Flow R ate Cohor t (weekly infusions): Fl ow rate per injection site of  
25 mL/hour up to 100 mL/hour. 
• Manual Push Flow Rate Cohort ( 2 to 7 inf usions per week): Flow rate per injection 
site of 25 to 30 mL /hour up to 120  mL/hour (equivalent of approximately 
0.5 mL/minute up to 2  mL/minute ; see Table 1). 
Each cohort will test 3 infus ion parameter levels  (for Pump -Assisted Flow Rate C ohort – 4) 
for at least 4 weeks each over a duration of 12 weeks (for Pump -Assisted Flow Rate C ohort – 
16 weeks ). After the fourth week on each level, qualifying subjects (responders) will  switch 
to the next infusion parameter level  (eg, from 25 to 50 mL/h). During the study the weekly 
dose will remain unchanged (as pr escribed by [CONTACT_301607], usually within 
100-200 mg/kg per week range ); only the respective infusion parameter under evaluation will 
change. If a subject  is unable to tolerate the respective infusion parameter level  (ie, is a non-
responder at that level, for definition see Section 11.3.5), the subject will continue study

CRD -TPL-[ADDRESS_368401]  within th e Pump -Assisted Cohort is  able to perform ≥ 3 out of 4 (75%) valid 
infusions at a certain infusion parameter level, he/she will be  considered to be a responder for 
this infusion parameter level (eg, completed 3 infusions with 50 mL/h  means  responder for 
50 mL/h) . Valid infusions do not need to be consecutive. Determination of a responder in the 
Manual Push Cohort is more complex due to the expected variable frequency of infusions per 
week for different subjects (see Section  11.3.5 for further details) . Valid infus ions in this 
cohort also do not need to be consecutive. However, each subject needs to adhere to the same 
schedule (number of infusions per week) throughout the study. 
An infusion parameter will be considered successfully achieved if at least one third o f the 
subje
cts in the corresponding cohort (5 of 15) are responders at that infusion paramet er level, 
as defin ed above. The highest achieved infusion parameter level will be used for the label 
change . The r ationale  for this is b ased on medical experience (personal communications with 
several key opi[INVESTIGATOR_301594]) . A response rate for 
reaching the top infusion parameter for each endpoint of 50% is assumed. Using a binomial distribution with 15 evaluable subjects, there will be a 94% probability that the observed 
response rate for a single e ndpoint in the study is ≥ 33%.

 dministration, all [ADDRESS_368402] a similar  
overall study design (including AE collection). A schematic overview of the study is

unintended sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated w ith the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product . 
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time the subject gives informed consent 
until the E
nd of Study (see Section 9.4 for further details).  
Adverse events may include:  
• Exacer
bation (ie , an in crease in the frequency or severity) of a pre-existing condition. 
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or 
severity of the condition during the study. 
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before  IgPro20  ad
 ministration.  
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of  IgPro20 . 
Adv
erse events do not include:  
• Events
 identified at Screening that meet exclusion criteria.  
• Medica

absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as  AEs in the following cases:  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at Screeni ng, unless a 
further increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre- existing 
condition. 
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by [CONTACT_301637] (eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by [CONTACT_254845]. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible (eg, values that are 
incompatib

Not applicable. 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: 
• Results in death – The even t must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet th is serious 
criterion.  
• Is life-threatening  – The  term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
 Study Number:  IgPro20_4004 
Study Product:  IgPro20  
 
CRD -TPL-077 2 December 2017  Page 56 of 76 
 Confidential  • Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  – CSL 
considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for at least 24  h as 
the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301600] (eg, chemotherapy) are not considered as defining 
criteria for SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a con
genital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is med
ically significant  – A medic ally significant event is defined as an eve nt that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a  qualified 
healthcare provider to potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE crite rion. 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above ca tegories are defined as nonserious AEs. 
9.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE  (ie, nonserious and serious AEs)  is to be assessed by [CONTACT_301638]:  
Severity Definition  
Mild  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
interven
tion. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specif ic thera peutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, o
r may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
CDISC SDTM Severity Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology.  
AE = adverse event.  
If AE severity is not reported (missing), it will be conservatively assessed  as a severe AE.  
9.[ADDRESS_368421] always be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. All 
AEs will be classified as either related  or not related  to IgPro20 . If a causality assessment is  
not provided  for an  AE (including an SAE ), the AE will be considered related to  IgPro20 .

CRD -TPL-077 2 December 2017  Page 57 of 76 
 Confidential  The degree of certainty with which an AE is attribute d to IgPro20  or an alternative cause (eg, 
natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by [CONTACT_254846]:  
• Known pharmacology of   IgPro20 . 
•
 Clinically and  / or p athophysiologically plausible context.  
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the lit
erature for similar products as being product -related (eg, headache, facial 
flushing, pallor ). 
• Plausibility supported by [CONTACT_254847] ( eg, the  event being related by 
[CONTACT_301639]20 , IMP withdrawal  or 
reproduced on  rechallenge). 
9.4 Observation Period for Adverse Events  
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and finish with 
the End of Study visit.  
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has started after the observation period has 
finished
, and the event is considered to be associated with  IgPro20 , then this must be reported 
to CSL.  
9.5 Adverse Event Reporting 
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation , the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs 
have occurred. AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF. If known, the medical 
diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference  to the listing of individual signs and 
symptoms.  The investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution  or 
stabilization. If an AE is ongoing after the End of Study visit, the AE will continue to be 
followed up until resolution, stabiliza tion, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Subjects who 
drop out of the study  due to reasons other than ‘consent withdrawn’  or ‘lost to follow -up’ will 
be followed up by [CONTACT_301640] , in order  to collect information  on AEs .

Not applicable. 
9.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Def initions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
For SAEs occurring during the study , the investig ator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the e CRF .  
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to  
IgPro20, must
 be entered into the eCRF immediately (within 24  h of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event) .  
Adverse events occurring in the period between the time the subject gave written informed 
consent 
and the first exposure to IgPro20  that meet [ADDRESS_368423] be reported immediately (ie, within 24  h of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event) to CSL . 
9.6.1 Requirements for Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The minimum reporting requirements for reporting of SAEs include:  
• Identifiable subject. 
• Suspected
 medicinal product and  / or proc edure. 
• Event term. 
• Identi
fiable reporting source. 
 Study Number:  IgPro20_4004 
Study Product:  IgPro20  
 
CRD -TPL-[ADDRESS_368424]:  
• Report all SAEs to the relevant Institution al Review Board  / Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB / IEC) within the timeframe  specified by [CONTACT_1201] / IEC. 
• Enter  follow-up informa tion in the eCRF  until the SAE has resolved, or, in the case of 
permanent impairmen t, until stabilized . 
• Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF . 
If the m
inimum requirement s for r eporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to 
receive additional informati on to fully document the event . 
In cases  of death, the investigator should supply CSL and t he IEC  / IRB (as applicable) with 
any additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical 
reports).  
9.6.2 Unusual Failure of Efficacy (Canadian sites only)  
For study sites located in Canada only , unusual failure of efficacy is also to be reported to 
CSL using the same process and requirements as for serious adverse events in order to 
comply with Health Canada’s Food and Drug Regulations . The rationale for thi s is if a health 
product fails to produce the expected intended effect, there may be an adverse outcome for the patient, including an exacerbation of the condition for which the health product is being 
used.   In cases where the investigator is uncertain whether an adverse event should be 
considered as a report of unusual failure in efficacy, the adverse event should be treated as such and reported accordingly.

9.7.1 Medication Compliance  
Details of actual doses of  IgPro20 admini stered (ie, volume, location of infusions, infusion 
rate) will be recorded in the subject eDiary or a back- up paper diary if the eDiary is not 
available. Once the eDiary becomes available, the data recorded in the back -up paper diary

starting at or after the next infusion following the infusion leading to non-response, will be 
listed  and flagged , and analysed separately from the AEs reported prior to that time . 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_301642]. Rates per 
infusion will 
be presented as well.  Adverse events will be  presented including a virtual 
System Organ Class comprising local reaction (identified by [CONTACT_301643] s: “administration site reactions NEC”, “infusion site 
reactions”, and “injection site reactions”) an d by [CONTACT_926]. Further, time to onset and duration 
will be presented descriptively. Tolerability of a certain infusion parameter within a cohort 
will be calculated as ‘number of infusions without severe local reaction / number of all 
infusions’ and be presented by [CONTACT_301616]. All infusions, regardless of the validity of the procedure (see Section 11.3.5 ) will be considered. 
11.3.4 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Data  
Not applicable. 
11.3.5 Other Analyses  – Infusion Parameters  
For the primary endpoints, number and percentage of subjects with response will be 
provided.  
If a subject is a non -responder at a certain infusion parameter level, data collected up to the 
time of non-response are taken into account for the analysis of response. Data collected at the 
individually tolerable infusion parameter lev el after the non- response in th e subject will not 
be included in the analysis of response  but will only be listed and flagged . 
Percentages will be calculated as follows:  
a) An infusion will be considered ‘valid’ if the subject completes the full dose  per 
scheduled infusion parameter (volume or flow rate) under test without interruptions or 
decrease during that infusion as detailed in Table 6. Other protocol deviations may 
also lea
d to invalidation of an infusion. Protocol deviations will be treated on an 
infusion basis, not on a subject basis .

Cohort  Criteria for a valid infusion  
Pump assisted volume 
cohort  • Maximum volume administered per injection site is at least 95% of the 
planned maximum volume (ie, 25 mL, 40  mL or 50 mL) for at least one 
injection site  
and 
• Infusion was not interrupted or stopped prematurely for any reason as 
documented in the eDiary   
and 
• Total dose administered is at least 95% of the planned dose  
Pump assisted flow rate 
cohort  • Injection site flow rate is at least 95% of the planned flow rate (ie, 25  mL/h, 
50 mL/h, 75  mL/h or 100 mL/h) for at least one injection site.  
and 
• Infusion was not  interrupted or stopped prematurely for any reason as 
documented in the eDiary   
and 
• Total dose administered is at least 95% of the planned dose  
Manual push cohort  • The actual infusion duration is not more than 1 minute or 10% (whichever is 
larger) longer t han the calculated infusion duration based on the desired flow 
rate (ie, 0.5  mL/min, 1  mL/min, or 2  mL/min) and the actual volume infused.  
and   
• The actual infusion volume is at least 95% of the planned infusion volume for 
that infusion day.  
b) For the Pump- Assisted Cohorts, a subject is considered as a ‘responder’ for a certain 
infusion parameter if he/she has performed ≥3 valid infusions (see a ) for that infusion 
parameter in any order , ie, not necessarily consecutive). 
c) For the Manual Push  Flow Rat e Cohort , a subject is considered as a ‘responder’ for a 
certain infusion parameter  if he/she has performed ≥k valid infusions (see a) for that 
infusion parameter in any order , ie, not necessar ily consecutive) during the 4  weeks 
planned for that infusion parameter level , where k is specified in Table 7.

 Confidential  The success criterion for any R c,p will be considered fulfilled if R c,p ≥ 33%. Within each 
cohort, the highest infusion parameter with fulfilled success criterion will be considered the 
new top infusion parameter to be recommended for the Hizentra label.  No formal statistical 
testing will be performed.  All subjects included in the Safety Population of a cohort will be 
included in the denominator for calculation of R c,p.  
Rationale for number of valid infusions to qualify a responder  in the manua l push cohort : The 
probability for a subject to be a responder for a certain infusi on parameter is assumed to be 
50% irrespective of the value of the infusion parameter itself , ie, identical to the assumed 
response rate in Section  11.[ADDRESS_368432] to interrupt the infusion or change the infusion 
parameters. To achieve ≥  3 out of 4 valid infusions the probability for a single infusion to be 
valid has to be ≥  61% for pump assisted cohorts. Using this 61% success probability for a 
single infusion in the manual push cohort the minimum of successes ( k) in above table 
corresponds to a probability for a subject to be a responder of at least 50%.  
The primary endpoints will be considered and evaluated independently from each other. 
No imputation of missing data will be performed.  
Descriptive subgroup analyses will be performed for Infusion Parameters by :  
• Age clas
s (≤ 17 years , > 17 years) .

13. Regulatory and Ethics Considerations  
13.1 Regulatory Considerations  
CSL or its agents will submit the appropriate documents to the local regulatory agencies and 
will a wait approval before study start. 
This study will be conducted under a  Clinic al Trial Agreement between the sponsor (or 
delegate) and the respective institutio ns representing the study sites and documented in 
accordance with the applicable regulatory guidelines and requirements. 
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that CSL and the 
inv
estigator abide by [CONTACT_301644], 
evaluation and documentation of this study, as described in ICH Topic E6 (Guideline for 
GCP ). The study will also be carried out according to all applicable international and national 
regulatory requirements. 
13.[ADDRESS_368435] / Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator must submit the protocol and informed consent forms (ICFs) for review by 
[CONTACT_301645] (according to local guidelines) IRB /IEC. Written 
approval must be received from the IRB/IEC before commencement of the study . 
13.[ADDRESS_368436]  be implemented in 
this clinical study before protocol -specifi ed procedures are carried out. Information should be 
given in both oral and written form whenever possible and deemed appropriat e by [CONTACT_5040]/ IEC. Subjects, their relatives (or if necessary, legally acceptable  representatives) must be 
given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study.

CRD -TPL-[ADDRESS_368437]’s 
participation in the study (eg, a change in any procedure), the ICF must be amended to 
incorporate this modification. Subject must be informed of the change and they must sign th e 
amended ICF indicating that they r e-consent to participate in the study.  
13.[ADDRESS_368438] (eg, name, address, phone number and identity in the study) so that regulatory 
agencies or CSL may access this inf ormation should the need arise.  These records should be 
retained in a confidential manner as long as legally mandated according to local 
requirements. 
Subject me dical records pertaining to the s tudy may be inspected/ audited at any time by [CONTACT_254864], a regulatory authority or the IRB/IEC. All 
records accessed will be strictly confidential. Consent to participate in the s tudy includes  
consent to these inspections/ audits. 
13.5 Indemnity and Compensation  
It is CSL policy that persons who participate in CSL’s  clinical studies should be no worse off 
for their having been involved in the study . These persons include the subjects/ volunteers, the 
investigator, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254798]/IEC. 
CSL has taken out insurance to cover its obligations under both the Indemnity and the 
Compensati
on guidelines for injury to subject s involved in the s tudy.

 Confidential  14. Administrat ive Considerations 
14.1 Clinical Trial Agreement  
This study will be conducted under a Clinical Trial Agreement between CSL (“Sponsor”) and 
the institution(s) representing the investigationa l study site(s) (“Authority”). Financial 
support to  the investigational site(s) will be detailed in  the Clinical Trial Agreement. The 
Clinical Trial Agreement must be signed before the commencement of the study and will 
clearly delineate the responsibilities and obligations of investigator and CSL, and will form 
the contractual basis under which the clinical study will be conducted.  
14.2 Clinical Study Registration and Results Disclosure   
CSL will provide the relevant study protocol information in public database (s) before  or at 
commencement of the stu dy. CSL  may also provide study information for inclusion in 
national registries according to local regulatory requirements . 
Results of this study will be disclosed according to the relevant regulatory requirements. All publications
 in peer -reviewed medical  journals resulting from this study will be listed in the 
original study protocol registration record. 
14.3 Implementation  of the Protocol / Protocol Amendment(s) 
With the exception of medical emergencies, no changes or deviations in the conduct of the 
signed protocol will be permitted without documented approval of the CSL Medical Monitor 
and the IRB/IEC.  In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator at the study site will 
institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. However, all such procedures  must be 
promptly reported to the CSL Medical Monitor and the IRB/IEC. 
Modifications to the protocol that may  affect su bject safety or the way the study is to be 
conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC.  
Adminis trative changes to the protocol, defined  as minor corrections and/ or clarifications that 
have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted, will not require IRB/ IEC approval, 
but will be submitted to the  IRB/IEC for their information .

 Confidential  14.4 Protocol Deviations 
All instances where the requirements of the study protocol were not c omplied with will be 
tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of  the 
investigator and/or CSL.  Study protocol deviations arise when subjects who have been 
entered in the study deviate from the IRB/IEC -approved study protocol.  
If a major protocol deviation (ie, a deviation that could have  a significant effect on the  
subject’s s afety, rights, or welfare and/ or on the integrity of the study  data) occurs, the 
investigator must notify CSL and the appropriate IRB/IEC as soon as possible or as per local 
requirements.  
An infusion will be considered ‘valid’ if performed according to the predefined time, total 
volume, and 
infusion rate. Any deviat ion from these for each infusion parameter step will 
disqualify the infusion and be considered a ‘failure’ in the analysis of this set of infusion parameters. However, if it is condu cted as stated in Section 11.3.5, it can be evaluated for the 
actual param 
eter as conducted. For example, if a subject was scheduled to a test volume of 
50 mL/site, but for some reasons tested 45 mL/site, it will not count  for the 50 mL level, but 
if that infusion w as otherwise uneventful and performed  in full without interruption, it will be 
considered valid for the 45 mL/site level, e ven though it was not planned.  
Protocol deviations may result in an invalid infusion eve n if the re is adherence to the inf usion 
parameters , as stated above. These include, but are not limited to, prohibited concomitant 
medication use. Full details regarding validation failure will be included in  the statistical 
analysis plan.

14.5.1 Data Collection  
The investigator (or delegate) will maintain individual records for each subject. These records should include dates when a subject visited the study site, records of vital signs, medical 
history, or physical examinations, administration of IgPro20  or concomitant therapy, any AEs 
experienced, a nd other notes as appropriate. These record s constitute source data.

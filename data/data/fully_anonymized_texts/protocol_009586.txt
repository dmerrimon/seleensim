4.1 Age-Related Macular Degeneration  
Age-related macular degeneration  (AMD)  is a disease characterized by [CONTACT_645804] , a small area in the central portion of the 
retina.  AMD is characteristically a disease of the elderly and is the leading cause of 
blindness in individuals >50 years of age in developed countries  (Van Newkirk et 
al., 2000) . In the [LOCATION_002], it is estimated that approximately 6% of individuals 
65-74 years o f age, and 20% of those older than 75 years of age are affected with 
AMD (Leibowitz et al., 1980) . Because of increasing life expectancy in developed 
and developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], the elderly sector of the general population is expected to 
increase at the greatest rate in coming decades  (Ortma & Velkof, 2014) .  While 1 in 
8 Americans was considered to be elderly in 1994 , it is expected that 1 in 5 will fall 
into this category by 2030  (Day, 1993; Hobbs, 1996 ).  Projections based on U.S. 
Census Bureau data suggest that  the number of Americans over the age of 65 will  
more than double , increasing it to 80 million by [CONTACT_645805] (Day, 
1993) .  In the absence of adequate prevention or treatment measures, the number 
of cases of AMD with visual loss is expected to gr ow in parallel with the aging 
population . 
AMD  is classified into one of two general subgroups; the non -neovascular ( “dry”) 
form of the disease and the neovascular ( “wet”) form of the disease.  The non -
neovascular  dry form of AMD is more prevalent, accounti ng for approximately 90% 
of all AMD cases . It is characterized b y degeneration of the macula , and with 
continued progression over multiple years, may ultimately  result in atrophy of the 
central retina associated with central  vision los s.  By [CONTACT_22242], neovascular AMD, 
although less prevalent, is more likely to cause  sudden, often substantial, loss of 
central vision  (Holz et al., 2014) . 
Dry AMD  is a significant cause of moderate and severe loss of central vision and is 
bilateral in most patients (Maguire & Vine, 1986; Potter & Thallemer, 1981; Sarks et 
al., 1988; Schatz & McDonald, 1989; Sunness et al., 199 9).  In dry AMD, thinning o f 
the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_86154] (RPE) in the macula  develops, along with other 
age-related changes to the adjacent retinal tissue layers  (Holz et al., 2014) . Dry 
AMD is characterized by [CONTACT_645806] (yellow crystalline deposits that 
develop within the macula)  located under the RPE  (Holz et al., 2014) . When severe, 
dry AMD results  in marked thinning and/or atrophy of the macula, resulting from the 
loss of t he RPE and associated capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_167583]). This form of late stage 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 10                                        28 March  2018 dry AMD is associated with thinning and loss of function of the neural retinal located 
above the affected RPE (McL eod et al ., 2009) . This collective phenotype in late 
stage dry AMD is termed  geographic atrophy (GA) . The progressive  degeneration 
of light -sensitive photoreceptor cells  in GA leads to severe visual loss  in affected 
eyes. In addition,  dry AMD can progress to the wet form of the disease  (Holz  et al.,  
2014). 
Although  dry AMD  is the most common form of the disease, currently no approved 
therap y exists. The absence of treatment options for dry AMD represents  an area of 
urgent  unmet medical need , and a major public health concern for the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_645797].   
 
4.[ADDRESS_864557]  
The etiology of AMD is not completely understood  (Frederick & Kleinman, 2014) .  In 
addition to advanced age, environmental and genetic risk factors for AMD  are well 
recognized, including ocular pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], dietary factors, family history for AMD, 
hypertension , and smoking (Klein et al., 2004 ). Research also  indicate s that 
inflammation is a major contributor  to the  pathogenesis  of AMD  (P.S. Bora  et al. , 
2005) . 
Mounting evidence suggests that both the wet and dry forms of AMD may involve  
an inflammatory process  (Bok, 2005; Donoso et al., 2006) . Patients with AMD are 
known to have elevated systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive 
protein (CRP) , interleukin -6 (IL-6), and homocysteine (Bok, 2005; Seddon et al., 
2005) . Furthermore, surgically excised choroidal neovascular tissue in patients with 
AMD contains inflammatory cells  (Grossniklaus et al., 2005) .   
The role  for complement  (C)-mediated inflammation in  AMD is highlighted  by 
[CONTACT_645807], which suggest that approximately 50% of 
AMD cases have polymorphism in complement regulatory proteins compared to 
age-matched controls  (Edwards et al., 2005; Hageman et al., 2005; Haines et al., 
2005; Klein et al., 2005; Narayanan et al., 2007) . Furthermore , polymorphism in 
genes coding for complement or complement regulatory proteins confer an  
increased risk in age -related macular degeneration . 
The complement pathway involves a complex system of serum proteins as a part of 
the innate immune system which interacts  in a cascade  (Holers, 2014) . The 
complement cascade is activated via the classical (antibody -dependent), the 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 11                                        28 March  2018 alternative (antibody -independent) , and the lectin pathways  (Holers, 2014) . Recent 
studies have implicated local inflammation and activation of the complement 
cascade in drusen formation (Hageman et al., 2001; Seddon et al., 2006) .  
Additionally, the complement components of drusen may induce vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF ) up-regulation , and therefore contribute to the 
formation of  neovascular AMD  (Nozaki et al., 2006) . Preclinical laser -induced 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models hav e also implicated complement 
activation  (P.S. Bora et al., 2005) . In experimental models of CNV , membrane 
attack complex (MAC: C5b -9) formation has been shown to be important  (Nozaki et 
al., 2006) . The MAC results in  pore formation  in affected cells that eventually lead 
to cell death  (Holers, 2014) . Inhibition of the alternate pathway of complement 
activation le ads to a reduction in pro-angiogenic factors and decreased CNV 
formation in models of experimental CNV (N. S. Bora et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 
2000) .  
The results from two recently completed clinical studies, with different molecules 
designed to block the complement pathways, have further substantiated the proof 
of co ncept for this approach in GA (Hariri et al., 2015 ; OPH2001 ). 
 
4.2.1  Non-Clinical Efficacy  
Preclinical data demonstrating t he anti -C5 properties of Zimura™ are described in 
detail in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).  
 
4.2.2  Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Zimura™ 
The sponsor has performed supportive non-clinical pharmacology studies with 
Zimura™, and, in some cases, with related aptamers.   
 
 
 
 
These safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any effects on cardiovascular,

Further information regarding the p harmacology of Zimura™ is presented in detail in

Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 13                                        28 March  2018 conjunctival hemorrhage (4 patients, 9%), corneal edema (4 patients, 9%), and dry 
eye (3 patients , 6%).  No other study ey e AEs were reported by [CONTACT_645808]. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. There were 2 
patients with AEs of severe intensity: gastrointestinal inflammation and 
nasopharyngitis.  
Five patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), namely  device failure, 
pelvic fracture, angina pectoris, chest pain, gastrointestinal inflammation , but none 
were related to the study drug or injection procedure. There were no 
discontinuations due to AEs.  
Vital signs and laboratory assessments did not show any particular clinically 
significant patterns or changes. Study eye (SE) ophthalmic examinations were 
mostly normal. There were some transient findings post -injection 
(conjunctiva/sclera and corn ea) which resolved prior to the next injection. Vitreous 
haze was also reported for a few patients. IOP showed a small mean increase 
following injections but no indication of any cumulative increase.  Visual acuity  (VA) 
assessments did not show any safety concerns . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
   

 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page [ADDRESS_864558] e intravitreous injections of Zi mura™ in 
combination with Lucentis® 0.5mg was evaluated in subjects with wet AMD 
(OPH  2000). In this study, 60 patients received doses of 0.03  mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg , or 
2 mg of Zimura™. Zimura™ was well  tolerated and no particular safety concerns 
were identified.  
Further, VA assessment for the treatment naïve patients who received 6 injections 
at the dose levels of 0.3 mg, 1 mg , or 2 mg indicated a trend towards a mean 
increase in VA (number of Early Tre atment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS ] 
letters) from baseline at all time  points.  At Week 24, there was an overall 
improvement in VA from baseline of 13.[ADDRESS_864559] improvement 
seen for the 2 mg dose group (15.3 letters).   
Taken together, the re is a rationale to further investigat e the antagonism of C5 
component of complement cascade  by [CONTACT_645809]™ in dry AMD subjects with GA.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_864560] that the activation of the complement system plays a major 
role in the pathogenesis and progression of both dry and wet AMD. These include 
genetic  studies , histopathological  studies , non -clinical in vivo  studies , and 
evaluation of systemic biomarkers in patients at risk  (Bok, 2005; Donoso et al., 
2006; Edwards et al., 2005; Grossniklaus et al., 2005; Hageman et al., 2005; 
Haines et al., 2005) .  
Much of the scientific foundation implicating the complement system is derived from 
seminal studies from multiple independent labs, published in 2005  (Edwards et al., 
2005; Hageman et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2005; Klein et al., 2005; Narayanan et 
al., 2007) . These studies infer that approximately  50% of the dry and wet  forms of 
AMD may have underlying activation of the complement system. Further , the 
Y402H variant of the complement factor H (CFH) gene has been shown to be 

 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 15                                        28 March  2018 strongly associated with geographic atrophy in the populations of various countries 
([LOCATION_002] of America , [LOCATION_008] , Netherlands, Iceland ) (Magnusson et 
al., 2006; Seddon et al., 2007; Sepp et al., 2006) .  
 
Histopathologic studies confirming the presence of complement activation in AMD 
have also been published (Grossniklaus et al., 2005 ). In a monkey pedigree wi th 
macular degeneration manifested by [CONTACT_645810], the se drusen were strongly reactive with antibodies against 
complement C5 (Umeda et al., 2005a)  and the membrane attack complex (MAC, 
the terminal C5b -9 complement complex) (Umeda et al., 2005b) . A study of  eyes 
from more than [ADDRESS_864561] also been shown to be present in drusen (Anderson et al., 
2002) . 
 
Therefore , preclinical models, clinical and genetic studies  implicate  the activation  of 
the complement cascade in AMD (Bok, 2005; Donoso et al., 2006; Edwards et al., 
2005; Hageman et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2005) . Inhibition of complement 
activation may potentially slow down or arrest the underlying pathobiology  of 
macular degeneration.  Thus, mole cules involved in regulation and inhibition of 
complement activation are prime targets for therapeutic intervention in AMD.   
Zimura™ is currently  being developed by [CONTACT_511570] . for the treatment of dry 
and wet AMD.  Zimura™ is a pegylated RNA aptamer .  It is a potent and specific 
inhibitor of complement activation.  Zimura™ inhibits C5, a central component of the 
complement cascade, which plays multiple roles in innate immunity and 
inflammatory diseases. Inhibition of this key step in the complement cascade at the 
level of C5 prevents the formation of key terminal fragments (C5a and C5b -9) 
regardless of which initial activation  pathway (alternate, classical , or lectin) induced 
their generation. The C5a fragment is an important inflammatory activator that 
induces  vascular permeability, and both recrui ts and activat es phagocyte s. C5b is 
involved in the formation of membrane attack complex (M AC: C5b -9) which initiates 
cell lysis. By [CONTACT_645811] C5 -mediated inflammatory and MAC activities, 
therapeutic benefit may be achieved in both dry and wet AMD .

11 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
The following  summarizes the statistical approaches that will be employed in this 
trial designed to compare the effects of 2  mg and 4  mg doses of Zimura™ against 
the Sham control arm, regarding geographic atrophy secondary to Dry AMD.  
  
11.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -masked,  Sham controlled   study that will 
obtain evidence regarding the effects of multiple dose levels of Zimura™ in reducing 
the rate of GA growth over 12 months, when compared with the Sham control.   
 
This  trial will provide evidence suggesting that a dose of Zimura™:  
• Is not plausibly more efficacious than the Sham control, and should be 
discarded  in its current formulation in this indication;  
• Is plausibly more efficacious than the Sham control and should be evaluated 
definitively in a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial; or  
• Is more efficacious than the Sham control, with strength of evidence meeting  the 
standard requirement of a 0.[ADDRESS_864616] the Sham control.  
A confirmatory trial likely would be required for regulatory approval.  

 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 46                                        28 March  2018  
Eligible subjects  that consent to participate will be randomized to Zimura™ or Sham 
control in two parts of the trial.  In Part 1, approximately 77 subjects  are randomized 
to Zimura™ 1 mg vs Zimura™ 2 mg vs Sham control, in a 1:1:1 allocation.  In Part 2, 
approximately 200 subjects  are randomized to Zimura™ 2 mg vs Zimura™ 4 mg vs 
Sham control, in a 1:2:2 allocation.   A total of approximat ely 2 77 subjects  are to be 
randomized .  
11.2 Endpoints  
11.2.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
• Mean rate of change in GA over 12 months measured by 
[CONTACT_645803] (FAF) at three time points: Baseline, Month 6, 
Month 12 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed from Baseline to Month 12: 
 
• Mean change in best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS letters) from Baseline 
to Month 12  
 
• Mean change in low luminance best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS letters) 
from Baseline to Mont h 12 
 
11.2.2  Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability endpoints : 
• All adverse events reported, whether or not deemed related to the injection 
procedure or study treatment  
• All SAEs , whether or not deemed related to the injection procedure or study 
treatment  
• Laboratory data (blood:  hematology, renal function, hepatic function, and 
electrolytes; urinalysis)  
• Ophthalmic variables (IOP, ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiograms, 
FAF, and OCT)  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead ECG  
 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 47                                        28 March  2018 11.3 Determination of Sample Size and Statistical Rationale  
 
The sample size determination for this study is based on  screening 
methodology presented in Fleming and Richardson (2004). The power calc ulations 
are based on the recently released results f rom a  clinical trial of a complement 
inhibi tor, including the estimated precision of the estimated effects on rate of GA 
growth over [ADDRESS_864617] size for Zimura™.   
 
A total of  approximately  [ADDRESS_864618] on the rate of GA growth over 18 months will be 
statistically assessed if statistical significance is achieved on the rate of GA growth 
over 12 months.   
 
 the primary analyse s will be based on  comparisons of 
Zimura™ 2 mg vs the Sham control, and Zimura™ 4 mg vs Sham control.  For the 
comparison of Zimura™ 2 mg vs Sham control, the 2 6 subjects  randomized to 
Zimura™ 2 mg and 2 6 subjects  randomized to Sham control from Part 1 will be 
combined with the 40 subjects  randomized to Zimura™ 2 mg and 80 subjects  
randomized to Sham control from Part 2, where the analysis will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_9524] 1 vs Part 2.  The comparison of Zimura™ 4 mg vs Sham control will be based 
on the 80 subjects  randomized to each of these two arms in Part 2.  
 
The primary analysis  for each of the two pairwise comparisons 
of an active dose of Zimura™ vs the Sham control is formally based o n a three -
category decision guideline.  To be specific, the decision guideline for this trial is 
based on whether the estimated reduction in rate of GA growth over 12 months for 
a dose of Zimura™ versus Sham control is less than 14%, is from 14% up to 24.5 %, 
or is at least 24.5%.   
 
Note that these categories should not be interpreted as providing strict decision 
rules but rather as guidelines that will be factored into a broader scientific 
assessment of the benefit to risk profile of the Zimura™ dose regim en.  This broader 
assessment will include consideration of safety, of supportive efficacy endpoints, 
and of relevant information external to this trial.  Specifically, the decision guidelines 
for this trial are:  
 

 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 48                                        28 March  2018 1. If the estimated reduction in the rate of G A growth over 12 months is less 
than 14%, then this dose of Zimura™ is not plausibly more efficacious than 
the Sham control; its utility in this indication should be reconsidered.  
2. If the estimated reduction in the rate of GA growth over 12 months is from 
14% to up to 24.5%, then this dose of Zimura™ is plausibly more efficacious 
than the Sham control and should be evaluated in a subsequent Phase 3 
clinical trial.  
In planning the design of the confirmatory Phase 3 trial s, this trial (and other 
information t hat emerges during the conduct of this trial) will provide 
important insights through consideration of:  
a. The estimated benefit -to-risk profile of this dose of Zimura™; 
b. Possible refinements in the dose/schedule of Zimura™ 
c. Approaches to improve adherence to the Zimura™ regimen;  
d. Modifications to defining eligibility criteria to enhance enrichment;  
e. Approaches to achieving timely accrual of study participants at centers 
with established ability to provide high quality implementation of  the trial 
and high quality data.  
3. If the estimated reduction in the rate of GA growth over [ADDRESS_864619] 
24.5%, then this dose of Zimura™ would be statistically significantly more 
effective than the Sham control, with strength of evidence meeting t he 
standard requirement of a 0.0125 one -sided false positive error rate 
(incorporating an adjustment for multiplicity arising from comparing each 
dose with the Sham control ). 
 
The operating characteristics for this three -category decision guideline are:  
 
1. The false -positive error rate of the screening procedure is low.  In particular, 
if a given dose of Zimura™ truly provides no improvement in the rate of GA 
growth over 12 months, then there is only a 10% chance of bringing that 
dose forward  to a Phase 3 trial and only a 1.25% chance of reaching the 
false positive conclusion that that dose regimen provides a statistically 
significant improvement in efficacy relative to a Sham control.   Given that 
there will be two pairwise comparisons, if bo th doses of Zimura™ truly 
provide no improvement in the rate of GA growth over [ADDRESS_864620] one dose regimen likely would be in the range of 15% to 17% (when 
one tak es into account the positive correlation between these two 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 49                                        28 March  2018 assessments), and the probability of reaching a conclusion that at least one 
dose regimen provides a statistically significant improvement in efficacy 
relative to a Sham control is only 2.5%.   
2. The false -negative error rate is low.  If a given dose of Zimura™ truly 
provides a 28% reduction in the rate of GA growth over 12 months, then 
there is only a 10% chance that that dose of Zimura™ would be discarded, 
and thus a 90% chance that it would be eval uated in a subsequent 
confirmatory Phase 3 trial. Given that there will be two pairwise comparisons, 
if both doses of Zimura™ truly provide a 28% reduction in the rate of GA 
growth over 12 months, then it is likely (when one takes into account the 
positive  correlation between these two assessments) that there is at least a 
95% chance that at least one dose would be evaluated in a subsequent 
confirmatory Phase 3 trial.  If a given dose of Zimura™ truly provides a 28% 
reduction in the rate of GA growth over 1 2 months, there is a 63% chance 
that that regimen will have a statistically significant improvement in efficacy 
(at one -sided p<0.0125) relative to the Sham control.  
 
11.4 Randomization Procedure  
Subjects will be centrally allocated to one of the three treatment groups stratified by 
[CONTACT_645817]:  
• Baseline visual a cuity < 50 ETDRS letters (20/100 Snellen equivalent ) vs > 
50 ETDRS letters  
• Size of baseline g eographic atrophy (< 4 disc areas vs >4 disc areas)  
• Pattern of Fundus Auto Fluorescence (FAF) at the junctional zone of GA 
(None/focal vs banded /diffuse)  
Randomization will be performed using an IRT system based on the stratification 
information above to r andomize each subject and assign a treatment arm.  
The IRT system will be used to assign masked study kits to subjects throughout the 
duration of the trial. All study medication must be dispensed using the IRT system. 
At each dispensing visit  the IRT system will allocate each study drug kit(s) using the 
kit number on the label of the study medication kit.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_864621]’s treatment assignment.  
 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 50                                        28 March  2018 For subjects receiving both Zimura™ and Sham injections, the Zimura™ injection 
must be administered first. To maintain masking, the IRT system will provide 
instructions as to which kit is to be administered first at each dispensing visit. These 
instructions are located on the IRT confirmation of drug assignments, which is 
provided for each dispensing visit. This information must be communicated to the  
unmasked injector and stored with subject’s  study documentation.   
 
Within each study drug kit there is a dosing label which indicates the amount of 
medication to be administered to the subject, based upon the randomized treatment 
arm of the subject. This  dosing label may only be seen by [CONTACT_645818].  
 
In the case of a rare emergency where , in the Investigators opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , unmasking the 
treatment is necessary to evaluate a further course of action, the Investigator 
should access the IRT and follo w the instructions to initiate unmasking. Every effort 
should be made to contact [CONTACT_645819] a subject. Any 
unmasking should be reported to the unmasked contact [CONTACT_645820].  
 
In the event of an unmasking , the Investigator will be informed of the subjects 
randomized treatment assignment. Any unmasking information must be stored 
separately from the subject's study files in a secure location to ensure the treatment 
assignment remains masked to other site, CRO  and sponsor personnel as required.  
The IRT system will generate an email notification that does not contain unmasking 
information , which will be sent to the Investigator and appropriate Sponsor 
personnel.  
 
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_864622]/ophthalmologist, who will be 
masked to the subjec t’s treatment as well as previous visual acuity assessments.

recent protocol refraction.  
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_864623] a minimum of two ophthalmologi sts – the 
unmasked injector and the masked assessor.  The unmasked injector will perform 
the Zimura™/Sham injection as well as the post -injection ophthalmic exam and 
tonometry measurements. The unmasked injector and designated unmasked 
assistants (if neede d) are not permitted to be involved in the conduct of the study in 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 51                                        28 March  2018 any other manner and are not to communicate with any other personnel or subjects 
regarding the treatment assignment.  The masked assessor will perform all other 
physician assessments includ ing the relationship of all adverse events to study 
drug, including those noted by [CONTACT_559927].  
 
11.5.3  Statistical Analyses  
All statistical analyses will be performed by a statistical office independent of the 
study Sponsor. The Sponsor and the subjects will remain masked to treatments 
until the end of the study, except if safety considerations justify breaking the code 
for individual subjects.  
 
11.6 Analytical Considerations  
11.6.1  Analytical Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide the details n ecessary for the statistical 
analyses to be explicitly pre -specified prior to unmasking.   The methods for 
imputation of post -baseline, missing data will be specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan. 
 
11.6.2  Significance Levels  
The overall  (one-sided) false posi tive error rate in this trial, accounting for the 
conduct of two pairwise comparisons with Sham control , is 0.[ADDRESS_864624] be attributed to chance.   
 
11.6.4  Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted on all randomized and treated subjects  
according to the intention -to-treat principle .  
For normal endpoints, treatment groups will be co mpared through an analysis of 
variance including stratification factors.

or Cochran -Mantel -Haensze l ² tests adjusting for strata as above.  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_864625] one 
administration of trial drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized using MedDRA terms. The incidence  and 
severity of adverse events will be listed and grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
All laboratory data will be listed and values falling outside normal ranges will be 
identified. Summary statistics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and 
maximum) wil l be presented for all continuous variables.  
Summary statistics will be given on the number of subjects for whom the trial 
medication had to be permanently stopped.  
 
12 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as follows:  Any untoward me dical occurrence in a patient or 
subject including unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship to this treatment.  
Adverse events include illnesses with onset during the trial, or exacerbations of pre -
existing illnesses. Exacerbation of pre -existing illness is defined as a significant 
increase in the severity of the illness as compared to the start of the trial and should 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page [ADDRESS_864626] requires new or additional treatment for that illness.  
Lack of or insufficient clinical response or efficacy should not be recorded as an 
adverse event.  
In addition, clinically significant changes in objective findings (e.g., labo ratory, ECG, 
X-ray, physical examination) should also be considered as to whether they are 
adverse events.  The criteria for determining whether an objective finding should be 
reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
1. Associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  
2. Requires medical/surgical intervention; and/or  
3. Leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the trial, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy; and/or  
4. Leads to any of the outcomes includ ed in the definition of a serious adverse 
event; and/or  
5. Is considered to be an advers e event by [CONTACT_1720] S ponsor.  
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting 
as an adverse event.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_864627] follow up study visit is required to be followed up until the event 
resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator and/or Sponsor.  
All adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited or observed by [CONTACT_645821]. The events will be recorded in the source documents and onto the 
adverse event pages of the case report form, including date of onset and resolution, 
severity, relationship to trial treatment and determination of whether the event 
qualifies as a “serious ” adverse event (Section 12.3) . 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, 
should not be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for 
which the procedure was  performed should be reported if it meets the definition of 
an adverse event.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page [ADDRESS_864628]’s source documents and on the appropriate pages of the 
subject’s case report form.  
To assist with grading of adverse event severity, the following definitions are 
provided:  
Mild = Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated;  
Moderate  = Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual 
activity;  
Severe  = Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity;  
Adverse events are assessed as either related to the intravitreous injection 
procedure (eyelid speculum, anesthetic drops, mydriatic drops, antibiotic drops, 
povidone -iodine drops or flush, subconjunctival injection of anesthetic, intravitreous 
injection), termed “injection procedure -related”, or to study drug ( Zimura™). 
The relationship to the intravitreous injection procedure or to study drug  will be 
assessed using the following definitions:  
Not Related  = There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
event is related to the injection procedure or to the study 
drug.  
Related  =  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event 
is related to the injection procedure or to the study  drug.  
 
12.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any event that:  
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);  
3. Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 55                                        28 March  2018 4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon  
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient/subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring inten sive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A life -threatening adverse event is any event that places the patient/subj ect at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645799].  For chronic or long -term 
inpatients, inpatient admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645800]/intensive care inpatient unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical f loor, 
from a medical floor to the coronary care unit).   
• Inpatient admission does not include the following:  
o Emergency Room/Casualty Department visits  
o Outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures and observation/short -
stay units  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645801] (e.g., caregiver relief)  
o Rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, 
custodial care facilities  
• Inpatient admission in the absence of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, 
clinical adverse event may meet criteria for “seriousn ess” but is not an 
adverse event and thus is not subject to immediate reporting to the Sponsor.  
For example:  
o Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with 
the development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the 
 
Protocol OPH2003 Amendment C - Confidential                     Page 56                                        28 March  2018 pre-existing condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pretreatment lab 
abnormality)  
o Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep)  
o Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_592827] (e.g., yearly physical, elective cosmetic surgery)

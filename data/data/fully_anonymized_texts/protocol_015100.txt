 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Improving Chronic Disease Management with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] (ICD-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]) 
Objectives 
The overall goal of the study, Improving Chronic Disease Management with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] (I CD-
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]) is to improve the care of patients who have the triad of coexi stent chronic kidney 
disease, diabetes and hypertension. The primary objective of the study is to test the 
hypothesis that patients who receive care with a collaborative model of primary care and 
subspecialty care interventions enhanced by [CONTACT_48329] a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension using objective an d reproducible 
criteria, and provide clinician support for implementation of best practices of care, moni toring 
clinical measures, adjusting treatments and reduce 12-month all-cause unplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48179], diabetes and hypertension. 
Secondary objectives as follows: 
a) To test if implementation  of the collaborative model of primary care-subspecialty care 
interventions will reduce 30-day readmissions (for patients who have an index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ), emergency room visits, cardiovascular events or deaths from any cause 
and  disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48180]-specified in this study as cardiovascular 
complications, congestive heart failure, volume overload, 
accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, 
myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral revascularization, stroke, limb 
ischemia/amputations, diabetes complications, uncontrolled diabetes or hypoglycemia, 
acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity, medication  
errors and infections. 
 
b) To develop and validate predictive models for risks of disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48181], 
all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 30-day readmissions, emergency room visits, cardiovascular 
events and deaths for all patients with coexistent CKD, diabetes and hypertension.   
 
c) To collect demographic data and clinical descriptive data to assist phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_48182] s 
with a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension.  
 
d) To obtain important safety data for patients with CKD, diabetes and hypertensio n 
including acute kidney injury, progression of chronic kidney disease (changes in eGFR), 
development of electrolyte disturbances and medication errors and drug toxicity (even if  
not leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 
e) To collect information on resource utilization including not only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48183], outpatient visits and procedures completed (both diagnostic or 
therapeutic). 
Design and Outcomes 
The study will employ a prospective stratified cluster randomization design. The stratum is each 
of the four large healthcare systems participating in the study. The unit o f randomization will be 
primary care clinics. In some healthcare systems several primary care clinics share the sam e 
geographic location and personnel and they will be randomized as a single unit.  
9 
 The primary outcome of this trial is all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48184] a triad of CKD, 
diabetes and hypertension. Specifically, the outcome will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48185] 12 months 
for all study participants. We will capture all cause unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48186] (to avoi d 
uncertainties related to variations in applications of definitions based on the recent 
implementation of the two midnight rule). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48187]. To maximize completeness of outcome data acquisition we will also track study 
patients with outcome data from the Dallas Fort Worth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48188] a cooperative 
regional-sharing initiative that allows to match patients with any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48189]. Patients in ProHealth in Connecticut are part of an accountable care 
organization (ACO) and outcomes are also captured in a database from reports received b y 
ACO. There will be also special attention to capture outcome information fr om VA database 
patients followed at the VA of North [LOCATION_007] who may not be part of the g roup identified through 
the Dallas Fort Worth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48190].  
Secondary outcomes captured in the study will include 30-day all cause readmissions (for those  
patients who have an index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), emergency room visits, cardiovascular events  and 
deaths, and disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48191], congestive he art 
failure, volume overload, hypertension complications, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial 
infarction, coronary/peripheral revascularization, stroke, amputation/limb ischemia, uncontrolled 
diabetes, hypoglycemia, diabetes complications, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, electrolyte 
disturbances, medication errors, drug toxicity and infections.. Data for secondary outcome s will 
be obtained as outlined above with the primary outcomes. In addition, we will  verify if enrolled 
patients who do not have an encounter in our systems within two years of study participation 
are classified as dead or alive using the Social Security Index.  
Other secondary outcomes captured from the electronic health records will include descriptive  
patient characteristics including demographic and clinical data from patients wit h CKD, diabetes 
and hypertension as well as information on patient comorbidities, changes in renal func tion 
(eGFR), epi[INVESTIGATOR_48192]/adverse events. Resource utilization 
will be captured from careful evaluation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48193], clinic visit s and diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures completed.

There will be two study groups: An active intervention group randomized to the col laborative 
model of care facilitated by [CONTACT_48330] d a group 
randomized to standard/usual care. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48195] a triad of CKD, type 2  diabetes and hypertension 
according to established inclusion criteria for the study. The candidate cohort of potential sites 
will then be randomized to active intervention (collaborative care model enhanced by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_6928])  or 
control group (standard of care). Interventions available for implementation in the active  group 
include maintaining blood pressure less than 140/90mmHg, use of angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), treatment with sta tins, aiming 
for hemoglobin A1C at recommended target for coexistent comorbidities, avoidance of 
nephrotoxic medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Other 
interventions available include education on CKD for both primary care providers and for 
patients. There will also be available material on lifestyle modification and immun izations.  
After a patient is enrolled, the primary care practitioner activates the CKD, diabetes  and 
hypertension collaborative model of care. Primary care practitioners will have the  option to

 2. Background and Rationale 
2.1 Background on Condition 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes and hypertension are three common chronic med ical 
conditions in the general population. It is estimated that 31% of US adults have hypertension, 
14% have CKD, and almost 10% have diabetes[1-4]. Diabetes and hypertension are among the 
most prevalent chronic medical conditions in adults of all ages[1,5]. Diabetes and hypertension 
are the two leading causes of CKD in the [LOCATION_002], which has now become a majo r public 
health problem[77]. The triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension conspi[INVESTIGATOR_48197][9,10,16,18,17]. Moreover, CKD disproportionately affects vulnerable 
populations including the elderly, Hispanics, African-Americans and those who reside i n 
socioeconomically deprived areas[1,2,3]. 
In patients with CKD, the kidneys are not able to filter blood normal ly and have reduced 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or abnormal leakage of albumin in t he urine. Compelling 
data indicates that graded reductions in GFR are strongly associated with higher ri sks of death, 
cardiovascular events, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], independent of traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors [5,12]. Premature death, both from cardiovascular disease and from all causes, is higher in 
adults with CKD compared to adults without CKD[6,7].  
Multimorbidity or the coexistence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is especially significant 
for patients with the triad of CKD, diabetes, and hypertension. Spe cifically, the coexistence of 
kidney disease and diabetes is associated with considerably higher mortality than the excess 
risk with either risk factor alone[10] (Figure 2.1 ). Similar relationships are observed with CKD and 
hypertension and with diabetes and hypertension[11,12]. While risk prediction models for 
progression from CKD to ESRD among those with CKD, diabetes and hypertension a re 
clinically useful, they are very limited in predicting cardiovascular events and mortali ty[13,20,50]. 
 
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_50805] itution of 
strategies to slow progression and treat associated complications and cardiovascular risks [5,77]. 
 
Early diagnosis of CKD allows for the institution of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48198]. Detection of CKD can be accomplished with 
relatively simple tests, such as serum creatinine and urine for protein and/or albumin. 
Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with high risk conditions for CKD , such as diabetes 
and/or hypertension, do not have basic tests of kidney function or urine albumin pe rformed.[14] 
Progressive CKD is a catastrophic condition that leads to end-stage kidne y disease requiring 
very expensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48199]. These patients su ffer from 
excessive rates of depression, catastrophic cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart a ttack 
and heart failure and other comorbidities that are difficult and expensive to 
manage.[1,2,4,48,49,47,46,45] CKD detection and documentation is low even across health care 
systems with sophisticated electronic health records (EHR) [83].  
Catastrophic consequences result from lack of detection of CKD, diabetes and 
hypertension 
 
More than 25% of adults with Type II diabetes are undiagnosed. Moreover, based on  fasting 
glucose or hemoglobin A1C values, around 35% of adults in the US have pre-diabetes, and  a 
large proportion are not aware of the risk[56]. Among adults with hypertension, about 22% are 
not aware of their condition[1,21]. The consequence of missed detection of CKD, diabetes and 
hypertension is higher morbidity, mortality and financial cost to our healthcare system. 
Failure of implementation of strategies to treat CKD, diabetes and hypertension and 
associated complications 
Several strategies are proven effective to treat CKD, diabetes, and hypertension. R ecent 
guidelines from medical groups have included specific recommendations for patients who have 
CKD coexisting with diabetes and/or hypertension.[5,25,24,65,67-71,31,34,11] Appropriate interventions, 
including treatment of hypertension, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , 
improving glycemic control and managing dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_48200], hypert ension, and 
diabetes.[26,27,28,29,30,32,33,22,23,19,57,58,59,60,62,63] 
Unfortunately, many of these strategies are not implemented in patients with CKD, diabetes and 
hypertension. Less than half of adults with CKD have blood pressure values withi n 
recommended targets[14]. About one half of patients with diabetes do not meet targets for  
glycemic control, BP or LDL cholesterol levels [35]. The use of recommended medications and 
achievement of targets for risk factor management are also unacceptably low for  patients with 
CKD [1,2,5,14]. Furthermore, patients with CKD, diabetes and hypertension suffer from excessive  
morbidity and mortality from adverse safety events.[76,79,80,81] 
[ADDRESS_50806] primary care physicians and subspecialists (e.g., 
nephrologists) favor collaborative care for patients with CKD[36]. However, implementation of 
care for those with CKD, diabetes and hypertension among practitioners remains fragmented, 
and delayed care is common. Education and efforts to facilitate communication amon g patients 
and providers about chronic disease management are effective in removing patient-related and 
physician-related barriers to CKD care. Health services research suggests tha t the design of the 
care system is a primary determinant of the quality of care in most chronic condit ions[84,85]. 
Some large health care systems have reported success identifying large numbers of pat ients 
with CKD and providing comprehensive CKD care[37,38,83]. The most promising strategies to 
improve CKD care emphasize multidisciplinary care models[39,40,41,42]. Integration of nephrology 
care and diabetes care in the chronic care model within existing health care systems has 
achieved some success in vulnerable populations with CKD, including those served by [CONTACT_48331][43,44]. Low recognition of CKD, limited resources, and lack of familiarity 
with CKD care have limited wider application of these approaches.  
Recent studies have reinforced the need for new strategies to improve care for patients with 
CKD. The introduction of automated eGFR reporting has led to higher detection of CKD in some 
healthcare systems but limited improvements in CKD care.[83] Electronic CKD checklists have 
improved adherence to some CKD guidelines but limited in scope.[75] Ongoing studies are 
evaluating the role of novel interventions including implementation strategies to promote  patient 
safety through care transitions, patient-directed education and self-management tool s, 
utilization of patient navigators, utilization of clinician decision support models an d patient-
decision support for selection of modalities of renal replacement therapy[74].

Preliminary Data: 
Our team at Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48206] a mod el to predict 
the risk of readmissions in congestive heart failure (CHF) with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48207], using information 
available in the first 24 hours of admission in the EHR and other computerized dat a sets, 
including clinical factors (ICD-9 codes, vital signs, lab values, etc.) and electroni cally derived 
measures of social disadvantage (housing stability, census track, etc.), and adherence 
(pharmacy refills, outpatient appointment follow-up, etc.). This model  demonstrated greater 
predictive probability for 30 day-readmission (C-statistic of 0.72) than prior models, including the 
ones used by [CONTACT_48332]-site heart failure trials, and has the advantage tha t it can be 
calculated in real time within 24 hours of admission.[51]  
In a prospective, interrupted time-series trial with concurrent controls involving  all CHF 
admissions to Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48208] 2008 to November 2010,  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] ™ 
real-time risk stratification and a patient-tailored CHF intervention signific antly reduced 30-day 
readmissions in patients from 26% to 21%, and the subset of Medicare patients fell f rom 20% to 
14% (p< .01), putting Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48209].[52]

electronically ascertainable inpatient and outpatient activities and protocols. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48210]. These include but are not limited to 
predicting out- of-ICU cardio-pulmonary arrest, sepsis, risk of surgical complications, 30-day 
readmission risk for diabetes, HIV, MI and pneumonia, risk of long-term diabetes co mplication 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48211]. The automated out of ICU cardiac arrest model had excellent 
discrimination (c-statistic=0.85) and calibration and was more sensitive (5 1.6% and 42.2%) and 
specific (94.3% and 91.3%) than MEWS (a previously published risk score based on the

automated model predicted resuscitation event and death (RED) 15.9 hours before t hey 
occurred and earlier than Rapid Response Team (RRT) activation (5.7 hours prior to an event, 
p=0.003) and showed excellent discrimination, sensitivity and specificity.[53]  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48212] e- registry 
within the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48213][54]. 
2.2.3 Preliminary data: CKD Collaboratory Study 
Our group has conducted an NIDDK-funded study (Improving CKD Detection and Care in a 
High Risk Underserved Population/R34DK094115) at Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214] . 
This is a prospective study to identify patients with previously undiagnosed CKD  and implement 
established therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48215]. The primary outcome of this study was blood pressure 
control for patients followed in primary care clinics with a collaborative primary care- nephrology 
care model enhanced by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_48207]. In this study we defined CKD by [CONTACT_48333] 60 ml/min 
or proteinuria/albuminuria and confirmed with repeat values more than 3 months apar t. Figure 
[IP_ADDRESS] summarizes the study design using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. 
 
 
When comparing detection of CKD based on the established diagnostic criteria described above  
to cases previously diagnosed with CKD by [CONTACT_48334]-[ADDRESS_50808], we found 46-64% of patients with newly detected CKD. Treatm ent efforts focused on blood 
pressure control which was the primary outcome of the study.  The results on achieving the 
primary outcome of blood pressure control were encouraging. BP control improved from 34.6% 
at baseline to 44% at most recent analysis. This accomplishment is particularly relevant given 
the low prevalence of blood pressure control in patients from high risk populations simil ar to our 
study group. Final collection and data analysis will be available in near future. (see table 
[IP_ADDRESS])  
Figure [IP_ADDRESS]  
[ADDRESS_50809] of CKD, diabetes, and hypertension, and the large ga p between proven 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48216]- to-day care, it is critical that we develop better 
ways to implement effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48217]. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline s state 
that "people with CKD are an ideal target for interventions aimed at reduction of morbidity, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], mortality and costs."[5]   
We have recently implemented successfully a collaboratory primary care and nephrology care 
model for patients with CKD in a predominantly minority population using an novel technology 
platform that facilitates implementation of CKD care within the context of primary care  practices 
and medical homes in the community. ICD-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48218] a randomized, pragmatic clini cal trial in 
four large healthcare systems in patients with coexistent CKD, diabetes and hypertension . Our 
hypothesis is that patients who receive care with a collaborative model of primary ca re-
subspecialty care enhanced by [CONTACT_48335] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]) and practice facili tators 
will have fewer all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], readmissions, disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ER  
visits, cardiovascular events and deaths than patients receiving standard medical care.  We will 
also aim to develop a better understanding of risk predictors in patients with CKD , diabetes and 
Figure [IP_ADDRESS] 
 
[ADDRESS_50810] practices. None of the proposed 
interventions are experimental. The study team will capture important safety dat a as part of the 
study outcomes: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 30-day readmissions, ER visits, cardiovascular events and 
death. In addition to outcome data and to maximize patient safety the study team wi ll capture, 
review monthly and report quarterly to the DSMB data on the following events in the  intervention 
group: hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, electrolyte disturbances, angioedema, 
hypoglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, drug toxicity, pregnancy while treated with A CEI of 
ARB, acute kidney injury, reductions in eGFR 50% or higher initiation of dialysis. 
There are inherent risks associated with use of patient data the study and careful attention has  
been put in place to maximize data safety and protect patient privacy and confide ntiality. 
Transmission of identifiable patient data will occur through secure FTP of HL7. Patient data will 
be stored in a secure database on the FISMA compliant VAZATA cloud. Access to the dat abase 
will be password protected. Communication and files will be encrypted. Patient data wil l be de-
identified prior to submitting for analysis. The approach has been already used safely at  [ADDRESS_50811] ructure

hypertension. The general hypothesis is that patients who receive care with a collabora tive 
model of primary care-subspecialty care interventions enhanced by [CONTACT_48336]-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
readmissions, all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], cardiovascular events and deaths than patients 
receiving standard medical care. 
3.[ADDRESS_50812] practices of care, monitoring clinical measures, adjusting 
treatments and reduce 12-month hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]. In this study disease-specific 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48219], diabetes and hypertension include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48220], congestive heart failure, volume overload, 
accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, coronary/peripheral revascularization, limb ischemia/amputations, diab etes 
complications, uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, 
electrolyte disturbances, medication errors, drug toxicity, and infections. 
3.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
The study will test if implementation of the collaborative model of primary care-subspeci alty care 
interventions will reduce 30-day readmissions (for patients who are hospi [INVESTIGATOR_057]), emergency 
room visits, cardiovascular events, deaths or disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. In  this study 
disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48219], diabetes and hypertension include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48221], congestive heart failure, volume overload, 
accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, coronary/peripheral revascularization, limb ischemia/amputations, diab etes 
complications, uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, 
electrolyte disturbances, medication errors, drug toxicity, and infections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Develop and validate predictive models for risks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency room visi ts, 
cardio vascular events and deaths for all patients with coexistent CKD, diabetes and 
hypertension and predict risks of 30- day disease-specific readmissions for patients who are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Capture data (demographic, clinical, medications, laboratories, procedures) to phenot ype 
patients with a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
22 
 Obtain important safety data for patients with CKD, diabetes and hypertension including 
adverse safety events, acute kidney injury and progression of chronic kidney disease (even for 
patients not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Obtain information on resource utilization including not only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48222], outpatient visits and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are increasingly recognized as key outcomes of clini cal 
studies challenges of obtaining direct consent from study patients and obtaini ng data from the 
control group prevent us from complete capture of PRO at this stage. We do plan t o submit a 
proposal to capture PROs for both intervention and control groups at completion o f the study. 
The objective will be to evaluate the impact of the collaboratory model of care on patient related 
outcomes (PROs) including health-related quality of life, patient satisfact ion, patient perspective 
on quality of their care and measures of patient perception of burden related to care of t heir 
CKD, diabetes and hypertension. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluate the impact of the collaborative primary care-subspecialty care model on provi der 
satisfaction with resources and ability to manage patients with coexistent CK D, diabetes and 
hypertension. 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome of this trial is all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48223] a triad of CKD, 
diabetes and hypertension. Specifically, the outcome will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48224]  12 months 
for study participants. We will include both regular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48225] (to avoid variations related to definition of inpatient 
status/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48226] “two midnight rule ” CMS -1599 -F). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48227] d with 
assistance of electronic tools in each of the participating healthcare systems. I f there is difficulty 
with adjudication of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the steering committee will review and make a final 
recommendation. It is possible that some patients may be seen at a healthcar e system other 
than one of the participating sites in this study. To maximize completeness of outcome data 
acquisition we will also track study patients with data from the Dallas Fort  Worth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48228] a cooperative regional-sharing initiative that allows matching patients with any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48229]-Fort Worth. Patients in ProHea lth in Connecticut are 
part of an Accountable Care Organization that receives regular and detailed repor ts from all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48230]. Patients followed at the VA of North Te xas may have 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48231]. We wi ll 
address this challenge in several ways. First, VA internal databases capture if payment s have 
been initiated for outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Second, we plan to include a standard qu estion to the 
clinic workflow to ask patients about recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Third, we have initiated discussi ons 
about the possibility of tracking hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48232]. 
23 
 3.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
Secondary outcomes will include 30-day all cause readmissions (for those patients who ha ve an 
index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), emergency room visits, cardiovascular events and deaths, and disease-
specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48233], congestive heart failure, volume 
overload, accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary/peripheral revascularization, limb ischemia/ampu tations, 
diabetes complications, uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, 
electrolyte disturbances, medication errors, drug toxicity, and infections. For those patient s who 
are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48234] 30 days of the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48235], Dall as Fort Worth 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48236] (for ProHealth, Connecticut) and VA of N orth [LOCATION_007]. 
Emergency room visits will be similarly captured from the electronic health reco rds, DFW 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48190], ProHealth database and VA database.  
Cardiovascular events include congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial 
infarction, coronary and peripheral revascularization, stroke and limb ischemia/amputation.  
Deaths from any cause will be captured. Deaths will be classified as cardiovascul ar or non-
cardiac related. Deaths will be captured from the electronic health records of the part icipating 
healthcare systems as well as from the Dallas Fort Worth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48237] O database 
(for ProHealth, Connecticut), and VA EHR. We will also verify if enrolle d patients who do not 
have an encounter in our systems within two year of study participation are classifi ed as dead or 
alive using the Social Security Index.  
Other secondary outcomes captured in the study from the electronic health records wi ll include 
descriptive patient characteristics for patients with a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension 
including demographic data, information of patient comorbidities clinical dat a, medications, 
laboratories, and procedures, and changes in renal function (eGFR) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_48238]/adverse events. We will use the wealth of information avail able in 
the EHR to advance disease-specific phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_48239].[72] Resource 
utilization will also be measured capturing not only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48240] (diagnostic and therapeutic). 
As previously noted, Patient Reported Outcomes will not be captured initially but will be 
addressed as part of a future proposal in the study. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are 
assessments directly reported by [CONTACT_48337][87]. A PRO survey derived for core 
domains and corresponding measures by [CONTACT_48338] (CMWG) will be used to measure health related quality of life and 
physical and emotional well-being of patients. Primary care practitioner reported out comes and 
satisfaction with resources and ability to manage patients with coexistent CK D, diabetes and 
hypertension will be measured with a survey adapted from collaborative disease m anagement 
initially developed for late-life depression in primary care[88].

 4. Study Design 
The study will employ a prospective stratified cluster randomization design. The stratum is each 
of the four large healthcare systems participating in the study. The unit o f randomization will be 
primary care practices. In some healthcare systems (Parkland and North [LOCATION_007] VA) primary 
care practices are defined by [CONTACT_48339] a unique group of 
patients with a permanently designated team of one RN and one medical assistan t with no 
overlap with the practices of other primary care practitioners.   In other heal thcare systems 
(THR and ProHealth) clinical practices are defined as group of patients cared by [CONTACT_48340] a single unit.      
The cluster design of the study is best suited to detect important differences in  outcomes 
between the intervention and control groups[8,55]. The decision to use primary care practices as 
a unit for randomization in the study is based on the ability to implement differen t models of care 
in the active intervention sites as compared to the control sites. The collaborative mod el of care 
which includes novel information technology, subject identification, facilitation of patient  care, 
monitoring of outcomes and participation from facilitators can be most eff iciently applied to the 
workflow of practices when they are fully randomized to active intervention. The cluster  
randomization design with practices receiving collaborative primary care-subspecialt y care 
versus standard care also limits the risk of cross-contamination between interven tion and 
control groups in the study. 
Primary care practices will be stratified by [CONTACT_48341] a randomized permutation block wi thin 
stratum. Based on the assignment of the practice where a patient receives medical care each 
patient will be assigned either to the intervention group or the standard medi cal care group. 
All eligible patients of practices who are randomized to the study will be included in the 
comparison of the two intervention groups regardless of intervention compliance (intention- to-
treat analysis) to investigate if patients in intervention group have signifi cantly less all-cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48241]. Evaluation will also be 
performed to determine treatment effects on disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], E R visits, 
cardiovascular events and deaths.  
There will be two study groups: active intervention group randomized to the collaborative model 
of care facilitated by [CONTACT_48342]/usual 
care group.  
The total number of patients to be studied is 10,991 . (see study table 4) 
[ADDRESS_50813] practices of care, monitor important clinical measures, adjus t treatments 
and achieve improved outcomes. The intervention will be delivered in the outpatient se tting. 
The primary outcome measured during the trial is 12-month all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48242]. Secondary outcomes measured during the trial include 30-day  disease-
specific readmissions (for all patients with an index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), emergency room  visits, 
cardiovascular event, deaths and disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
Other secondary outcomes measured in the study include adverse safety events, epi[INVESTIGATOR_48243]. 
Data collection for assessment of study objectives will be mainly based on information 
technology tools to capture data from the electronic health record. Some data fi elds will require 
collection of data from Dallas Fort Worth Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48190], ProHealth A CO databases, 
VA of North [LOCATION_007] and Social Security Death Files Index. 
There will be an interim analysis for efficacy of the intervention when 50% of t he primary 
outcome data is available. This the consensus recommendation after review of the pr otocol and 
incorporating input from NIH, DSMB and OHRP. The study biostatistician s will review trends 
quarterly including patient volumes compared to goals from power calculations and inf orm study 
team and DSMB of any concerns based on trends of findings. 
A DSMB (Data Safety Monitoring Board) has been assembled by [CONTACT_48343] d will oversee 
study planning and implementation of the study.

5. Selection and Enrollment of Participants 
The total sample size of patients with the triad of CKD, type 2 diabetes and hypertension among 
participating sites in the four large healthcare systems in our study exceeds 28,118. The actual 
number of patients to be studied is 10,991.  
The study will include patients 18-85 years old with CKD, diabetes and hyperten sion. Men, 
women, and minorities will participate in the study. Children will not part icipate as this study is 
focused on adults with multiple chronic conditions. 
The outpatient population to be studied will be drawn from four large healthcare sy stems 
participating in the study. Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48244]-net health system 
for Dallas County. [LOCATION_007] Health Resources is a large private, non-profit healthcare system 
network in North [LOCATION_007]. The North [LOCATION_007] Veterans Administration Healthcare System provide s 
care for US veterans. ProHealth Physicians is Connecticut’s largest network of primary care 
physicians.

1. Systolic blood pressure greater than 140mmHg on two different occasions at least on e 
week apart 
2. Diastolic blood pressure greater than [ADDRESS_50816] Exclusion Criteria 
All eligible patients from clinics randomized to the study will be includ ed in the comparison of 
the two groups regardless of intervention compliance (intention- to-treat analysis).  
Exclusion criteria will be minimal in this pragmatic trial. The collaborative model of care will not 
be implemented in patients younger than [ADDRESS_50817] CKD stage 5/ERSD. Primary care practitioners have the option of not i mplementing the 
intervention on any of their patients if they believe benefit to be mi nimal or risk too high due to 
patient comorbidities. Patients also have the option to opt-out from the f acilitated collaborative 
model of care. 
5.3 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Prior to initiation of the study there will be information materials and educati on sessions 
provided to all participating sites. This will include both written material and electron ic 
information. Resources from National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDE P) will be 
provided to all practitioners.[82] There will also be special attention to selection of study 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_48245]. In addition, there will be plans to visit most of the 
participating healthcare sites by [CONTACT_40221]. These efforts will  continue not only 
early in the study but throughout the study to promote study retention. 
Participating healthcare systems will be provided with advance notice of possible study 
participants prior to upcoming appointments.  
There will be review of actual enrollment of patients versus enrollment goals for every 
participating site. Reviews will occur monthly and reported quarterly.

sites randomized to active intervention. 
Practitioners and/or patients can choose to withdraw for the study at any time. Th ey can choose 
not to follow the intervention model (any or all of the components or tools of care) .  Patient can 
request their data be not included for analysis of outcomes.

6. Study Interventions 
6.1 Healthcare System Collaboratory 
The pragmatic trial ICD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48246] a special emphasis on multiple chronic conditions. The study will  be conducted 
by a collaborative network of UT Southwestern and several other cores and four large 
healthcare systems that provide care to more than 2.5 million patients.  (see figure 6.1) 
[ADDRESS_50819] 
healthcare providers in Connecticut providing care to more than 250,000 adults eve ry year 
across multiple practices.  
6.2 Informatics Architecture 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48247]. (see figure 
6.2.1) The Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation will provide specifications for data ext raction 
using batch files and the data from each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48248] r elevant fields in the 
electronic health records systems. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48249] d to specifically detect 
patients with a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension and to detect eligi ble participants, 
facilitate management and monitor outcomes. Each healthcare system will have some 
differences in their electronic health records and data flow. This is being  addressed with backup 
systems in place to access data and allow for safe and secure transmission. The N orth [LOCATION_007] 
VA will not be transmitting patient specific information via the cloud at l east in the early stages 
of the trial. Data from each site will be programmed to be de-identified in the cloud and sent 
securely to the Biostatistics and Research Design Core at UT Southwestern. Please see figure

6.3 Practice Facilitator 
A key component of the collaborative model of care for the intervention group is the i ntroduction 
of practice facilitators. In order to maximize the successful implementation of care in the 
intervention group the role training of the practice facilitator will be standardized  across sites. 
We will use a curriculum developed following principles detailed in the Practice Facilitation 
Handbook from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and especially adap ted for 
ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202].[89] We have two content experts that will lead these efforts. [CONTACT_44325] N arva 
from NIDDK has developed educational programs which have been successfully used by  
[CONTACT_48346], diabetes and hypertension. [CONTACT_48375] from SUNY directs a tr aining program at 
SUNY for practice facilitators working in primary care practices.  
There will be an initial on-site course for practice facilitators led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. N arva and [CONTACT_48376]. After 
that initial meeting ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48251], 
written material and webinars to disseminate study relevant material to practice facilitators. All 
practice facilitators will also participate in regularly scheduled calls to review study progress.  It is 
anticipated that these call will be at least weekly early in the study wit h additional calls and site 
visits to each site over the duration of the study. 
Practice facilitators may defer in professional qualifications among the different healthcare sites . 
Practice facilitators will have some clearly defined responsibilities including the follow ing: 
• Receive initial and on-going training from the study team about the study, study protocol 
and proposed intervention 
• Ensure training of designated clinic staff on clinic level activities and expectations 
• Ensure necessary participation of designated clinic staff in CKD, diabetes, and 
hypertension care 
Figure 6.2.2 
33 
 • Coordinates with study clinic staff to ensure the following activities: 
– List of eligible patients scheduled for clinic visit weekly are received thr ough the 
EHR weekly 
– Site-specific enrollment protocol are activated for eligible patients 
– Smart/Order set in the EHR are triggered for enrolled patients 
– Holds weekly conference calls with clinic representatives to answer any 
questions and monitor enrollment number for each clinic 
• In-person visit to observe processes of enrollment and Smart/Order set trigger and other 
intervention activities 
• Provides regular update to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_48252] y team on 
enrollment number, performance of study clinic and on-going challenges

patients with a triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension according to estab lished inclusion 
criteria for the study.  (see figure 6.3.1 Detection for CKD, Diabetes and Hypertension) 
The candidate cohort of potential sites will then be randomized to active intervention  
(collaborative care model enhanced by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_6928]) or control group (standard of care)  (see figure 
6.3.2 Detection CKD, Diabetes and Hypertension).

6.5 Implementation Collaborative Model of Care 
The interventions selected for this pragmatic trial are supported by [CONTACT_48347],  clinical 
evidence and/or guidelines for treatment of CKD, diabetes and hypertension.[5,25,24,65,67-71,31,34,11] 
Specific interventions include maintaining blood pressure less than 140/90mmHg, use of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB ), 
treatment with statins, aiming for hemoglobin A1C at the recommended ta rget for coexisting 
Figure 6.4.2 Detection CKD, Diabetes and Hypertension

 comorbidities, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications including non-steroidal anti-inflam matory 
drugs (NSAIDS). Other interventions will include education on CKD for both primary care 
providers and for patients using material prepared by [CONTACT_48348]. Material on lifestyle  modification 
and immunizations will also be included. (see figure 6.5.1)  
After a patient is enrolled, the primary care practitioner activates the CKD, diabetes  and 
hypertension collaborative model of care. The primary care practitioner will also have the option 
to activate smart forms already constructed and available from our team (see appendix section)  
from the electronic heath record. Primary care practitioners will have t he option to initiate 
protocols for CKD management, hypertension management, lipid and diabetes managemen t. 
Protocols can be initiated via smartsets in the EHR. (see figures 6.5.2 Initiation of Protocol from 
SmartSets and Links to SmartSets). The specific and detailed protocols for hypertension 
management and diabetes/lipid management are included in appendices. 
 
  
 
 
 
Figure 6.5.1  
36 
  
6.6 Maintenance of Provider and Facilitator Engagement   
Engagement of primary care providers at the time of study initiation and throughout  the entire 
duration will be focus of special attention by [CONTACT_3476]. Educational materi als on CKD, 
diabetes and hypertension will be provided to practitioners and facilitators. Materials develop ed 
by [CONTACT_48349]. Primary care pr oviders will be 
offered the opportunity to participate in continuing education (CME) provi ded as part of their 
participation in ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202]. In addition, efforts are underway to det ermine if it is possible to 
link active participation in the study with Quality Initiatives (QI) that coul d fulfill maintenance of 
certification (MOC) requirements. 
As previously noted practice facilitators will be integrated into the study at all t imes including 
participation in the initial training curriculum, ongoing educational options an d regularly 
scheduled study visits, conferences and reports. 
6.[ADDRESS_50822] the selection of clinics/geographic clusters as  unit of 
randomization for the study should reduce the risk of cross-contamination by [CONTACT_48350], nurses, clerks and other profession als in the 
intervention groups from those in control groups. 
We are aware that the healthcare systems in the study may at various times develop an d bring 
for implementation competing initiatives and will review quarterly any new initiatives that the 
clinical leadership is planning across the healthcare systems. We will also work closely w ith the 
QI teams to be aware of any new initiatives that could overlap with ICD-P IECES. Our study 
team will also conduct quarterly reviews of any new national guidelines ( from ASN, NKF, ADA) 
that could be relevant for the study population in ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202]. Any potenti al changes wil be 
discussed with Steering Committee and reported to DSMB. 
Figure 6.5.[ADDRESS_50823] measures of separation between 
implementation and control groups: 
• Activation of Smart sets 
• Referrals to educators (diabetes) 
• Selection of education modules (for providers and for patients) 
• Linkage to pharmacy (recommended medications) 
• Immunization rates 
A possible consequence of the facilitated protocol is increased utilization of health services and 
resources. We will monitor and compare utilization rates in control and intervention groups.

 7.  Study Schedule  
7.1  Screening 
Potential study participants from each healthcare system followed in primary care clinics 
randomized to the study will be screened for inclusion according to the p re-established criteria 
for CKD, diabetes and hypertension (see section 5.1) and as illustrated in figure 6.3.1 
There are no plans to obtain individual informed consent for patients screene d or randomized in 
the study. (see section 14.3) Information about the study will be available to all patients in 
participating clinics and who have the triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertensi on. There will be an 
opt-out opportunity from the interventions or from use of information fr om any patient who 
requests their data not to be used for analysis.  
Screening of participants will occur at an initial stage to identify a  candidate cohort of patients in 
various eligible clinics (see figure 6.3.2).  Patients who do not fulfill required diagnostic criteria on 
initial review and require a separate determination to confirm any of the three diagnosis will be 
rescreened at the time of a future visit (figure 6.3.3)  
7.2 Enrollment/Baseline 
Primary care practitioners will receive advanced notice (electronic and/or pati ent list) of eligible 
patients for the intervention group prior to their initial visit (visit 1) . That visit will mark the first 
opportunity for initiation of the study by [CONTACT_48351] t o activate study 
interventions (see figure 6.4.1). The primary care practitioner will have the option of activating 
the study protocol and following recommendations using study tools/available smar t forms. 
7.3 Follow up Visits 
Measures of blood pressure, blood glucose, kidney function (creatinine, eGFR), lipid levels,  
urine protein/urine albumin as well as pre-specified safety events will be captured  from 
electronic health records at the time of patient contacts with the healthcare system for 
scheduled or unexpected visits for patients. Information will be then directed to primary care 
teams per study protocol. 
Main study outcomes will be captured throughout the study for both intervention an d control 
groups using the same tools in the electronic health record and access to DFW Region al 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48190], ProHealth database and VA electronic information systems. 
The study does not specify the frequency of visits for study participants. I t is anticipated that 
patients with the triad of CKD, diabetes and hypertension will usually be seen at a minimum of 
every 3-6months in most participating clinics. 
7.[ADDRESS_50824] to 12 months after initiation of the study for 
that patient. As previously stated, visits will be for ongoing care and not  mandated for 
study/research interventions. 
7.5  Unscheduled Visits 
Acquisition of data/facilitation of care at the time of unscheduled visits will foll ow the schedule 
described in section 7.3. This is, however, an outpatient study. There will be cap ture of relevant 
data from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (including major outcome measures) but study intervention s and 
application of study tools will not be actively implemented during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
39 
 7.6  Early Termination Visits 
Patients and/or primary care practitioners may decide at any time to discontinue partici pation in 
the facilitated collaborative model of care. Outcomes will still be captured f or intention- to-treat 
analysis unless participants request their data/information not to be used. Table 7.1 sum marizes 
the visits in the study.

 8. Study Procedures/Evaluations 
8.1  Clinical Evaluations 
The study does not mandate interventions or evaluations considered experimental o r outside of 
those recommended as part of optimal evidence-based care for patients with CK D, diabetes 
and hypertension.  
• Medical history and emphasis on problem list and diagnostic codes. 
• Medications including lists of all medications from electronic health record and 
medication reconciliation  
• Physical examination with special emphasis to blood pressure readings. 
• Education/counseling procedures. There will be emphasis on lifestyle modifications and 
confirmation of immunizations and interventions related to healthcare interventions.  This 
will also be an opportunity to insure distribution of education on chroni c kidney disease 
and diabetes. See information from NKDEP.[82] 
• Criteria for dose adjustment. Recommended goals for clinical measures and 
suggestions for recommendations are included in the specific protocols for CKD, 
hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], lipid management and diabetes management. (see 
appendix)]  
 
8.2 Laboratory Evaluations 
• Serum chemistries including creatinine and electrolytes, GFR estimations (eGFR )   
• Glucose and hemoglobin A1C  
• Urine protein and urine albumin quantitative, urine creatinine and urine protein 
dipstick/with specific gravity 
• Microalbumin/creatinine ratio and protein/creatinine ratio in urine 
•  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. 
 
8.3  Special Measures

Recommendations for Enrolled Patients at ProHealth 
 
Background 
ProHealth Physicians is an intervention site for a large, multisite, NIH-sponsored pragmatic clin ical trial 
(“Improving Chronic Disease Management with PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202]”) which offers  virtual pharmacist support for 
clinicians in the care of patients with the disease triad of chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabe tes 
mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). To date, our pharmacist has conducted over 300 medication 
reviews for these patients. Reviews assess: a) recommended practices in CKD (e.g. use of ACEi/AR B 
and statins), b) glycemic and blood pressure control, and, c) medication safety, which includes avoidance 
of nephrotoxic agents and renal dosing. The pharmacist makes patient- centered recommendations to 
clinicians to optimize and improve safety of regimens. Reviews and recommendations are entered as a 
Clinical Pharmacist Note in the electronic health record prior to primary care appointments. The 
pharmacist communicates electronically with clinicians for salient issues.  
 
Objectives   
The primary objectives of the proposed sub-study are to characterize a) medication-related problem s 
(MRPs), and b) pharmacist recommendations among outpatients over [ADDRESS_50826]’s medication  recommendations.  
 
Methods 
In this retrospective cohort study of [ADDRESS_50827] recommendations will be classified as fo llows: 
 
Category  Medication-related problem  Pharmacist 
recommendation 
I. Safety 1. Contradindication 
2. High dose 
3. Adverse Drug Event (ADE)  
4. Drug interaction 
5. High risk medication  
(e.g. Beers List, anticholinergics) a. Discontinue  
b. Decrease dose 
c. Renal dose 
adjustment 
d. Lab test / 
monitoring 
 
II. Appropriateness 1. Needs additional medication 
2. Unnecessary medication  a. Start medication  
b. Discontinue  
III. Effectiveness  1. Ineffective 
2. Low dose a. Increase dose 
b. Alternative 
medication 
 
This classification is based on a well-established taxonomy of MRPs. It was adapted to align with t he 
focus of our medication reviews and patient population. Medication names and dosages will be collect ed 
to identify drug classes and specific medicines associated with MRPs.  
 
[ADDRESS_50828] Note.  
 
Variables for the primary objective include: number of medication reviews, baseline patient 
characteristics (age, gender, mean eGFR and A1c, number of medications), number of medication related 
problems, and classification of MRPs and associated medicines. Variables for the secondary objecti ve 
include number of medication recommendations accepted by [CONTACT_48352].  
 
Data Sources  
Data will be extracted from the electronic health record; no patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
• Demographi cs – patient age, gender  
• Clinical Pharmacist notes  – MRPs, recommendations 
• Primary Care progress notes  –acknowledgment of pharmacist recommendations, documentation 
of medication changes  
• Medication profile  – medication and dose, medication changes  
• Laboratory results – serum creatinine, eGFR, A1c, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], urine microalbumin, LFTs  
• Vitals  – blood pressure, heart rate  
 
Impact  
This study is important to identify common medication-related problems among these vulnerab le patients 
with the disease triad of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Results have potential to 
improve decision support for clinicians at the point of prescribing. This work also highlights t he 
feasibility and value of adding virtual Clinical Pharmacist support for primary care tea ms in a large 
primary care-based Accountable Care Organization.  
 
8.5 Substudy 2:  Testing Computable Definitions of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the ICD-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48254] (AKI) refers to an abrupt decrease in kidney function, resulting in the retention of 
waste products and in the dysregulation of electrolytes and extracellular volume1.   In the United 
States, about 300,000 people die from AKI each year, and the prese nce of AKI increases the length of 
a patient's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48255] 3.5 days.2   Furthermore, it is recognized that there is an association 
between AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal  disease (ESRD) .3 There is evidence 
of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness 
and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervent ion. Emerging data point 
to an urgent need to change the treatment paradigm of CKD and other AKI risk factors by [CONTACT_48353] (including the treatment of CKD), and modify its  course with 
modalities and treatments that can improve outcomes. 
 
Defined criteria to document AKI for research criteria (KDIGO, RIFLE,AKIN) have been used in research 
studies and compared to   billing diagnostic codes for identification of AKI. In two recent studies the 
use of billing codes to identify AKI had low sensitivity compared with current KDIGO consensus 
definition or modified KDIGO definition (not counting urine output decrease as a criterion). 4,5   In one 
study of 
~34,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48256] 17.2% (95% CI 13.2%-21.2%) of AKI cases that were identified 
using serum creatinine were also identified using AKI billing codes.4   In a more recent report using 
43 
 electronic health records, the ICD- 10 code corresponding to AKI (N17) was recorded in 30%  of the 
cases documented by a laboratory based approach to find Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48257]-AKI identified in a 
reported study.[ADDRESS_50829] sponsored by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) to improve  electronic safety surveillance, the positive predictiv e values of ICD-
9 diagnoses in identifying AKI ranged from 48%-84% at best.[ADDRESS_50830] AKI in clinical trial adverse event reporting would 
improve safety monitoring and build the evidence base for  defining subtypes of AKI in current 
studies and for future biomarker and precision medicine in itiatives. We propose an additional 
substudy of the incidence of laboratory-defined AKI compared to administrative coding as an 
extension research question for the current ICD-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48258]. The ICD-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48259]. It is notable that 1/3 of AKI cases in a large 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_48260].7 
Specific Aim 1: 
Test the performance of laboratory based criteria for AKI compared to coded ICD- [ADDRESS_50831] for concordance of the laboratory only- based definiti on of AKI compared to ICD- 10 
code documentation within a well- defined cohort with established baseline eGFR. AKI w ill be 
defined using KDIGO laboratory criteria.    Although routine collection of information of urine output  is 
not part of the trial,  laboratory based data will be available along with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48261] a section of the clinical sites including the North [LOCATION_007] VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619], Parkland 
Health & Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214], and [LOCATION_007] Health Physicians Group of [LOCATION_007] Health Resources. This would 
demonstrate the feasibility of improved monitoring for adve rse events, specifically AKI, in a large 
cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial of patients with chronic kidney disease. 
Specific Aim 2: 
Document modern mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48262]- CT 
Ontologies 
In order to promulgate a standard modern definition of AKI based on computable laboratory values 
and related medical concepts and to allow exploration of concordance of alternate methods of 
detection of AKI based on Natural Language Processing, the investigators propose a m appi[INVESTIGATOR_48263]. This definition can be circulated at both the NKDEP 
Health Information Technology Working Group and through the  NIH Collaboratory Living Textbook as 
well as other publications. To the investigators ’ knowledge, no such modern mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48264], and exhaustive mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48265]. This resource map would allow explo ration of documentation of clinical 
findings and concerns in routine clinical notes as an alternative m ethod for surveillance of AKI as a 
clinical event.

1. Abstract 
Patients may sometimes be given the option to opt-out of pragmatic clinical research, 
which may mean not receiving a particular intervention based upon a study protocol or 
not having their data used for analyses. Yet, there is minimal information available about 
the reasons why patients opt-out, which may prove to very useful in assessing the ethical, 
scientific, and practical aspects of pragmatic clinical trials. This project involves pi[INVESTIGATOR_48266] a short survey instrument among patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202], a 
pragmatic clinical trial currently being fielded to develop a preliminary understanding of 
reasons for opting-out as well as assemble a cohort of patients who may be interviewed 
in a possible qualitative interview study in the future. 
 
2. Objectives 
a. To pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a short survey instrument regarding reasons for opting-out of 
pragmatic clinical trials. 
b. To develop a preliminary understanding of reasons for opting-out of ICD-
PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202], a pragmatic clinical trial currently enrolling participants. 
c. To obtain permission from patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48267] a 
possible in-depth interview regarding decisions related to opting-out that may 
be designed and conducted in the future.  
 
3. Background  
[ADDRESS_50832] a 
short survey instrument among patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202], a pragmatic 
clinical trial currently being fielded. The estimated opt-out rate in ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48268] 1.5% of those approached.  
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design. Patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48269]-
PI[INVESTIGATOR_48270]-out and ask 
them if they would be willing to answer some questions about their decision. 
Answering these questions will be considered to indicate consent. The information 
will be captured on a form that will include only basic demographic and site 
information unless the patient voluntarily provides permission to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
Primary data will be retained by [CONTACT_48355]-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48271]. Aggregate information 
will be provided without any patient identifiers to the study team at the NIH 
Collaboratory Coordinating Center (Drs. Sugarman and Weinfurt).  
b. Study duration and number of study visits. The study will take 5-15 minutes at a 
single encounter.  
 
5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. 
a. Adult, competent patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202] 
b. Willing and able to answer questions related to their decision to opt-out 
c. Able to converse in English 
 
6. Sample Size: 10-[ADDRESS_50833] descriptive statistics. We will endeavor to continue 
to enroll patients who opt-out of ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48272].  
 
 
8. Risks 
 
There are no anticipated physical, financial or social risks for participating. Patients may 
feel uncomfortable discussing their reasons for opting-out. If this occurs, the survey can 
be stopped. If any unanticipated problems occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48273].

None. 
 
 
 
9 Assessment of Safety 
9.1 Specification of Safety Parameters 
Adverse safety events will be captured and monitored as part of the study.  The primary 
outcome of this trial is all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48223] a triad o f CKD, diabetes and 
hypertension and all unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48274]. The main secondary outcomes 
that will be captured in the study also include safety events including 30- day all cause 
readmissions (for those patients who have an index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), emergency room visit s, 
cardiovascular events, deaths, and disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. In this study disease-
specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48275], 
congestive heart failure, volume overload, hypertension complications, acute coronary 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral revascularization, stroke, amputation/l imb 
ischemia, uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia, diabetes complications, acute kidney injury, 
hyperkalemia, electrolyte disturbances, medication errors, drug toxicity, and infections. 
In this study the control group will receive standard of care. The intervention group  will receive 
interventions that are already accepted as best practices. Primary care providers wil l make 
ultimate decisions regarding implementation of any of the interventions for both groups. In 
addition to the study outcome measures detailed above the following events w ill be captured 
and reported (whether they lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48276]) as they could be related to potential 
study interventions: hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, electrolyte disturbances, angioedema,  
hypoglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, drug toxicity, pregnancy while treated with ACEI  or 
ARB, acute kidney injury, reductions in eGFR 50% or higher, or initiation of dialysi s. 
 The study will monitor for any malfunctions on the decision support software system and SFTP 
used for data transmission to and from electronic health records of the study sit es for Parkland, 
THR, ProHealth and VA of North [LOCATION_007]. There will also be monitoring  for adherence to Manual 
of Procedure interventions including identification and enrollment of eligible patients,  activation 
of study protocols and recommended follow up.

 9.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording and Analyzing Safety Parameters 
9.2.1 Adverse Events 
The study outcomes and adverse/safety events detailed in Section 9.[ADDRESS_50834] 
instances from the electronic health records and databases. As noted above there wi ll be 
confirmation for solicited adverse event including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48277] s from the VA of 
North [LOCATION_007] who may be seen in other institutions in Dallas/Fort Worth. 
Adverse events will be collected throughout the entire participation of subjects in t he study ([ADDRESS_50835]). The study 
coordinating team will review adverse events to determine relatedness to study in terventions 
and to grade severity as needed. 
Adverse events will be classified as severe or mild/moderate. For the purposes of t his study 
severe adverse events will include those leading to death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or permanen t 
disability/incapacity. Other safety events will be classified as mild/moderate. As t he study relies 
heavily on event capture via the electronic health records it may not be possible in all instances 
to accurately differentiate between mild and/or moderate severity within the context  of this 
pragmatic trial. 
The study team will make determinations on whether serious adverse eve nts are possibly/likely 
related to study interventions.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_50836] udy from each 
healthcare site. We will also review a minimum of 10 subjects from each participati ng healthcare 
system every quarter to monitor for adverse events and relatedness to study interventi ons. 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48278]. It should be noted tha t these 
adverse events classified as serious are already primary and secondary outcomes for this study 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48279]). Other serious events are those leading to incapacity an d/or 
permanent disability and will also be captured as noted above. 
9.2.4 Unanticipated Problems 
The study team will remain vigilant for unanticipated problems. Trends of increasing f requency 
or rate of safety events in the intervention group will prompt review of individual cases by [CONTACT_48356] (DSMB). 
Other possible unanticipated problems including malfunctioning of the decision suppor t system 
or non-adherence to recommended clinic protocols as well as possible mitigations a re 
discussed in Section [ADDRESS_50837] monthly. There will be reports prepared for submission to t he DSMB quarterly. 
It should be noted that there will be some delay on the acquisition of data regarding some 
adverse events/outcomes. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48280]. Furthermore, information on other serious adverse events such  as 
deaths may not be available to the study team until after review of the Soci al Security Death 
files.

practices by [CONTACT_48357]. As part of participation in the study, the intervention group will continue to be monitored 
by [CONTACT_976][INVESTIGATOR_48281] 12 months of their participati on in the study. 
9.5 Halting Rules 
The study can be halted at any time by [CONTACT_48358], lack of enrollment or poor adherence to study plans and poor ad herence to 
protocol.  
9.6 Safety Oversight (DSMB) 
The study has approval from the IRB at UT Southwestern which will oversee the study for 
Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48282]. There is also IRB 
approval from the  from the [LOCATION_007] Health Resources IRB and the North [LOCATION_007] VA I RB. NIDDK 
has constituted a DSMB that will review and approve final study protocol, address any major 
changes in protocol and have ultimate authority to halt the study according to the  concerns 
detailed in Section 9.5.

11. Statistical Considerations 
11.1  Study Hypothesis:  
It is hypothesized that the PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202]-based interventions can reduce one-year (12  months) 
unplanned all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48223] a triad of CKD, diabetes and hyper tension.  
Study Design:  
A prospective stratified cluster randomization design will be employed. Patients are clustered  by 
[CONTACT_29372], which are stratified by [CONTACT_4295], and randomly allocated to either  the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_48202]-based intervention or a control (standard medical care) group using a rando mized 
permutation block within each stratum. Based on assignment of his or her cl inic, each patient 
will be assigned either to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48283] a standard medical care group. Str atified 
randomization log will be created using SAS PROC PLAN with variable block size s. 
11.2  Sample size consideration:  
We determined sample size based on the comparison of one-year unplanned all-cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48284]-based intervention groups.  
The sample size formula developed by [CONTACT_48359] [64] for stratified randomized t rials was 
employed. From preliminary data we observe that the rate of unplanned all-cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48285] 1-year follow-up period is 14% across all four large health care 
systems in standard medical care group. We expect that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48286] 3% lower than that in the standard medical care group. Electr onic health records 
show that the number of patients with coexistent CKD, hypertension and di abetes are 4,419, 
4,738, 4,175 and 1,093 in Parkland, [LOCATION_007] Health Resources, ProHealth, and VA North [LOCATION_007] , 
respectively. The numbers of clinics are 25, 40, 50, and 9 in Parkland, [LOCATION_007] Health Resources, 
ProHealth, and VA North [LOCATION_007], respectively. From a preliminary dataset extracted from  
51 
 Parkland Healthcare System and THR Healthcare System, we obtained an intracluster 
correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.015.  
If we assumed ICC = 0.[ADDRESS_50840] a 3% difference in the rate of unplanned al l-cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a total of 10,991 patients are needed to achieve 80% power at a two-sided 5% 
significance level. We would need to enroll 3,367, 3,610, 3,181, and 833 patients from P arkland , 
THR, ProHealth, and VA North [LOCATION_007], respectively.  Here, 10,991 patients are 76.2% of  14,425 
patients from the 4 healthcare systems participating in the study. Waiver of consent has been 
obtained from all IRBs overseeing the study and no informed consent will be ob tained from 
patients.  There is an opt-out option available for patients in the implement ation and in the 
control groups and based on the nature of the interventions a small number of opt-out r equests 
is expected.  Additional practice sites/ clinics will be available at 3 of the 4 partici pating health 
care systems as enrollment sites for additional patients if required in the fu ture.  
  
11.3  Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Standard descriptive analysis will be performed where we summarize continuous variables by 
[CONTACT_48360], and categorical variables by [CONTACT_48361]. The one-year 
unplanned all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48287]-
Haenszel procedure as presented by [CONTACT_48359] [64], which is suitably adjusted for clustering. 
Furthermore, we will use generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to exa mine if there is a 
significant difference in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48288] r controlling 
for potential confounding patient, clinician and clinic factors. The mixed model includes clinic 
random effects to account for within-cluster correlation. Univariate mixed mod els will be 
employed to assess the marginal association between the outcome and individual covariates. 
The final multivariate model will include covariates identified by [CONTACT_48362] n 
procedure as well as those considered to be clinically important a priori . Similar analysis will be 
performed to compare the rates of disease-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. As secondary an alyses, the 
Kaplan-Meier plots will be generated to explore the difference in time to  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48289]. Cox models with frailty will be implemented to evaluate t he treatment effect on the 
event times of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], CV, and death events, controlling for confounding f actors. 
Random effects for clinics are also included. Similar strategy of univariat e and stepwise variable 
selection procedure in mixed model will be implemented to the Cox models with  frailty. 
Statistical significance will be reported for p-value<0.05. All statistical an alyses are performed 
using statistical software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, NC, Gary).  
To construct and evaluate predictive models for unplanned all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], disease-
specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 30-day readmissions, cardiovascular events and deaths, the total 
cohort will be randomly separated into derivation and validation datasets (2/3 and 1/3 sample, 
respectively). Based on the derivation set, we will select independent variables wit h p-
value<0.20 from univariate analysis as candidate variables for multivariate analysis. We will 
explore possible contributions to models from interactions of independent variables and from 
splines, transformations, and recursive partitioning for continuous variables. We will use the 
stepwise variable selection procedure on generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to identify 
variables that are significantly associated with outcome variables such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 30 
day readmissions, cardiovascular events and deaths. The goodness of fit criteria and the  Bayes 
Information Criterion (BIC) will be used for model selection.  
 
The resulting model will be externally validated based on the validation dataset.  We will 
evaluate calibration through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test; we will measure discrim ination by [CONTACT_941] 
52 
 c-statistic, the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
and by [CONTACT_48363]. We will divide the patients into fi ve groups based on the 
quintiles of their predicted risk by [CONTACT_10994]. We will compare the true event rate amon g the 
quintile groups to examine how well the predictive model separate patients at diffe rent levels of 
risk. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.  Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents 
The main source of data will be through Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48290] m the EHRs of all 
study sites. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48291]. The data will be de-identified before transfer to the statistical te am for analysis. Other 
sources of data is readmission data from the DFW Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48190], Pro Hea lth databases and

The quality of data received from all sites will be reviewed and verified at begi nning of the 
implementation phase and monthly thereafter to ensure problems are identified and corr ected in 
a timely manner 
13.5 Routine Progress Reports 
We will prepare a monthly progress for each site to include the following:

14.3 Informed Consent Process 
This pragmatic clinical trial will offer an opt-out option for any eligible patien ts in either control or 
intervention groups. There will be no formal informed consent obtained from each ind ividual 
patient. The rationale for waiver of informed consent has been carefully reviewed and presented 
to the IRBs overseeing the study as well as to the federal agencies oversee ing the study. The 
research involves minimal risk to subjects. Both groups including control (standar d care group) 
and intervention will have access to recommended best therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48293], 
diabetes and hypertension. In both groups the primary care provider will have the f inal say on 
what interventions are implemented for the care of CKD, diabetes and hypertension for their  
individual patients. The waiver of informed consent will not adversely affect t he rights and 
welfare of participating subjects. This pragmatic trial cannot be perfor med at all participating 
[ADDRESS_50843] practices for t heir care. 
There will be reference to a phone number and a link to the collaboratory websit e specific to 
ICD-PI[INVESTIGATOR_48294]. If a patient does use the opt-out mechanism, the research team wil l document and 
track the instances for those patients to remain outside of the study interv entions or use of any 
of their specific data.

platform hosting the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48296]. Flat file transfer via SFTP will occur and HL7 based 
data integration will occur with a site specific selection of the best met hod to transmit data 
centrally. In the instance that external approval of data transfer cannot occur, a process of 
locally matching patient selection criteria on software server with a local firewall w ill be 
implemented with a process to allow deidentified data to the SaaS server will be im plemented. 
Access to the central server will be restricted using Secure VPN tunnel with t wo factor 
authorization. The Secure Cloud Hosting Environment will be FISMA ( Federal Information 
Security Management Act of 2002 ) compliant. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48297]: 
Data requests by [CONTACT_48365] 
(NAPHSIS) Death index information from the CDC will be obtained after com pletion of IRB 
submission for approval and then performed at the termination of the study a single time to 
obtain death outcomes after enrollment and follow up of planned time period for  augmentation 
of EHR stored death date and death status of inpatient discharge to ascertain mor tality 
outcomes. 
Master Patient Index matching to a shared Dallas Fort Worth Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48298]-Fort Worth area. Patient outcomes wi thin the 
outside of the Veterans Affairs System will occur with an additional resea rch effort to assess the 
57 
 feasibility of patient patching between the Veterans Affairs patient index an d the DFWHC data 
to provide additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48299]. 
15.2  Data Management and Reports 
Encrypted computers stored in physical secured premise. Patient cohort selection cri teria will be 
preserved in PheKB platform and publically available after the completion of the grant 
(https://phekb.org/ ). Snapshots of the data elements constituting candidate identification and 
confirmation will be stored for all patients meeting the candidate defi nition. 
Formats RDBMS using MySQL or Sql Server environment configured to support the data model 
with access controls overseen by a PCCI Security officer. Deidentified final registr y data sets 
with Safe harbor HIPAA data elements removed will be provided to the final statistics team 
performing predictive modeling for Aim [ADDRESS_50845]. 
Server Data will be backed up on mirrored virtual machines within a partit ioned cloud server 
environment with disaster recovery. RDMBS scripts, stored procedures and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] s TM platform 
executables related will be versioned control using Subversion as will data exports  to the 
analytic teams. 
DATA VALIDATION: 
Annual review of value sets update form the VSAC and HEDIS will be performed to test for the 
impact of newly released medications or laboratory mappi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]. Unexpected drop offs in patient 
identification will also prompt analyst review of site data. Data model and queries wil l be stored 
in version control software. Data mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48300] w ith the local 
site investigator. Medication mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48301]. For example, if an NDC medication code f or a blo od 
pressure medication from the current release of RxNorm maps to an inappropriate medica tion 
(say an estrogen), inappropriate medications will be removed from final cohort  selection. 
Laboratory values for LOINC mapped  labs will be reviewed for name [CONTACT_48374], specimen 
source and that diagnostic results are in expected ranges by [CONTACT_8477], median, maximum, an d  
minimum tables and histograms.  Non-numeric text values will be reviewed to ge nerate 
interpretative keys for all sites with periodic review for text values not mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48302]. For example, if out of range labs reporting changes for HgbA1c f rom ‘>12 .1’ to 
‘>12.3’, new text values not seen during the validation phase will be flagged f or analyst review. 
ICD10 conversation dates will be tracked for all institutions and ICD10 crosswalks f or  inclusion. 
Data transfers to federated data store in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48213] 
[ADDRESS_50846] data model. Local copi[INVESTIGATOR_48303] y 
local versions of the data model within the VA Internet Firewall planned for  initiation of trial 
activity to expedite information security and privacy concerns. Identical query logic will be used 
to identify patients on local copi[INVESTIGATOR_48304]. Federated Data Systems using the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48305]. Minim al data 
transformation steps necessary to standardized date/time formatting and impo rt of data with 
minimal transformations.  
As a condition of the data use agreements signed with ProHealth Physicians, individual 
elements of the Safe Harbor elements of PHI are encrypted before transmission until  they are 
needed for final data sets linkages for outcome standardization to maximize patient  privacy and 
minimize data loss risk. As a result the data base of candidate and confirmed pat ients will be 
mirrored on the ProHealth Corporate Data ware house to allow subsequent on premises 
identification and generation of worklists.  
Data transfers from Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48306]. Patients 
with a candidate status and upcoming appointments in the subsequent week will be reported to 
the practice facilitator for additional follow up confirmatory testing to  be arranged.  An additional 
report on confirmed patients with planned visits in the coming week will al so be transmitted to 
the sites. Additional reports on candidate or confirmed patients presenting in the prior week, not 
reported on the prior report due to new interval data or scheduling changes since the time of the 
prior report will also be transmitted. Where these data transfers can trigger addi tional provider 
notification or worklist integration with the local EHR will be permitted as a site specific IT 
decisions 
Intellectual Property related to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48307]. Data definitions 
and workflows of the cohort selection will be public maintained and associated predictive 
models for specific aim three will be public released. 
Disseminations Methods 
Data Sharing Plan and Public Access 
We are obliged to share our data within the analytic team of the ICD-Pi [INVESTIGATOR_48308]. The authors 
will retain the rights to the deidentifed final data until the trial is compl eted. Interested parties will 
be able to download information about the predictive model from the PCC I 
website.pccipi[INVESTIGATOR_6928].org. 
Short term data storage of transfer files will occurred via encrypted driv es between password 
protected encrypted computers.

PA or NP may suggest deviations from protocol as de emed clinically appropriate. 
Orders (except medication orders) will be placed by  [CONTACT_48367] 
"per protocol" order mode with physician, PA or NP as authorizing provider. Medication 
orders may be routed to provider as suggested per p rotocol, but medication and dose will 
ultimately be selected and ordered by [CONTACT_48368]. Aft er medication orders are finalized by 
[CONTACT_48368], RN will notify patient of final decision.

pressure according to JNC 8 standards: After patien t has sat quietly 
for [ADDRESS_50881] the average of the two —sum of systolic 
values divided by 2 and sum of diastolic values div ided by 2. (See 
Page number 4 (which is page 20 of 52 including int roductory 
section) of the following link for full details: 
http://www.nhibi.nih.goviguidelines/hynertension/ex nress.bdf).

diastolic values (i.e. sum of seven most recent systolic 
values divided by 7; and sum of seven most recent 
diastolic values divided by 7). 
c If average systolic > 140 mmHg or average diastolic > 90 
mmHg, initiate CKD HYPERTENSION PROTOCOL and 
perform at this visit. 
d If average systolic < 140 mmHg AND average diastolic < 
90 mmHg, no further action is necessary.

(v) If not adherent by [CONTACT_6270]-report or refill history, 
discuss with patient importance of adherence. 
(a.) Reschedule RN BP Assessment Visit in 2 
weeks after improved adherence. 
(b.) If patient was deemed non-adherent on two 
consecutive visits, refer to clinical 
pharmacist for medication review and 
assistance with barriers to adherence (cost, 
complexity, etc). 
(vi) If considered adherent by [CONTACT_6270]-report and refill 
history, proceed to "Medication Adjustment". 
6. Medication Adjustment 
a If patient is already on ACEi or ARB but not at maximum 
tolerated dose (see above), increase dose to achieve SBP 
and DBP goal (as per ACEi/ARB PROTOCOL below)

 Appendix II: DIABETES MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL 
Goals :  
The goal of this protocol is to assist primary care providers in delivering diabetes care to 
patients with CKD, type [ADDRESS_50889] ed 
below and in the context of an overall care plan that promotes reduction of cardiovascular risk 
factors. 
• Duration of diabetes 
• Remaining life expectancy 
• Presence and severity of microvascular complications, such as 
o Retinopathy 
o Albuminuria 
o Neuropathy 
• Presence and severity of major active co-morbidities, such as 
o Coronary artery disease 
o Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
o Chronic kidney disease 
o Chronic liver disease 
o Recent stroke 
o Life-threatening malignancy 
• Risk for severe hypoglycemia 
• Financial resources 
• Patient factors that affect adherence, such as motivation, family support, and 
insight 
 
The short-term benefits of improving poor glucose control include the resolution of sympto ms 
(polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, unintended weight loss) and the avoidance of volume 
depletion due to excessive glycosuria, which is especially dangerous in the elderly and those at 
risk for acute kidney injury, and of excessive catabolism resulting in weight loss and ke tosis. 
Long -term benefits include reduced risk of the development or progression of the mi crovascular 
complications of diabetes, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. 
The risks of tighter glucose control include the requirement of increased glucose self-monitori ng 
(cost and inconvenience) and of hypoglycemia. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a major patient 
safety issue, especially in those who have blunted or absent hypoglycemia awareness and 
those with coronary artery disease. 
Thus, for each patient, goals for glucose control must be individualized based on the de gree of 
achievable benefit and the degree of acceptable risk. The figure below from the American 
Diabetes Association Position Statement on Glycemic Targets visually summarizes this risk-
benefit consideration.

take into account multiple factors that cannot be fully protocolized. In striving to reduce the long-
term risks of microvascular complications, it is important to remember that hypog lycemia, if 
severe and prolonged, may result in seizure, coma and death in the short-term.  Even mild 
hypoglycemia in someone driving a motor vehicle, for example, may result in significant  harm to 
the patient and to others. The elderly are particularly at risk for falls r esulting from 
hypoglycemia. 
 
 

84 
 Monitoring Glucose Control : the Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) 
Methods for monitoring glucose control include self-monitoring with glucose meters , continuous 
glucose monitors, and the hemoglobin A1C. For type [ADDRESS_50891], A1C 
measurements may be falsely reduced in cases of shortened RBC lifespan, blood transfusion s 
and hemolysis. Second, renal dysfunction and/or dialysis may complicate the relationship 
between A1C and glucose levels, so it is important to examine the patient’s blood gl ucose 
logbook to assess glucose control by [CONTACT_48372]. In general, the A1C should be 
measured twice yearly in patients who are at goal and every 3 months in those who are 
adjusting their therapeutic regimen. 
Hypoglycemia and the Rule of 15 
At each visit, patients should be asked if they are experiencing symptomatic or asympt omatic 
hypoglycemia. Each patient should demonstrate knowledge of the symptoms of hypoglycemia 
and how to treat hypoglycemia. 15-20 grams of pure glucose is the preferred method of  
treatment for hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dl). The patient should repeat treatmen t with 15-20 
grams of glucose every 15 minutes until their self-monitored blood sugar is above 70 mg/dl 
(Rule of 15). After the blood sugar reaches over 70 mg/dl, the patient should eat a  meal within 
one hour or eat a snack to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia. 
Setting Glucose Control Targets Based on the A 1C 
Guidelines have been proposed for appropriate A1C targets based on the considerations 
described above. 
The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) published in 2012 guidelines for the  
management of hyperglycemia and general diabetes care in C KD. 
• KDOQI Guideline 2.1 recommends “a target HbA1c of ~7.0% to prevent or delay 
progression of the microvascular complications of diabetes, including DKD” (diabetic 
kidney disease). 
 
• KDOQI Guideline 2.2 recommends “not treating to an HbA1c target of <7.0% in patients 
at risk of hypoglycemia.”  
 
• KDOQI Guideline 2.3 suggests “that target HbA1c be extended above 7.0% in 
individuals with co- morbidities or limited life expectancy and risk of hypoglycemia.”  
 
The VA Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus suggest gl ucose 
control target ranges based on major comorbidities, life expectancy, and the presence/sever ity 
of microvascular complications. See Protocol Table 1. 
 
85 
 Protocol Table 1 
 
Protocol Table 1 : From VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline, Management of Diabetes Mellitus, 
2010, p. 49. 
 
As eGFR declines below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, the risk of hypoglycemia increases. Thus, it is 
important to reassess glucose control targets in the setting of declining renal fun ction. The 
American Diabetes Association Consensus Conference on Diabetic Kidney Disease (2014) has 
recommended the A1C goal of <8% when GFR <60 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_50892] in the face of fr equent or 
dangerous hypoglycemia, as well as the development of hypoglycemia unawareness. On the 
other hand, a more aggressive goal of <6.5%, if achieved without significant hypoglycemia, may  
be appropriate in “early -onset diabetes in younger pati ents” (Tuttle et al., 2014).  
 

86 
 General Guidelines for Antidiabetic Medications 
• Metformin, which reduces liver glucose production, is usually the first line treat ment for 
type [ADDRESS_50893] 
o Long history as safe and effective 
o May reduce risk for cardiovascular events ([LOCATION_006]PDS) 
• If glycemic goals have not been reached after [ADDRESS_50894] little remaining beta cell function, 
insulin therapy is usually required. Refer to Protocol Figure 3 for a schematic 
approach to initiating insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
o In patients already on oral antidiabetes medications up to three oral agents, a 
basal insulin (glargine, detemir, or NPH) is usually added as a single daily 
injection. If prandial bolus insulin is later added, then sulfonylureas, DPP- 4 
inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists are usually discontinued. Combination of 
basal-bolus insulin with metformin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], or SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce 
the insulin requirement and improve control over insulin only. 
• In general, one can expect a 1% decrease in the A1C after starting an oral antidiab etes 
medication and an additional 1% decrease after adding a second oral agent. 
• If given as part of dual or triple therapy with insulin, any antidiabetes m edication can be 
associated with hypoglycemia. 
 
Specific Guidelines for Oral Antidiabetes Medications 
• The medications listed below are the most commonly prescribed in the U.S. Other 
approved drugs are used less frequently due to lower efficacy or side effects. 
• Recommended dose adjustments in CKD for the non-insulin diabetes medications have 
been published. The table below is taken from Tuttle KR et al. Diabetic Kidney Disease:  
A Report From an ADA Consensus Conference. Diabetes Care  2014,37:2864- 2883.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
87 
 Metformin 
• Increases risk for lactic acidosis in those with significant renal dysfunction (do not use if 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, in those at risk for AKI, and in those with fluctuating renal 
function) 
• Use of Metformin in CKD : 
o FDA label reads, “do not use if SCr ≥1.5 mg/dl in men, ≥1.4 mg/dl i n women,” but 
this restriction has been questioned due to the low incidence of metformin-
induced lactic acidosis 
o Proposed recommendations from Lipska et al. Use of Metformin in the Sett ing of 
Mild- to-Moderate Renal Insufficiency. Diabetes Care . 2011, 34:1431-1437: 
 
▪ eGFR ≥60   No renal contraindications; monitor annually 
▪ eGFR <60 and ≥45  May continue use; monitor every 3-6 months 
▪ eGFR <45 and ≥30  Use caution and at lower dose (e.g. 50% maximal) 
Monitor every 3 months 
Do not start new patients on metformin 
▪ eGFR <30   Stop metformin  
 
• May cause GI side effects, including diarrhea and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], but these are minimized  if 
started at low doses, taken with food, and titrated up slowly 
 
o Start at [ADDRESS_50895] tolerated 
o Maximal dose is 2550 mg/day in divided doses or 2000 mg of the extended 
release (ER) formulation 
• Prolonged use is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency 
 
Sulfonylureas (glyburide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]) 
• Promote insulin secretion independent of ambient glucose level 
o Risk of hypoglycemia 
o Use with caution in the elderly and in CKD 
o Avoid use in stage 3 or greater CKD 
o Glipi[INVESTIGATOR_48326] 
• Efficacy is good initially but requires addition of second agent sooner than other drugs 
• Risk for weight gain 
• Must not skip or delay meals 
• Low cost 
 
 
 
 
88 
 Rapid-acting Secretagogues (repaglinide, nateglinide)  
• This class, the metaglinides, are more rapid-acting than sulfonylureas and are taken 
before each meal 
• May cause less hypoglycemia than sulfonylureas in patients who skip or delay meals 
• Expensive 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]  
• Promotes insulin sensitivity in muscle and reduces hepatic glucose production 
• Disadvantages include weight gain (both water and fat), edema and heart failure, and 
increased risk of bone fracture 
• Contraindicated in NYHA Class III and IV heart failure 
• Advantages include low risk of hypoglycemia and good durability of efficacy 
• Generic formulation now available; low cost 
• No adjustment for eGFR 
 
DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin) 
• Increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion 
• Low risk of hypoglycemia; no weight gain 
• Expensive 
• Possible risk of acute pancreatitis 
• Possible increased risk of heart failure admissions 
 
SGLT2 Inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) 
• Inhibit reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, thereby [CONTACT_48373] 
• Advantages include low risk of hypoglycemia, weight loss, and blood pressure lowering 
• Do not rely on intact beta cell function, so SGLT2 inhibitors are effective at all stages in 
the natural history of type 2 diabetes 
• Do rely on renal function; as renal function falls, SGLT2 inhibitors are less effect ive 
• When starting, consider reducing doses of diuretics or other antihypertensives to avoid 
hypotension 
• Must use with caution or not at all in patients with eGFR <60;  
• Renal dosing: 
o For canagliflozin and dapagliflozin see Table below 
o Empagliflozin: do not use for eGFR <45 
 
 
 
 
 
89 
 GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (exenetide, liraglutide, albiglutide) 
• Stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, delay 
gastric emptying, and diminish appetite 
• Advantages include low risk of hypoglycemia and weight loss 
• Disadvantages include requiring injection and cost 
• Some experience nausea/vomiting, especially soon after starting treatment 
• Rodents have developed thyroid C-cell tumors in these drugs, but the risk for hum ans is 
not known   
• Contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of medullary carc inoma of the 
thyroid or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 
• Some reports of exenetide drug-induced renal injury

 Another commonly used formula to design a starting multi-injection insulin reg imen is to 
estimate the total daily dose of insulin as follows: 
Total Daily Dose (TDD)= 0.5 units X body weight in kilograms 
The estimated TDD for a 70 kg person would be 35 units. 
Prescribe 50% of the Total Daily Dose as basal insulin and 50% as prandial insulin divided 
between three meals.  
In the example of the same 70 kg person, prescribe 18 u basal insulin once daily and 6 u rap id-
acting insulin three times daily before each mea l. 
For the elderly, those at risk for hypoglycemia, or significant CKD, conside r a lower multiplier, 
e.g 0.2-0.4 units X body weight in kilograms to determine the TDD.

 Recommendations for Lipid Management in Patients with Diabetes and CKD  
A new KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid Management in CKD greatl y simplifies the 
approach. Regardless of LDL, statins are recommended for all adult patients with both diabetes 
mellitus and non-dialysis- dependent CKD, unless there is a contraindication or statin -
intolerance. Initial assessment of fasting lipid profile is recommended, but routine reassessment  
of fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_48327]. Specific KD IGO 
recommendations are as follows: 
Statin or statin/ezetimibe treatment is recommended for: 
• Adults ≥50 years with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 but not treated with chronic dialysis or 
kidney transplant 
•  
Statin treatment is recommended for: 
• Adults ≥50 years with eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2  
 
Statin treatment is recommended for: 
• Adults aged 18-49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or ki dney 
transplantation with one or more fo the following: 
 
o Known coronary artery disease (MI or coronary revascularization) 
o Diabetes Mellitus 
o Prior ischemic stroke  
o Estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or non-fatal MI >10%.  
 
Drug treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in adults with CKD is not recommended but rat her 
therapeutic lifestyle changes are advised. Therapeutic lifestyle changes include diet changes, 
weight reduction, increased exercise, reduction in alcohol consumption, and improvement in 
glucose control if indicated. In the case of severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides >1000 
mg/dl), drug treatment with fibrates may be considered for patients with CK, but at doses 
adjusted for kidney function. 
KDIGO Guidelines recommend doses for statin use in CKD that are based on regimens and 
doses “shown to be beneficial in randomized trials done specifically in this population” (adult s 
with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or on renal replacement therapy). 
See Protocol Table 3 for recommended doses of statins in mg/day for adults with CK D. 
 
 
 
95 
 Protocol Table 3 
  
Protocol Table 3. From  Kidney International Supplements  (2013) 3(3), p. [ADDRESS_50896] for Patient Visits 
o Ask about symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
o Review how to recognize and self-manage hypoglycemia (Rule of 15) 
 
o Action point: If the patient is having hypoglycemia unawareness, frequent 
hypoglycemia, or severe hypoglycemia, liberalize glycemic targets for at least 
several weeks in order to allow recovery from hypoglycemia unawareness or 
prevent its onset. 
o Glucagon kits are recommended for those at risk for severe hypoglycemia. 
 
o Is the patient pregnant? Might the patient be pregnant? 
o For overweight or obese patients, encourage weight loss/maintenance through 
sustainable lifestyle interventions. As little as 5-10% reduction in body weight may result 
in significant improvement in glucose control. 
o Consider referral for medical nutrition therapy 
o Review with the patient exercise recommendations for adults with diabetes who can  
safely exercise:  
o At least 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity (50-
70% of maximal heart rate) over 3 days per week 
o Resistance training two days per week 
o Advise smoking cessation and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48328]; refer for counseling 
if indicated 
o Confirm or administer annual influenza vaccine 
o Confirm or administer pneumococcal vaccine 
o Confirm yearly dilated retinal exam 
o Confirm yearly diabetic neuropathy screen (vibration and 10-gram microfilament tests ) 
o Examine feet and instruct in foot self-exam by [CONTACT_1962] 
o Consider actions to reduce the patient’s cardiovascular risk profile  
o Consider statin therapy for all adults 18 or older with diabetes and CKD u nless 
the patient is statin-intolerant or statins are contraindicated (e.g. pregnancy)  
o Follow protocols for management of hypertension to achieve  ≤140/90  
o Consider whether the patient would benefit from daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (75-162 mg/da y) 
▪ 10-year cardiovascular risk of >10% (includes most men >50 years and 
women >[ADDRESS_50897] one additional risk factor (family 
history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], albuminuria) 
o Review interval medical history and instances of hypoglycemia. Adjust A1C treatment 
target as appropriate 
o Consider screening for depression, especially if patient adherence is complicating 
glucose control 
o Review A1C and self-monitored glucose logbook and adjust antidiabetes medications to 
treat- to-target.

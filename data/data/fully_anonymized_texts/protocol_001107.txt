Version  Date: December 21, 2022  
Versio n: I 
  
Imperative Trial Protocol    
 
Imperative Care  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_611916] been 
specifically designed to track through the tortuous anatomy of the 
neurovasculature and are intended to be used, in conjunction with a vacuum 
source, to remove thrombus in order to restore blood flow to the brain during an acute ischemic stroke .  
 
The Zoom Reperfusion System i ncludes the commercially available Imperative 
Care 0.088” ID Catheters  and the Zoom Reperfusion Catheters  (0.035” to 0.071” 
ID Catheters) , Zoom Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477100], and Zoom Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448982] (or 
equivalent vacuum pump). The Imperative Care 0.088” ID Catheters have FDA 
clearance for facilitating introduction of interventional devices into the 
neurovasculature  and the Zoom Reperfusion Catheters , with the Zoom 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477101] (or equivalent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477102] ), 
have FDA clearance for direct aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477103].  
 
Within this trial, the  Imperative Care 0.088” ID Catheters will be used  as the 
primary access device for all cases and  direct aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477104].  If a Zoom 
Reperfusion Catheter is used  for direct aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , the Imperative Care 0.088” ID 
Catheter should be positioned as close to the occlusion as possible and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477105] 0.088” ID Catheter .      
Objectives  To assess  the safety and efficacy of the  Zoom  Reperfusion System  in subjects 
diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and undergoing mechanical 
thrombectomy procedure.  
Control Devices  N/A - This is a single arm study.

 Indications for Use  The Zoom  Reperfusion System , including  the Zoom  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477106] (or equivalent vacuum pump), are indicated for use in the 
revascularization of patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to 
intracranial large vessel occlusive disease (within the internal carotid, middle 
cerebral – M1 and M2 segments,  basilar, and vertebral arteries) within 8 hours 
of symptom onset.  
 
Patients who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolytic therapy  or who fail 
thrombolytic  therapy are candidates for treatment.  
Clinical Trial/ 
Investigation Design  Prospective, Multicenter, Open label, Single arm study to assess  safety and 
reperfusion success following thrombectomy within [ADDRESS_611917] seen normal and meeting all trial 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Number of Subjects  Up to [ADDRESS_611918] consent screen failures . Enrollment will stop when the 
target number of  evaluable  subjects or enrollment limit ha s been reached.   
Number of 
Arms/Randomization  Single arm/No randomization  
Number of Centers  Up to 30 sites (US)

 Trial Endpoint(s)  Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is reperfusion  success, defined as achieving a 
mTICI score ≥ 2b  in three or less passes of the Zoom  Reperfusion System  (primary 
modality ) without using additional thrombectomy devices or rescue therapy . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• Time to achieve mTICI score ≥ 2b, defined as the time from groin 
puncture to physician assessment of m TICI score ≥ 2b  
• The mTICI 3 success rate, defined as the proportion of patients achieving 
mTICI score  3 flow  
• First pass success rate ( mTICI score ≥ 2b), defined as the proportion of 
patients where the primary treatment was accomplished with the first 
pass   
• The mTICI 2c success rate, defined as the proportion of patients 
achieving mTICI score ≥ 2c flow  
• Modified Rankin S cale (mRS) ≤2 at 90 days using the primary treatment 
modality  
• Quality of Life Assessement, measured by [CONTACT_477107] (SIS) 
Questionnaire.  
 
Primary Safety Endpoint:  
• Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH), as confirmed by [CONTACT_9661], 
at the [ADDRESS_611919] -procedure visit  
Secondary Safety Endpoints:  
• 90-day all-cause mortality  
• Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) as confirmed by [CONTACT_477108] [ADDRESS_611920] -procedure visit  
• Embolization in new territory (ENT)  
• All serious  adverse device effects  (SADEs) through [ADDRESS_611921] -
procedure  
• All serious adverse events through [ADDRESS_611922]

2. NIHSS >=[ADDRESS_611923] seen well  
4. Pre-event mRS scale  0-1 
5. Large vessel o cclusion of the  intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) , middle 
cerebral artery (MCA) -M1 or M2 segments , basilar, or vertebral arteries  as

6. For strokes in anterior circulation, ASPECT S >=6; For strokes in posterior 
circulation, pc -ASPECTS >=[ADDRESS_611924]/CTA or MRI/MRA for trial eligibility performed or repeated

14. CTA or MRA evidence of carotid stenosis requiring treatment for intracranial 
access  
15. Excessive vascular access tortuosity or target vessel size that will likely 
prevent endovascular access  with the Imperative Care 0.088” ID Catheters  
16. Intracranial stent implanted in the same vascular territory that would 
preclude the safe deployment/removal of the thrombectomy devices  
17. Occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, 
or anterior circulation/vertebrobasilar system) as confirmed on CTA/MRA, 
or clinical evidence of bilateral strokes or strokes in multiple territories  as 
determined by [CONTACT_1963]  
18. Significant mass effect with midline shift as confirmed on CT/MRI  
19. Evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma defined as ≤  3cm 
and asymptomatic ) as confirmed on CT/MRI  
20. Angiographic evidence of pre -existing arterial injury, e.g. , carotid dissection, 
complete cervical carotid occlusion, or vasculitis  
Determination of 
Sample Size The sample size for this trial was based on determining the number of subjects 
needed to demonstrate that the performance goals  established for the primary  
safety and efficacy endpoint s, as well as the first Secondary Safety endpoint, will 
be met with 90% probability of success  or power.

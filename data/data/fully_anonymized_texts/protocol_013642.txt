Indication 
Oral contraception  
 
Objectives: 
Primary objective 
• To determine the effect on cervical mucus score of  a delayed intake of [ADDRESS_832605] daily use  
 
Subordinate primary objective 
• To estimate the duration of the protective effect of cervical mucus after last pi[INVESTIGATOR_624924] [ADDRESS_832606] use 
 
Secondary objectives 
• To evaluate and compare the percentage of subjects  with a protective cervical mucus score 
during reported perfect daily use, during a treatme nt period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and 
during a treatment period with a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624925] 75 mcg.   
• To evaluate and compare the ovarian activity durin g reported perfect daily use, during a 
treatment period with a delayed intake of 6 hours a nd during a treatment period with a missed 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_624926] 75 mcg.  
• To assess if a combination of cervical mucus score  and ovarian status can be considered as a 
measure of protection from conception during report ed perfect daily use, during a treatment 
period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period with a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624927] 75 mcg. 
• To determine levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics after  a single dose of norgestrel 75 mcg, at 
steady state, after a delayed intake of 6 hours and  after a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].   
• To assess the safety of norgestrel [ADDRESS_832607] participation will be approximately 4 .5 months long (up to one month for screening, thre e 
28-day treatment periods, up to 12 days of follow-u p and up to 5 days for the end of study visit (EOS)  
after the last pi[INVESTIGATOR_624928]-up visit) (see  Figure 1 below).

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 
Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most widely used hormonal method of contraception in the United 
States (US). Combined estrogen-progestin OCs (COCs)  are the most frequently-prescribed OCs in the 
US, while progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (POPs) are less freq uently prescribed. POPs are mainly prescribed to 
breastfeeding women or when the use of a COC is con tra-indicated.  
 
POPs prevent conception by [CONTACT_625001], 
thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm pene tration, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH peaks, 
slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallop ian tubes, and altering the endometrium (McCann 
1994). 
 
Because of the lower dose of progestin in POPs comp ared to the dose in COCs, the reliance on 
mechanisms of action other than ovulation inhibitio n, and the potential importance of consistent daily  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_82959], POPs are perceived to be not as effect ive as COCs. However, when used as directed, POPs 
seem to be as highly effective as a COC, with a per fect-use failure rate estimated at 0.3% and a typic al 
use failure rate estimated at 9% (Trussell, 2011; C urtis, 2016). A recent Cochrane review concluded 
that no firm conclusion is possible concerning the comparative efficacy of POPs or whether such pi[INVESTIGATOR_624945] (Grimes A, 2013). 
 
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® (norgestrel (NG) 75 mcg) is a 2nd  generation synthetic progestin-only oral contracep tive approved 
in the US in 1973, (under the proprietary name [CONTACT_625049] ®) at a daily dose of [ADDRESS_832640] marketed 
in 1974 in the US. NG is a mixture of two enantiome rs, only one of which levonorgestrel (LNG) being 
the active form. LNG have been marketed in the US a nd in Europe for more than 30 years in a wide 
variety of contraceptive products (including combin ed and progestin-only oral contraceptives, implant,  
vaginal ring, intrauterine system, and emergency co ntraceptives)..  
  
Approval for marketing in the US by [CONTACT_625002] (FDA) was based upon the 
results of eight clinical trials of continuous dail y oral NG 75 mcg. The study sites represented all m ajor 
US geographic regions and participants were 53% Cau casian and 47% African-American. There was 
a combined [ADDRESS_832641] one cycle of medication (28 days), and 
21 856  28-day cycles of exposure in women aged 15 to 49 years. Thirty-seven pregnancies were 
confirmed during the eight clinical investigations,  resulting in an overall use effectiveness (Pearl I ndex) 
of 2.[ADDRESS_832642]. The theor etical use effectiveness rate among women 
experiencing a method failure therefore has a Pearl  Index of 0.98 per 100 women-years (N = 2 173; 21 
854 cycles; 1 821 women-years). 
 
As with other POPs, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® has only few contra-indications, the most relevant  is having history of breast 
cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the  US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive 
Use, 2016, list “current breast cancer” as the sing le condition that represents an unacceptable health  
risk (category 4) for a woman if she uses POPs. Onl y a few other conditions are listed for which the u se 
of POPs is not usually recommended unless other, mo re appropriate, methods are not available. The 
main adverse reactions consist in the disturbance o f the menstrual cycles, and other few and moderate 
hormonal reactions such as delayed follicular atres ia or ovarian cysts. 
 
 
2. RATIONALE, BENEFITS AND RISKS 
 
NG, as with other POPs, is currently prescribed wit h the advice that it should be taken without 
interruption every day at the same time to achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness. Any pi[INVESTIGATOR_624946] 3 hours late is considered a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624947] (Han L  
2017).  
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 18/[ADDRESS_832643] immediate leve l 
of protection provided by [CONTACT_625003], but offering a full  protection for less than 24 hours (McCann 1994). 
In fact, there are only very few studies assessing the PK of oral NG/LNG for use as POP and no data 
linking the PK to the pharmacodynamic (PD) action o f POPs. In one study where five subjects were 
given a single dose of 30 mcg LNG (Weiner 1976), th e mean plasma half-life was 13.7 hours with large 
variability between subjects (7.95 to 23.23 hours).  Twenty four hours after drug intake, the plasma 
concentrations were 0.05 to 0.14 ng/mL. The plasma levels observed in 3 subjects taking 30 mcg LNG 
daily for 3 weeks were between 0.10 and 0.40 ng/mL when measured 12 hours after the oral 
administration each day during the 3-week treatment  period. Brenner et al. (1977) found that serum 
levels of LNG were 0.2 to 0.5 ng/mL [ADDRESS_832644] of POPs on cervi cal 
mucus. In healthy women given 350 mcg of norgestrie none for 13 days, cervical mucus displayed 
changes in its macromolecular structure, i.e. an ex treme degree of compactness, an appearance typi[INVESTIGATOR_624948] (Chretien et al. 1980). Th e cervical mucus remained extremely dense [ADDRESS_832645] dose mucus was considered as 
not protective. Lebech et al. (1970) found that spe rm penetration of the cervical mucus was totally 
inhibited in 3 out of 4 subjects treated with 0.5 m g/day megestrol acetate but returned to normal 
[ADDRESS_832646] dose. Howe ver, interpretation of the results of these continu ous 
low-dose progestogen contraceptive studies is hampe red by [CONTACT_625004], the incomplete 
description of the methodology, and the absence of statistical analysis and it is not known whether su ch 
results can be extrapolated to NG 75 mcg.  
 
Regarding ovarian activity, it was shown that 75 mc g NG daily for 30 days inhibited or suppressed LH 
and FSH peaks and the rise of serum progesterone (P 4) and urinary pregnanediol during the luteal 
phase, suggesting that even if there was follicular  rupture, this was associated with luteal insuffici ency 
(Moghissi and Marks, 1971). In another study where 29 subjects received 30 mcg LNG daily, an 
ovulation defined as follicular rupture associated with P4 level above 30 nmol/L was observed in 28% 
of all studied 57 cycles (Rice CF, 1999). However, there is no study analysing both ovarian activity a nd 
cervical mucus in women treated with NG and no data  are available regarding the effect of delayed or 
missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624949].  
 
In the light of limited PK and PD data on NG and PO Ps in general that supports the clinical guidance o f 
taking it everyday at the same time within a three hour window, this exploratory study aims to determi ne 
the PD mechanisms underlying the contraceptive prot ection of NG 75 mcg. Primarily, the study will 
evaluate whether these PD mechanisms are impacted b y a delayed intake or a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. 
 
The main PD endpoints will be the cervical mucus as sessed according to the WHO guidelines excluding 
the volume component as already described (Dunson e t al, 1998; Petta et al, 1998) and the ovarian 
activity measured with a Ovarian Activity Score (OA S) (see Appendix 3).  
 
 
3. OBJECTIVES 
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of a delayed intake of [ADDRESS_832647] of cervical mucus is consider ed as present when the score is below or equal 4. 
 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 19/80   The secondary objectives are: 
• to evaluate and compare the percentage of subjects  with a protective cervical mucus score 
during reported perfect daily use of norgestrel 75 mcg, during a treatment period with a delayed 
intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period wit h a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624926] 75 mcg.   
• To evaluate and compare the ovarian activity durin g reported perfect daily use, during a 
treatment period with a delayed intake of 6 hours a nd during a treatment period with a missed 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_624926] 75 mcg.  
• To assess if a combination of cervical mucus score  and ovarian status can be considered as a 
measure of protection from conception during report ed perfect daily use, during a treatment 
period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period with a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_624927] 75 mcg.  
• To determine levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics after  a single dose of norgestrel 75 mcg, at 
steady state, after a delayed intake and after a mi ssed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
• To assess the safety of norgestrel [ADDRESS_832648] daily use and after a  
delayed intake of 6 hours and after a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
 
This study includes three 28-day treatment periods (approximately 3 months) with a screening period 
of up to 1 month to demonstrate ovulatory status pr ior to enrollment, a possible follow-up of 12 days to 
follow ovarian activity if a follicle ≥ 15 mm is observed at the end of period 3 and an en d of study (EOS) 
visit within 5 days. Women of reproductive age (18- 35 years old) who meet eligibility requirements wil l 
receive treatment for a total of three 28-day perio ds (84 days) but in treatment period [ADDRESS_832649] 
a 6-hour delay in pi[INVESTIGATOR_624950] a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (see  Figure 2  below).  
 
Figure 2 Design of the study 
 
 
Besides the screening visit, a total of approximate ly 28 visits will be required for this study but up  to 7 
additional visits per menstrual cycle (up to 3 in t reatment periods 1 & 2, up to 7 in treatment period  3) 
may be required if an ovarian follicle of ≥ 15mm in one dimension is visualized on TVUS.   
 
The study is designed to evaluate cervical mucus at tributes, ovarian activity and PK of LNG after dail y 
treatment by [CONTACT_625005] [ADDRESS_832650] weeks of treatment will be observed. I n addition, PK profile of LNG will be determined af ter 
a single dose (Day 1) and at steady state (on week 3). 
 
In the second and third periods of treatment, the d ifference on cervical mucus score and ovarian activ ity 
score between a perfect use (Day 41 ± 3 / Day 69 ± 3) and a 6-hour delayed intake (Arm A Day 42 ± 3 
and Arm B Day 70 ± 3) or a missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (Arm B Day 4 3 ± 3 and Arm A Day 71) will be assessed.

Two investigational research centers located in the  US will conduct the study. A complete list of 
investigators, sub-investigators, and coordinators will be maintained with trial documentation. 
 
Listed here are the investigational research center s conducting this study: 
• Alison Edelman, MD, MPH: Oregon Health & Science U niversity, Portland, Oregon 
• Mitchell Creinin, MD: University of [LOCATION_004] Dav is Health, Sacramento, [LOCATION_004] 
 
 
6. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT 
 
Participants will be recruited from two research ce nters in the US. Competitive recruitment will be 
planned between the two centers. Each center will e nroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_832651] 45 subjects.  
 
Subjects will be recruited from family planning cli nics and other clinics serving reproductive-aged 
women for gynecologic care and reproductive health services (including the clinics’ database) as well 
as through IRB-approved research recruitment effort s (newsletters, in-services, tear-ads, radio ads, 
social network ads, online form etc). Referrals fro m previous / ongoing participants are accepted. Thi s 
study will be listed on the website ClinicalTrials. gov (see section 21.1). Subjects will be selected f or the 
study according to the inclusion and exclusion crit eria detailed in section 9.  
 
Information collected before signature [CONTACT_625050] (ICF), if used, will be stored in a 
locked office, with access limited to study staff. For subjects electing to enroll in the study, this 
information will become a part of their protected r esearch record. For subjects choosing not to enroll , 
all protected health information (PHI) will be stor ed confidentially with the research study informati on in 
a locked cabinet and archived with other study-spec ific documents at the closure of the trial. 
Confidentiality of PHI will be maintained according  to regulations and sites’ procedures.    
 
Women will be screened for eligibility and  interest in study participation. If they meet the b asic criteria 
and agree to participate, they will be required to provide informed written consent prior to beginning  any 
study procedures. The protocol and patient informat ion sheet/ ICF will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_60284]. Informati on collected and created in order to conduct and ov ersee 
this research study may be stored according to regu lation, sites’ procedures and with the agreement of  
the participant.  
 
 
7. STUDY DURATION 
 
The total duration of the study for each participan t is expected to be approximately 4.5 months: up to  4 
weeks for screening to meet enrollment criteria, 12  weeks of treatment and a possible follow-up of 12 
days to follow ovarian activity if a follicle ≥ [ADDRESS_832652] recruitment is expected to begin Q2 2018 an d is planned to continue through the beginning of 
Q1 2019. However, if the enrollment rate declines, the enrollment period may be extended beyond this 
date. If this enrollment timeline is met, all subje cts should finish active treatment by [CONTACT_625006] Q2 2019. Therefore, the total duration of th e study will be approximately 15 months for each 
study site.  
 
Results of the study are expected to be available Q 3 2019.

Approximately [ADDRESS_832653] use and 
a cycle with an infringement in the schedule is 14 % in the expected proportions of women with a loss 
of protection at any time and if the proportion of discordances between the 2 situations is 17% then t he 
exact power is equal to 79.1%. If the expected diff erence in proportions is 15% with a rate of 
discordance of 18% then the exact power is 82.4% fo r an unconditional test. The expected difference 
in proportions need therefore to reach 14-15 % to g et a sufficient power for detecting a significant 
difference. This difference in proportions is a sub stantial difference knowing that most of change in 
status (see discordance rate) are in the same direc tion i.e. from protection to loss of protection.

in order to properly document the determination of eligibility. 
 
13.4 Hormone testing 
 
Hormone testing (P4, E2, FSH, LH) will be performed  locally at each site.  
 
P4 will be tested at all visits up to EOS visit, wi th the exception of V2 R and V3 R during the DMP periods. 
 
E2, FSH and LH will be tested at all regular visits , extra visits and follow-up visits until a postovu latory 
image is observed, with the exception of V2 R and V3 R during the DMP periods. 
 
The samples will be destroyed after completion of C SR. 
 
Point of care urine high-sensitivity pregnancy test ing will be performed at V1 1 (enrollment visit) before 
dispensation of study drug and at the EOS visit.  
 
13.5 Levonorgestrel concentrations

13.8 Cervical mucus 
 
Cervical mucus will be sampled and analysed at all regular and extra visits, including all the visits during 
the DMP period. The cervical mucus collection will always be performed before TVUS. 
 
A gynecologic exam is completed to assess the cervi cal mucus score based on the modified Insler 
score (WHO manual 2010). Consistency (viscosity), f erning, spi[INVESTIGATOR_624961] a 4-point scale (0-3), see Appendix [ADDRESS_832675] of cervical mucus is consider ed as present when the score is below or equal 4. 
 
The cervical mucus will be collected by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_1516].  The cervical mucus assessment will be made by a 
limited amound of trained clinic personnel in order  to limit variability. A centralized training will be 
organized to maintain a high level of consistency f or these evaluations. It is recommended that an 
experienced physician or specifically trained nurse  (whoever is available on site at the time of subje ct 
visit) perform the exam on each subject, and the nu mber of examiners be limited to the smallest group 
needed by [CONTACT_625012].

bleedings if any in an e-diary: 
 
 
14. STUDY VISITS 
 
14.1 Screening visit (V0, during luteal phase)  
 
The purpose of the screening evaluation is to obtai n baseline history, physical exam, and laboratory 
evaluations to determine if the subject meets eligi bility criteria. Prior to any screening procedure b eing 
performed, potential participants will receive info rmation about the study, including potential risks,  and 
patient information sheet / informed consent form, that they will sign.  
 
Screening will include the following procedures: 
• The risks, benefits, and alternative methods of co ntraception will be reviewed with each subject 
in a manner consistent with her education level. 
• Each woman must sign an IRB-approved informed cons ent form before any of the study-related 
procedures can be performed. The original signed in formed consent form will be kept on file by 
 
1 postovulatory image is defined as:  
• abrupt disappearance of follicle like structure ( FLS) or 
• reduction in size of the leading follicle > 4 mm at two consecutive visits or  
• haemorrhagic corpus luteum (FLS at least as large  as the leading follicle)

  Page 29/[ADDRESS_832676]’s records. A copy  of the executed form will be given to the 
subject. 
• A unique subject identification number will be ass igned by [CONTACT_625013] o f screening assessments. 
• Demographic characteristics will be collected incl uding date of birth, ethnicity, and race. 
• Previous medical, surgical and gynecological histo ry will be collected, including history of acute 
and chronic medical and gynecological conditions, m arijuana, illicit drug and alcohol use history, 
menstrual cycle history, current sexual activity, p revious contraceptive use, pregnancy history 
and plans for future pregnancies. This includes rec ording the date of onset of last menstrual 
bleeding along with the date of last use of a metho d of contraception. 
• Vital signs (pulse, and blood pressure) will be ob tained and recorded with the subject in a sitting 
position after at least 2 minutes’ rest. This metho d will be employed for all blood pressure 
measurements taken during the study.  
• Height and weight will be recorded. BMI will be ca lculated in kg/m².  
• General physical and gynecological examinations (b reast and pelvic examinations) will be 
performed. 
• A TVUS will be performed to ensure the subject has  an intact uterus and both ovaries and 
assess endometrial thickness, endometrial appearanc e, presence of follicles and TVUS 
abnormalities. 
• If indicated, a Pap test will be performed. 
• Chlamydia and gonorrhea tests. A wet mount should be obtained if vaginitis is suspected. 
• Wet mount and KOH preparation of vaginal fluid to confirm diagnosis bacterial vaginosis if there 
is presence of non-physiologic vaginal discharge. 
• Blood sampling for clinical chemistry and CBC test s for safety as well as P4 to check ovulatory 
status.  
• Women will be questioned regarding concomitant med ications. Concomitant medications taken 
within the 2 weeks before screening and from time o f consent will be reported, in addition to 
indications for the medications and reasons for dis continuing. 
• Subject eligibility will be assessed based on all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Adverse events happening after signature [CONTACT_625052], Pap an d STI test results (if indicated), and remaining el igibility 
criteria must be reviewed by [CONTACT_978]/medical designe e before enrolling the subject. The 
investigator/medical designee must review laborator y reports, which should be filed with each subject’ s 
chart. The PI/medical designee will consider an ind ividual subject’s risks regarding use of a POP. The  
woman will be informed by [CONTACT_756]/email of her sc reening results and, if eligible, she will be instr ucted 
to notify the study site when her next menstrual bl eeding occurs in order to schedule the next visit.  
If any laboratory results are abnormal, according t o local lab standards and clinically significant pe r the 
investigator’s judgment, the subject will be inform ed and excluded from the study as well as referred to 
her primary health care provider. At the discretion  of the investigator, abnormal laboratory assessmen ts 
may be repeated before a final determination of exc lusion is made. Subjects who have vaginitis, or 
those that screen positive for Chlamydia or gonorrh ea, should be treated and can then be enrolled into  
the trial once proof of cure is obtained. It is adv isable to have partners of women who screen positiv e 
for Chlamydia or gonorrhea treated as well.  
If a subject is on a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhi bitor at time of screening, and is not taking the 
CYP3A4 inhibitor on a chronic basis, the subject ma y be re-evaluated for enrollment [ADDRESS_832677] be related to treatment completion 
and unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study. 
 
Laboratory assessments performed >[ADDRESS_832678] delayed enrollment beyond 60 days since screen ing should be queried regarding any changes in 
their medical history and the investigator will det ermine if there is a need to repeat the physical ex am, 
including the gynecologic exam (breast and pelvic e xaminations). Vital signs (BP and pulse) and 
weight/BMI should be verified in accordance with ex clusion criteria.

15. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
15.1 OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFE TY REPORTING   
 
15.1.1 Definitions of Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), severity 
and causality assessment 
 
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or  clinical trial subject administered 
a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 
An adverse reaction  is defined as “all untoward and unintended respons es to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered” . The definition also covers medication errors and 
uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, incl uding misuse and abuse of the product. The definiti on 
implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the IMP. This means 
that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to sug gest a causal relationship. 
 
The reference document used to assess the expectedn ess is US Product Information of the study 
treatment. A copy of the document will be provided to the investigators before study start. 
 
An event is considered a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE), if in the view of either the investigator o r 
sponsor, it meets the criteria as outlined in 21 CF R 312.32 (a) as per the following:  
Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose t hat results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life threatening adverse drug experience,  
NOTE: The “life-threatening” criterion in the defin ition of “seriousness” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at immediate risk of death at the t ime of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94137], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263281]:  
1. routine medical treatment or monitoring or surge ry in relation with the indication 
studied in the protocol and not associated with any  deterioration  
2. planned treatment for a pre-existing condition t hat is unrelated to the indication 
of the current study and has not worsened since the  start of study medication (in 
that case, this pre-existing condition should be me ntioned in the e-CRF as 
patient’s history or concomitant disease) 
3. Emergency consultation without any medical admis sion 
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• is medically important 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercise d in deciding whether the case should be 
considered serious in other situations, such as imp ortant medical events that may not result in death,  
be immediately life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403870], may jeopardize the patient or subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or conv ulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624968] o r drug abuse.”   
 
Severity 
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the s everity of each AE using the following definitions for 
severity criteria: 
• Mild – events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities. 
• Moderate – events result in a low level of inconve nience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures.  Moderate events may cause some interfere nce with functioning. 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 38/80   • Severe – events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment.  Severe events are usually inca pacitating. 
 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the r elationship between the AE and the investigational 
product. The Investigator must determine whether th ere is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to an  AE. The relationship assessment, based on clinical  
judgment, often relies on the following: 
• A temporal relationship between the event and adm inistration of investigational product; 
• A plausible biological mechanism for the investig ational product to cause the AE; 
• Another possible etiology of the AE; or 
• Previous report of similar AEs associated with th e investigational product or other agents 
in the same class. 
 
The terms used to assess the relationship of an eve nt to the investigational product are: 
Causality Assessment Criteria for Assessment (note that re-challenge does not 
apply in this study) 
Certainly Related The experience occurs immediately  following investigational 
product administration, related pharmacologically ( not related to 
underlying condition/concurrent disease or other dr ugs or 
chemicals) 
Possibly Related The experience follows a reasonabl e temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration and/or follows a kn own response 
pattern to the investigational product but could ha ve been 
produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s  clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy. 
Unlikely Related Improbable temporal relationship. The experience was most 
probably produced by [CONTACT_625014]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic intervention or concomi tant therapy and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the inv estigational 
product. 
Not Related There is not a reasonable possibility t hat the AE is related to the 
investigational product; when an AE is assessed as not related to 
the investigational product, an alternative etiolog y, diagnosis or 
explanation for the AE should be provided. If new i nformation 
becomes available, the relationship of any AE shoul d be 
reviewed again and updated as required. 
 
15.1.2 Adverse Events: Recording and Reporting 
All AEs will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations and reported in the  
eCRF and in the clinical study report (CSR). 
At every visit, study staff will ask each subject h ow she has felt since her last visit as well as dir ectly 
and indirectly ask if she has experienced any AEs. A review of the subject’s diary should be completed  
during the visit with the subject to identify any p ossible AEs reported through the diary.  
The reporting period for AEs, regardless of serious ness or relationship to the study drug, is the peri od 
immediately following the subject signing the infor med consent through the EOS. However if an AE/SAE 
is reported after the last visit and considered as related to the IMP, the sponsor has to be informed.

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 39/[ADDRESS_832697]’s e-CRFs an d must include the following information (when 
applicable):  
• Specific condition or event.  
o Whenever possible, diagnosis or syndrome should be  reported instead of symptoms.  
o Laboratory, vital signs or ECG parameters should b e recorded as AE only if they are 
medically relevant (e.g.: symptomatic, leading to s tudy drug discontinuation, requiring 
medical treatment). 
o Indication of whether the condition was preexistin g prior to study entry or not and if yes, 
whether it has worsened in severity or frequency in  which case it is reported as an AE. 
Conditions present prior to study entry (screening)  that do not worsen in severity are 
considered medical history, not considered AEs. (Re fer to Section 11.2 Prior and 
Concomitant Illnesses and Treatments).  
• Date of occurrence.  
• Date of resolution. If the event has not resolved by [CONTACT_2054]-reporting period, it will b e 
documented as still present on the case report form .  
• Severity (AEs that change in intensity are recorde d at the intensity level that is the most severe 
reported by [CONTACT_625015]. If t he intensity category changes over a non-
consecutive period of time, then these changes shou ld be recorded separately with distinct onset 
dates). 
• Relationship to study medication as evaluated by t he investigator (causality assessment). 
• AE outcome (recovered, ongoing, etc.) 
• Seriousness 
 
The investigator should also specify actions taken with respect to the study drug(s), corrective treat ment 
given, additional investigations performed, outcome  and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a

visit, the participant will be asked to report it t o investigator, so it can be reported to the sponso r (see 
section 15.1.2). 
 
15.1.4 Study reporting for SAEs 
The reporting period for SAEs is the period immedia tely following the informed consent signature [CONTACT_625053]. In case a SAE is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after the end of th e 
clinical trial and is considered by [CONTACT_625016] d by [CONTACT_53610] a reasonable possibility, the 
SAE will be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigil ance Department. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution, even if thi s extends beyond the study-reporting period. 
Resolution of a SAE is defined as the return to bas eline status or stabilization of the condition with  the 
expectation that it will remain chronic.  
In case of SAE, the investigator must immediately: 
• Enter within 24 hours the information related to t he SAE in the appropriate screen of the e-CRF. 
• Attach the photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_624969]: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 40/80   • All further documentation should be sent by [CONTACT_625017]’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department within [ADDRESS_832699] from the Sponsor 
Pharmacovigilance Department. 
Fax:  
E-mail:  
 
Any additional SAE supporting documentation should be transmitted to Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department whenever possible (with subject identifi cation information redacted) to verify the medical 
diagnosis. This includes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624970], lab report, death certificates/autopsy reports 
(where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, h istology reports, and imaging reports.  
 
As the IND holder, HRA is responsible for the appro priate recording, review and compliance with 
regulatory reporting requirements of SAEs to the FD A in accordance with 21 CFR 312.50.  
 
15.1.5 Follow up 
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measur es to ensure the safety of the patient and should 
follow the outcome of the AE/SAE until return to no rmal or consolidation of the patient’s condition.

15.3 PREGNANCY DETERMINATION AND FOLLOW-UP 
 
Subjects are not supposed to be at risk for pregnan cy (see inclusion criteria) but If a subject become s 
pregnant during the study, the investigator must in form HRA of the pregnancy within [ADDRESS_832703] accurate:  
1. TVUS. 
2. Estimate based on pelvic and/or abdominal examin ation or pregnancy outcome. 
3. Daily diary information ( e.g. , last menstrual period). 
4. Quantitative β-hCG determination. 
5. Investigator estimation in the absence of above criteria. 
 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be informed of pregnancy options and referred for 
appropriate care.  
All pregnancies will be monitored until outcome (i. e. 9 months follow-up or until outcome information is 
obtained). Information will also be collected on an y maternal or fetal complications. Congenital 
anomalies or birth defects will be classified as SA Es. Pregnancy outcome data will be collected for 
analysis. Reports of pregnancy outcome and examinat ions during the pregnancy will be requested from 
the attending physician/outside clinic, if applicab le. Pregnancy outcome data will include the rates o f 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, live preterm, and  full-term births. 
If a subject has a spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy this will be considered as a SAE. In 
addition, congenital malformations and anomalies wi ll be recorded as SAEs and summarized.  
If a subject continues with her pregnancy through c hildbirth, every effort will be made to maintain co ntact 
with her so that health of the baby [CONTACT_625024] d at six and twelve months. Any outstanding data at  
the end of the study that is collected will be subm itted to the FDA as a Safety Update to the NDA 
submission. A clinical summary of the prenatal and postnatal events will be reported separately from 
the case report form in narrative format in the cli nical summary report.

19.3.4 Other secondary analyses 
 
Protection from conception based on cervical mucus score and OS (binary and ternary 
analyses)) 
 
Based on cervical mucus score and OS only, the aim of these exploratory analyses are to assess if a 
combination of cervical mucus score and ovarian sta tus can be considered as a measure of protection 
from conception or not and the level of protection,  during reported perfect use of norgestrel 75 mcg a nd 
after a delayed intake/missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. 
 
For both analyses, the assessment criteria will be the OS and the highest cervical mucus score during 
the 3 visits before a postovulatory image is obtain ed including the visit when the postovulatory image  
is obtained 2. 
For the OS, the risk of conception is ranked depend ing on the OS: OS nlp  > OS alp  > OS a > OS q and for 
each treatment period the most risky OS will be con sidered.  
 
Binary analysis 
 
The aims of this analysis is to determine whether a  subject is protected on not, according to the 
algorithm presented in Figure 4 
 
Figure 4 Conception protection based on OS and cerv ical mucus score (binary analysis) 
 
 
The endpoints will be, for each treatment period, t he distribution of subjects:  
 
1 The ovarian status are: 
OSq = quiescence defined as a OAS ≤ 3 
OSa = ovarian activity defined as a OAS = 4 or 5 
OSalp = ovulation with abnormal luteal phase define d as a OAS = 6 at only one visit 
OSnlp = ovulation with normal luteal phase as a OAS  = 6 at two consecutive visits or OAS = 7  
2 The number of visits considered for the evaluation of the mucus score may be modified by [CONTACT_625034] (see section 20).

19.4 Safety analysis 
 
Safety data will be collected by [CONTACT_625036] g and the EOS visit. Subjects will report bleeding 
data and drug intake using a e-diary every day.  
Evaluation of the bleeding patterns will be based o n the subjects responses in the e-diary and validat ed 
during clinic visits. Vaginal bleeding in between e xpected menstrual periods will be categorised as 
breakthrough bleeding and spotting based on the ble eding intensity recorded in the e-diary. 
Amenorrhea or absence of bleeding for two menstrual  cycles or more than 60 days in subjects who 
took the medication as prescribed will also be note d.   
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_625037]. Summaries will be 
provided for all AEs reported, and separately for A Es leading to study discontinuation. Serious Advers e 
Events (SAEs) will be listed separately and describ ed by [CONTACT_625038].

Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving H uman Subjects Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General 
Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_832744] WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], Octo ber 2002 (Note of Clarification added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 20 04 (Note of Clarification added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea , October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, Octob er 2013 
 
PREAMBLE  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has develope d the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving h uman subjects , including  research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole a nd each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant pa ragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Decl aration is addressed primarily to physicians. The 
WMA encourages others who are involved in medical r esearch involving human subjects to adopt these 
principles. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the p hysician with the words, "The health of my patient 
will be my first consideration," and the Internatio nal Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physic ian 
shall act in the patient's best interest when provi ding medical care." 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and s afeguard the health, well-being and rights of patie nts, 
including those who are involved in medical researc h. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultim ately must include studies involving human subjects . 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involvin g human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve pre ventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best  proven interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effe ctiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards  that promote and ensure respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights.  
 
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is  to generate knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individ ual research subjects. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in  medical research to protect the life, health, dign ity, 
integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, an d confidentiality of personal information of resear ch 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physici an

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 73/[ADDRESS_832745] an increased likelihood of 
being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receiv e specifically considered protection. 
 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is onl y justified if the research is responsive to the he alth 
needs and priorities of this group and the research  cannot b carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In  
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 74/[ADDRESS_832746], incentives f or 
subjects and information regarding provisions for t reating and/or compensating subjects who are 
harmed as a consequence of participation in the res earch study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe  appropriate arrangements for post-trial provisions . 
RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for con sideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concerned research ethics committee before the stud y begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researc her, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified. It must take into considera tion the laws and regulations of the country or 
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduce o r eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoin g studies. The researcher must provide monitoring 
information to the committee, especially informatio n about any SAEs. No amendment to the protocol 
may be made without consideration and approval by t he committee. After the end of the study, the 
researchers must submit a final report to the commi ttee containing a summary of the study’s findings 
and conclusions.  
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the p rivacy of research subjects and the confidentiality  
of their personal information. 
INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_625046]. Although it may be appropriate to con sult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may b e enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees. 
26. In medical research involving human subjects ca pable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, me thods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the rese archer, the anticipated benefits and potential risk s of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail and any othe r relevant aspects of the study. The potential subj ect 
must be informed of the right to refuse to particip ate in the study or to withdraw consent to particip ate 
at any time without reprisal. Special attention sho uld be given to the specific information needs of 
individual potential subjects as well as to the met hods used to deliver the information.  
After ensuring that the potential subject has under stood the information, the physician or another 
appropriately qualified individual must then seek t he potential subject's freely-given informed consen t, 
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 75/[ADDRESS_832747]'s dissent should be 
respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for 
example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents 
giving informed consent is a necessary characterist ic of the research group. In such circumstances the  
physician must seek informed consent from the legal ly authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research can not be delayed, the study may proceed without 
informed consent provided that the specific reasons  for involving subjects with a condition that rende rs 
them unable to give informed consent have been stat ed in the research protocol and the study has 
been approved by a research ethics committee. Conse nt to remain in the research must be obtained 
as soon as possible from the subject or a legally a uthorized representative. 
31. The physician must fully inform the patient whi ch aspects of the care are related to the research.  
The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient's decision to withdraw from the stud y 
must never adversely affect with the patient-physic ian relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human m aterial or data, such as research on material or 
data contained in biobanks or similar repositories,  physicians must seek informed consent for its 
collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exce ptional situations where consent would be 
impossible or impractical to obtain for such resear ch. In such situations the research may be done onl y 
after consideration and approval of a research ethi cs committee. 
USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those 
of the best current proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
• Where no proven intervention exists, the use of pla cebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; 
Or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound metho dological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven on e, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an  intervention  
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 76/80   • And the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, 
or no intervention will not be subject to additiona l risks of serious or irreversible harm as result 
of not receiving the best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this o ption. 
POST-TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, resea rchers and host country governments should make 
provisions for post-trial access for all participan ts who still need an intervention identified as ben eficial 
in the trial. This information must also be disclos ed to participants during the informed consent proc ess. 
RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINA TION OF RESULTS 
35. Every research study involving human subjects m ust be registered in a publicly accessible database  
before recruitment of the first subject. 
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and pub lishers all have ethical obligations with regard to  
the publication and dissemination of the results of  research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly  
available the results of their research on human su bjects and are accountable for the completeness 
and accuracy of their reports. All parties should a dhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting.  
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive resul ts must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affili ations and conflicts of interest must be declared i n the 
publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be 
accepted for publication. 
UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE 
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, wher e proven interventions do not exist or other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician,  after seeking expert advice, with informed consent  
from the patient or a legally authorized representa tive, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life , re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object  of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be rec orded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

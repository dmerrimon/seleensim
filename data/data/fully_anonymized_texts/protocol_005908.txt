CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Anticipated 
Regulatory Classification s: Class II in [LOCATION_002]  
Indication : ECHELON  ENDOPATH  Staple Line Reinforcement  is indicated for use in 
surgical procedures in which soft tissue transection or resection with staple line reinforcement is needed. ECHELON  ENDOPATH Staple Line 
Reinforcement  can be used for reinforcement of staple lines during lung 
resection and bariatric surgical procedures. Th
e device can also be used 
for reinforcement of staple lines during gastric, small bowel and colorectal 
procedures.  
Objective(s):  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety following use of ECHELON ENDOPATH Staple Line Reinforcement ( ECHELON  SLR) in 
subjects undergoing indicated gastric and lung resection  procedures. The 
secondary objective will be to capture usability data of the device. 
Overview of 
Study Design:    This prospective, single- arm, multi -center study will collect clinical data in 
a post -market setting by [CONTACT_212638] ( gastric  and lung resection) . 
Investigators will perform each procedure using the device in compliance 
with their standard surgical approach and the ECHELON  SLR 
instructions for use ( IFU).  
Subjects  will be consented and screened anytime during a period of [ADDRESS_255001]- operatively through 
discharge and again at 28, 70, and 135 days (± 14 days)  post-surgery ; 
therefore, from the surgery date to study exit, the duration will be approxima tely 19 weeks . 
 
Trial Number : ESC_2018_03  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 34 
Version: Amendment 3 – Gastric proc edures only   11 JU N 2021 
Number of 
Subjects:   A minimum of 243 treated  subjects (maximum of 431 treated subjects) 
will be included in the study from up to 16 sites in the [LOCATION_002] with 
the following procedure targets:  
• A minimum of  112 treated subjects for gastric  procedures; and 
• A minimum of  131 treated subjects for lung resection procedures . 
Given the lack of available clinical data on the ECHELON SLR, an 
adapt
ive approach to sample size re- estimation will occur after 
approximately 50% of the originally planned sample size in each group 
has been enrolled. The purpose of this interim analysis will be to estimate the rate of the primary endpoint in each procedure group as well as to understand the size of the relative reduction in the rate of the primary 
endpoint  in relation to published literature. Based on these observed 
value s, the sample size will be re- estimated.  Upon completion of the 
sample size re -estimation, the Sponsor will determine if enrollment will 
continue to the originally planned enrollment values above (the minimum 
number listed above for each procedure group) , stop at the time of the 
interim  analysis due to futility , or increase the sample size in one or both 
groups  if the true endpoint rate or effect size differ from the original 
estimates.  
Criteria for Inclusion:  Subjects satisfying the following criteria will be considered eligible for enrollment in this study:

Statistical Analysis:  Analysis Sets 
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed 
on the set of subjects in whom the ECHELON  SLR is utilized during the 
surgical procedure. The summary of all primary and secondary endpoints 
will be performed by [CONTACT_212638] ( gastric  or lung resection).  
  
Primary Endpoint Analyses  
The following hypothes es will be evaluated for the primary endpoint for 
gastric procedures:  
H0: pG ≥ 14.0% 
H1: pG < 14.0% 
Where pG is the percentage of subjects experiencing at least one 
occurrence of bleeding, leak, or stricture through 70 days. A 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated for p  based on the sample 
proportion of subjects experiencing the endpoint using the Normal approximation to the Binomial distribution, and the upper limit of this 
confidence interval will be compared to 14.0% to evaluate the above 
hypotheses. A p -value will be determined based on the same Normal

3.3 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
3.3.1  Procedure Description  
Elective gastric  and lung resection procedures where ECHELON  SLR is indicated for use 
(See Section 3.2.1 for the study specific procedures)  will be performed per  the institution’s 
standard of care ( SOC ).  
3.3.[ADDRESS_255017] 60 mm reload cartridges.  
For this study, only the ECHELON FLEX ™ Powered Plus Stapler  (with ECHELON 
ENDOPATH GST 60 mm cartridges) should be used with the ECHELON SLR .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Device Description  
The ECHELON  SLR (Figure 1)  is a sterile, bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement. The 
applicator contains a set of reinforcement materials: one each for the upper and lower 
stapler jaws.  
 
 
Figure 1: Image of the ECHELON SLR . 
 
The reinforcement material is composed of a VICRYL® material coated with a thin 
polydioxanone film on each side. The VICRY L component is prepared from polyglactin 
910, a synthetic absorbable copolymer of glycolide and lactide, derived respectively from 
glycolic acid and lactic acids. The polyglactin 910 component is essentially absorbed 

 
Study  Number : ESC_2018_03  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 34 
Version: Amendment 3 – Gastric proc edures only    11 JU N 2021 
within 120 days. The VICRYL material is degraded via a combination of hydrolytic and 
enzymatic pathways and has been found to be both biocompatible and nonantigenic, 
with a history of use as bioabsorbable sutures, membranes and other implantable 
devices.  
The polydioxanone which coats the VICRYL is a poly (p- dioxanone) polymer. The 
polydioxanone is essentially absorbed within 120 days. The reinforcement material 
elicits a mild tissue reaction during absorption. The polydioxanone material is degraded via a combination of hydrolytic and enzymatic pathways and has been found to be both biocompatible and nonantigenic, with a history of use as bioabsorbable sutures.  
The ECHELON  SLR contains a pre- applied, patterned adhesive composed of a mixture 
of water soluble alkylene oxide copolymers, which attaches the reinforcement material to the stapler reload and anvil.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Indications  
ECHELON  ENDOPATH  Staple Line Reinforcement  is indicated for use in surgical 
procedures in which soft tissue transection or resection with staple line reinforcement is needed. ECHELON  ENDOPATH Staple Line Reinforcement  can be used for 
reinforcement of staple lines during lung resection and bariatric surgical procedures. The device can also be used for reinforcement of staple lines during gastric, small bowel and colorectal procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Labeling of Study Products  
The ECHELON  SLR has received 510(k) clearance in the [LOCATION_002] from the Food 
and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) . The study device will use the cleared labeling.  The 
Sponsor requires no additional labeling in this study .

interac tive coding processes.  
4.3 VIDEO RECORDING AND ANALYSIS  
Video will be used in an exploratory analysis to validate the utility of video analysis to assess 
several study variables. Video footage will not be considered source documentation for 
purposes of data collection for this study.  C-SATS, part of the [COMPANY_012] Institute, 
is a performance management system for healthcare professionals that may be used to assess and improve performance continuously, accurately, and objectively. In this study, the 
C-SATS platform may be used for video upload and analysis.  
Videos of the surgical procedure will be recorded at applicable investigational sites. Videos 
should be of the entire procedure, as per physician/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109210] .  
Upon completion of the surgical procedure, the video will be sent to the Sponsor via one of the following methodologies, based on local requirements:  
• Upload videos to Sponsor from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212635]; or  
• Send video via encrypted hard drive to the Sponsor.  
Specific instructions for each delivery method will be included in the Investigator Site File.  
The following variables will be reviewed through videos obtained during the procedure (as 
mentioned in Section 3.4.2): 1) counts of number of study device(s) replaced during surgery 
due to slippi[INVESTIGATOR_212636], 2) e ndocutter and reload used (type, name, and color [for 
reload]) for each firing during the procedure along with which firings are associated with the study device, 3 ) if intervention used for i ntra-operative bleeding on the staple line, capturing 
length of time, type and number of interventions used,  and 4) total video operative time will 
be captured.  Additional post -hoc data collection and analysis of other variables from the 
videos may be performed.  
The video collected will be used for an exploratory  comparison analysis  to data  entered into 
eCRFs (based on source document worksheets, subject files, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]) , in 
order to validate the use of video for possible endpoint assessment in future studies .  
Any issues observed by [CONTACT_212656] a device deficiency shall be reported following the sponsor’s product complaints reporting process for medical devices. For any discrepancies noted as a result of the comparison analysis, onl y the site -
reported data will be considered for purposes of study endpoint assessment, as the videos 
are not considered source documentation for purposes of study data collection.  
In order to maintain independence of the video reviewers, access to the EDC  database will 
not be granted to the video reviewers.  
Participation with  video recording of the surgical cases is not mandatory. Surgeons or 
subjects who decide to opt out will still be included in the study.  
4.4 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of  
qualified investigators and appropriate sites, review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, and periodic monitoring visits by  [CONTACT_429] . The Sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy and completeness during monitoring 
visits  and periodic reviews; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator or

5.3 INTERVAL WINDOWS  
Interva l windows for the purpose of analysis in this study will not be defined outside of those 
already specified in the protocol for visit scheduling . The final visit occur s approximately 19 
weeks after surgery, thus no interval windows need to be defined given the absence of long-
term follow -up in this study. The Schedule of Events specifie s a window of 14 days around 
the scheduling of the follow -up visit s, and any information entered in the eCRFs at this visit 
will correspond to the associated visit. There will be no assigning of observations to time 
points outside of the visit to which they are recorded in the eCRFs . 
5.4 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS AND AS SOCIATED HYPOTHESES 
All study endpoints are described in Section 2.1 through Section 2. 3. The following 
hypothes es will be evaluated for the primary endpoint for gastric procedures:  
H0: pG ≥ 14.0% 
H1: pG < 14.0% 
Where pG is the percentage of subjects experiencing at least one occurrence of bleeding, 
leak, or stricture through 70 days. A 95% confidence interval will be calculated for p G based 
on the sample proportion of subjects experiencing the endpoint using the Normal approximation to the Binomial distribution and the upper limit of this confidence interval will 
be compared to 14.0% to evaluate the above hypotheses. A p- value will be determined 
based on the same Normal approximation methodology .  
A similar methodology will be applied to the data observed in lung procedures to evaluate the following hypotheses:  
H
0: pL ≥ 12.0% 
H1: pL < 12.0% 
Where pL is the percentage of subjects experiencing at least one occurrence of prolonged air 
leak or empyema through 70 days.  
5.5 LEVELS OF SIGNIFICANCE 
Each of the sets hypotheses above will be evaluated using a one- sided significance level of 
0.025 and the overall level of significance across the study will be controlled at a value that 
does not exceed 0.05. Estimation of all additional endpoints will be performed using 95% confidence intervals . 
5.[ADDRESS_255023] a 
minimum of 80% power for rejecting the null hypothesis when the expected rate of the primary endpoint is 7% based on current available literature
1,2. Similarly, fo r the lung 
resection group, a sample size of at least [ADDRESS_255024] a minimum of 80% 
power for rejecting the null hypothesis when the expected rate of the primary endpoint is 6% based on current available literature
3. Each calculation is determined using the Normal 
approximation with a one- sided significance level of 0.025 and makes the assumption of a 
20% reduction in the expected rate of the primary endpoint with the ECHELON SLR.  The 
 
Study  Number : ESC_2018_03  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 34 
Version: Amendment 3 – Gastric proc edures only    11 JU N 2021 
performance goal -based hypotheses specified in Section 5 .4 are based on establishing 
acceptable initial performance of the ECHELON SLR by [CONTACT_193327] a doubling of the expected 
risk that has been reported in the literature for these procedures.  
Accounting for an anticipated dropout rate as  high as 12.5% in each procedure group leads 
to an initial planned sample size of 112 subjects in the gastric group and 131 subjects in the 
lung resection group.  
Given the lack of available clinical data on the performance of the ECHELON SLR, an 
adaptive approach to sample size re- estimation will occur after approximately 50% of the 
originally planned sample size has been enrolled into each procedure group. The purpose of 
this interim analysis will be to estimate the rate of the primary endpoint in each gr oup or 
concurrently to estimate the size of the relative reduction of this endpoint relative to the 
values reported in current literature. The current sample size calculation assumes an expected background rate of 7%  in the gastric group, 6% in the lung resection group, and 
that a 20% relative reduction will be observed with the ECHELON SLR.  Based on the values  
observed at the interim analysis time points for each group,  the within -group sample size s will 
be re- estimated. A sample size of 200 subj
 ects has b een set as the maximum sample size 
that will be pursued following the interim analysis and sample size re- estimation  process in 
the gastric group and a maximum of 231 subjects has been set in the lung resection group.  
The sam
ple size re- estimation  for each group will apply the methodology described in Lan 
and Trost4 and Wang, Keller, and Lan5.  Following that methodology, the prespecified 
conditional power lower limit for futility is set at 10% , and the upper limit for maintaining the 
original sample size is set at 80%. Specifically, if the conditional power evaluated at the time of the interim analysis is ≤ 0.10, the trial within that procedure group will be stopped for futility 
and the null hypothesis will be accepted. If the conditional power is ≥ 0.80, then the study will continue to its originally planned completion with no sample size adjustment. If t he 
conditional power is between 0.[ADDRESS_255025] disposition will be summarized in total and by [CONTACT_212660]. The number and percentage of subjects completed and discontinued will be 
tabulated along with the specific reasons for discontinuation.  
 
Study  Number : ESC_2018_03  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 34 
Version: Amendment 3 – Gastric proc edures only    [ADDRESS_255026] demographics (age, gender, race and ethnicity ) will be 
presented in total and by [CONTACT_212638]. Similar summaries will also be provided for 
baseline and surgical characteristics including body mass index, surgical procedure, smoking history, ASA physical status classification, procedure duration, and additional surgical data outlined in earlier sections.  
5.9.4  Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
Within each procedure group, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing  an 
occurrence of the primary endpoint will be summarized and a 95% confidence interval for 
each rate will be estimated.  The performance goal hypotheses will be tested based on 
methodology as described above in Section 5 .4.  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each component of the composite 
endpoint will be summarized in each procedure group.  
All device -related and procedure- related AEs reported during the study will be coded to 
MedDRA. All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_212661]. Separate summaries will be provided for device- related 
and procedure- related AEs. Serious AEs will be summarized in a similar manner. 
Counts and percentages will be provided for usability data collected via surgeon 
questionnaire and summary statistics will be provided for the number of study devices 
attempted and used during the surgical procedure.  
5.9.5  Plans for Interim Analyses 
One interim analysis in each procedure group is planned for sample size re- estimation. 
Details are provided in Section 5 .7 above. Study enrollment may continue while the interim 
analysis is ongoing.  
5.9.6  Handling of Missing Data  
All summaries will be performed only on subjects undergoing the scheduled procedure 
and only observed data will be summarized. There will be no imputation of data for early terminated subjects or for missing data within the database for the primary evaluation of 
the hypotheses specified above. Sensitivity analyses will be detailed in the SAP that will 
be designed to assess the robustness of the primary study conclusions to missing data or incomplete data on early terminated subjects.  
5.9.7  Subgroup Analyses  
Descriptive summaries are planned to be provided for each procedure within the lung 
resection group (lobectomy, segmentectomy, etc.). Subgroup analyses may be performed 
for additional groups  pending the distributions of baseline demographic or clinical 
characteristics. These analyses will be exploratory , and s ummary statistics for the 
procedure- related parameters will be provided for each subgroup .  
6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
All adverse events considered unlikely, possibly, probably, or causally related to  the device or 
the procedure will be collected during this study.

date. Any pre- existing condition that has worsened in intensity, frequency, or the character 
of the condition should be recorded as a new AE on the AE eCRF, as an exacerbation of the pre- existing condition and the start date will be recorded as the time when the 
exacerbation occurred.

6.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the I nvestigator ’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE.  A change in severity 
may constitute a new reportable AE.  
The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each AE: 
• MILD:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but does not interfere with the patient’s 
usual activity, or is a transient event that resolves without treatment and with no 
sequelae. 
• MODERATE:  A sign or symptom, which interferes with the patient’s usual activity . 
• SEVERE: Incapacity with inability to do work or usual activities . 
6.3 RELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the I nvestigator ’s responsibility to assess the relationship of a reportable AE (as defined 
in Section 6.1.1). Only AEs considered unlikely, possibly, probabl y, or causal ly related  to the 
study procedures or  the ECHELON SLR  device are to be recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an AE  in the 
study : 
• Not related  – Relationship to the procedures or device can be excluded when:  
o The event is not  a known side effect of the product category the device 
belongs to or of similar devices and procedures;  
o The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures;  
o The event does not follow a known response pattern to the device ( if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
o The discontinuation of the device application or the reduction of the level 
activation/exposure (when clinically feasible) and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level  of activation/exposure), does not impact on the event;  
o The event involves a body  site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_212662] ; 
o The event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical c ondition, an effect of another device, drug, 
treatment, or other risk factors);  
o Harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; or  
o To establish the non- relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
• Unlikely  – The relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the 
event can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. 
• Possible  – The relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled 
out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment). 
Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed, or no information has been obtained 
 
Study  Number : ESC_2018_03  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 34

should also be classified as possible. 
• Probable – The relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the 
event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information 
may be obtained.  
• Causal relationship – The event is associated with the device or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when:  
o The event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures; 
o The event has a temporal relationship with the device uses/application or procedures;  
o The event involves a body -site or organ that:  
 The device or procedures are applied to or is adjacent to; 
 The device or procedures have an effect on;  
o The event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known); 
o The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible);  
o Other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
o Harm to the subject is due to error in use; or 
o To establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
6.[ADDRESS_255031] all AEs (both AEs and SAEs)  considered attributable 
(relationship of possible, probable, causal relationship) to the study procedure or the ECHELON  SLR in the source documents and eCRF .  
Standard medical terminology should be used when recordi ng AEs . In addition, the 
following information should be recorded:  
• Onset date;  
• Resolution date or date of death; 
• Severity of the event;  
• Indication of whether the event is serious;  
• Relationship of AE to the device used in the study;  
• Relationship of AE to the study procedure;  
• Action taken;  
• Event status;  and 
• Was AE anticipated or not  (only for SAEs) . 
Data related to  AEs will be collected until the event resolution, or until the event is 
considered stable, or until all attempts to determine the resolution of the event are

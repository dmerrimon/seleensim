To Be Completed Only If Protocol is to Receive Expedited Review
Applicability
A. Research activities that (1) present no more than *minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or
more of the following categories, may be reviewed by [CONTACT_86411] [ADDRESS_543866] apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted.
C. The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably
place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation,
or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and
breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal.
D. The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects.
E. IRBs are reminded that the standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply regardless of
the type of review—expedited or convened—utilized by [CONTACT_1201].
*“Minimal risk” means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in
and of themselves from those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examination or tests. 45 CFR 46.102(i)
Check the appropriate categories that apply to your research project:
 Study was originally approved by [CONTACT_86412] a convened meeting.
1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met.
A. Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs
that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is
not eligible for expedited review.)
B. Research on medical devices for which (i) an investigational device exemption application is not required *; or (ii) the
medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its
cleared/approved labeling.**
* Study must meet one of the IDE Exempt categories listed on the Device Form Attachment. 
** An approved Device used in research according to its approved labeling is considered Exempt from IDE requirements. 
NOTE: Select Category 1 for compassionate use medical device applications or individual patient expanded access
investigational drug applications for which FDA has waived the requirement for full review.
2) Collection of blood samples by [CONTACT_25877], heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
A. From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts drawn may not
exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week; or
B. From other adults and children* considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the collection procedure, the
amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn
may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than
2 times per week.
NOTE: Intravenous (IV), Port, Central, or any other lines are NOT eligible under this category even if the research involves
“minimal risk”.
*In Kentucky, “child/children” refers to all individuals less than 18 years of age unless the individual(s) is/are legally
emancipated. (See Informed Consent SOP  for discussion of “Emancipated Individuals” under Kentucky state law.)
Individuals less than 18 years of age who are not emancipated meet the federal definition for “child” (e.g., DHHS, FDA, and
U.S. Department of Education). Children are defined in the HHS regulations as “persons who have not attained the legal age
for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the
research will be conducted.” If conducting research outside the state of Kentucky, you are responsible for complying with
applicable state law.
3) Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by [CONTACT_25878]. Examples:
Section 2 Page 1 of 256982
A. Hair and nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_59787] a nondisfiguring manner;
B. Deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
C. Permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
D. Excreta and external secretions (including sweat);
E. Uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by [CONTACT_86413]
a dilute citric solution to the tongue;
F. placenta removed at delivery;
G. Amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor;
H. Supra- and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the collection procedure is not more invasive than routine
prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques;
I. Mucosal and skin cells collected by [CONTACT_59846][INVESTIGATOR_59788], skin swab, or mouth washings;
J. Sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.
4) Collection of data through noninvasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation) routinely employed in
clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x-rays or microwaves. Where medical devices are employed, they must be
cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not
generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.) Examples:
A. Physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not involve input of significant
amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject’s privacy;
B. Weighing or testing sensory acuity;
C. Magnetic resonance imaging;
D. electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring radioactivity,
electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiography;
E. moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate
given the age, weight, and health of the individual.
5) Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been or will be collected solely for non-
research purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis) as well as research involving existing information or specimens that
were previously collected for research purposes, provided they were not collected for the currently proposed research. (Note:
Some research in this category may qualify for Exempt review. This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.) 
(Note: If submission includes materials previously collected for either non-research or research purposes in a protocol for which
IRB approval expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], you may check Category 5. However, a separate category must also be selected for prospective collection
of data/specimens obtained solely for research purposes)
6) Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.
7) Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition,
motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research employing survey,
interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (Note:
Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. This listing refers
only to research that is not exempt.)

Consent/Assent Tips:
If you have multiple consent documents, be sure to upload each individually (not all in a combined file).
If another site is serving as the IRB for the project, attach the form as a “Reliance Consent Form” so the document will not receive
a [LOCATION_006] IRB approval stamp; the reviewing IRB will need to stamp the consent forms.
Changes to consent documents (e.g., informed consent form, assent form, cover letter, etc...) should be reflected in a 'tracked
changes' version and uploaded separately with the Document Type "Highlighted Changes".
It is very important that only the documents you wish to have approved by [CONTACT_41896]; DELETE OUTDATED FILES --
previously approved  versions will still be available in Protocol History.
Attachments that are assigned a Document Type to which an IRB approval stamp applies will be considered the version(s) to be
used for enrolling subjects once IRB approval has been issued. 
Document Types that do NOT get an IRB approval stamp are:

for Recruiting Non-English Speaking Participants or Participants from a Foreign Culture.
Research Repositories  
If the purpose of this submission is to establish a research repository describe the informed consent process. For guidance
regarding consent issues, process approaches, and sample language see the Sample Repository/Registry/Bank Consent
Template .
The informed consent shall be provided as a standard written statement, written in non-technical language. No patient can enter the
study before his informed consent has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered to part of the protocol, and must be
submitted by [CONTACT_181612].
Requests for information about the research or complaints will be addressed to the PI, research staff, or Office of Research Integrity
as appropriate. All requests or complaints will be handled in a timely, courteous, and confidential manner following University policies.
Request for Waiver of Informed Consent Process
If you are requesting IRB approval to waive the requirement for the informed consent process, or to alter some or all of the
elements of informed consent, complete, Section 1 and Section 2 below.
Note: The IRB does not approve waiver or alteration of the consent process for greater than minimal risk research, except
for planned emergency/acute care research as provided under FDA regulations. Contact [CONTACT_41897] ([PHONE_728]).
SECTION 1.
Check the appropriate item:
I am requesting a waiver of the requirement for the informed consent process.
I am requesting an alteration of the informed consent process.
If you checked the box for this item, describe which elements of consent will be altered and/or omitted, and justify the
alteration.
SECTION 2.
Explain how each condition applies to your research.
a) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subject.
b) The rights and welfare of subjects will not be adversely affected.
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration.
d) Whenever possible, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information
after they have participated in the study.
e) If the research involves using or accessing identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could
not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format.
Private information/specimens are “identifiable” if the investigator may ascertain the identity of the subject or if identifiers
are associated with the information (e.g., medical records). This could be any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers  including dates
of service .
If not using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, insert N/A below.
Section [ADDRESS_543871] fit into one of three regulatory options :
1. The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would be
potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (e.g., a study that involves participants who use illegal drugs).
2. The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant and involves no procedures for which written consent
is normally required outside of the research context (e.g., a cover letter on a survey, or a phone script).
3. The participant (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject, and there is an appropriate
alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
Select the option below that best fits your study. 
If the IRB approves a waiver of signatures, participants must still be provided oral or written information about the study.
To ensure you include required elements in your consent document, use the Cover Letter Template  as a guide. There is
an English  and a Spanish  version.
 
Option 1
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document:
b) The principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (i.e., a study that involves subjects
who use illegal drugs).
Under this option, each participant (or legally authorized representative) must be asked whether (s)he wants to sign a
consent document; if the participant agrees to sign a consent document, only an IRB approved version should be
used.
Option 2
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant:
b) Involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (i.e. a cover
letter on a survey, or a phone script):
Option 3
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The subject (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm.
b) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject.
c) There is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

Background
Include a brief review of existing literature in the area of your research. You should identify gaps in knowledge that should be addressed
and explain how your research will address those gaps or contribute to existing knowledge in this area. For interventional research,
search PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for duplicative ongoing and completed trials with same condition and intervention(s).
Biochemically recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer is an increasingly common disease state, with more than 25,000 cases annually [1].
Approximately 30-40% of all prostate cancer patients will develop biochemical or PSA recurrence within 10 years [2]. Whereas, high-
risk localized prostate cancer patients (50-90%) have a higher rate of BCR progression [1]. In 2007, the American Urological
Association defined biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy as an initial PSA level of = 0.2 ng/ml and with a second test
confirming levels of > 0.2 ng/ml without radiological or clinical progression [3]. The natural history of PSA recurrence is usually long but
can be varied. In a longitudinal cohort of 379 men followed for 22 years, the median time from PSA recurrence to prostate cancer
death was not reached after 16 years [4]. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_39044], prostate cancer deaths are occasionally seen as early as 1 year after PSA
recurrence. Thus, although the natural history of recurrent prostate cancer is often one of a slowly progressive disease spanning years
or decades, it can also be very rapid in a subset of patients. Moreover, 90% of all recurrences after radical prostatectomy were found
within 5 years of prostatectomy as per Duke Prostate Cancer Database [5]. Patients who had early (=¬5 years) PSA recurrence have
greater risk for cancer-death compared to those that recur >[ADDRESS_543873] radical prostatectomy [5]. It has been shown that rapid
prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) is closely linked with risk for prostate cancer death and overall survival [4, 6]. Among
men with a PSADT > 3 months after either RP or RT, PSADT as a continuous variable was significantly associated with prostate
cancer death [6]. It has become common in clinical practice to make treatment decisions for men with PSA recurrence based on small
changes in PSA level, PSADT, Gleason score and time to PSA recurrence [4, 8-10]. The clinical entity of recurrent prostate cancer is
fairly common, affecting many current era patients and the subject of many encounters by [CONTACT_354855], radiation oncologists, and
medical oncologists. 
It is challenging to treat because of the absence of radiographic disease to monitor response. There is no clear consensus on when to
begin androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and the optimal duration of ADT in men with BCR. ASCO updated consensus panel
recommendations in 2007, the authors refrained from strongly recommending early ADT initiation [11]. The Veterans Administration
Cooperative Urological Research Group found no difference in overall survival when they compared early with deferred hormonal
therapy [12]. Moul et al. reviewed data from 1,[ADDRESS_543874] on
time to metastasis [13]. However, among those with high-risk disease, (pathologic Gleason =8 or PSADT <12 months, early ADT (i.e.,
starting when the PSA was <5 or < 10 ng/ml) was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of metastasis after a median follow-up of
3.7 years after PSA recurrence [13]. Unfortunately, follow-up was too short to assess the association between timing of ADT and
prostate cancer mortality. Garcia-Albenix et al. analyzed 2,096 men experiencing biochemical recurrence after initial treatment from the
CaPSURE registry (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavour) [14]. The effect of immediate ADT initiation (within
3 months of PSA relapse) on overall survival and prostate-cancer specific survival was evaluated, in comparison to deferred ADT
(initiated at the development of metastases, symptoms or a short PSA doubling time). The adjusted mortality hazard ratio for
immediate ADT versus deferred ADT was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.52-1.60), demonstrating no significant advantage to early initiation of ADT
[14]. ADT confers significant decrements to functioning and quality of life, including sleep disturbance, hot flushes, breast enlargement
and tenderness, mood swing, and increased risk of cardiovascular-related death have been observed [15-16]. Thus, the treatment
decision for biochemical recurrence is complicated by [CONTACT_429852] (gains in overall and disease-
specific survival) against minimization of side effects and decline in quality of life in this generally asymptomatic population. 
Myriad alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_429828]. Celecoxib treatment for post-RP BCR decreased PSA velocity [17].
Increased intake of vegetable proteins while decreasing animal protein and saturated fat consumption [18] or intake of a soy-based
dietary supplement prolonged PSA velocity among men with BCR [19]. NCCN recommends in those population expectant
management is also appropriate given the known toxicity of ADT and with the unclear benefit [20]. Thus, ongoing investigation and
development of non-hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_429829].

biochemical response
To assess health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30 and PR-25) 
Exploratory Objective
Primary tumor from prostatectomy specimen will be assessed for CBD receptor 1 and 2 expression levels, among patients for whom
archival surgical specimens are available.
Study Design
Describe and explain the study design (e.g., observational, secondary analysis, single/double blind, parallel, crossover, deception, etc.).
Clinical Research : Indicate whether subjects will be randomized and whether subjects will receive any placebo.
Community-Based Participatory Research : If you are conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR) , describe
strategies for involvement of community members in the design and implementation of the study, and dissemination of results from
the study.
Qualitative research : Indicate ranges where flexibility is needed, if a fixed interview transcript is not available, describe interview
topi[INVESTIGATOR_41866].

This is a phase I dose escalation study with expansion cohort. Dose escalation will be determined by a Bayesian optimal interval
design (BOIN) design [41]. Patients are enrolled in cohorts with [ADDRESS_543875] cohort, a patient is considered evaluable if he completes 75% of doses. Patients that are not evaluable will be replaced. 
- In the dose expansion cohort, a patient is considered evaluable if he completes 75% of the planned dosing. 
Dose Escalation / De-escalation Decision Rule
Number of patients Treated
Decision Rule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Escalate (or highest) if # DLT >= 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2
De-escalate (or lowest) if # DLT >= 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
Eliminate (or stop) if # DLT >= -- -- 3 3 4 4 5 5 5
The secondary endpoints include assessment of biochemical response via serial PSA and serial testosterone levels, and health-
related quality of life (as assessed by [CONTACT_20368] C-30 and PR-25). 
The correlative endpoint includes CBD receptor 1 and 2 expression levels.
Sample Size/Accrual Rate
We plan to enroll up to [ADDRESS_543876] the number of non-DLT evaluable patients from
expansion cohort. The total sample size for this study is 18 (enrolled) patients with about 12 patients treated at the MTD.
Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The dose escalation and MTD will be determined by [CONTACT_429853](DLT) estimate [41]. The target toxicity probability is
set at 30%. Safety and tolerability of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_429830]. AE counts will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086].

Digital Data
Specimens from subjects (either archival or fresh tumor tissue) are reviewed to confirm diagnosis for participation in the study.
Medical/Clinical information pertaining to protocol is included in the subjects’ medical records. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_174567]’
protocol chart. This ensures timely record review, and allows for collection of data points required to meet primary and secondary
objectives of the study.
Confidentiality of medical information is discussed at length in the informed consent. Subjects are made aware of what data will be
collected, where it is stored and who has access to the information. Study data may be published or shared with other researchers, but
the identity and medical history of each study participant will remain strictly confidential. Representatives of University of Kentucky, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), or representatives and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
may view study data and information.
During the study, information will be collected to assess compliance with the study requirements. These records will be used by [CONTACT_230070], the IRB, and the Investigator(s) in connection with complying with their obligations relating to this study. The records will not be
used for any other purposes or disclosed to any other party without the subject’s permission. All records will be coded with an
identification number to protect their identity. Data will be stored in a secured area for at least two years after the study is completed. All
data stored is on site at Markey Cancer Center Clinical Research Organization in locked facilities, and with limited access to records by
[CONTACT_174582]. All research records will be held for a minimum of six years following completion of the study
Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and at regular intervals during their
participation in this study. Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all Adverse Events (AEs) and all serious
adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; measurement of
protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s).
Patients will be evaluated for all adverse events for the duration of their participation in the study. Patients discontinued from the
treatment phase of the study for any reason will be evaluated approximately 30 days (between 30 and 37 days) after the decision to
discontinue treatment.
Safety will be evaluated from the incidence of all AEs including SAEs and the severity of AEs according to the NCI CTC guidelines.
Reporting guidelines for AEs will comply with the University of Kentucky’s IRB requirements and are extensively described in the
clinical protocol. To minimize risks, tests are performed at intervals to monitor the clinical status of the subject. Confidentiality of
medical information is discussed at length in the informed consent. Subjects are made aware of what data will be collected, where it
is stored and who has access to the information. To assure necessary medical intervention in the event of an adverse experience,
patients are asked to notify their physician in the event of any adverse experience in the consent. The patients are interviewed at each
clinic visit by [CONTACT_429857]. Adverse events from ongoing
studies are reviewed as the sponsor submits them to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429835];

Yes No
PI-Sponsored FDA-Regulated Research
If the answer above is yes, then the investigator assumes the regulatory responsibilities of both the investigator and sponsor. The
Office of Research Integrity provides a summary list of sponsor IND regulatory requirements for drug trials [PDF ], IDE regulatory
requirements for SR device trials [PDF ], and abbreviated regulatory requirements for NSR device trials [ PDF]. For detailed
descriptions see FDA Responsibilities for Device Study Sponsors  or FDA Responsibilities for IND Drug Study Sponsor-
Investigators .
Describe the experience/knowledge/training (if any) of the investigator serving as a sponsor (e.g., previously held an
IND/IDE); and
Indicate if any sponsor obligations have been transferred to a commercial sponsor, contract research organization (CRO),
contract monitor, or other entity (provide details or attach FDA 1571).
IRB policy requires mandatory training for all investigators who are also FDA-regulated sponsors (see Sponsor-Investigator
FAQs ). A sponsor-investigator must complete the applicable Office of Research Integrity web based training, (drug or device)
before final IRB approval is granted.
Has the sponsor-investigator completed the mandatory PI-sponsor training prior to this submission?
Yes No
If the sponsor-investigator has completed equivalent sponsor-investigator training, submit documentation of the content for the
IRB’s consideration.

•You are currently taking any other investigational agents  
•You are unwilling/unable to discontinue use of CBD oil products, Marinol or marijuana  
• There are other criteria that must be met to take part in this study that your study doctor will review with you.  
WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL  AMOUNT OF TIME INVOLVED?  
The research procedures will be conducted at  University of Kentucky Medical Center and Markey Cancer Center 
facilities . You will need to come six  times during the study. Each of those visits will take about 3 hours.  If your 
disease worsens while you are on the study, you will stop study treatment. If this happens, you will be asked to come in for a final off -study visit that will take about an hour. The total amount of time you will be asked to 
volunteer for this stud y is 18 hours over the next 120 days .  
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASK ED TO DO?  
You will be asked if you are interested in taking part in this research study. If you are interested, you will be asked to read this informed consent form and ask any questions you may have and  decide whether you want to take

visit to determine if you can join the study, four times for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_429832], and finally once for follow up 
after treatment is complete.  If your disease progresses (worsens), you will be asked to come in for a final “off -
study” visit. See below for detailed list of what will occur at each visit:  
 
Pre-Study Visit  (Screening)  
• The study doctor will ask you about your medical history, including any medicines, herbal/natural remedies, vitamins, or other over -the-counter  (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) items that you have taken in the last 90 days 
or are taking now.  Demographic information will also be collected.  
• You will have a full physical examination performed by a medical doctor to check your health status.  Your blood pressure, heart rate, the number of times you breathe per minute, your body temperature (known as vital signs), and your height and weight will be measured. The study doctor will assess the state of your cancer and how the disease affects your daily living.  The doctor  will also ask you about any thoughts 
you may have about death or harming yourself .  
• You will be asked to complete two questionnaires about your health.  
• You will be asked to provide a sample of your blood (about 3 tablespoons, or 45 milliliters) for routi ne 
tests to evaluate your overall health, organ function as well as your PSA and total testosterone levels.  
• You will be asked to provide a urine sample. It will be screened for the presence of THC, which is the 
compound in cannabis that is psychoactive.  
• Electrocardiogram (abbreviated as EKG or ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of your  
heartbeat.  
• If you have previous had a biopsy, your archival tumor will be tested to learn more about the Cannabidiol (CBD) levels present in that tissue.  
• The scans (PET, CT, MRI, etc.) that you received as part of your standard care will also be used to 
determine whether you are eligible to be in this study.  
 
All lab tests and scans should be completed within 4 weeks of starting treatment  and radiographic studies 
should be completed within 12 weeks prior to registration/initiation of treatment.

• You will take Epi[INVESTIGATOR_429844], once a day, on empty stomach on an outpatient basis using the dose 
assigned to you by [CONTACT_39635].  You will be asked to maintain a medication diary of each dose of 
medication. The medication diary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of each course.  
• The study doctor will ask you about any side effects you have experienced since the previous visit.  
• The study doctor will ask you about your medical history, including any medicines, herbal/natural 
remedies, vitamins, or other over -the-counter (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) items that you have taken in the last 90 days 
or are taking now.   
• You will have a full physical examination to check your health status.  Your blood pressure, heart rate, the number of times you breathe per minute, your body temperature (known as vital signs), and your height and weight will be measured. The study doctor  will assess the state of your cancer and how the disease 
affects your daily living.  The doctor will also ask you about any thoughts you may have about death or 
harming yourself.  
• You will be asked to provide a sample of your blood (about 3 tablespoons, or  45 milliliters) for routine 
tests to evaluate your overall health, organ function as well as your PSA and total testosterone levels.  
• Electrocardiogram (abbreviated as EKG or ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat.  
• During the study, the status of your cancer will be assessed using standard scans. If your PSA rises or 
you experience other clinical systems, the study doctor may ask you to have scans to determine if your 
cancer is progressing (worsening).  
• You will be asked to complete two questionnaires about your health (Day 90 visit only).

Allergic Reactions  
As with any drug, it is possible that you could have allergic reactions to study drug, such as itching, skin rash, 
facial swelling, and/or a severe or sudden drop in blood pressure. A sudden drop in blood pressure could lead to loss of consciousness and/or  possible seizures and could progress to the possibility of significant side effects 
including death. If you have any of the above symptoms, seek medical attention right away.  
Blood Sampling  
Having blood drawn from a vein in your body may cause some pain, soreness, possible fainting, bleeding, redness, or bruising where the needle is inserted. An infection is also possible, but rare. If you feel faint while having your blood drawn, you should sit or lie down to avoid falling.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Your skin may react to the sticky patches that attach the detectors (electrodes) to the chest for the ECG. This skin 
irritation usually disappears when the patches are removed

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 9.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 This is a phase I dose escalation study with expansion cohort. Dose esc alation will be determined by a 
Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design [41]. The target DLT rate is 30%. Patients are enrolled in cohorts with [ADDRESS_543889] 75% of the planned dose of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_429846] 30 
days of the treatment, unless the reason is due to toxicity. 
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the acute toxicity  and long- term safety and tolerability  of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] 
(CBD) in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer . Acute toxicity of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_429847], which  is calculated as the total number of patients experienced DLTs at a dose level 
divided by [CONTACT_429864]. The calculation of DLT rate will only include DLT evaluable patients. Patients who are not DLT- evaluable will not be replaced  for 
the current cohort and will not be included in the calculation of DLT rate. At the end of the dose escalation part of the study, we will use the dose escalation/de-escalation decision rules (see section 9.1.1) to decide the dose level for dose expansion cohort. If the current dose at the end of dose escalation is already the highest available dose, and the decision rules did not indicate de- escalation  or elimination , the highest 
dose level is deemed as safe for acute toxicity; otherwise, the dose recommended by [CONTACT_429865].  
 
Following dose-escalation, an expansion cohort will be enrolled to confirm safety  for acute toxicity, 
evaluate long -term safety and tolerability  and explore evidence of efficacy of the study treatment. Long-
term safety and tolerability are evaluated through the summary statistics of  adverse events occurred within 
the 90-day follow-up period in patients who received any amount of study drug. The study treatment is deemed as not safe for long -term tolerability if any  of the following criteria are met:  
 
• More  than 40% of the patients treated at the dose level selected for expansion cohort experienced 
grade 3 or higher AE s that are possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment  
• More  than 30 % of the patients experienced grade 3 or higher CNS toxicity  that are 
possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment 
 
9.1.1 Dose Escalation / De -escalation Decision Rule  
 
 Number of patients Treated  
Decision Rule  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Escalate (or highest) if # DLT <= 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 
De-escalate (or lowest) if # DLT >=  1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 
Eliminate (or stop) if # DLT >=  -- -- 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 
Note: the next cohort will be treated at the current dose level if the criteria are not met for escalation/de -
escalation rules .  
 9.1.2 Secondary and Correlative Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include change in serial PSA, PSA velocity and testosterone levels from baseline

 throughout the treatment period as an indication of biochemical response and health -related quality of life 
(as assessed  by [CONTACT_20368] -C30 and QLQ- PR25).  
 
The correlative endpoint includes CBD receptor 1 and 2 expression levels. 
 9.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
We plan to enroll up to [ADDRESS_543890] 9  
patients are not evaluable  for DLT , additional cohort(s) will be enrolled to ensure at lea st [ADDRESS_543891] tolerated dose is deemed as acceptable for acute toxicity  or estimated the MTD , we will begin treating 6 to 9 more patients in 
an expansion cohort to confirm safety for a cute toxicity, evaluate long- term tolerability  and explore 
evidence of efficacy of the study treatment.  The number of patients to be enrolled in expansion cohort 
depends on the DLT rate during the dose escalation part of the study. The total planned sample  size 
for this study is 18 (enrolled) patients with about [ADDRESS_543892] planned dose.  9.3  Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
 
Dose escalation decisions and MTD are estimated through the rules specified in section 9.1.1. DLT rate at each dose level will be calculated along with the Fisher’s exact confidence interval at 95% confidence level. AE, SAE and AE of special interests will be summarized by [CONTACT_429866] -term safety .

be analyzed using appropriate linear models for repeated measures data.   9.[ADDRESS_543894]-hoc analyses will be conducted on correlative endpoints wit h appropriate statistical methods 
depending on distribution and availability of collected data.

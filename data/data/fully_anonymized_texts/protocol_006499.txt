Primary outcome variable estimate (mean +/ - s.d. for continuous 
outcome, frequency/percentage for categorical variable):  
Based on results from the control group of a previous study (IRB 
#[ZIP_CODE]) the mean + standard deviation PAP level [ADDRESS_708014] -
operative ly in unilateral TKA patients = 1086.6 + 536.3 µg/mL  
Number of groups being compared (use 1 for paired analysis 
within the same subjects): 2 (IV TXA vs. topi[INVESTIGATOR_374145])  
Effect size or change expected between groups:  
There is no information in the literature r egarding a clinically 
meaningful difference in PAP level. Based on clinical 
experience, a difference of 400 µg/mL in mean PAP level 
between IV and topi[INVESTIGATOR_542504].  
Resulting number per group: 30  
Total sample siz e required:  After inclusion of 6 additional 
patients (+10%) to account for potential withdrawals and/or 
protocol violations, the total sample size  
 
It was determined that a sample size of 30 patients per group 
would achieve 80% power at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_708015] a 400 µg/mL 
difference in mean PAP level [ADDRESS_708016] deviation of 536.3 µg/mL using a two -sided two -sample 
t-test. After addition of 10% to the sample size to a ccount for 
potential withdrawals and/or protocol violations, the total sample 
size required was 66 patients.  
 
The primary outcome (PAP level 4 hours postoperatively) will be 
compared between the IV and topi[INVESTIGATOR_542505] a two -
sample t -test or the Wi lcoxon rank -sum test, depending upon 
the distribution of the data.  
 
Continuous secondary outcomes will be compared between 
groups using two -sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, as 
appropriate. Differences between groups will be expressed as 
differenc es in means or Hodges -Lehmann estimate of location 
shift with 95% confidence intervals. Categorical secondary 
outcomes will be compared between groups using chi -square or 
Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. The magnitude of the 
effects will be expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Tranexamic acid (TXA), a lysine analog and antifibrinolytic  agent, is being used more 
frequently at HSS in order to decrease blood loss associated with total knee replacement 
(TKR). It can be used intravenously or topi[INVESTIGATOR_542506]. One of the 
concerns while using TXA is the possibility of deep  vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary 
embolism (PE). According to HSS medical guidelines, there are specific contraindications to 
use of IV TXA, but none for topi[INVESTIGATOR_542507]. Interestingly, in a recent study done by [CONTACT_542517] -investigators ([CONTACT_542519] ), 2 patients in a group of 320 patients who received 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_542508] (320 patients) developed signs of 
thrombosis. This may be a coincidence since the total number of patients is small, but it 
raises concern about the safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407]. According to Wong et al, topi[INVESTIGATOR_542509] a dose of 3gm led to serum levels of 8.05 (7.2 -9.9 mg/ml). The 
therapeutic level of TXA is considered to be 10 mg/ml. If topi[INVESTIGATOR_542510] a similar 
effect on throm botic markers, topi[INVESTIGATOR_542511].  
 
If we find that the IV form of TXA has mostly a local effect, should we give it only topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]? 
These are some of the questions this study will help answer . 
 
This study will examine thrombotic markers when TXA is given both IV and topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. We will 
also measure levels of TXA as well and establish a correlation if possible from peripheral 
blood and Constavac drainage.

6.4 Randomization  
 This is a double -blinded study; group assignment will be concealed from both patients and 
the treating physicians/researchers. A computer -generated randomization table will be 
generated by a statistician. After a patient is enrolled in the study, the pharmacist  will 
provide 2 vials of study medication (TXA or placebo) to be given intravenously (one 
intraoperatively, one postoperatively), as well as a syringe containing study medication (TXA 
or placebo) to given topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  
 
 Randomization was performed prior to e nrollment start. Due to methodological and sample 
collection issues, the first 10 patients enrolled using this randomization scheme are 
excluded from data analysis. In order to meet the required sample size, the target 
enrollment number will be increased b y 10 patients and a new randomization scheme will be 
created for the required sample size (66 patients) prior to enrolling the 11th patient.

9.0 ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT  
All Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported in the final study report. Definitions for Adverse 
Event (AE) used in this study are listed below and are based on FDA and international 
guidelines:  
 
 
  
 
Confidential  Page 11 of 13 
 
9.1 Adverse Event (AE ) 
Tranexamic acid (TXA) is routinely used at HSS to reduce postoperative blood loss 
after total knee arthroplasty and potentially reduce the need for transfusion. Risks 
associated with TXA administration are rare.  
One risk of participating is this study is having blood drawn. The risks of blood 
drawing include mild pain, bruising, and very rarely infection at the place of the 
needle insertion. However, the likelihood of these risks occuring is rare, as an arterial 
line catheter is routinely placed in TKA patients. The purpose of this catheter is to 
continuously monitor blood pressure during and after surgery. We expect to draw 
blood using the pre -existing catheter.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Due to the pro -clotting  nature of TXA, there have been long -standing concerns about 
the potential for thromboembolic events, including: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), transient ischemic attack (TIA), 
and stroke. However, intraven ous administration of TXA has been widely studied and 
has been shown to reduce the need of blood transfusions without an increase in risk 
of complications (Poeran et al, 2014). Moreover, TXA is contraindicated in patients 
with a history or high risk of thr omboembolism. It is currently unknown whether 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_542516].  
 
9.[ADDRESS_708025] an allergy/hypersensitivity to TXA, they will immediately  be 
withdrawn from the study and kept at HSS for observation and treatment. Based on the 
current literature, the doses that are used in this study have not been found to result in any 
toxicity level in patients. However, if this occurs, patients will immed iately be withdrawn from 
the study. If any mortality is seen, or if there is any increase in DVT or PE rates from the 
established incidence in the literature, the DSMB will recommend termination of the study.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_708026] Consent and Information  
Written/signed consent will be collected from participants in the holding area before surgery.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_708027] Data Protection  
o HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i ) removing some direct identifiers from information 
stored [(i.e., names, social security numbers, medical record numbers)]; (ii) securing, in a 
separate location, and limiting access to information linking codes (i.e., linkage codes) 
 
  
 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_708028] participant identifiers; and (iii) limiting 
access to information stored to HSS investigators.  
o Access to the REDCap program is password -protected, and access to a specific study's 
information within the program is limited to th e research assistant and other IRB -approved 
study personnel who have been given permission to view and/or enter study data. 
REDCap program access is authorized by [CONTACT_23191]; particular study access is granted by 
[CONTACT_17033]. For data exports, fie lds marked as protected health information 
(PHI) in REDCap will be de -identified, if feasible.  
o All transmission of data will occur via encrypted networks in password -protected files. Any 
paper -based data sheets utilized for the study will have personal ide ntifiers removed 
whenever possible and will be stored in the department's locked office. Each subject will 
be assigned a unique study number for identification, and that number will not be derived 
from or related to information about the individual. Presen tations and publications that 
result from this study will not contain any individual identifiers (at most the unique study 
numbers may be referred to). Thus our research presents a minimal risk of harm to 
subjects' privacy.

11 Statistical  
Considerations  The primary endpoint will be evaluated in both the AFX and proximally fixated device 
groups.   The relative performance of the two groups will be evaluated through one -
sided tests for non- inferiority and superiority.  Combining the superiority and non -
infer iority trials into a single closed testing procedure allows for maintenance of a 
controlled Type 1 error rate.    An 8% margin will be used for the non- inferiority test.   If 
the non- inferiority null hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis for superiorit y will 
be investigated.     
Hypotheses for Non- Inferiority: 
Null Hypothesis:            𝐻𝐻10:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵≤−8%  (AFX is inferior with respect to the 
primary endpoint)  
Alternative:                    𝐻𝐻11:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵>−8% (Statistical evidence of non -
inferiority)  
 
Hypotheses for Superiority:  
Null Hypothesis:   𝐻𝐻 20:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵≤0 (The two device groups have equal effect)  
Alternative:       𝐻𝐻21:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵>0 (Statistical evidence of superiority)  
 
The original trial size was selected to provide 80% power for the superiority test.  The 
original  sample size required , for non -inferiority testing , is relatively smaller; thus, 
the power of the non -inferiority test approaches 100%  with the revised sample size . 
Suggested  
Schedule of 
Tests  Patient eligibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_325295]-procedural imaging. Blood work and physical exam will also be collected as per 
routine  schedule at each institution.  
Following Institutional R eview board approval and patient written informed consent, 
the patient will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will be followed procedurally and 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325287] 5 years (total follow -up commitment).

Clinical Trial Protocol - CP-[ADDRESS_401679] been few pi[INVESTIGATOR_325290] (EVAR).  
The EVAR -1/2, DREAM, OVER and ACE trials have demonstrated early  benefits of EVAR 
over open surgical repair but each of these studies included patients with prior ge neration 
endografts; many of which are rarely or never implanted today. The gradual evolution of EVAR 
practices has since expanded the use of the technique in a growing number of aortic  anatomies 
outside the boundaries tested in clinical trials. Such pract ices have recently been questioned, 
reversing in some instances the utilization of EVAR as the technique of choice in AAA repair.  
Unfortunately, current evidence on so- called “hostile” v ersus “friendly” anatomies is limited to 
the retrospective analyses o f the single -center cohorts treated with multiple generations of 
devices. In the age of increasing patient awareness and fiscal scrutiny over therapeutic 
outcomes, new prospective data on EVAR outcomes in the contemporary patie nt populations is 
long overdue.  
The evolution of EVAR technology has led to two distinct device concepts currently available in clinical practice. One concept incorporates the bifurcated component positioned high in the 
aneurysm sac and tubular limb components extended distally into i liac arteries. Such endograft 
systems rely on penetrating hooks and barbs for proximal fixation within the aorta. The majority 
of device manufacturers adopted this concept, producing devices with different proximal stent configurations (suprarenal versus infrarenal), stent designs, and graft materials. The alternative 
concept, developed by [CONTACT_325296], relies on the bifurcated endograft component positioned directly on the native aortic bifurcation, with the proximal component extending cranially into 
the aor tic neck. Fixation of the endograft on the aortic bifurcation (anatomic fixation) and the 
associated freedom to optimize the proximal configuration without constraints of the fixation 
elements, results in a system that most closely resembles the anatomy of  the native aorta and 
the seal zones extended by [CONTACT_325297] (ActiveSeal™), with potential advantages of optimized hemodynamics, migration resistance, and aneurysm exclusion.  
The purpose of the LEOPARD trial is to evaluate the out comes of contemporary EVAR in a 
real-world population using two distinct endograft concepts ( proximal  versus  anatomic 
fixation). The multicenter, Level [ADDRESS_401680]   2021

13 4.3 INITIAL  TRIAL  GOVERNANCE  
The initial governance of the trial will be provided by a Steering Committee  (SC)  comprised of 
physicians  experienced in EVAR and considered thought leaders in the field. The purpose of 
the Steering Committee  is to provide scientific direction and oversight to the  start-up of the  
LEOPARD Trial involving Endologix’s EVAR System, AFX. Essential responsibilities of the 
SC incl ude trial design and protocol review and to provide guidance and advice to the 
Investigators for patient selection and  timely enrollment.

2. Cook Zenith® System  (Comparator  device)  
3. Gore Excluder System  (Comparator  device)  
4. Medtronic Endurant System  (Comparator  device)  
The description, specifications and indications/instructions for use may be found in their respective In structions for Use. It is noted the AFX
® System is anatomically fixated distally 
while the remaining three devices are fixated proximally within the aorta using penetrating 
barbs or hooks.  
This trial will allow for use of iterative changes to all devices indicated above.  
4.[ADDRESS_401682] trial is a prospective, randomized, multi -center trial, intended to evaluate the 
outcomes of contemporary EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) in a real -world population.  
The trial is designed to compare the anatomically stabilized AFX Endograft System to a 
reference group of proximally fixated EVAR  devices. Patients will be ran domized between the 
two groups.  
Randomization will be 1:1. Each I nvestigator will select one comparator device of their choice 
before enrolling the first patient  and this device will serve as the comparator device for that 
Investigator throughout the course of enrollment . The trial will sequentially evaluate non-
inferiority and superiority hypotheses.

All subjects undergoing EVA R with either the AFX System or the reference group of other 
EVAR devices will be followed procedurally to discharge, at 1, 6  (standard of care follow -up, 
no specific trial visit is  require d), 12 months and annually through to 5 years (total follow -up 
commitment).  
After this protocol and the patient I nformed Consent Form (ICF)  are reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_186616] ( IRB), potential subjects having infrarenal AAA will 
be offered participation in the trial . This will be accomplished through the patient’s reading 
of the informed consent form and discussion of the trial with the patient by [CONTACT_325298]. Agreement to participate an d to attend all protocol required  follow -up visit s 
will be documented with the patient’s signature [CONTACT_273314].  
4.6 ENROLLMENT CLOSE  
Total enrollment for the trial is up to 800 patients. When the sponsor has been notified that the 
necessary number of patients has been enrolled, the sites will be notified to discontinue 
enrollment. However, all consented patients will still be allowed to receive the treatment for their trial arm. This may result in a small number of additional patients in the trial. All such 
patients will be included in trial analysis.  
5 TRIAL  POPULATION AND PROCEDURES  
Up to 80 sites with experience in EVAR and up to 800 subjects will participate in this trial. Each 
participating Investigator will be required to be certified on both the AFX system and their choice 
of comparator  device. Any Investigator wishing to employ percutaneous endovascular repair 
(PEVAR) must also p rovide documentation of certification on the procedure using the particular 
device. Following completion of the ICF , the Investigator  will commence patient screening and 
enrollment . Certification must be completed in accordance with each manufacturer’s  certification 
process.

19 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Primary analyses will be based on modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT)  populations. An 
Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) analysis population consists of all randomized subjects. While the 
intent of the trial is to implant all randomized subjects, some randomized subjects will not 
undergo implantation  due to unforeseen issues. If this were to occur in a substantial number of 
subjects, it is possible that the results may be biased towards non -inferiority as the groups would 
become increasingly similar. Thus , a mITT population is defined, which consists of all 
randomized subjects that subsequently underwent EVAR. All endpoints in this trial , unless 
otherwise specifically noted, will be evaluated against the mITT analysis population. 
Randomization will be centralized using permuted block design. A randomization schedule will 
be generated with a random number generator in the SAS System®.  Sites/I nvestigators will be 
blinded to block size.  Due to the use of a large number of sites with  a relatively small number 
of patients within specific sites, stratification by [CONTACT_325300]. The intent is 
to allocate similar numbers of subjects between the two treatment groups across the total number 
of sites, to provide maximum power. Additionally, s tratification using risk factors will not be 
performed.  
Additional information is available in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS System®, Version 9.4 or later.   
For additional information on the randomization process, refer to §5.6.  
10.2 STATISTICAL METHODS  
All non-imaging -driven variables  in the composite endpoint will be evaluated to 1 year (day 
[ADDRESS_401693] -implant), whereas imaging- driven variables will be evaluated to a 1- year window (day 
365 +/ - 60 days). The day of implantation will be set as day 0.  Early events are defined as those 
occurring from the date of the procedure up to [ADDRESS_401694] -operatively (from day [ADDRESS_401695]).  
The null hypotheses for both non- inferiority and superiority will be evaluated with one- sided 
alpha level s of 0.05.  
If the non- inferiority null hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis for superiority will be 
investigated.  
Hypotheses for Non -Inferiority:  
Null Hypothesis:           H10:μA−μB≤−8% (AFX is inferior with respect to the primary 
endpoint)  
Alternative:                   H11:μA−μB>−8% (Statistical evidence of non -inferiority)

device) and control (proximally fixated devices), along with a 95% confidence int erval for the 
difference.  The lower bound of a one sided 95% confidence interval is used to evaluate the non-inferiority and superiority null hypotheses.  
 
Quantitative parameters will be described using the following summary descriptive statistics: 
numbe r of non- missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, and 
minimum and maximum values.  
 
Qualitative parameters will be described overall using frequencies and percentages. 
Percentages will be calculated on the number of non- missing observations.  In all cases, the 
number of missing values will be specified.  
 
Kaplan -Meier estimates will be generated for the composite endpoint components across the 
duration of the trial . 
 
Sample Size Determination:  
Given an alpha error rate of 0.05, a desired power of 90%, and assuming a success rate (in terms of the primary endpoint) of 86% for AFX with a n 8% advantage over the control 
group, the sample size required to demonstrate non- inferiority is [ADDRESS_401697] enough power to evaluate all hypotheses the sample size for this trial was 
driven by [CONTACT_325301].  In this case, an alpha error rate of 0.05, power of 80%, success rate of 86% for AFX, and a relative 8% advantage in AFX’s favor requires 566 patients.  A  7% advantage in AFX’s favor requires 724 patients. An approximate drop-
out rate of 10%/1- year indicates 804 patients should be enrolled to provide 724 patients at 1 
year.   The original protocol thus called for enrollment of up to 800 subjects. The enrollment 
was completed  at 455 subjects after an unplanned analysis supported that the superiority 
evaluation was futile. With a total of 455 subjects enrolled, 410 are assumed to reach the 1 -
year endpoint after 10% dropout. This sample size results in 99% power for the non-
inferiority test under original assumptions, and thus the trial is considered adequately 
powered for evaluating non -inferiority. The sample size has been determined with PASS 
version 12.0.2.  
10.2.1  D
ISTRIBUTION OF THE PATIENTS  
The number of patients in the m ITT population, as well as the distribution across sites will be 
presented. Descriptive statistical data will be used to draw up the characteristics of subjects at 
the time of enrollment  (demographics, baseline data).

21 10.2.2  HANDLING MISSING VALUES  
In order to provide unbiased and informative findings, no replacement of missing values is 
planned for any parameters. In all applicable cases, reported analysis will mention the number 
of missing values for each outcome in the m ITT population.  
10.2.3  DATA  ANALYS IS 
In the original analyses, the ARC endpoint has been evaluated  by [CONTACT_325302].  
Now that  Corelab data is available,  it will be considered during the future evaluation s of the 
data.  
In future analyses, the data presented will utilize CoreLa b findings in addition to site -reported 
findings.  The analyses will defer to CoreLab  results when the site and CoreLab  disagree. In 
the absence of CoreLab -reviewed data, events will be assessed by [CONTACT_779]. In addition to this, 
the clinical data and evalua tion of the patients will be considered when reviewing data, and 
the clinical history of the patient as well as the review of the independent adjudicator m ay 
overrule site and Corelab findings.  
 
11  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The safety of the device will be monitor ed throughout the trial by [CONTACT_325303] (SAE), adverse device effects (ADE) serious adverse device effects (SADE ), and major 
adverse events (MAE) , or events that may potentially meet a n endpoint . All SAE s will be 
recorded  in the eCRF system and will be assessed by [CONTACT_1034] . Additionally, applicable events 
will be assessed by   [CONTACT_325304]. Non-serious adverse events with no device relationship that do not meet a trial 
endpoint, will not  be evaluated in this trial ( definition according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011(E)).  
 
Independent  adjudication will occur for  all ADEs , MAEs and SADEs reported by [CONTACT_325305]. For any adjudicated events, the adjudicator  or designee  will be required to complete the 
eCRF data capture form.  
11.[ADDRESS_401699] (UADE)  
UADE  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or 
death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence. Additionally, an unanticipated adverse 
event includes any other unanticipat ed serious problem associated with a device that relates

 SYNOPSIS 
 
Summary :  Ewing’s sarcoma is the sec ond most frequently diagnosed primary 
malignant bone tumor in the US with an annual  incidence, from birth to age 20, of 
2.9 cases per million populat ion.  The survival rate for patients with high-risk 
recurrent disease (relapse < 2 years) is gener ally < 10% at 5 years.  Moreover, of 
patients who progress after second line tr eatment, eighty percent do not achieve 
a second complete response and of t hese patients < 10% survive one year.  
Refractory patients to both frontline and second line therapy have even worse 
prognosis. 
 In an effort to overcome limitations of first-generation immunostimulatory cancer 
vaccines, we designed a novel autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil formerly known as FANG, incorporating the rhGMCSF transgene and the bifunctional shRNA
furin to: 
 
1) address the inability to fully identify re levant strong-affinity cancer specific 
(and associated) antigens, 
2) effect antigen recognition by [CONTACT_27639] (i.e. antigen immunogen), 
3) enhance effector potency, and 
4) subvert endogenous cance r-induced immune resistance. 
 A Phase I assessment of Vigil in advanced solid tumor patients including 16 Ewing’s sarcoma patients receiving ≥1 cycle (at a dose > 1.0 x 10
6 
cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) demonstrated safety of 
the Vigil immunotherapy.  Furthermore, mechanism of action (i.e., vector 
effectiveness) was established in t he manufactured products with increased 
mean GMCSF expression and knockdown of TGF 1 and TGF 2.  The induced 
immunomodulatory effect in Ewing’s sa rcoma was reflected in positive IFN γ 
ELISPOT response to autologous tumor ce lls in 10/[ADDRESS_1230797] Criteria partial response (PR), a second patient achieving no evidence 
of disease (NED) and a total 1-year su rvival (Kaplan Meier method) of 73%. 
 
Objective(s):  
 Part 1 
Primary Objectives : 
 To determine and compare overall survival of patients with metastatic 
Ewing’s sarcoma refractory or intolerant to ≥ 2 prior lines of systemic 
chemotherapy treated with Vigil immunotherapy vs. gemcitabine/docetaxel. 
 Secondary Objectives : 
 To determine the γIFN ELISPOT conversion rate of subjects treated with 
Vigil immunotherapy vs gemcitabine/docetaxel.

patients with metastatic Ewing’s sarc oma refractory or intolerant to ≥ 2 
prior lines of systemic chemotherapy  treated with Vigil immunotherapy vs 
gemcitabine/docetaxel. 
 To determine and compare the safety  profile of Vigil immunotherapy vs 
gemcitabine/docetaxel in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing’s 
sarcoma.  
 Part 2 
Primary Objective : 
 To determine safety profile of Vig il immunotherapy in combination with 
irinotecan and temozolomide in patient s with metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma 
refractory or intolerant to at leas t 1 prior line of systemic chemotherapy.  
 Secondary Objectives : 
 To determine the γIFN ELISPOT conversion rate of patients dosed with 
Vigil immunotherapy in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide. 
 To determine the progression free surv ival of patients dosed with Vigil 
immunotherapy in combination wit h irinotecan and temozolomide. 
 To determine the overall survival of  patients with relapsed or refractory 
Ewing’s sarcoma who are IFN γ ELISPOT negative at baseline and are 
dosed with Vigil immunotherapy in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide. 
 To determine the objective response rate (RECIST 1.1) of patients with 
metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma refractory or  intolerant to at least 1 prior line 
of systemic chemotherapy treated with Vigil immunotherapy dosed with Vigil immunotherapy in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide. 
Part 1 Methodology : 
This is a multicenter, 1:1 randomized P hase IIb study of intradermal autologous 
Vigil immunotherapy (1.0 x 107 cells/injection; minimum of  4 to a maximum of 12 
administrations) versus gemcitabine / docetaxel in patients with metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) refractory or intolerant to at least [ADDRESS_1230798] surgical procedure 
(e.g., tumor biopsy or palliative resect ion) may have tumor tissue harvested for 
manufacture of investigational product.  Patients meeting elig ibility criteria 
including manufacture of a minimum of 4 immunotherapy doses will be randomized to receive either (1) in tradermal Vigil every 28 days for 4-12

 administrations, or (2 ) gemcitabine 675 mg/m2 IV at 10 mg/m2/min D1 and D8 
and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV D8 every 21 days.  The primary trial objective is to 
determine the overall survival of patients treated with Vigil versus 
gemcitabine/docetaxel.  Randomization may occur as early as vaccine is 
released (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 - 4 weeks following tumor procurement) but no later than 8 
weeks following tumor procurement.  Randomi zation of patients will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_345078] (KPS) ≥ 80% vs < 80%. 
 
Patients will be managed in an outpatient setting.  Hematologic function, liver 
enzymes, renal function and electrolytes  will be monitored monthly.  Blood for 
immune function analyses including IFN γ-ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell 
response to autologous tumor antigens wi ll be collected at tissue procurement, 
baseline, and prior to product administration at Cycles 2, 4, end of treatment, and 
every 6 months thereafter.   
 
Part 2 Methodology : 
Based on the limited accrual to Part 1 of th is study, Gradalis is  opening Part 2 of 
this clinical protocol to assess the safe ty of Vigil immunotherapy in combination 
with irinotecan and temozolomide.  Part 2 will be conducted at the same centers 
as Part 1, studying intradermal autologous Vigil cancer vaccine (1.0 x 107 
cells/injection; minimum of 4 to a maximu m of 12 administrations) in patients with 
metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma Family of Tumo rs (ESFT) refractory or intolerant to 
at least [ADDRESS_1230799] surgical 
procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy or palliat ive resection) may have tumor tissue 
harvested for manufacture of investigationa l product.  Patients meeting eligibility 
criteria including manufact ure of a minimum of 4 immunotherapy doses of Vigil 
will be registered to receive: (i) oral temozolomide 100 mg/m2 daily (Days 1 – 5, 
total dose 500 mg/m2/cycle), (ii) irinotecan 50 mg/m2 daily (Days 1 – 5, total dose

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Summary 
 
Ewing’s sarcoma is the second most frequently diagnosed prim ary malignant bone 
tumor in the US with an annual age-adapted (b irth – 20 years) incidence of 2.9 cases 
per million population (Esias hvili, Goodman et al. 2008).  Approximately 20-30% of 
cases are diagnosed in the first decade and 10% after age 20.  The median age of 
diagnosis is 14 -15 years old (Cotterill, Ahr ens et al. 2000; Stahl , Ranft et al. 2011).  
Molecularly the disease is distinguished by a translocation of the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22q12 with in FLI1 or, less commonly, other genes (ERG) of the ETS 
transcription factor family (M arino-Enriquez and Fletcher 2014) .  Up to 85% of Ewing’s 
tumors are characterized by [CONTACT_880689]/FLI1 Type 1 (EWS exon 7 to FLI-1 exon 6) or 
Type 2 (EWS exon 7 to FLI1 exon 5) translocation (11;22)(q24;12) (Arvand and Denny 2001).    Patients with initially diagnos ed localized disease have a disease-free survival rate 
(EFS) of 60-70% with standard 5-drug chemotherapy regimen (VAC +IE or VIDE), while patients with metastatic disease have a EFS of <20%.  The 5 year front line treatment survival rate for patients with localized disease approaches 70% with standard of care, but only ~30% for those with  metastatic lesions isolated to the lung 
and <20% for those with bone or bone marrow in volvement (Cotterill, Ahrens et al. 
2000; Meyers, Krailo et al. 2001; Grier, Krai lo et al. 2003).  In a large analysis of 975 
newly diagnosed Ewing patients enrolled in trials from 1979 to 1993, the 5 year RFS for 
patients with primary metastatic disease (n=179)was 22% , which was significantly 
worse than localized disease (p<.0001) (Cotte rill, Ahrens et al. 2000).  Although the 
SEER data survival for metastatic disease ha s improved (5 year survival of 39%) with 
“current” standard of care, the toxicity prof ile has also increased during the multi-agent, 
front line chemotherapy treatment course (E siashvili, Goodman et al. 2008).  Second or 
greater line therapy regimen only show temporary benefit with  dismal survival outcome. 
 
 Relapsed and Refractory Ewing’s sarcoma 
 Thirty to forty percent (30-40%) of Ewing’s sarcoma patients who present with localized 
disease, and 60-80% presenting with primar y metastatic diseas e, will experience 
relapse or progression with a median time to  relapse of 1.3 year s (Ozaki, Hillmann et 
al. 1996; Bacci, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_880674]. 1998; Klingebiel, Pertl et al . 1998; Leavey and Collier 2008; 
Stahl, Ranft et al. 2011).  Patients who re lapse have a marked reduction in overall 
survival with published results in 122 (good prognostic) patients of only 12%, 5 year 
survival, and 19% 2-year survival (Leavey, Ma scarenhas et al. 2008).  Factors like site 
of recurrence (localized, metastatic, comb ined localized and metastatic) and time to 
relapse (<2 years or >2 years)  play important prognostic factor s for survival in recurrent 
Ewing’s sarcoma (Table 1).  For relapses that occur within t he first 2 years after initial 
diagnosis, which make up 72% of relapses (Stahl, Ranft et al. 2011), the 2-year OS 
Protocol No. CL-PTL-121 CONFIDENTIAL AM3 03/29/17 
Page 15 
 was 7% (Shankar, Ashley et al. 2003), 5-year  EFS was 5%(Bacci, Ferrari et al. 2003), 
and 5-year OS was 7% (Stahl, Ranft et al. 2011). 
 Ewing’s Sarcoma can pr esent with localized or metastatic  disease at time of diagnosis. 
Presentation with localized disease is associated with a 6-year event free survival rate of 69% and overall survival (OS) rate of 72% (Leavey, Mascarenhas et al. 2008).  If 
patients present with metastatic  disease at diagnosis, the 6-year event free survival 
significantly deteriorates to 28% with OS 29% (Guerney, Swensen et al. 1999; Miser, 
Goldsby [CONTACT_2297]. 2007; Leavey, Mascarenhas et al. 2008).  Once firs t recurrent disease 
occurs survival is much worse with a 5 year OS  of only 13% (Bacci, Fe rrari et al. 2003).  
Recent analysis of [ADDRESS_1230803] recurrence Ewing’s Sarcoma patients treated on INT0091 revealed similar results with 12% 5 year OS, and only 19% 2 year survival.  This analysis included 122 (good prognostic) pati ents who had local recurrence manageable 
with only surgery and/or irradiation (Leavey, Mascarenhas et al. 2008).  
 The NCCN guidelines do not provide standar d of care recommendations for second-
line treatment.  Regimens such as topotecan/cyclophosphamide, irinotecan/temozolomide, or docetaxel/gemcitabine have been utilized in second line or later treatment and may prolong life for thos e who respond (Merchant, Kushner et al. 
1999; Saylors, Stine et al. 2001; Wagner, Crews et al. 2004; Wagner, McAllister et al. 
2007; Navid, Billups et al. 2008;  Navid, Willert et al. 2008; Casey, Wexler et al. 2009; 
Mora, Cruz et al. 2009; Wagner 2010; W agner, Perentesis et al. 2010; McGregor, 
Stewart et al. 2011; Rapkin, Qayed et al. 2012;  Raciborska, Bilska et al. 2013; Wagner, 
Turpin et al. 2013).  However, none of t hese regimens have been determined to have 
significant advantage in a randomized com parative clinical assessment (Gaspar, 
Hawkins et al. 2015).  The Irinotecan/Te mozolomide regimen is the most common 
second-line regimen utilized.  Irinotecan/Temozolomide shows moderate durable responses (Casey, Wexler et al. 2009; Racibor ska, Bilska et al. 2013; Palmerini, Jones 
et al. 2016).  Although results of progre ssion free survival (PFS) and OS do not 
significantly vary between this and other dose intense regimens (Yildiz, Sen et al. 2014), PFS in second-line varies between [ADDRESS_1230804] commonly reported PFS of 6 months (Casey, Wexler et  al. 2009; Raciborska, Bilska et al. 2013; 
Palmerini, Jones et al. 2016).  Prognostic markers for clinical benefit in sec ond relapse is the response status to prior 
therapy regimen (i.e. responder 5 year surviv al 48% vs. non-responder 0% respectively 
to second-line chemotherapy, p=0.0001), (Barke r, Pendergrass et al. 2005). Another 
study revealed similar results: of 161 pat ients treated with sec ond-line chemotherapy, 
had a 5-year survival of 25% in res ponders (CR/PR)  compared to non-responders 
(SD/PD), (2-year survival 45% vs 10%) (R asper, Jabar et al. 2014).  Few patients 
respond to second-line achieving a second remission and survival at 5 years is 
severely limited (Table 1) (Rodriguez-Galindo,  Billups et al. 2002; Bacci, Ferrari et al. 
2003; Shankar, Ashley et al. 2003; Bark er, Pendergrass et al. 2005; McTiernan, 
Cassoni et al. 2006; Leavey and Collier 2008; Stahl, Ranft et al. 2011), particularly in 
patients with high risk disease (time to re lapse (TTR) within 2 years of front-line 
treatment).  In one large retrospective analysi s of [ADDRESS_1230805] relapse, the 1-

 Second-line chemotherapy for relapsed Ew ing’s sarcoma generally has had limited 
efficacy with only 9% to 13% of patients achieving a second disease free remission (Bacci, Ferrari et al. 2003; Ba rker, Pendergrass et al. 2005; Ra sper, Jabar et al. 2014).  
There is no standard of care for third-line treatment.  Mu ltiple groups have evaluated 
the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel in the trea tment of pediatric sarcomas 
with particular attention to Ewing’s sarcoma (T able 2) (Navid, Billups et al. 2008; Mora, 
Cruz et al. 2009; Fox, Patel et al. 2012; R apkin, Qayed et al. 2012). Both Gemcitabine 
and Docetaxel have been evaluat ed separately in phase I pediatric solid tumor studies 
establishing MTD and toxicities in pediat ric populations (Seibel, Blaney et al. 1999; 
Reid, Qu et al. 2004).  Gemcitabine with Doce taxel showed a 53% response rate in 
adult uterine leiomyosarcoma (Hensley, Maki  et al. 2002) and showed superior activity 
in direct comparison to gemcitabine alone (Maki, Wathen et al. 2007).  Further studies in adult sarcoma studies showed response rates ranging 16-43% specifically 2 
previously treated Ewing’s patients responde d with 1 PR and 1 SD (Leu, Ostruszka et 
al. 2004).  Gemcitabine in combination wit h docetaxel began to be used in pediatric 
settings and an early report evaluated 14 pat ients with refractory bone sarcomas and 
showed an ORR of 29% with one SD response out  of 2 Ewing’s patients (Navid, Willert 
et al. 2008).  A second report of 10 patient s included 6 Ewing’s patients, of which 4 
experienced response (3 CR and 1 PR) and one had stable disease (Mora, Cruz et al. 2009). Of 14 patients with Ewing’s sarcoma in  another study, two achieved PR and six 
SD as best response (Fox, Patel et al. 2012).  Toxicity primarily involves transient 
hematopoietic suppression wh ich has been managed with use of Filgrastim and dose 
reduction.

 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_880676] r egimen, the majority of relapsed patients 
will not achieve a second or third remission, or show only temporary benefit followed by 
[CONTACT_880690] a grim prognosis.   To date, there is no proven significant benefit of third-line chemotherapy.  Prognostic markers for clinical benefit in second relaps e is the response status to prior therapy 
regimen (i.e. responder 5 year survival 48% vs. non-responder 0% respectively to 
second-line chemotherapy, p=0.0001), (Barker, Pendergra ss et al. 2005). Another 
study revealed similar results: of 161 pat ients treated with sec ond-line chemotherapy, 
had a 5-year survival of 25% in responder s (CR/PR)  compared to non-responders 
(SD/PD), (2-year survival 45% vs 10%) (Ras per, Jabar et al. 2014).  In a relatively 
large retrospective analysis 86% of 195 pati ents, did not achieve a second remission 
and 97% had died with a median of 11.7 mo, wh ile no patient achieved disease control.  
For the 26 of 195 patients who did go into a second remission, 12 relapsed again 
(10/12 died and 2 were living with uncontro lled disease at 6 and 13 months)(Bacci, 
Ferrari et al. 2003). 
 This reflects the limitations of conventional cytotoxic chemot herapy underscores the 
desperate need for treatment development in t he metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma in high-
risk first relapse patients(TTR within 2 year s of front line treatment) or in second 
relapse.  Immune escape mechanisms also appear to play a role in the development and metastasis of Ewing’s Sarcoma.  Patient s with primary disseminated disease showed 
increased frequency of T-regulatory cells in the bone marrow compared to localized disease at presentation (Bri nkrolf, Landmeier et al. 2009).  Factors associated with 
survival benefit are increased number of tumor infilt rating CD8+ T-lymphocytes 
(p=0.05) as well as lower tumor volume (< 200 ml) at diagnosis (Berghuis, Santos et al. 
2011).  Furthermore, the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein itself presenti ng uniquely on EWS

 tumor cells and absent on normal cells, may be a driver neoantigenic target capable of 
eliciting an effective cytotoxic immune res ponse (Liu, Huang et al. 2012; Peng, Huang 
et al. 2014).  Re-activation of immunogenic antitumor response as a treatment strategy 
for EWS could be exploited either in a m onotherapy or in combination with lymphocyte-
sparing chemotherapy agents like irinotecan and temozolomide, which have been 
found with lower rates of lymphopenia in trea ted patients (Kushner, Kramer et al. 
2006).  Thus, preliminary results in 83% of Ewi ng’s Sarcoma patients demonstrated actual 
“turn on” of activated T cells in circ ulation with marked capacity to release γIFN at 
exposure to unmanipulated autologous tumor cells as defined by γIFN ELISPOT assay 
after treatment with Vigil immunotherapy.  ELISPOT activity has been verified by [CONTACT_880691]. 
Sinai and plates are third party read, Zellnet, Fort Lee, NJ with a high confidence in this 
functional immune assessment.  ELISPOT re sults have also demonstrated significant 
correlation with survival and TTR in previously published work involving other solid tumor patients (Senzer, Barve et al. 2013; Oh, Barve et al. 2016) .  Moreover, these 
results have correlated with tumor responses (1 CR/NED, 1 PR) in 2 Ewing’s sarcoma 
patients.  One who observed complete regression and is described in prior publication (Ghisoli, Rutledge et al. 2017).  Notably γIFN ELISPOT level appeared to correlate 
lightly to disease response and progression ( Figure 1 ) in this patient.

 VIGIL 
 
Vigil immunotherapy comprises 1) autologous tu mor cells as a source of the full matrix 
of a patient’s tumor-related antigens and 2) a DNA plasmid with two genetic 
modifications in order to opt imize a “triad” func tionality i) patient tumor-specific antigen 
presentation, ii) dendritic cell activation (GMCSF), and iii) tolerance escape (blocking 
TGF1, 2 activation) (Maples PB 2009; Nemunai tis 2011).  To construct Vigil, 
autologous cancer cells are transfected wi th a multi-component expression vector 
encoding GMCSF and a downstream bi-functiona l small hairpin RNA for specific 
knockdown of furin, a proprotein converta se critical for maturational proteolytic 
processing of immune relevant TGF  isoforms. 
 
Since the start of a Phase I trial of Vi gil in advanced cancer patients on 06/08/2009, 
strong evidence for safety and benefit was initially seen in a sub-analysis of 35 adult and pediatric patients given 176 vaccinations  (Senzer, Barve et al. 2013).  To 
determine optimal dosing regimen, analyses were carried out comparing survival, safety and ELISPOT response at 1 x 10
7 cells/injection vs. 2.5 x 107 cells/injection and 
at a range of Vigil dosing schedules between 4 and 12 monthly injections.  This 
analysis showed similar results between dose levels and number of doses; thus 1 x 107 
cells/injection with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 monthly injections was 
selected as the treatment regimen for subs equent studies.  Vector effectiveness was 
also confirmed via GMCSF transgene expr ession and knockdown of Furin, TGF β1 and 
TGFβ2 expression (Senzer, Barve et al . 2012; Senzer, Barve et al. 2013). 
 Eighty patients in total (54 females,  aged 13-84 / 26 males, aged 12-76) have been 
entered into Phase I trial involving 19 soli d tumor cancers.  Four hundred sixty-four 
Vigil injections were administered and no ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1230806] 
been observed.  Dose variance ranged from 2 x 10
6 cells/injection to 2.5 x 107 
cells/injection via intradermal injection 1x/m onth for a minimum of 4 months.  The 
prolonged survival shown in Figure 2  involving predominantly advanced stage, heavily 
pretreated patients suggests further safety support as it is greater than historical 
expectation (Senzer, Barve et al. 2013).

However, fifteen failed to show upregulation of circulating active effector T cells against 
autologous tumor induction by [CONTACT_880692].  Survival correlation continues to be demonstrated in this 4-year updated analysis ( Figure 4).

 Vigil Phase II Trial: Ovarian Cancer 
 
All ovarian cancer patients who underwent γIFN ELISPOT assay testing underwent a 
sub analysis from the Phase I population to validate the efficacy findings.  Results 
demonstrated correlation with survival advantage in ovarian cancer patients in which Vigil induced above threshold levels of circulating γIFN expressive T cells to 
autologous tumor ( Figure 5 ).

 A Mary Crowley Cancer Research Center registry database, randomly selected matched Phase I trial ovarian cancer patients who did not receive Vigil or TAG.  This 
historical sub-analysis revealed survival advantage of Vigil ELISPOT positive patients 
to the historical control (MCCRC database).  Additionally, ELISPOT negative patients 
had similar survival duration as the matched database ( Figure 6).  Thus, a 2:1 
(Vigil:Control) randomized Phase IIa open-label trial of Vigil (tumor harvested at the 
time of surgical debulking), in patients wit h Stage III/IV ovarian cancer, who achieved 
clinical complete response (CR) following primary surgical debulking and standard chemotherapy (5-6 cycles, front-line mainten ance setting), was initiated (CL-PTL-105).

Discussion of these results lead to a larger (currently ongoing) Phase II/III trial design.  
Once the Phase II/III trial was initiated study CTL-PTL-105 was closed to further 
accrual and patients not yet randomized in consolidation chemotherapy section were allowed to enter into the Vi gil arm.  Thirty-one patients received Vigil as part of the

revealed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  No ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1230812] to

demonstrated autologous tumoricidal acti vity of circulating T cells by γIFN ELISPOT

follow up analysis of all patients enter ed into study CL-PTL-105 was recently 
completed.  Results dem onstrate continued benefit ( Figure 8).

 Vigil Phase I Trial:  Ewing’s Sarcoma Subset 
 
Initial results of 12 Ewing’s Sarcoma Vigil treated patients entered into CL-PTL-101 were published two years ago (Ghisoli, Barve et al. 2015).  A total of 30 Ewing’s sarcoma patients have been enrolled into CL-PTL-101 with intent to treat and 
procurement for EWS Vigil m anufacture.  All patients had late stage Ewing’s sarcoma 
(majority ≥ third line chemotherapy).   Sixteen patients rece ived Vigil.  Fourteen 
concurrent patients (control) did not rece ive Vigil after undergoing similar surgery and 
Vigil construction.  Nine of the latter  were unable to have vaccine released (6 
contaminants, 3 insufficient viable tumor cells) and 5 chose other treatment management.  All products constructed fulfilled release criteria  of GMCSF production 
and TGFβ 1, β2 knockdown.  See demographics in Table 3.

 A Phase llb randomized open label trial (CL-PT L-121) comparing Vigi l vs. standard of 
care chemotherapy (Gemcitabi ne/Taxol) in metastatic E wing’s Sarcoma patients was 
initiated and enrolled the first patient 13 months ago.  Patients with refractory or recurrent disease failing ≥2 prior systemic treatment lines and undergoing surgical 
disease resection were targeted (for trial CL -PTL-121).  The trial is open to enrollment 
at 10 sites (5 in development) across the U SA but only [ADDRESS_1230815] registered into 
study.  Eight were randomized to cont rol and received Gemcitabine/Taxol and 5 
received Vigil.  No Grade 3 or greater toxi city to Vigil has been observed.  Grade 3 or 
greater toxic events related to chemother apy were observed in 2 Ewing’s patients 
(hematologic, compromise, edema/facial blis ters) and significant chemotherapy related 
toxicity of Grade 1 and 2 involving fever,  fatigue, erythroderma, pruritus, neuropathy, 
nausea, vomiting was observed as expected.  Ea rly assessment of survival is shown in 
Figure 10 .  Kaplan Meier survival of 172 da ys was observed in the chemotherapy 
group while the Vigil (initial treatment) gr oup has not yet reached survival median.  
Mean survival of the Vigil group is 271 days.   This is consistent with the results 
observed with Phase I/II results in study CL-P TL-101.  Futility analysis also revealed 
that the current trend of positive survival to  Vigil is on track to achieve statistical 
significant survival advantage to Vigil at a 90% power (46 events).  Further assessment 
of all advanced Ewing’s patients who have received Vigil in studies CL-PTL-101 and CL-PTL-121 (21 patients) vs. matched contro ls (n=14) and randomiz ed controls (total 
n=22) revealed further support of potential benefit to Vigil in third-li ne Ewing’s Sarcoma 
(Figure 11 ).  A Kaplan Meier survival of 524 (17.2 months) days was observed with 
Vigil.

Additionally, a long-term follow up of one of the two respondi ng Phase 1 Ewing’s 
patients ( Figure 1) (first patient response ch aracterization is shown in Figure 12) 
revealed long term RECIST qualified response to Vigil.  A complete regression related 
to a second course of Vigil therapy (Ghisoli, Rutledge et al. 2017) was recently confirmed.  This pat ient had extensive disease initia lly and at rapid progression during 
frontline chemotherapy (TTR <2 years) underwent Vigil treatm ent with disease 
stabilization for > [ADDRESS_1230816]-line di sease management.  Results 
yielded complete regression by [CONTACT_60864].  ELISPOT response was shown with both Vigil treatments but was shown (in retrospect)  to have deteriorated following the first 
Vigil treatment with recovery in immune re sponse following the second Vigil treatment 
using the second recurrent disease sample for construction ( Figure 1).  Overall, ten of 
12 (83%) of Ewing’s Sarcoma patients who received Vigil demonstrated marked

 STUDY RATIONALE 
 
The results from the Phase I Vigil trial supported high confidence in safety (both short-term and long-term through 3+ years), confirmed effective transgene expression (GM-CSF) and RNAi [furin] silencing, and supported the triad rationale autologous tumor cell therapy with increased GMCSF expression and decreased TGFβ  production, to 
modulate immunogenicity as show n by [CONTACT_880695] γ-ELISPOT 
responsiveness with overall survival (Senzer , Barve et al. 2012; Senzer, Barve et al. 
2013).  The preliminary evidence of safety, i mmune stimulation and c linical benefit from 
Vigil in patients with ESFT treated in the P hase I setting supports evaluation of this 
therapy in a larger and randomized study and at earlier stage of recurrence (first recurrence).  Less tumor burden is typi[INVESTIGATOR_880677].  Thus, better control of delayed disease 
progression with increased response to c hemotherapy (second line treatment involving 
Temozolomide/Irinotecan) in concurrence wi th Vigil immunotherapy in first relapse 
patient population is suggested.  Median time to progression of the Phase I EWS patients (third-line) was approximately 6 months compared to  historical experience of 
similar patients of 2 months (R odriguez-Galindo, Billups et al . 2002; Bacci, Ferrari et al. 
2003; Shankar, Ashley et al. 2003; Bark er, Pendergrass et al. 2005; McTiernan, 
Cassoni et al. 2006; Leavey, Mascarenhas et al. 2008; Juergens, Daw et al. 2011; 
Stahl, Ranft et al. 2011; Tap, Demetri et al . 2012; Choy, Butrynski et al. 2014; Rasper, 
Jabar et al. 2014; Ghisoli, Barve et al. 2016). Thus, Part 2 combination of 
Vigil/Temozolomide/Iri notecan is justified.

 administrations) versus gemcitabine / docetax el in patients with metastatic Ewing’s 
sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) refractory or intolerant to at least [ADDRESS_1230818] su rgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy 
or palliative resection) may have tumo r tissue harvested for manufacture of 
investigational product.  Patient s meeting eligibilit y criteria includin g manufacture of a 
minimum of 4 immunotherapy doses will be randomized to receive either (1) 
intradermal Vigil every 28 days for 4-12 admin istrations, or (2) gemcitabine 675 mg/m2 
IV at 10 mg/m2/min D1 and D8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV D8 every 21 days.  The 
primary trial objective is to determine the overall survival of pat ients treated with Vigil 
versus gemcitabine/docetaxel.  Randomizat ion may occur as early as vaccine is 
released (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 - 4 weeks following tu mor procurement) but must occur no later 
than 8 weeks following tumor procurement.  Randomization of patients will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_345078] (KPS) ≥  80% vs < 80%. 
 
Patients will be managed in an out patient setting.  Hematologic function, liver enzymes, 
renal function and electrolytes will be monito red monthly.  Blood for immune function 
analyses including IFNγ-ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell response to autologous 
tumor antigens will be collected at tissue pr ocurement, baseline and and prior product 
administration at Cycles 2, 4, end of tr eatment, and every 6 months thereafter.   
 
 
Part 2  
 Based on the limited accrual to Part 1 of this study, Gradalis is opening Part 2 of this 
clinical protocol to assess the safety of Vigil immunotherapy in combination with 
irinotecan and temozolomide.  Part 2 will be c onducted at the same c enters as Part 1, 
studying intradermal autologous Vigil cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10
7 cells/injection; 
minimum of 4 to a maximum of  12 administrations) in pati ents with metastatic Ewing’s 
sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) refractory or intolerant to at least [ADDRESS_1230819] su rgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy 
or palliative resection) may have tumo r tissue harvested for manufacture of 
investigational product.  Patient s meeting eligibilit y criteria includin g manufacture of a 
minimum of 4 immunotherapy doses of Vig il will be registered to receive: (i) oral 
temozolomide 100 mg/m2 daily (Days 1 – 5, total dose 500 mg/m2/cycle), (ii) irinotecan 
50 mg/m2 daily (Days 1 – 5, total dose 250mg/m2/cycle), orally or irinotecan 20mg/m2 
daily (Days 1 – 5, total dose 100mg/m2/cycle ), intravenously (iii) peg-filgrastim 
100μg/kg (Day 6) subcutaneously (optional and may be administered at home), and 
Vigil 1.0 x 107 cells/injection, intradermally on Day 15 and every 3 weeks thereafter.  
One cycle = 21 days.  Registration onto Part 2 may occur as early as one week but no later than 8 weeks following tumor procurement.  Vigil is typi[INVESTIGATOR_880678] 3 weeks after the completion of the two-day manufacturing process. 
 Patients will be managed in an out patient setting.  Hematologic function, liver enzymes, 
renal function and electrolytes will be monitor ed.  Blood for immune function analyses 
including IFN γ-ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell response to autologous tumor 
antigens will be collected at tissue pr ocurement, and prior to Day 15 Vigil

the site will be notified of t he eligibility (Part 1 and 2) and randomization (Part 1 only) by 
[CONTACT_315125].  
 Tumor Procurement 
 Refer to the Tissue Procurem ent Manual for instructions. 
 The cumulative equivalent of a “golf ball si ze” mass (~10-30 gm tissue) is optimal for 
vaccine manufacturing.  If surgeons have the option of collecting more tissue, more 
doses of vaccine may be prepared (up to 12 dos es).  Vaccine manufacturing is rarely 
successful with small (<10 gm) tumor masses.  Lesions extending into lumen (e.g., bowel) or tumor embedded in bone cannot be processed . 
 Once the procured tissue is received at Gra dalis, Inc. samples will be processed for 
autologous vaccine manufacture. 
 
 Vigil Immunotherapy Manufacturing 
 Gradalis, Inc. will manufacture vaccine from the procured subject tumors.  Gradalis, 
Inc. will release vaccine once all release criteria have been met and eligibility has been 
confirmed.  No tissue or vaccine will be given to the participant or site apart from the outlined 
clinical protocol.  Any excess tumor tissue, not used for vacci ne manufacture will be used towards Vigil 
vaccine research and process development assays.

Premedications 
 Vigil : EMLA® may be utilized at the injection site prior to Vigil administration.  
Analgesics may be employed as necessary.  As noted above, systemic steroids or 
other immunosuppressents should be avoid ed due to immune inhibition activity. 
 Gemcitabine / docetaxel : Per package insert and institutional standards.  To reduce 
the frequency and severity of fluid retent ion, it is recommended to administer 
dexamethasone 8mg PO bid fo r 3 days starting one day prior to each docetaxel 
administration (minimum of 3 doses).  (Oral suspensions / modifications are 
acceptable).  Temozolomide / irinotecan / peg-filgrastim : Per package inserts and institutional 
standards.  
Vigil Immunotherapy Transfer 
 All manufactured Vigil will be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until ready for use.  The site will contact [CONTACT_492635], In c. when the study agent is needed for subject

and continued. 
 
Vigil Treatment Delay 
 
 Treatment may be delayed no more than 4 weeks to allow recovery from 
toxicity. 
 Subjects who delay treatment for more  than 4 weeks due to toxicities will 
be considered off study treatment (see Section 5.4 Withdrawal). 
 Treatment delay not related to toxi c events (including subjects unable to 
adhere to monthly/[ADDRESS_1230827] ion) may not extend for more than 
three days unless due to symptoms rela ted to disease or infection in 
which case up to a 2 week delay is allowed. 
 If ≥ one [ADDRESS_1230828] be reviewed by [CONTACT_3211]. 
 If subjects miss doses, the doses will be made up the following week 
and continue on a revised monthly/ ev ery [ADDRESS_1230829] safety and should be carried out in accordance with the Investigator’s standard of practi ce and the package inserts and institutional 
standards.  If irinotecan + temozolomide is  administered beyond 12 months, it will be administered 
off study.  If irinotecan + temozolomide is discontinued, Vigil may be administered

RECIST Web page , https://www.eortc.be/Recist/documents/RECISTGuidelines.pdf 
 
 DRUG INFORMATION 
 
 Vigil Investigational Product 
 Vigil is made up of irradiated autologous tumor cells which have been electroporated 
ex vivo with the Vigil plasmid designed to suppress expression of both the TGFβ 1 and 
TGFβ2 proteins while simultaneously  expressing rhGMCSF protein. 
 
Vigil Production 
 The Vigil manufacturing process is identic al to prior Vigil manufacturing (BB-IND 
[ZIP_CODE]) (Maples 2010).  Surgically excised tumo r is collected in the surgical field and 
placed in 0.04mg/ml of gentamicin and sterile saline then packaged for transport to the manufacturing facility.  The tumor is mechanically and enzymatically dissociated into a single cell suspension.  The cells are counted and then transfected with the Vigil 
plasmid.  The cells are incubated overnight to allow transcription of the Vigil plasmid.  
Protocol No. CL-PTL-121 CONFIDENTIAL AM3 03/29/[ADDRESS_1230842] Blood Bank irradiator.  The irradiated cell suspension is then enumerated, aliquoted and frozen (1 x 10
7 cells).  The freeze media consists of 10% 
DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; Cryoserv U SP; Bionichepharma US), 1% Human Serum 
Albumin (ABO Pharmaceuticals) in Plasma-L yte A at pH 7.4 (Bax ter).  After freezing 
the cells are stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until all release testing is 
completed, all necessary approvals are obtai ned and the patient is ready for treatment. 
 
 Safety Analysis 
 Vigil plasmid employed in the generation of  this product has been tested for identity, 
sterility, purity and strength.  
Irradiated Gene Modified Tumor Cells 
 To ensure safety, all gene-modified tumor cells to be used in Vigil administrations must 
be irradiated 10,000 cGy prior to freezing.  This is the same irradiation process as for 
the TAG vaccine, BB-IND [ZIP_CODE] and prior vaccines (Belagenpumatucel-L and GVAX® published trial results and BB-IND [ZIP_CODE] and BB-IND [ZIP_CODE]) (Kumar 2009; Maples PB 
2009; Maples PB 2009).  The selection of th is radiation dose is based on the desire to 
utilize the lowest possible radiation dose fo r the transfected cells to optimize the level 
and duration of bifunctional shRNA
furin transcription and GMCSF protein production and 
maximize the safety of vaccine cell inje ctions at the same time.  In addition, 
investigators have demonstrated that irradi ating cultured tumor cells of different 
histologic origins at 10,000 cGy complete ly arrests tumor colony formation. 
 
Preparation 
 Reference the Pharmacy Reference Manual for preparation and handling information. 
 Vigil concentrate:  1.0 x 10
7cells per injection in a volume of 1mL. 
 Route of administration:   Intradermal injection 
 
Storage and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_880684], unopened vials are stored in the vapor phase of Liquid Nitrogen below -150° C at Gradalis.  Each Vigil concentrate will be shipped individually in a portable liquid 
nitrogen tank.  This shippi[INVESTIGATOR_880685] 7 days.  This will enable sufficient time to reach the different clinical site 
pharmacies. 
 
Protocol No. CL-PTL-121 CONFIDENTIAL AM3 03/29/[ADDRESS_1230843] a causal relationship with this tr eatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory findi ng), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Serious Adverse Event 
 An AE (experience) or reaction occurring at  any dose should be classified as a serious 
adverse event (SAE) if any of the following occur: 
 
 Initial or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( ≥ 24 hours). This does not  include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732118].  
 A life-threatening condition (i.e. an event  in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it  does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) 
 Significant disability/incapacity (i.e. t he AE resulted in a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to ca rry out normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 It does not meet any of the above seri ous criteria, but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require surgical or m edical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
 Death

Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
An unexpected event is any AE that is not i dentified in nature, severity or frequency in 
the clinical Investigator’s brochure or the drug package insert.  
Grading Adverse Events 
 Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded throughout  the trial.  Toxicities and AEs will be 
graded and reported using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_1230844] frequent of wh ich included local reactions at the site of 
injection.  Potential adve rse events are listed below. 
 
Local skin reactions at th e site of injection: 
 
Erythema, tenderness, induration,  urticaria/rash, pruritus. 
 
Other expected adverse events: 
 
Fever, myalgias/arthralagias, chill s/rigors, nausea, fatigue, headache, 
thrombocytopenia and other cytopenias, hyperglycemia, vomiting, hypotension, infection at the immunization site.  In addition, there may also be a risk of  autoimmune disease development, although to 
date no evidence of this has been seen in any vaccination study.  There may also be 
worsening of tumor related symptoms secondary to immune mediated attack on 
patient’s tumor. 
 
Protocol No. CL-PTL-121 CONFIDENTIAL AM3 03/29/17

 Recording of an Adverse Event 
 
Adverse events will be recorded for the duration of a patient’s study treatment (following the first dose of the Investigational Product), and for up to [ADDRESS_1230845] to be reported as an AE on 
subsequent cycles.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
 All SAEs will be reported to Gradalis, Inc. within 24 hours of notification by [CONTACT_880699].  This includes any death from any cause while a patient is 
receiving the study agent on this protocol, or  [ADDRESS_1230846] dose of the 
protocol study agent (Vigil).

 PART 1 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Sample Size Justification 
 
This is an open label randomiz ed controlled Phase II clinical trial.  Information 
concerning the predicted survival of the c ontrol group is limited, based on rarity of 
disease and few published reports.  However expert advisors in the EWS field estimate a conservative one-year survival rate of 25% in the chemotherapy control group.  The 
one-year survival rate of 60% in the Vigi l treated group is estimated from EWS patients 
treated on the Vigil phase [ADDRESS_1230849] ratio 
(HR) of 0.383 favoring Vigil over control.  Assuming 1:[ADDRESS_1230850] at the alpha=0.05 
level of significance, 46 events will prov ide 90% power to detect an OS HR of 0.383.  
Assuming a one-year accrual period, and a one-year follow-up period after 
randomization of the last subject, it is esti mated that the total sa mple size (number of 
subjects) required to achieve 46 event s is 62 (31 patients in each arm). 
 
 Analysis Populations 
 The intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion will include all randomi zed subjects.  All efficacy 
analyses will be completed in the ITT population.  The Safety population will include all patients who receive study treatment and patients 
will be analyzed according to actual treatme nt received.  All safety analyses will be 
completed in the Safety population. 
 
 Efficacy Analyses 
 
15.3.[ADDRESS_1230851] follow-up confirming survival will be used as 
the censoring date for subjects who are alive and/or do not have a known date of 
death.  The primary analysis of OS will be conducted using a two-sided log rank test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance. 
  
Protocol No. CL-PTL-121 CONFIDENTIAL AM3 03/29/[ADDRESS_1230852].  The secondary endpoint of 1 year surv ival proportion will be estimated using 
Greenwood’s formula to estimate the standar d errors of the Kaplan-Meier survival 
probability at a specified time point.  The secondary endpoint of ORR will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. 
 All secondary analyses will be conducted using two-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level 
of significance.  
 Safety Analyses 
 Safety endpoints include all adverse ev ents (CTCAE 4.03), laboratory safety 
assessments, and physical examination findings.  
 PART [ADDRESS_1230853] been excl uded from the study.  Patients who are 
included will be assigned a pat ient identification number. 
 For each patient treated with the study drug(s) , the Investigator or  their designee is 
required to prepare and maintain case histor ies that include all observations and other 
data pertinent to the investi gation.  This will include all source documents needed to 
verify the accuracy of all observations and other data contained in the eCRFs on each 
study patient.

1. introduction  
This reporting and analysis plan (RAP) details all planned final analyses  for study AGO -
OVAR16/VEG110655/PZP034C2301 . This is a phase III study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of pazopanib (trademark: Votrient) compared to placebo using a randomized, 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled, and multi -center design in women with non -bulky, 
FIGO Stage II -IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer that has 
not progressed after first line chemotherapy .  
For further information on the study design, see Protocol Amendment 9, dated May 09, 
2016  (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number UM2008/[ZIP_CODE]/0 ). 
2. Study Objective(s) and Endpoint(s)  
2.1. Study Objective(s)  
Primary  
• To determine whether pazopanib (up to 24 months of pazopanib 800 mg daily) 
prolongs progression free survival (PFS by [CONTACT_393] 1. 0) compared to placebo in 
women with non -bulky, FIGO Stage II -IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
primary peritoneal cancer that has not progressed after first line chemotherapy . 
Secondary  
The principal secondary objective is:  
• To compare overall surv ival (OS) of patients treated with up to 24 months of 
pazopanib 800 mg daily  to those treated with placebo.  
 CONFIDENTIAL  
  VEG110655  
Other secondary objectives are:  
To compare the effect of 24 months of pazopanib 800 mg daily versus placebo on  
• Safety  
• PFS by [CONTACT_59126]  
• 3-year P FS (by [CONTACT_393]) rate  
• Quality of life (measured using EORTC QLQ -C30 with the OV -28 module, and 
EuroQOL EQ -5D)  
2.2. Study Endpoint(s)  
Primary  
• PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date 
of either  radiological  progression  or death due to any cause.  The primary analysis 
will be based on the radiological progression per RECIST as determined by [CONTACT_1275].   
Secondary  
The principal secondary  endpoint : 
• OS is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of  death due to any 
cause.    
Other secondary endpoints:  
• PFS by [CONTACT_59127] . 
• 3-year PFS  is defined as the percentage of subjects w ho are alive and progression -
free (progression defined as radiological progression per RECIST or death due to 
any cause) at 3 years from randomization .   
• Safety will include evaluation of AE s and changes from baseline in vital signs, 
ECGs, and laboratory p arameters  
• Quality of life is measured using the EORTC QLQ -C30 with the OV -28 module, 
and EuroQOL EQ -5D. 
2.3. Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary objective of this study is to compare progression free survival (PFS) of 
pazopanib versus placebo each given for up t o 24 months in women with non -bulky 
Stage II -IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253] (EOC), fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer that has 
not progressed after first line chemotherapy.  For the primary hypothesis, PFS is defined 
as the interval between the date of ra ndomization and the earliest date of disease 
progression (as defined by [CONTACT_59128]) or death due to any 
cause.  
The study is designed to provide evidence with regard to PFS to support the null 
hypothesis H 0: λ = [ADDRESS_64285] it in favor of the alternative hypothesis HA: λ ≠ 1, where 
λ is the hazard ratio: pazopanib / placebo. While the primary endpoint of the study is PFS, 
the study will have 80% power to detect a 27% increase in median survival in subject s 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
  VEG110655  
who receive pazopanib compared to subjects who receive placebo (49 months vs. 38.5 
months).  
The study will have more than 90% power to detect a 47% increase in median PFS in 
subjects who receive up to 24 months of pazopanib compared to subjects who rece ive 
placebo (19.8 months vs. 13.5 months) at the time of final PFS analysis.  
Confidence intervals will be two -sided and will use 95% confidence levels  unless 
otherwise specified .  Two-sided hypotheses will be tested at the 5% significance level 
unless othe rwise  specified . 
2.4. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/Pharmacodynamic (PD) 
hypotheses  
Not applicable  
3. Study Design  
For information on the study design, see Protocol ( UM2008/[ZIP_CODE]/0 ). 
4. Planned Analyses  
The 3rd interim analysis for futility based on OShas occurred at 80% information fraction 
(at least 441 OS events).  An overall conditional power of 20% served as the boundary 
for futility. Based on the estimated hazard ratio at the  third interim analysis, the futility 
criteria was met, and the study will be closed (conditional power was <1%).  
The main purpose  of the final analyses is to report the updated OS results after all 
patients have completed the end of study visit.    
5. Sample  Size Considerations  
For information on sample size considerations, see Protocol ( UM2008/[ZIP_CODE]/0 ). 
6. Analysis populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will comp rise all randomized subjects who are not 
screen failure, i.e. subjects who were screen failure but randomized by [CONTACT_59129]. The treatment group assignment will be based on the 
randomized treatment instead of the actu al treatment received. The ITT population will 
be used for the analysis of efficacy data and summaries of study population.  
The All Treated population will comprise all randomized subjects who receive at least 
one dose of investigational product, and will be based on the actual treatment received if 
this differs from that to which the subject was randomized. The All Treated population 
will be used for the analysis of safety data.  
It is possible that during the course of the study a subject will only tempora rily receive 
the incorrect treatment , which means the subject will receive incorrect treatment for some 
time, but not the whole treatment period .  Pazopanib subjects who temporarily receive 
placebo will be treated similarly to subjects with drug interrupti ons.  Placebo subjects 
who temporarily receive pazopanib will be included in  the safety summaries for 
pazopanib arm .   
 CONFIDENTIAL  
  VEG110655  
7. Treatment comparisons  
The single treatment comparison will be between pazopanib  and placebo.   Unless 
otherwise stated, all efficacy compa risons will be performed using the ITT population 
and all safety comparisons will be performed using the All Treated population (as defined 
in Section 6).  
7.1. Data Display Treatment and Other Sub -group Descriptors  
The following treatment descriptors will be used on all applicable  tabulations:  
• Pazopanib  
• Placebo  
8. general considerations for data analyses  
8.1. Multicentre Studies  
Data from all participating centers will be pooled prior to analysis. Since patient accrual 
is spread t hinly across multiple centers, summaries of data by [CONTACT_59130], therefore, be provided.   
8.2. Other Strata and Covariates  
Prior to randomization, eligible patients are stratified according to the following two 
stratification factors:  
1. First-line treatment outcome:  
a) no evidence of disease [NED] after surgery (or, if unknown, FIGO stage II -
IIIA at diagnosis) and NED after chemotherapy and normal Screening CA -125; 
versus , 
b) residual tumor after surgery (or, if unknown residual tumor after initial 
surgery, FIGO stage IIIB -IV at diagnosis) and NED after chemotherapy and 
normal Screening CA -125; versus , 
c) residual tumor after chemotherapy or elevated Screening CA 125 regardless 
of tumor status after surgery and FI GO stage at diagnosis  
2. Geographic coverage of participating cooperative group: Europe vs Asia vs 
North America/Australia . 
This represents a total of nine (9) sub -strata. Patients in each sub -stratum are then 
centrally randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_64286] completed the study if death occurs.  Subjec ts who 
withdraw from the study will be included in analyses up to the time of withdrawal, 
regardless of the duration of treatment.  
As the  length  of treatment for any patient will depend on the efficacy and toxicity  of the 
treatment , the duration of follow -up will vary among  patients. Consequently, there will 
be no imputation for missing data.  Where appropriate, available d ata will be summarized 
over specified intervals (e.g. from randomization until withdrawal from the study) using 
suitable summary statistics.   
10. Disposition of Subjects  
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects who completed the study as well as 
subjects who withdrew prematurely from the study will be displayed  based on the ITT 
population . Reasons for premature withdrawal will be presented in the order they are 
displayed in the CRF, which include study closed/terminated, lost to follow -up, 
investigat or discretion, and withdrew consent.   
11. Efficacy Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, all the efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population 
as defined in Section 6.  
11.1.  Overall Survival  (OS)  
OS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization  and date of  death due to 
any cause.  The length of this interval (in days) is estimated as the date of death minus 
date of randomization plus [ADDRESS_64287] (as recorded in the eCRF). Last dat e of contact [CONTACT_59131], survival follow -up date , or date of study withdrawal .  
Only patient contacts recorded in the eCRF can be used for the calculation of last date of 
contact.  
OS will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier survival curves, and compared between 
treatment arms using a stratified log rank test based on the stratification factors defined in  
Section 8.2.  For each Kaplan -Meier analysis the following estimates will also be 
provided:  
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59123] [ Berry , 1991 ] of the treatment hazard ratio based on the 
corresponding stratified log-rank test statistic will be  provided  together  with a naïve 95% 
confidence interval.  For each treatment group, the K aplan -Meier estimates for the 
median OS time, the first and third quartiles will be presented, along with approximate 
naïve 95% confidence intervals.  Brookmeyer -Crowley method [ Brookmeyer , 1982]  will 
be used to calculate the confidence intervals .

[IP_ADDRESS].  Subgroup analyses of OS  
The second interim OS analysis revealed a negative trend for Asian patients with HR: 
1.71 (95% CI : 1.01 to 2.89 ;  p=0.047). To better understand whet her the negative trend 
observed in the Asian subgroup at the first two OS interim analyses  was due to a true 
negative treatment effect or it was rather secondary to random variation, a subgroup 
analysis by [CONTACT_11338] (Asia vs. non -Asia) was performed at the time of third OS interim 
analysis. A numerical trend was also observed in this third analysi s (HR=1.35, 95% CI: 
0.87, 2.09 and p=0.181), but not as strong as that in the second analysis. Updated results 
will be presented at the time of the final analyses. It is important to note that the study 
was not designed to make definitive conclusions in an y of the subgroups including the 
Asia subgroup. The analysis of OS by [CONTACT_59132].  
 
 
12. Safety Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, all the safety analyses will be based on the All Treated 
population. Given all patients were off treatment as of the primary analysis/first OS 
interim analysis, the only safety analyses to be conducted at the  time of third OS interim 
analysis will be the summary of deaths.  
All deaths occurring any time from the time of informed consent t o the clinical cut -off 
date will be summarised based on the number and percentage of subj ects. This summary 

 CONFIDENTIAL  
  VEG110655  
will classify subjects by [CONTACT_59133] ( >28 days or 
 28 days) and primary cause of death (disease under study, toxicity or other).  The 
summary will also be provided in the following subgroups:  
• Region: Asia vs. Non -Asia. 
All deat hs will be listed with subject level details. In addition, a listing of adverse events 
with onset date after the third interim analysis cutoff date (Jan 12th, 2017) will be 
provided.

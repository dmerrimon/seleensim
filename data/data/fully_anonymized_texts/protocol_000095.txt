2 Introduction  
2.1 Background 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while implementing a provision of the Family 
Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA), issued new cigarette health warnings for cigarette packages on August 15, 2019 (84 FR [ZIP_CODE]). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_128783] (P WLs) are an 
effective way to communicate health risks of tobacco use 
[ADDRESS_145355] emphasized the effectiveness of pi[INVESTIGATOR_128784] -only warnings for increasing knowledge regarding smoking risks, likelihood to 
reduce cigarette demand and promoting quitting 3–6. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_128785], even in high income countries such as [LOCATION_002] and Canada – significant gaps in health knowledge remain 
7. The newly released warning labels 
include lesser -known harms of smoking such as macular degeneration, bladder cancer and erectile 
dysfunction. Currently, there is limited evidence on the effect of lesser -known harm warnings on 
attention, recall and  knowledge increase of tobacco related harms.  
  This study, as a part of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_128786] (TCORS),  will 
examine the effect of the newly proposed FDA PWLs on daily smokers on visual engagement, 
knowledge, and recall. 
 
FDA Labels: Eye Tracking Study          Page 3 
Version 3: 03.10.[ADDRESS_145356] recall of text, image and 
message, knowledge of tobacco harms and risk -perceptions.  
 
This document  is a human research protocol for a TCORS  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] . This study will be 
conducted in compliance with this research protocol and according to U.S. standards of Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable government regulations, and institutional research policies and procedures.  
2.2 Rationale  
2.2.1) Rationale fo r between subject condition – warning labels  
The new warning labels are created in compliance with court recommendations and tailored to 
increase knowledge of smoking harms. 6 out of 11 warning labels highlight lesser- known smoking 
harms. The participants will be randomized to one of two conditions – one containing FDA 
warning labels bearing lesser known and another with better -known tobacco use risks. In Canada, 
packages include information about smoking causing impotence and therefore, twice as many respo ndents reported impotence as tobacco harm relative to respondents in US, [LOCATION_006] and Australia
7. 
There have been no previous studies that have evaluated the impact of highlighting lesser known harms of tobacco; they are now a part of FDA’s label policy and  would add to the literature on 
tobacco control messaging.  
 
2.2.2) Rationale for primary outcome measures  
Previous PWL studies using eye -tracking methodology have used latency, latency duration and 
total dwell time
11–13 to character ize visual engagement and this study will continue to use these 
measures for consistency and comparisons. The image/text/message recall and knowledge 
measures are a good indicator of information retention and effectiveness of the labels. 
3 Study Objectives  
Aim 1: To assess daily smokers ’ response to FDA PWL content on visual engagement, recall 
and knowledge . 
H1a: Warning label images may have greater visual engagement when compared to text portions 
of the PWLs  
H2a: The recall for image areas of PWLs might be higher post -exposure in comparison to text 
areas of interest.  
 
 
Aim 2: To evaluate effects of PWL risk content (lesser- known vs well -known risks) on 
visual engagement, recall and knowledge  
FDA Labels: Eye Tracking Study          Page 4 
Version 3: 03.10.2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  H2a: Warning labels bearing images of lesser known tobacco  use harms will have longer latency 
and fixation durations  than warning labels bearing images of well- known harms of tobacco.  
H2b: The initial image/text/gist recall of PWL text and message with lesser known harms may be 
lower than well- known harms . 
H2c: T he knowledge increase will be greater among smokers exposed to warning labels 
highlighting lesser known harms of tobacco.  
 
 
Secondary Aims:  
To examine the perceived effectiveness of all the warning labels. A p ersonalized 
effectiveness ranking11 for each participant will be collected by [CONTACT_128794] 
[ADDRESS_145357] avoidant, preferred  and informative.  
4 Study Design 
4.1 Design  
Study participants will be randomized to view one set of graphic warning labels with either lesser -known or well -known harms of t obacco use. The labels will be presented on a computer 
screen while their eye movements are recorded for each label seen. Participants will provide smoking and quitting related attitude, belief and intention  measures and answer questionnaires 
before and af ter viewing the labels during the in -person session. This laboratory -based study will 
aim to enroll 70 current cigarette  users to complete a 1- day, randomized, parallel design 
protocol. We base this design on our previous and ongoing studies using eye -tracking 
methodology.  
4.2 Study Duration  
Recruitment/enrollment is anticipated to begin in November  2020. We estimate that up to [ADDRESS_145358] flyer s and advertise online, similar to our previous recruiting 
efforts. We will enroll (i.e., sign an IRB -approved informed consent form) ~ 70 participants to . To 
achieve this goal , we intend to recruit 5-7 participants per month, which will allow us to enroll and 
randomize enough participants to complete data collection as proposed. The sample size was 
determined based on a previous graphic warning label eye -tracking study by [CONTACT_128795].11

CONFIDENTIAL  • Inability to provide informed consent or complete any of the study tasks as determined by 
[CONTACT_458].  
5.5 Vulnerable Populations  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study. 
Educat ionally or economically disadvantaged persons are included but not solely targeted for 
recruitment. Because of our recruitment efforts for this study, it is possible that University of Pennsylvania employees and students may be invited to participate. Stat us of participation in the 
current study will be independent of the participant’s work or school activities.  
5.6 Participant Recruitment  
Anupreet Sidhu will oversee the study recruitment. Participants may be recruited from television, 
radio, internet adverti sements, newspaper, flyers, transit posters, referrals, and/or from our 
database of previous participants who have agreed to be re -contact[CONTACT_7678]. Interested 
participants will first complete a n online RedCap screener or a telephone screen to assess their 
initial eligibility.   Participants who are initially eligible will be screened against our registration 
database to confirm that they are not currently participating in another research study at our Center 
and have not previously reported a condition or circumstance that would make them ineligible for the current study. Those participants who remain initially eligible will then be invited to attend the 
lab session  at our Center during which they will be presented with the IR B-approved  Informed 
Consent Form and have their final eligibility confirmed.   
FDA Labels: Eye Tracking Study          Page 7 
Version 3: 03.10.[ADDRESS_145362] access to the online screener, i nitial eligibility will be determined 
during a structured Telephone Eligibility Screen conducted by a trained member of the research team. If a participant is found to be initi ally eligible per the applicable inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, the lab s ession will be scheduled in order to confirm the participant’s final eligibility  and 
to complete the study questionnaires and viewing tasks. A completed telephone screen will take approximately 30 minutes. 
5.8 Procedures  
The lab session  will occur at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction 
(CIRNA). Participants will typi[INVESTIGATOR_128788] a session reminder 24 – 48 hours prior to their 
scheduled session via phone call, email, and text message (if applicable).   
During the se ssion (Duration: ~2 hours), participants will complete the following: 
1. Confirm the accuracy of information (i.e., name, a ddress, phone number, email [if applicable], 
date of birth, age, ethnicity, race, sex assigned at birth, gender, cigarette brand type ) provided 
during the initial Telephone Eligibility Screen.  Participants will be explicitly instructed to bring 
in their own preferred brand of cigarettes to verify their preferred brand. If the participant does 
not bring in the brand of cigarettes,  they reported during the Telephone Eligibility Screen, the 
participant may be deemed ineligible or their s ession  may be reschedul ed to a later time/day.  
2. Receive and review a research study summary for potential participants. If the participant is still interested in participating in the study, they will be presented with the complete combined Informed Consent Form per below.   
3. Be presented with the combine d Informed Consent Form. The Informed Consent Form will be 
read to the participant verbatim. All of the participant’s questions will be answered. Both the questions and subsequent answers will be recorded on an “ICF/HIPAA Questions Form,” which will be maintained with the original Informed Consent Form. If the participant agrees to participate in the study, the Informed Consent Form will be signed (legal name) and dated by [CONTACT_128796] a qualified member of the research team. Participants will receive a signed copy of the Informed Consent Form for their records.  
4. Smoke a cigarette (own brand) outdoors to standardize the time to last smoke.  
5. Complete baseline questionnaire: 
• Cigarette Brand Form - While viewing the participant’s cigarette pack, the research staff will 
record the cigarette brand information on the form as appropriate. Additionally, a photocopy 
of the participant’s cigarette packaging will be obtained for further verification of preferred brand and flavor. 
• Demographics and Sexual Orien tation  
• Smoking History  
• Nicotine Dependence (FTND) 
• Pre-test measures of smoking related beliefs, attitudes towards quitting and knowledge of 
tobacco harms.  
• No CO measurements will be collected during the session to minimize the risk of COVID -19 
infection.

by [CONTACT_128797]. Participants will then complete a recall 
task and a questionnaire with knowledge, risk beliefs and attitude measurement.  
7. After viewing labels from their assigned group, each participant will perform a recognition and ranking task for  all 1 1 labels proposed for cigarette packs by [CONTACT_1622].  
8. Participants will be  provided compensation for their participation.  
  
5.9 Description of Study Measures  
5.9.1 Screening and Covariates 
Age, Date of Birth (DOB), Sex Assigned at Birth, Gender, Ethnicity, and Race : Participants will 
report their Age, DOB, Sex Assigned at Birth, Gender, Ethnicity, and Race during the initial 
telephone eligibility screen . During the study session, the previously reported information will be 
verified in person with the participant by [CONTACT_16133].  
Cigarette  Use Survey and Brand Form: P articipants will complete a standardized survey about 
their cigarette use (i.e., pack type, brand, filtered or non -filtered,  flavor, menthol or non-
menthol, frequency, and additional information ). In addition, a photocopy of the participant’s 
cigarette pa ck will be obtained for further verification of brand and flavor.  
Demographics, Smoking History, and Nicotine Dependence (FTND):  Standard questionnaires 
will be administered to collect the following data: demographics, age at smoking initiation, current sm oking rate, and intentions to quit . The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence 
(FTND) will also be administered. The FTND is a 6 -item, self -report measure of nicotine 
dependence derived from the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire.  
5.9.2 Eye tracking, Recall  and Knowledge (Primary Outcomes)  
Eye tracking: Participants will view the warning labels on a computer screen while wearing an 
eye movement tracker. The eye tracking device will provide key measure such as latency, latency duration and fixation duration for text as well as image areas of interest.  
Recal
l : The participants will provide answers to an open -ended recall question for the text, image 
and/or overall message question .   For the recognition task, the participants will also view all 1 1 
label  images and text statements, and would be required to identify the warning labels and text 
statements they saw earlier .  
Knowledge : A ll participants will select harms caused by [CONTACT_128798] a list of health issues and 
diseases, before as well as after viewing the warning labels on screen.  
5.9.3 Secondary Measures  
Perceived Effectiveness Warning Label Ratings : Participants will provide subjective ratings of 
all the warning labels released by [CONTACT_128799], believable 
and informative.

Version 3: 03.10.2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  5.10 Analytic Plan  
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the study population and smoking-related data.  
A factorial design will be used. The primary independent variable is warning label type (lesser-
known harms vs well- known harms.  Associations of independent and covariate variables with 
eye-tracking measures, recall, and knowledge will be assessed using unpaired t -tests or ANOVA 
(categor ical predictors) and linear regression analysis (continuous predictors).  Eye-tracking 
measures are continuous, and previously been observed to meet assumptions of normality. Recall is dichotomous and will be examined using logistic regression model to generate odds ratio, as in 
our previous work (Strasser et al., 2012; 2008). A primary outcome measure of this study  is 
change in knowledge after exposure to graphic cigarette warning labels. Th is measure will be  
continuous when calculated on a scale and categorical when coded as increase in knowledge vs 
no change. Chi -square and regression analysis can be used to assess association of knowledge 
change with label type and by [CONTACT_551]. Analysis will be conducted in a using S tata (Stata 
Corp., TX). Path analysis techniques for tobacco related mediation and moderation models will be used; covariates found to be significantly associated will be considered for inclusion in models as appropriate.  
6 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Although cigarette smoking is associated with many diseases, we do not anticipate that any risk of smoking [ADDRESS_145364] scientific and policy implications by [CONTACT_128800][INVESTIGATOR_128789]. 
7 Data Management 
The CIRNA Data Management Team has developed a data management system (DMS) that 
will facilitate the operati onal facets of this study, including collection, validation and storage 
of participant data, tracking recruitment call attempts, participant study milestones, accrual goals, and exporting data for use in statistical analysis and data sharing. The DMS integ rates 
Microsoft Access, REDCap and AutoData Scannable Office.  
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is the primary software platform for collecting and storing questionnaire data. REDCap is a web‐based application developed by [CONTACT_128801]. It is HIPAA‐compliant, and highly secure. REDCap ensures data integrity through range and validity checks during the data entry process.  
FDA Labels: Eye Tracking Study          Page 10 
Version 3: 03.10.[ADDRESS_145365] management. The MS Access databases contain VBA programming to automate report generation (e.g., accrual, enrollment, AE tracking, participant compliance, and r ecruitment sources), calculate study milestone dates, 
performing range/validity checks as users enter data, generate custom error messages to control user input, and populate information displayed on participant study materials.  
7.[ADDRESS_145366] an appropriate 
database structure to support the requirem ents of the DMS and to promote data security and 
integrity. Electronic audit trails of changes to database contents (including REDCap) are incorporated into the design and will capture and record those changes automatically.  
7.2 Data Security  
Data collected in an Access database and REDCap will be stored on a secure server administered by [CONTACT_128802] (PMACS) organization and will be restricted to only those individuals who are authorized to work on the trial . Individual user 
accounts with passwords will be used to restrict access to the database. Specific privilege assignments within the database will also be employed to limit the types of functions that 
authorized users can perform to those functions that are appropriate for their role in the trial. 
Additional measures to prevent unauthorized external access to the database environment will be employed using network firewall technologies. The Data Manager will maintain the database in an appropriate manner for the retention pe riod required by [CONTACT_5151]. Database administration 
includes user account maintenance, database security, performance monitoring, and database 
change management. Daily backups are performed to protect data against accidental destruction 
or corruption.  
7.3 Data Processing  
The data entry screens will resemble the data collection forms as closely as possible to allow 
visual referencing during data entry. The data entry module will be configured for single data entry. The majority of participant data will be self‐report and participants will either enter data into Qualtrics  using computer, tablets or complete paper -and-pen forms during in‐person visits. 
Some data might  be collected by [CONTACT_3647], recorded on study‐specific source 
documents/CRFs, and scanned in or entered directly into REDCap or MS Access. Data entry checks will be included in the entry screen designs, where appropriate, to limit the opportunity for erroneous entries due to mistypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Such data entry checks would include value range comparisons, valid data type checks, required value checks, and/or skip pattern enforcement. Following initial telephone eligibility screening, research staff will perform subject registration.

protocols, data management system, AE collection and reporting, and all study- specific SOPs, 
which will be maintained in an accessible electronic manual of procedures.  In addition, during a standardized training period, the duties of each staff member will be clearly outlined, and all applicable regulations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_128803]. All 
personnel working on this project will complete required training in the protection of human 
participants and the protection of PHI (i.e., HIPAA) before interacting with study data or 
research participants.  All human participant and privacy protections certifications will be 
maintained in the regulatory binder. 
8.3 Monitoring Activities  
8.3.1 Initial Assessment ( Lab Session) Monitoring  
The study staff will conduct a manual quality assurance review of a participant’s telephone 
screen documentation to confirm the participant’s initial eligibility prior to their session. Further, eligibility data will be closely reviewed in real-time by [CONTACT_16133].

 Synopsis  
Primary Objective  
• To compare the acute and longer -term effectiveness of Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT 
(telehealth, office -based, or hybrid) versus Guided Online CBT (with minimal 
clinician involvement) for treating youth anxiety identified in pediatric healthcare.  
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To determine whether key factors predict or moderate differential treatment 
engagement or response, in turn informing treatment personalization for various 
patient subgroups  
• To explore quantitative and qualitative data to understand perspectives, 
preferences, background factors, clinical and treatment engagement variables, and 
organizational factors that impede or facilitate implementation of, and patient 
engagement with, the comparators in pediatric health settings.  
Primary Outcome Variables  
• Youth anxiety symptoms  - measured via the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form Item 
Bank v2.0 -Anxiety.  
• Life interference  - measured via the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale; CALIS  
• Treatment Responder Status  – measured via the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; 
PARS  
• Family Perceived Effectiveness  – measured via caregiver - and youth self -report  
• Treatment Satisfaction  – measured via caregiver - and youth self -report  
Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables  
Treatment engagement and barriers, broader youth psychopathology (i.e., internalizing 
problems, externalizing problems, and attention problems), youth sleep difficulties, 
caregiver internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and 
stress symptoms), and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332213].  Other secondary 
analyses  will examine predictors and moderators of  differential  outcomes, including: 
demographic factors, clinical factors, caregiver and youth a ttitudes, and language of care  
(English versus Spanish) , among other factors.  
Study Duration  
The study project has a duration of 5 years.  
Study Design  
6 
 The study design entails a large -scale, streamlined, pragmatic Randomized Controlled 
Trial (RCT), in which eligible anxious youth presenting to pediatric health care settings will 
be randomly assigned to receive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led (telehealth , office -based, or hybrid care ) 
versus guided  online CBT for youth anxiety and monitored for up to 1 year.  
Intervention  
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a well -supported standard of care for the treatment of 
anxiety in children and adolescents. This study is a pragmatic comparative effectiveness 
design comparing two modalities for administering CBT: Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led CBT (telehealth , 
office -based, or hybrid care ) vs. Guided  Online CBT  (with minimal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332214]) .  
Study Population  
We will include youth ages 7-18 years of age presenting to pediatric health care sites, 
including community health centers serving primarily low -income and traditionally 
underserved populations, affiliated with four major academic medical centers, each 
distinguished by [CONTACT_332380]: [LOCATION_011] Medical 
Center in [LOCATION_011], MA; Nicklaus Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332215], FL; John's Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332216], MD, and Seattle Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332217], WA.  
Number of Participants  
We require 150 participants per treatment group, for a total of 300 participants.

 1 - Introduction  
1.1 Introductory Statement  
This document is a protocol for a human research study, Kids  FACE FEARS ( Formats of 
Anxiety Care Effectiveness study For Extending the Acceptability and Reach of Services ). The 
purpose of this protocol is to ensure that this study is to be conducted according to PCORI 
guidelines, applicable government regulations, and participating institutional research policies 
and procedures. Each site will adhere to their institution’s hu man subject research policy.  This 
study protocol and statistical analysis plan details the trial’s rationale, stakeholder partnerships, 
treatment conditions, participant recruitment, assessment schedule/st rategy, provider 
training/consultation, and analytic plan.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_410977] Synopsis  
Pediatric anxiety constitutes a serious public health concern. Cognitive -behavioral therapy 
(CBT) is a “gold standard” treatment, preferred by [CONTACT_332381], but 
barriers limit CBT accessibility. Modern CBT formats include varying l evels of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332222], but little is known about their 
effectiveness in typi[INVESTIGATOR_332223]. The Kids Formats of Anxiety Care Effectiveness study For 
Extending the Acceptability and Reach of Ser vices (Kids FACE FEARS) trial addresses these 
gaps. The Kids FACE FEARS trial ( N~300 youth; ages 7 -18 years) is a multisite, pragmatic 
randomized trial comparing Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT (telehealth, office -based, or hybrid) versus 
Guided Online CBT (self -administered/self -paced, with minimal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34722]) for treating 
anxiety identifie d in pediatric care. English - and Spanish -speaking families are enrolled from 
high-volume, urban pediatric healthcare sites affiliated with major medical centers in four 
metrop olitan regions. Children with elevated anxiety (and their families) are randomized to 
receive one of the two treatment comparators. Families participate in major assessments 
conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and one -year follow -up. Data f or the study 
are drawn from caregiver -reports, youth self -reports, ratings of independent evaluators who are 
masked to treatment condition assignment), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -reports, and administrative logs. 
Exclusion criteria are minimal relative to other large -scale  youth anxiety treatment trials. 
Treatment is provided by [CONTACT_332382] (i.e., clinicians not 
employed by [CONTACT_332383], and not working in anxiety specialty 
settings).  
Primary study aims focus on comparative effectiveness between the two treatment conditions 
on symptom severity, impairment, and patient -centered outcomes. Secondary aims focus on 
examining factors that predict heterogeneity of treatment response outcomes across youth (i.e., 
predictors and moderators), and exploring factors that impede or facilitate the treatment 
implementation and engagement.  
14 
 2 – Background  and Rationale  
2.[ADDRESS_410978] common psychiatric problems affecting children and 
adolescents,1–4 with one -fifth of the population meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder by [CONTACT_332384].3 Pediatric anxiety is associated with considerable burdens including 
school absenteeism, academic underachievement, social difficulties, family dysfunction, somatic 
symptoms, and frequent medical visits.5–[ADDRESS_410979] wages 
and job producti vity, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and substantial costs to society.9–[ADDRESS_410980] decade,16–[ADDRESS_410981], widening disparities and inequities, potentially 
harmful social media impacts, rising climate concern, and a global pandemic with far -reaching 
ripples and hardships. In the [LOCATION_002]  (U.S.), minoritized status confers particular risk for 
anxiety, especially for youth of color, language -minority youth, and children of foreign -born 
caregivers.21–25 At the same time, minoritized youth are often underrepresented in pediatric 
anxiety research.  
2.2 Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy is Well -Supported in Treating Pediatric Anxiety.  
Efficacious treatments for youth anxiety can decrease lifelong symptoms, functional burdens, 
costs, and the subsequent onset of comorbid problems (e.g., depression, substance use).26 –30 
Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) is a “gold standard” psychological treatment for mild -to-
moderate anxiety,31 –34 and is preferred by [CONTACT_332385].35 CBT 
is goal -directed, brief and time -limited, can be manualized and broadly disseminated, and is 
divided into two general phases: (1) skills buildi ng; and (2) exposure practice.  
Dozens of large randomized trials indicate the majority of anxious youth are markedly improved 
after CBT, significantly outperforming waitlist, bibliotherapy, active support, and placebo 
comparators. 31–33,36  In the landmark, multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study 
(CAMS), 34 for example, 60% of youth treated with CBT were classified as treatment responders 
by [CONTACT_262420] (IEs), compared to 55% of youth treated with sertraline and only 23% 
of youth treated with placebo. For those with severe anxiety, a combination a pproach of CBT 
plus sertraline (associated with an 80% responder rate) was required for response, [ADDRESS_410982] added to existing CBT gains.  
 
15 
 2.3 Treatment Gaps: Problems in the Availability, Accessibility, and Acceptability of CBT 
for Pediatric Anxiety.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_332224], up to 80% of anxious 
children do not seek or receive help.[ADDRESS_410983] been 
supported in the literature47–58 and show promise for meaningfully overcoming treatment 
barriers. Research documents rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332225] U.S., 
with 97% of people below the age of 65 years now reporting regular Internet use, and 85% of 
people bel ow the age of 65 years having household Internet access.59 Racial/ethnic - and 
income -related disparities in Internet access persist, particularly when considering household 
and mobile Internet access, although 91% of Black people and 86% of people earning less than 
$30,000/year  nonetheless report regular Interne t usage.[ADDRESS_410984] Internet use data speak to the considerable potential 
Internet -delivered CBT formats hold for broadening the reach of supported care. Two leading 
Internet -delivered approaches for ext ending CBT availability are (1) telehealth and hybrid care, 
and (2) guided online care.  
16 
 Telehealth and Hybrid Care . Telehealth formats and hybrid options (i.e., mix of telehealth and 
office -based care) leverage synchronous telecommunications (typi[INVESTIGATOR_332226]) for 
the remote provision of live and interactive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led care. Telehealth has been increasingl y 
studied47–50 as a means to overcome logistical challenges to traditional brick -and-mortar CBT for 
youth anxiety and stigma about attending a mental health facility. Research in controlled 
settings and specialty clinics finds that telehealth options for a range of chil d mental health 
challenges can produce gains comparable to traditional office -based CBT. 47–50,60 –62 In some 
trials, telehealth has even outperformed traditional office -based care on key outcomes,61 likely 
due to the improved ecological validity afforded in telehealth by [CONTACT_332386]. Furthermore, relative to traditional office -based care, telehealth is associated with 
significantly reduced caregiver -perceived barriers to  care 61 and significantly improved session 
attendance, particularly for racial and ethnic minoritized youth.63 After years of research, 
telehealth entered the clinical mainstream during the COVID -19 pandemic,64–[ADDRESS_410985] -
pandemic times, telehealth still plays a prominent (albeit understudied) role in youth mental 
health care.  
Guided Online Care.  Guided online care (i.e., self-administered/self -paced, with minimal 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34722]) offers a computerized CBT delivery format that reduces therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332227] -based care and telehealth, while also affording greater family flexibility, 
agency, and control. As such, guided online care addresses many of the same logistical care 
barriers as telehealth, but can also address person -power issues in the mental health workforce, 
inconsistencies in care quality across practice settings, cost issues, and, for some fam ilies, 
issues of mistrust about working directly with a healthcare professional. Accordingly, self -
administered online CBT may in some cases be the preferred treatment mode. CBT lends itself 
well to standardization to reduce drift and digitization due to i ts highly structured nature, and 
digital delivery may be particularly well -suited to youth and younger families who avidly engage 
with media and technology. That said, attrition can be high in self -administered online care. 
Increasing studies find some lev el of minimal/low -intensity human support is often needed to 
accompany self -administered online CBT —i.e., guided online CBT —to sustain patient 
motivation, promote adherence, and prevent disengagement.67,[ADDRESS_410986] shown many of these programs can produce sizeable treatment gains, 
particularly when administered with some level o f guided support.51–[ADDRESS_410987] been implemented in anxiety -specialty clinics and/or research 
settings. Evaluating the effectiveness of guided online CBT in diverse populations under usual 
care conditio ns is critical for understanding the extent to which this format can truly expand the 
accessibility and acceptability of care and reach underserved populations. Further, clinical trials 
of guided online CBT have not included a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led treatment compa rison, rendering it hard 
to make informed comparisons across treatment formats and precluding an understanding of 
which CBT formats for pediatric anxiety work best for whom.  
 
  
18 
 3 - Rationale/Significance  
3.[ADDRESS_410988] children with anxiety do not receive treatment for many reasons, including lack of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], stigma, getting to appointments, and time -commitment. Online delivery of CBT can 
lead to meaningful improvements in child anxiety and  could make CBT available for more 
families (Morgan et al., 2017) . Providing these treatments in community pediatrics practices 
could help even more children, particularly lower income and minority families who may not 
seek care elsewhere. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_332228] -to-face and online formats 
of CBT, to date no study has directly compared face -to-face and online CBT delivery methods in 
pediatric settings with predominantly low income and minority families, nor has research 
evaluated whether these two formats may differentially work better for certain p atients or 
scenarios.  
The project outlined in this protocol responds to PCORI’s (Patient Centered Outcomes 
Research Institute) Special Area of Emphasis on digital health interventions for treating anxiety 
in children and adolescents at risk of reduced access to care, including immigrant, racial/ethnic 
minority, and low -income patients. This protocol also addresses the AHRQ (Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality) future research needs for the integration of mental 
health/substance use treatment in primary care.  
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
This study addresses three critical yet unanswered questions related to improving the delivery 
of CBT and treatment outcomes for anxiety in pediatric health settings. Answering the following 
question offers the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of the evidence available to help 
children, families, and organizational stakeholders make informed decisions regar ding clinical 
practice and implementation strategies for the treatment of childhood anxiety:  
(1)  What is the comparative  effectiveness of implementing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led (telehealth , office -
based, or hybrid ) versus guided  online  formats of CBT to treat youth anxiety i dentified i n 
pediatric health  care settings ?  
(2)  Which factors might  moderate outcomes across treatment formats and sequences? 
Which patient subgroups might benefit most from each of the treatment formats?  
(3)  What are the barriers and facilitators to delivering this care in pediatric health care 
settings and for the diverse patient populations served?  
19 
 Both the effectiveness and implementation questions are relevant to advancing strategies for 
addressing anxiety in pediatric health care and optimizing patients' and families' access to, 
options for, and quality of anxiety treatment. In recent years there has been a surge of interest 
in online treatment delivery formats that offer more accessible, flexible, and efficient care with 
the potential to reach a greater portion of the population in need . 
3.3.1 Potential Benefits  
Families  enrolled in the study would benefit from:  
• Receiv ing evidence -based treatment for youth anxiety  
• Parents  or guardians  receiving education on anxiety and how they can help manage 
their child’s anxiety through an evidence -based program  
• Receiving support from a trained professional over the phone (if the y are randomized to 
the guided online format ) 
• Having access to a convenient evidence -based self-administered CBT program online  (if 
randomized to the online format ) that would not be offered outside of the study  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332229]:  
• Assisting participating families with access to child behavioral health services   
• Learning a new framework for delivering CBT  
• Providing valuable information to primary care practices and integrated health networks 
about the potential benefits and barriers to implementing these interventions for children 
with anxiety  
• Providing evidence -based  information to support patient and provider decision making 
and patient centered care  
3.3.[ADDRESS_410989] confidentiality : 
• Because the research covers the topic of mental health and potential psychosocial 
stressors, participation may be emotionally distressing to individuals in the study.  
• Although we will strive to maximize cultural sensitivity in delivery of the proposed 
intervention, it is possible that, among guardians , their explanatory models of their child's 
condition will be incompatible with our proposed interventions and even the 
assessments, which may upset some participants.  
20 
 • Although data will be stored in a secure and confidential manner, and we will code  all 
stored data  and store it separate from any direct participant identifiers , accidental 
breaches of confidentiality are technically possible.    
Potential risks for staff participants are the need to protect confidentiality:  
• Although data will be stored in a secure and confidential manner, and we will code all 
stored data and store it separate from any direct participant identifiers, accidental 
breaches of confidentiality are technically possible.  
• Because the research involves feedback about the study and the clinic's ability to 
implement mental health care, staff participants may be concerned or distressed about 
how this may impact their employment. Their responses  will be kept confidential and will 
not be shared with their employer.  
The primary risk for study participants is breach of confidentiality. We have taken  measures to 
ensure the safety and security of all data and participant  information which is  outline d in the 
data storage/ security section of this protocol.

4.1 Primary Objective  
The objective of Aim 1 ( Comparative Effectiveness ) is to compare the acute and long -term 
effectiveness of Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT (telehealth, office -based, or hybrid) vs Guided Online CBT 
(with minimal clinician support) for treating youth anxiety identified in pediatric healthcare. It is 
hypothesized that yo uth in both conditions would show significant curvilinear improvements over 
time characterized by [CONTACT_332387], followed by a slowing down of improvements toward the end of treatment a nd 
then relative stability across the follow -up time interval. Comparative effectiveness analyses will 
22 
 compare differences in outcome slopes across the two conditions. Aim 1 focuses on the 
following primary treatment outcomes across the comparators: family -rated anxiety severity, 
family -rated anxiety -related life impairment, independently rated treatment re sponder and 
anxiety remission status, family perceived effectiveness, and family satisfaction with care. Data 
on a range of secondary outcomes are also collected.  
 
4.2 Secondary Objectives  
The objective of Aim 2 ( Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects ) is to determine whether key factors 
predict or moderate differential treatment engagement or response, in turn informing treatment 
personalization for various patient subgroups. To understand heterogeneity in treatment 
response across youth, moderating f actors examined include:  demographic factors, clinical 
factors, caregiver and youth a ttitudes, and language of care (English versus Spanish). 
Additional factors are also assessed to afford further tests of predictors and moderators of 
treatment response.  
 
Aim 3 ( Implementation Facilitators and Barriers ) is exploratory, with the objective to understand 
perspectives, preferences, background factors, clinical and treatment engagement variables, 
and organizational factors that facilitate or impede implementation of, and patient engagement 
with, the comparat ors in routine pediatric health settings.

 5 – Engagement and Partnerships with Patients, 
Other Stakeholders, and Scientific Advisors  
Throughout all stages of the Kids FACE FEARS trial, investigators are engaged in 
collaborations with patient, parent, and community stakeholders who have experience 
(themselves or loved ones) with mental health challenges such as anxiety, as well as with 
treatment providers, clinical supervisors, and program administrators who are responsible for 
providing care to families. Investigators also engage with a Study Advisory Committee 
comprised of members dedicated to improving access to evidence -based treatmen t, and a Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board to further ensure patient safety and protection. These mutual 
partnerships with stakeholder groups meaningfully inform each aspect of the study design, 
implementation, and dissemination, as described below.  
Patient Family Advisory Council (PFAC). The Kids FACE FEARS Patient Family Advisory 
Council (PFAC) is made up of 22 members (16 parents and 7 adolescents) with lived 
experience (personal or family) with youth anxiety and its treatment. PFAC members were 
identified and recruited through patient a dvisory boards at participating clinical sites in all four 
study regions, extended patient networks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102476], clinical networks of study team 
members, and through study team member connections with patient s and families with anxiety 
in their communities. Throughout study design, implementation, and analysis, the PFAC will 
convene regularly in person and on group videoconferencing calls to ensure that patient/family 
perspectives are fully integrated into all  aspects of the study and that research activities are 
aligned with patient/family needs. PFAC meetings will be held throughout the study. Separate 
meetings will be held in English and Spanish. For each set of meetings, separate one -hour 
sessions are held with an English -speaking Youth Council, an English -speaking Caregiver 
Council, and a Spanish -speaking Youth/Caregiver Council. Bilingual youth can chose whether 
to be in the English -speaking Youth Council or the Spanish -speaking Youth/Caregiver Council. 
Meetings will occur quarterly during the first three years of the study, bi -annually during the 
fourth year of the study, annually during the fifth year of the study, and twice during the data 
analysis/interpretation phase of the study.  Each PFAC meeting is  structured as followed: 1) an 
overview of the meeting agenda, 2) a review of study progress and updates (including study 
changes based on PFAC feedback), 3) a presentation of current study tasks/goals 4) 
introduction of specific questions/prompts for disc ussion, 5) division into breakout groups to 
facilitate small group discussion and brainstorming, and 6) full -group discussion and closure. 
Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, PFAC meetings were held in a hybrid format, with all regions 
convening together on Zo om, and in -person break -out groups convening within study regions 
prior to a final all -region discussion on Zoom. After the pandemic began, all PFAC meetings are 
held entirely on Zoom, with virtual breakout rooms used for small group discussions. To furthe r 
facilitate virtual engagement, brainstorming, and interaction among group members, study staff 
will utilize collaborative digital tools (e.g., Zoom reaction features, screensharing, a collaborative 
[ADDRESS_410992]). PFAC members will help with study planning and 
provide input throughout about participant recruitment and project implementation. PFAC co -
investigators will assist in creating research poster presentations for profe ssional conferences 
and will be invited to collaborate on major scholarly papers for the project. PFAC members will 
also provide suggestions about ways to effectively disseminate findings to study participants 
and to the public.  
Treatment Providers and Clinical Supervisors. Natural providers in participating pediatric 
health settings (i.e., clinicians not employed by [CONTACT_332383], and 
not working in anxiety specialty settings) serve as the treatment providers in the Kids FACE 
FEARS trial. These provi ders also provide stakeholder input and collaboration, along with 
clinical supervisors and clinic staff at the participating settings. Their participation and feedback 
helps the investigative team refine traini ng and implementation efforts and contribute to an 
improved understanding of barriers and facilitators to implementing the treatment comparators 
in usual care settings. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332230] -practices CBT for 
youth anxiety. Clinicians and supervisors at the participating sites will engage in full -day training 
and then receive bi -weekly, small group consultation through videoconferenci ng calls led by a 
pediatric anxiety treatment expert (see Procedures) throughout the study. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332231] - 
and post -training, through quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback, questionnaires about 
their comfort with technology and the organizational climate of their professional setting, and 
through therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332232] n forms and posttreatment logs. Clinicians and supervisors provided 
further information about successes and challenges in delivering the CBT comparators during 
bi-monthly consultation calls led by [CONTACT_332388]. These calls will be u sed 
to clarify therapy skills, promote sustained learning and prevent drift, support therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and 
gain feedback from clinicians about their experiences implementing the treatment.  
Study Advisory Committee (SAC). The Study Advisory Committee (SAC) consists of 14 
nationally known researchers and other clinical professionals (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, 
pediatricians, clinical social workers, child health service researchers, primary care physicians, 
medical directors) committed to clinical research to improve access to evidence -based 
treatments for underserved youth. The SAC includes a scientific steering committee with 
considerable collective expertise in pediatric mental health, digital mental health, worki ng with 
minoritized youth, leading large multisite randomized clinical trials, and overseeing prior PCORI -
funded projects. The SAC will meet roughly twice annually with the investigators via 
videoconferencing across the planning, recruitment, implementatio n, and analysis phases of the 
study. These meetings will afford a structured opportunity to provide external advisory support 
[ADDRESS_410993] (DSMB). Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
members will have considerable collective experience in the conduct of clinical and 
developmental research with youth, the conduct of clinical trials, and working with diverse 
families. They will be involved to exter nally assess the protection of data and participant 
confidentiality, and help ensure the trial is conducted according to high scientific and ethical 
standards. The DSMB is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, 
assessing the safety and efficacy of study procedures, and monitoring the overall conduct of the 
study. The DSMB will meet via videoconferencing about twice yearly to provide independent 
oversight of data management and integrity and  participant safety.  DSMB members will include 
a clinical child psychologist with experience conducting federally funded clinical trials and 
experience serving on university Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and DSMBs, and a 
child/developmental psychologi st with extensive experience conducting applied research with 
diverse families.

 6 - Study Design  
6.1 General Design  Overview  
The KFF trial is a multisite, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the 
effectiveness of Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT (telehealth, office -based, or hybrid) versus Guided Online 
CBT (with minimal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34722]) for the treatment of elevated youth an xiety identified in 
pediatric health care settings. Families are enrolled from  high-volume, urban pediatric health 
care sites affiliated with major medical centers  in four U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD, [LOCATION_011], MA, 
Miami, FL, and Seattle, WA. Universal screen ing of English - and Spanish -speaking youth 
receiving primary or secondary pediatric health care in these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332233], if interested, are referred to behavioral 
health teams in their h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_332234]. Elevated youth anxiety is 
required for eligibility; to maximize generalizability a formal anxiety disorder diagnosis is not 
required. Eligible and interested families are randomly assigned to one of the two  treatment 
comparators and given up to 20 weeks to complete their allocated treatment. All services and 
assessments are provided in English and in Spanish, as needed. Major assessments are 
conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and roughly one -year follow -up.  
To maximize generalizability, exclusion criteria are minimal compared to previous large -scale 
RCTs of youth anxiety treatment.34 To observe treatment comparators under natural 
circumstances in general pediatric health care settings, study treatment is incorporated into the 
natural flow of care at each participating site (e.g., clinical care is not funded by [CONTACT_281883], 
researc h therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332235], anxiety specialty clinics are not involved in clinical care). 
Natural therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332236], and then participate in biweekly consult ation calls.  
Institutional review boards (IRBs) at each participating site approved and oversaw the human 
subjects research aspects of the study, with [LOCATION_011] Medical Center’s IRB serving as the primary 
ethics review board for the trial. The trial is pre -registered ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
6.1.1 Study Setting  
This multisite comparative effectiveness trial is being conducted  at high -volume, urban pediatric 
health care sites affiliated with four major medical centers (Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332237], [LOCATION_011] Medical Center in [LOCATION_011] MA, Nicklaus Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332238], Seattle 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332239]).  These sites were selected as clinical performance partners 
due to their roles in serving large numbers of diverse pediatric patients and providing a high 
volume of services in English and in  Spanish, their collective representativeness of under -
resourced pediatric health settings that serve diverse populations from a range of 
socioeconomic backgrounds, and for the advantages offered in studying the treatment 
comparators in the context of acad emic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -community health center partnerships. For 
[ADDRESS_410994] safety net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332240] a large 
affiliated network of community health centers. Nicklaus Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332241] a nd the majority of its 
patient population is Hispanic/Latine, reflecting the demographics of the South FL community.  
6.2 Outcomes  
6.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables . The p rimary clinical outcomes assessed in the Kids FACE 
FEARS trial are focused on anxiety symptoms, anxiety -related impairment, treatment responder 
status, anxiety remission status, and patient -centered outcomes focused on perceived 
effectiveness and treatment satisfaction.  Specifically, these include:  
• Youth anxiety  symptoms  - measured via the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form Item Bank 
v2.0-Anxiety. The PROMIS pediat ric self -report will be completed by [CONTACT_332389] 8-18 
and parent proxy report s will be complete by [CONTACT_332390] s for all children. Only parent proxy 
reports will be collected for children under the age of 8 . 
• Life interference  - measured via the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale; CALIS  
• Treatment Responder Status  – measured via the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; PARS  
• Family Perceived Effectiveness  – measured via caregiver - and youth self -report  
• Treatment Satisfaction  – measured via caregiver - and youth self -report  
6.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables . Secondary clinical outcomes 
assessed in the Kids FACE FEARS trial focus on treatment engagement  and barriers , broader 
youth psychopathology (i.e., internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and attention 
problems), youth sleep difficulties, caregiver internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, and stress symptoms), and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332242]. 
Specifically, these include:  
• Treatment engagement and barriers  – measured via administrative logs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332243], and family reports of: Attendance, Homework engagement,  Treatment 
completion, Child participatory engagement, Caregiver participatory engagement, 
Comprehension difficulties, Difficulties making time for treatment, Treatment discomfort, 
Technology treatment challenges, and Therapeutic alliance.  
• Youth internalizing problems  - measured via the Pediatric Symptom Checklist; PSC -17 
• Youth externalizing problems  - measured via the Pediatric Symptom Checklist; PSC -17 
• Youth attention problems  - measured via the Pediatric Symptom Checklist; PSC -17 
• Youth sleep problems  - measured via a sleep item generated for this study  
• Caregiver depression symptoms  – measured via the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale ; 
DASS -21 
28 
 • Caregiver anxiety symptoms  – measured via the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale ; 
DASS -21 
• Caregiver stress symptoms  – measured via the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale ; 
DASS -21 
• Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -perceived effectiveness  – measured via items generated for this study  
Other s econdary outcomes incorporate a series of a moderator analyses to elucidate 
heterogeneity of treatment effects  across formats among important subgroups of patients.  On 
this front, w e will examine: Patient characteristics , Family characteristics , Provider 
characteristics , and Organizational and s ystem characteristics  
6.3 Study Population  
6.3.1 Number of Participants . Power analysis (accounting for an expected attrition  and 
missing data ) indicated w e require 150 participants per group, for a total of 300 participants  in 
the study .  
6.3.2 Eligibility Criteria . The study eligibility and inclusion , and exclusion  criteria for families 
include:  
Inclusion/ Eligibility  
• Elevated child/adolescent anxiety - Operationalized as T -Score on the PROMIS 
Pediatric Short Form -Anxiety Scale v2.0 > 55 (Child eligible if either the Pediatric Self -
Report or the Parent Proxy Report score was > 55) 
• Child aged 7 -18 years (inclusive) at time of screening  
• Child and caregiver(s) are fluent in English or Spanish  
• If taking medication for emotional problems, child must be on a stable dose 
(Operationalized as no adjustments to prescription for > 8 weeks)  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Severity requiring higher level of care, as defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  
o Suicidal thoughts or behaviors (STB) with active  plan or STB(s) that required a 
higher level of care within the past 6 months (e.g., inpatient, partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
o Anxiety -related absences > 50% of school days over the past month (If summer, 
attendance during last month of previous school year considered)  
o Substance use that required emergency services or inpatient/partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332244] 3 months  
29 
 o Clinician determined child requires higher level of care than outpatient services  
• History of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability with severe 
challenges and needs for support (e.g., complete absence of verbal communication 
unrelated to anxiety)  
• Currently engaged in CBT or planning to continue different therapy for anxiety during 
study treatment phase  
• Child is a ward of the state  
The decision to include families fluent in either English or Spanish was made to (a) improve the 
generalizability of trial findings, relative to existing research on the treatment of youth anxiety; 
(b) recruit a sample that would be more representative of the general U.S. population and the 
diverse range of anxious youth seen in clinical practice; and (c) provide treatment -related 
findings that would also be informative to the estimated 33.3% of mental health treatment 
facilities that provide services in Sp anish.[ADDRESS_410995] offered intervention in English and in 
Spanish,50,82 –[ADDRESS_410996] English -speaking families. Accordingly, the Kids FACE FEARS trial 
offers a rare large -scale examination of treatment for pediatric anxiety that is more broadly 
generalizable to the >90% of U.S. households that speak either English or Spanish.  
Several factors informed the decision to not consider formal DSM or ICD diagnoses as part of 
study inclusion or exclusion. Eligibility criteria were intentionally relaxed relative to previous 
large -scale trialse.g.,[ADDRESS_410997] elevated anxiety levels, but does not require 
formal anxiety disorder diagnoses, given the high number of anxious individuals i n need of care 
who miss diagnostic thresholds by [CONTACT_332391],86,87  especially in medical 
populations.88–90 Further, comorbid diagnoses do not preclude eligibility in the Kids FACE 
FEARS trial (as long as they do not acutely require a higher level of care such as inpatient or 
partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), given research showing such requirements can exclude up to ha lf of 
children seeking care from research trials.[ADDRESS_410998] “pure” diagnostic groups of 
youth wi th anxiety disorders who are represented in narrower efficacy trials. The decision to not 
consider DSM or ICD diagnoses as part of study eligibility is consistent with concerns about the 
poor reliability and differentiation of pediatric anxiety disorder di agnoses,92–[ADDRESS_410999] from formal diagnoses.96,97 Moreover, there is 
evidence that clinicians rarely use structured diagnostic interviews outside of research 
contexts,98 rendering findings based on structured diagnostic interviews poorly aligned for 
informing clinical practice. Finally, not including structured research -based diagnostic interviews 
30 
 in the trial’s assessment protocol addresses the need to minimize participant burdens and 
assessment demands in a pragmatic effectiveness trial. Reducing the assessment time that is 
focused on diagnostic nuances also affords opportunity to instead assess s everal important 
factors that have previously been neglected in large -scale clinical trials for the treatment of child 
anxiety (e.g., adverse childhood events, experiences of discrimination, mental health stigma; 
see Measures, below).

 7 - Methods  
7.1 Participation Flow  
Figure 1 presents the study timeline for participating families. Following initial screening and 
consent, families complete baseline assessment (Week 0) and eligible participants are then 
randomized to one of the two treatment comparators. Participants are  granted up to 20 weeks to 
complete their allocated treatment program. The decision to allow a 20 -week treatment window 
was informed by [CONTACT_332393], holiday breaks, health -
related cancellations, and attendance -interfering life events. All randomized families are invited 
to complete a midtreatment assessment once they complete half of their allocated treatment. 
Families who do  not complete half of their allocated treatment by [CONTACT_332394] a midtreatment assessment at Week 8. All 
randomized families are invited to complete a posttreatment assessment once they fully 
complete their allocated treatment program. Families who do not complete their allocated 
treatment program by [CONTACT_332395] 
a posttreatment assessment at Week 20. All randomized families are inv ited to complete a 
follow -up assessment at Week 52.

Note:  Week numbers reflect target number of weeks since baseline that participants in the Kids FACE 
FEARS Trial will complete assessments at each timepoint.  
 
7.2 Description of Intervention s/Comparators  
We are testing two deli very strategies of CBT  for youth anxiety disorders. CBT is the “gold 
standard” for the treatment of anxiety and is currently used as the standard of care by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_332250]. This research does not change the current standard of care used by 
[CONTACT_332396] – it expands the mode used to d eliver standard of care by [CONTACT_116826][INVESTIGATOR_332251] -based Cool Kids framework (i.e. a standardized version of CBT).  

32 
  
Specifically, the Kids FACE FEARS trial tested two CBT delivery strategies for pediatric anxiety: 
(1) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT (telehealth, office -based, or hybrid), and (2) Guided Online CBT (with 
minimal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34722]).  
Comparator 1: Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT for Youth Anxiety (telehealth, office -based, or hybrid). 
An extensive body of controlled studies supports Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT for anxious youth and their 
families, with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led CBT conventionally considered a “gold standard” psychological 
treatment for anxious youth.31–[ADDRESS_411001] directly trains youth (and often caregivers) in anxiety management skills 
then guides children in planning and participating in graded exposure tasks in which they 
approac h increasingly feared situations. In the landmark Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal 
Study (CAMS) trial, roughly 60% of youth treated with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led CBT classified as “treatment 
responders” by [CONTACT_332397].[ADDRESS_411002] received considerable and comparable research support.47–[ADDRESS_411003], Cool Kids  includes all the “gold standard” CBT components for treating 
youth anxiety and has an extensive research base.101–[ADDRESS_411004], the Cool Kids  suite of treatment programs comprehensively includes 
developmentally tailored versions for the full age range of youth included in the study (7 -18 
years). Fourth, the Cool Kids treatment suite has a documented history of successful 
implementation when rolled out on large -scale levels.103,[ADDRESS_411005] -
led version, and in a roughly comparable number of sessions/modules, thus allowing for well -
matched and time -equitable comparisons. And finally, the Cool Kids therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led and online 
treatment programs are all available in English and in Spanish.  
The standard Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led Cool Kids Therapy for Anxiety (ages 7 -12)99 is a structured, 
evidence -based, 10 -session program for treating youth anxiety in middle childhood and entails 
ten 50 -minute weekly sessions with children and families. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332252], cognitive/copi[INVESTIGATOR_332253], problem -solving skills, and graded exposures to 
anxiety provoking situations. Caregivers and youth are taught skills for managing anxiety and for 
reducing avoidant behaviors. Car egivers are included in all sessions (adjusted developmentally) 
and are taught parenting skills plus personal anxiety management. The program is supported by 
[ADDRESS_411006] -Led Chilled Therapy for Anxiety (ages 
13-18 years) is an adolescent version of Cool Kids  and includes a workbook geared specifically 
for adolescents; in this version teens take a more central role in managing their anxiety, and 
caregivers do not participate in all of the sessions. This version also includes ten sessions.  
Comparator 2: Guided Online CBT for Youth Anxiety (With Minimal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332254]). 
To expand the accessibility and reach of CBT for anxious youth, a suite of self -paced, online, 
multimedia, CBT -based programs for youth anxiety was developed to run parallel to the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led Cool Kids program. This online suite of programs covers identical content in a 
largely self -administered format. Similar to Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led Cool Kids , the Cool Kids Online  suite 
of programs is comprised of separate developmentally tailored online programs, two of which 
were used in the present trial, depending on the age of the child: (1) “Cool Kids Online” for ages 
7-12 years, and (2) “Chilled Out” for youth ages [ADDRESS_411007] -Led Cool Kids 
programs, feature interactive, engaging formats, and include video and audio clip examples of 
how to implement skills. In Co ol Kids Online, caregivers take on the role of their child’s coach, 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_332255], and learn helpful ways of responding to their child’s 
anxiety. In the Chilled Out adolescent online version,  the teen takes primary responsibility for 
program completion, and there are features designed to specifically increase teen 
engagement —e.g., there are real teens featured in the videos, teens demonstrate skills for 
managing anxiety, and there is a “playlis t” menu where teens can choose to re-visit content and 
cover skills at their own pace. The programs were originally developed in Australia. For both 
Cool Kids Online and Chilled Out, “Americanized” versions of the programs were used that 
include videos with diverse representation (e.g., Am erican children, families, and experts; 
broader representation of individuals of color; removed Australian accents or vernacular).  
To foster supportive accountability and engagement,67,68 families in this condition receive brief 
phone check -in calls (i.e., < 15 minutes) from a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332256]. To ensure these 
brief calls do not drift into treatment sessions, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332257] a conversation guideline to 
standardize calls (wit h space for flexibility as appropriate). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332258] -
in call with an explanation of the purpose of the call —i.e., to see how their use of the online 
modules is going, to find out whether the child/teen/caregiver has any questions, to  support the 
family with the program, and to make a plan for continued practice. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332259]: (a) engagement with online program and activity 
completion (“Were you able to log into the online prog ram? If not, what got in the way?”); (b) 
34 
 identification of current difficulties/barriers, including technical or motivational challenges (“Did 
anything get in the way of completing activities or practice? Did you experience any difficulties 
as a parent with respect to your child/teen’s anxiety ma nagement?”); (c) brainstorming possible 
solutions to identified barriers (“Let’s see if we can problem -solve together and come up with 
some solutions to help you complete materials this week”); (d) review of anxiety and caregiver 
progress (“Has your/your c hild’s level of anxiety changed since beginning the program?); (e) 
technical questions about content (“Do you have any specific questions about the material that 
you learned in the modules you completed?”); (f) assignment/plan for next two weeks, providing  
encouragement and praise for even small successes; and (g) confirmation of the next call.   
Of note, the comparators included across the two treatment delivery strategies cover identical 
therapeutic content, although the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led CBT program entails slightly more sessions than 
there are modules in the self -administered CBT program in order t o afford opportunities for 
alliance building. At the same time, participants in the self -administered online CBT program are 
able to revisit various modules multiple times. It is believed that the additional number of 
sessions in the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led CBT prog ram is roughly offset by [CONTACT_332398]-administered CBT program to revisit modules multiple times. In addition to the two 
comparators offering identical therapeutic content, participants across the two delivery 
strategies will be gi ven the identical amount of time (i.e., up to 20  weeks) within which to 
complete their course of treatment, further ensuring equipoise across comparators.  
7.[ADDRESS_411008] -Led Cool Kids (office -based or telehealth)  vs. Self-
Administered Web -based CBT for Child Anxiety  
Once therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332260] -led Cool Kids CBT, all patients 
screened positive for elevated anxiety can be offered Cool Kids CBT as standard treatment at 
[ADDRESS_411009] -led Cool Kids (telehealth, 
office-based , or hybrid ) CBT, or the guided online  Cool Kids CBT. Participants in the study will 
be asked to complete assessments throughout their  treatment and post -treatment for the 
purposes of this study. Short -term and long er-term outcomes will be analyzed in both arms to 
compare both forms of delivering CBT.  
7.5 Method of Assignment/Randomization  
Participants will be randomized by [CONTACT_5569]. If the participant will be completing the program and 
enrolling in the study without parental involvement, they will be randomized individually. Each 
patient/family will receive a unique study ID at the time of re ferral to the study that is not 
connected to identifiable data. Before randomization, the referred patient/family will complete 
the following enrollment procedures: (1) each referred patient will complete a clinical intake at 
their referral site with a the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], (2) each referred patient/ family with complete an assessment 
to determine eligibility for the study, (3) each referred patient/family will give study staff consent 
to participate in the study, (4) the participants will complete baseline assessment , and (5) the 
participants will complete the PARS assessment   
Once a participant/family gives consent to enroll in the study, they will be provided with a unique 
ID number and this ID number will be connected to their identifiable data (access to identifiable 
data will be limited). The clinical intake can happen befo re or after consent is received, but the 
baseline assessment and PARS assessment must be completed after the patient gives consent 
to enroll in the study. Once all four steps of enrollment (consent, clinical intake, baseline 
assessment, and PARS) are compl eted, the participant/family will be randomized.  
Anticipated participants  were  divided into 16 strata based on the 16 combinations of 4 regions 
([LOCATION_011], Miami, Baltimore, Seattle), 2 languages (English, Spanish), and 2 age groups (7 -12, 
13-18). For each strata, a randomized list of conditions (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led treatment versus guided 
online treatment) was generated at Sealed Envelope using random blocks of size 4. Random 
blocks help maintain equally sized treatment groups while also reducing bias in random 
assignment by [CONTACT_332399] (deliberately or not) p redict the next 
condition. Random assignment lists have been archived with the Data Management team and 
with [CONTACT_332463].  
Randomization assignments are made centrally at the FIU data coordination site. Once a 
participating family’s baseline assessments are completed (see Measures), the randomization 
assignment software is programmed to send an automated push notification revealing their 
assigned condition simultaneously to the FIU data management team (for data recording 
purposes) and to the research coordinators and clinical team at the participant’s site (to o rient 
the family to their assigned treatment condition).

Because of the nature of the intervention, we will not be able to mask  study participants, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] , and RAs  from treatment assignment . However, researc h staff who will be 
administering the PARS assessment  will be masked  to study condition . 
7.[ADDRESS_411011] -report questionnaires, ratings of independent evaluators 
masked to each family’s treatment condition, and administrative logs. To maximize 
generalizab ility and rigor while minimizing patient and clinic burdens, priority has been placed 
on supported measures that are brief and available free -of-cost in the public domain. Moreover, 
consistent with growing recognition that supported clinical interventions are intended to impact a 
range of domains of functioning (rather than a single narrow domain),114,[ADDRESS_411012] data from both caregivers and youth across 
assessment points for all families, to minimize participant burdens and maximize engagement, 
only caregiver -reports are required to randomize children ages 7 -12 years, a nd only youth self -
reports are required to randomize adolescents ages 13 -18 years. Furthermore, 7 -year-old 
participants are not to be administered self -report questionnaires, due to concerns about the 
reliability and validity of self -reports of anxiety in children this age voiced by [CONTACT_20767]’s patient 
and family advisory council and scientific advisory panel, and corroborated by [CONTACT_332400]. 116–118 Such youth should be administered self -report forms at later assessment points 
if they turn 8 during the trial. In addition, although youth self -reports of primary and secondary 
clinical outcomes are to be administered to all youth > 8 years, a subset of youth self -report 
variables will only be administered to youth > 13 years given: (a) recommendations from the 
trial’s patient and family advisory council and the scientific advisory panel to minimize the 
assessment burdens outside of clinical outcomes for participating children < 12 years, and (b) 
concerns from these advisory groups about younger children’s abilities to accurately self -report 
on some of these variables (e.g., their own treatment histories, family treatment barriers; details 
below).

 Measures included in the Kids FACE FEARS trial can be sorted into four groups: (i) Primary 
Clinical Outcomes. (ii) Secondary Clinical Outcomes; (iii) Treatment Variables; and (iv) Study 
Covariates, Predictors and Other Included Measures.  
7.6.1  Primary clinical outcomes.  Primary clinical outcomes assessed in the Kids FACE 
FEARS trial focused on anxiety symptoms, anxiety -related impairment, treatment responder 
status, anxiety remission status, and patient -centered outcomes focused on perceived 
effectiveness and treatment sa tisfaction. Table 3 presents a summary of the primary clinical 
outcomes assessed, which are described in detail below.

 Anxiety symptoms . The PROMIS Pediatric Short Form -Anxiety Scale (8a v2.0)  is being used to 
assess youth anxiety severity across time. Caregiver -reports will be collected via the parent -
proxy form, and youth self -reports will be collected via the pediatric form for youth ages > 8 
years. Across psychometric studies, the measure has exhibited strong reliability, structure, and 
validity in the measurement of youth anxiety severity.72–75 The PROMIS Pediatric Short Form -
Anxiety Scale is also free, brief (8 items), and publicly accessible, which minimizes patient and 
clinic burdens and positions the measure for use in under -resourced settings and other typi[INVESTIGATOR_332261].72 Raw total scores are converted to T -scores normed for age and sex.  
Anxiety -related impairment . The Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS )119 is a measure 
of life interference and impairment associated with youth anxiety problems. Items are each rated 
on a five -point Likert -style scale (0= not at all, 4 = a great deal), and are summed to generate a 
total interference score. Parent and youth > [ADDRESS_411013] accounts of caregiver -reported and youth self -reported anxiety -related life impairment. 
The parent form consists of 16 items (scoring range: 0 -64) and the youth form consists of 9 
items (scoring  range: 0 -36) The CALIS parent and youth forms have exhibited strong 
psychometric properties in previous research.119,120 
Treatment responder status . The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS )[ADDRESS_411014] followed by [CONTACT_332401] a six -point (0 -5) scale. Six of the global items are summed to generate a PARS Total Score 
(range: 0 -30). PARS Total Score reductions of 35% or more from baseline to p osttreatment are 
interpreted as reflecting “ PARS Treatment Response .”121 For the present study, Independent 
Evaluators (IEs) masked to treatment condition conducted PARS interviews at baseline and at 
posttreatment with caregivers and youths together and then generated scores based on the 
pooled information.  
Primary patient -centered outcomes . To assess Caregiver -Perceived Effectiveness , caregivers 
will be asked on a 7 -point scale at midtreatment and again at posttreatment “How effective do 
you think the program [has been/was] in treating your child's anxiety?” [0= very ineffective ; 
3=somewhat effective ; 6=very effective ]. In addition, caregivers and youth  > 8 years will 
complete a patient -adapted version of the Clinical Global Impression -Improvement Scale  (CGI -
I)122 to characterize their judgement of treatment -related improvement, relative to the child’s 
baseline presentation. Consistent with the standard version of the CGI -I, scores of 1 (“ very 
much improved ”) or 2 (“ much improved ”) will be interpreted as reflecting “ Caregiver -Perceived 
Treatment Response ” (for caregiver -report) or “ Youth -Perceived Treatment Response ” (for 
40 
 youth self -report). The caregiver - and youth -report versions of the CGI -I will be administered at 
midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow -up. 
To assess Treatment Satisfaction , caregivers and youth > 8 years will be administered a 
Satisfaction Scale  that has them rate three items along 0 -3 rating scales at midtreatment and 
again at posttreatment: “Overall, how satisfied [have you been/were you] with the services that 
[your family/you] received?” [0= quite dissatisfied ; 3=very satisfied ]; “Would you recommend this 
program to a friend if they [had a child with/had] anxiety?” [0= no, definitely not ; 3=yes, 
definitely ]; and “How pleased [have you been/w ere you] with how this program has helped [your 
child/you] with anxiety” [0= quite displeased ; 3=very pleased ]. These three items will be 
averaged for each informant to generate Caregiver Total Satisfaction Scores and Youth Total 
Satisfaction Scores. For dichotomous interpretation, mean scores >2 will be interpreted as 
“Satisfied” and mean scores <2 will be interpreted as “Dissatisfied.”  
7.6.2  Secondary clinical outcomes . Secondary clinical outcomes assessed in the Kids 
FACE FEARS trial focus on broader youth psychopathology (i.e., internalizing problems, 
externalizing problems, and attention problems), youth sleep difficulties, caregiver internalizing 
symptoms (i.e., depre ssion symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress symptoms), and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332262]. Table 4 presents a summary of the Secondary Clinical 
Outcomes assessed, which are described in detail below.

[ADDRESS_411016]  (PSC -17)76 is a brief 
questionnaire developed to identify child and adolescent emotional and behavioral challenges in 
pediatric and primary care settings. The measure has exhibited strong validity and reliability in 
psychometric analyses across diverse samples of yo uth.123–125 PSC-17 subscales separately 
assess internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and attention problems. For the present 
study, caregivers and youth > 8 years will complete separate PSC reports, and all three 
subscales will be included.  
Youth sleep difficulties.  Caregivers will be asked to rate on a 5 -point scale the frequency with 
which the following statement applies to their child: “I n the past 7 days, my child has been 
having sleep -related difficulties (for example, difficulty falling asleep or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_332265]) ” [0=never ; 2=sometimes ; 4=always ]. Youth > 8 years will be similarly asked to rate on a 
5-point scale the frequency with which the following statement applies to them: “I n the past [ADDRESS_411017] been having sleep -related difficulties (for example, difficulty falling asleep or 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_52036]) ” [0=never ; 2=sometimes ; 4=always ]. 
Caregiver internalizing symptoms . The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS -21)126,127 
is an adult self -report of negative emotional states that has demonstrated strong psychometric 
properties.127,128 Respondents rate their experiences across 21 items using a 4 -point 
severity/frequency scale ranging from 0 ( never ) to 3 ( always ). DASS -[ADDRESS_411018] -Perceived Effectiveness , 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332266] a 7 -point scale at posttreatment: “How effective do you think the 
program was for treating this child?” [0= very ineffective ; 3=somewhat effective ; 6=very

relative to the child’s baseline presentation. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332268] a CGI -I at 
posttreatment.  
7.6.3  Treatment variables . Treatment variables assessed in the Kids FACE FEARS trial 
focus on treatment preferences and expectancies, the scope and content of each session and 
check -in call, treatment fit and flexibility, treatment engagement and barriers, and therapeutic 
alliance. Table 5 presents a summary of the treatment variables assessed, which are described 
in detail below.

 Treatment preferences and expectancies . Prior to randomization, caregivers and youth > [ADDRESS_411019] -Led 
CBT (coded: 0) or Guided Online CBT (coded: 2), or whether they have no preference between 
the two conditions (coded: 1) [ Treatment Preference ]. Respondents will also rate each of the 
two treatments on Anticipated Treatment Comfort , Anticipated Treatment Comprehension 
Difficulties , and Anticipated Treatment Scheduling Difficulties  on 0-[ADDRESS_411020]’s early treatment expectations for each family. 
Specifically, after the first clinical encounter with an assigned family (i.e., first session for 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT families; first check -in call for Guided Online CBT  families), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332272] . This form has 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332273] a scale from 0 ( very 
ineffective ) to 6 ( very effective ): “Think ing about the treatment course ahead, how effective do 
you think the child’s assigned treatment condition will be in treating this child’s anxiety?” 
(anticipated treatment effectiveness ). To measure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s Anticipated Effectiveness of the 
Non-Assigned Treatment , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332274]: “If instead of [Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT/Guided Online CBT], 
this family had been assigned to Guided Online CBT/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT], how effectiv e do you 
think that treatment would be in treating this child’s anxiety?” ( Anticipated Effectiveness of Non -
Assigned Treatment ). 
The Early Treatment Expectations Form will also assess therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ early expectations about 
treatment engagement for each family. Specifically, after their first clinical encounter with an 
assigned family , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332275], along a scale from 0 
(to a small extent ) to 4 ( to a very great extent ): “Thinking about the treatment course ahead, to 
what extent do you expect this child will actively participate in their assigned course of 
treatment?” ( Anticipated  Child Parti cipatory Engagement ); and “Thinking about the treatment 
course ahead, to what extent do you expect this child’s caregiver(s) will actively participate in 
their assigned course of treatment?” ( Anticipated  Caregiver Participatory Engagement ). 
Furthermore, the Early Treatment Expectations Form also assesses therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ early 
expectations about treatment alliance for each family. Specifically, after their first clinical 
encounter with an assigned family , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332275], 
along a scale from 0 ( never ) to 6 ( always ): “Across treatment, I think this child and I will work 
well together” ( Anticipated Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Child Collaboration ); and “Across treatment, I think this 
child’s caregiver(s) and I will work well together” ( Anticipated  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Caregiver 
Collaboration ). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332276] ( Anticipated Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Child Bond ); the extent to which 
they predict the child will enjoy working with them ( Anticipated Child -Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332277] ); the extent 
[ADDRESS_411021] they will enjoy working with the child’s caregiver(s) ( Anticipated Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -
Caregiver Bond ); and the extent to which they predict the child’s caregiver(s) will enjoy working 
with them ( Anticipated Caregiver Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332277] ). 
Finally, the Early Treatment Expectations Form will be used to assess Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332269] -Specific 
Self-Efficacy  with regard to implementing the assigned treatment. Specifically, after their first 
encounter with a family, depending on the family’s treatment assignment, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332278] [Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT/Guided 
Online CBT], along a 0 ( very limited ) to 4 ( very high ) scale.  
Scope and content of treatment sessions and check -in calls . After each treatment session (for 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT cases) or check -in call session (for Guided Online CBT cases), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332279] a Session Summary Form that was developed for the present study. On this form, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332280] (e.g., youth, caregiver, other), the 
language in which the session was held (English, Spanish, or both), whether the session began 
on time (and  if not, how late it began), the length of the session, and the format of the session 
(e.g., in -office, phone, videoconference). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332281], from a list of options: 
psychoed ucation; detective/realistic thinking; fear hierarchies; future exposure practice; in - 
session exposure practice; rewards and reinforcement; parenting issues related to youth 
anxiety; additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (e.g., problem -solving, social skills, assertiv eness, relaxation 
techniques); non -CBT strategies (e.g., interpreting the meaning of symptoms, interpreting the 
meaning of child’s play or artwork); discussion of issues not directly related to anxiety (e.g., 
major family transitions, conflicts other than co-occurring non -anxiety problems); review of 
previous homework; assignment of new homework; and/or addressing barriers to 
treatment/homework. For Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT cases, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332282](s) in the protocol that were covere d in that session.  
Treatment fit and flexibility . As part of the Session Summary Form completed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_332283] (for Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT cases) or check -in call session (for Guided 
Online CBT cases), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332284] a scale from 0 (not at all ) to 6 ( extensively ): “To what extent was the content covered this 
[session/check -in call] a fit to this child’s clinical presentation and individual needs?” To assess 
needs for treatment flexibi lity, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332285] a scale from 0 (not at all ) to 6 ( extensively ): “How 
much did you need to tailor or adapt the content or structure of this session because of the 
child’s clinical presentation and individual needs?” Moreover, as part of the Session Summary 
Form , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332286](s) they may have covered content outside of the 
treatment protocol in the session they just held from a list of options (if relevant): (a) had to 
address a clinical emergency that made them concerned about immediate safe ty, (b) needed to 
48 
 address a topic of the week that did not directly relate to the focus of the treatment protocol 
(e.g., family conflict, school trouble), (c) had to address a co -occurring/co -presenting issue other 
than child anxiety (e.g., ADHD, medical problem), (d) neede d to engage in an alliance -building 
activity, (e) needed to address treatment resistance, (f) other (describe).  
Treatment engagement and barriers.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332287]. These 
data will be used to characterize Treatment Attendance  and Homework Engagement . Treatment 
Completion  is defined for Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT as attending 10 treatment sessions, and for 
Guided Online CBT Care as attending 4 support calls. For Guid ed Online CBT families, 
administrative backend data will also be collected from the central server to further assess 
user/usage analytics.   
To assess session -by-session participatory engagement, as part of the Session Summary Form 
completed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_332288] (for Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Led CBT cases) or 
check -in call session (for Guided Online CBT cases), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332289] a scale from 0 (not at all ) to 6 ( extensively ): “To what 
extent did you feel that this child was engaged in today’s [session/check -in call]. For example, 
did the child appear motivated and committe d to improving, and was the child actively 
participating in the [session/call]” ( Child Participatory Engagement ). When appropriate, a 
parallel item will be asked of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332290]’s engagement in that session 
(Caregiver Participatory Engagement ). At posttreatment, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332291].  
To assess Comprehension Difficulties , caregivers and youth > 13 years across both conditions 
will be asked at midtreatment and again at posttreatment “How hard has the intervention been 
for [your family/you] to understand?” [0= never hard ; 3=sometimes hard ; 6=very hard ]. To 
assess Difficulties Making Time for Treatment caregivers and youth > 13 years will be asked at 
midtreatment and again at posttreatment “How hard has it been for [your family/you] to [make 
your schedule work for treatment sessions/find time to work on and complete the computer -
based treatment modul es online]?” [0= never a problem ; 3=sometimes a problem ; 6=often a 
problem ].  To assess Treatment Discomfort , caregivers and youth > 13 years will be asked at 
midtreatment and again at posttreatment “How comfortable [has your family/have you] felt when 
[attending treatment sessions/completing the computer -based treatment modules online]?” 
[0=very comfortable ; 3=sometimes comfortable ; 6=very uncomfortable ].   
The Technological Experiences And Reactions Scale (TEARS )[ADDRESS_411022] -Led CBT participants (most of 
which completed sessions via telehealth) and Guided Online CBT participants will use the 
TEARS to rate the extent to which technology issues and time spent addressing technology -
related issues took away from the quality of the intervention, frustrated them, and/or interfered 
with treatment understanding. For families in either condition, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332292] -report TEARS at the conclusion of each session/check -in call and again at 
posttreatment. In additio n to the TEARS, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332293], and the devices they were using.  
Therapeutic alliance . A caregiver  Perceptions of Therapeutic Alliance  Scale  will aske caregivers 
at midtreatment and again at posttreatment to respond  to the following items, along a scale from 
0 (never ) to 6 ( always ): “I think the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752] I [work/worked] well together to help with my 
child’s anxiety” ( Caregiver -Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332294] ); “I feel like I [like/liked] the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]” 
(Caregiver -Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332277] ); “I feel like the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] [likes/liked] me” ( Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -Caregiver

d  Measure administered again to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332302] . Caregivers and youth > 11 years will provide data on caregiver 
and youth age, gender, race, ethnicity, nativity (U.S. - or foreign -born), family and household 
living structure, languages spoken, and language(s) preference, among a number of other 
demographic pi[INVESTIGATOR_332303] n. Caregivers will also provide information on their child’s 
grade level, as well as their own highest level of education and literacy comfort. Families will 
be classified as experiencing baseline resource ins ecurity  if the caregiver indicates at 
baseline that the family experienced any of the following circumstances over the prior 12 
months: (a) unhoused or living in a shelter; (b) unable to pay the rent or mortgage on time; 
(c) the food they purchased did not last a nd they did not have money to get more; (d) there 
was concern their food would run out before they got money to buy more; and/or (e) the gas 
or electric company threatened to shut off or refuse gas or electricity to their residence for 
not paying bi lls. 
Youth health and education . Caregivers will provide information on the child’s 
developmental history, medical history, previously diagnosed mental health problems, 
mental health treatment history, academic performance and attendance, and school 
accommodations.  
Adverse childhood experiences . The Center for Youth Wellness (CYW) Adverse Childhood 
Experiences Questionnaire (CYW ACE -Q)[ADDRESS_411025] of 19 specific 
adversities, caregivers and youth > [ADDRESS_411026] includes 10 items from the original conceptualization of adverse 
childhood experiences (e.g., phy sical, emotion, and sexual abuse; physical and emotional 
neglect; household dysfunction; livi ng with family members who misuse substances; living 
with family members with mental illness), as well as a broadened set of 9 additional 
experiences that can similarly cause prolonged stress that were not included in the original 
ACES conceptualization (e .g., death of a caregiver, exposure to neighborhood violence; 
immigration - or deportation -related separation from caregiver; identity -based discrimination; 
abuse or threats from a romantic partner). Two more additional items were also added to 
assess wheth er the child had directly experienced a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, 
tornado, wildfire, hurricane) or a manmade disaster (e.g., terrorist attack, mass shooting, 
plane crash, industrial fire/explosion, bridge collapse). Respondents will review the li st of 
items, tally the number of these experiences that the child has endured, and report that total 
number. Accordingly, the quantity of experienced ACES will be assessed, but information 
will not be collected for the research record that clarifies which specific ACES were 
experienced by [CONTACT_2252]. Per guidelines for the CYW ACE -Q, scores between 1 and 3 
indicate “moderate exposure” to ACES and scores > 4 are considered “high” and indicate 
“considerable exposure” to ACES.

 Experiences with discrimination . The Everyday Discrimination Scale -Short Version (EDS)[ADDRESS_411027] as if 
they are not sma rt, and being threatened or harassed. The frequency of each item is rated 
on a scale ranging from 0 ( never ) to 5 ( almost everyday ). For responses > 2, follow -up 
questions ask respondents to indicate what they think is the main reason for these 
experiences (e.g., their ancestry, gender, race, age, religion, weight, sexual orientation, 
education or income level). The scale has been used extensively in the mental health field.  
Higher scores represent more incidences of everyday discrimination as compared to l ower 
scores.  
Mental health stigma . The Parental Attitudes Toward Psychological Services Inventory  
(PATPSI)[ADDRESS_411028] emotional 
or behavioral health challenges or who seek psychological services. Using a scale ranging 
from 0 (strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ), respondents will rate their level of 
agreement with eight items (e.g., “I would not want others to know if my child had a 
psychological or behavioral problem”; “Having been mentally ill carries with it feelings of 
shame”). The measure has exhibited strong psychometric properties, including a sound 
factor structure and great reliability and validity.134 
Caregiver beliefs about youth anxiety and overprotection . The Parental Attitudes, Beliefs, 
and Understanding of Anxiety  (PABUA) – Overprotection Scale135 is a supported self -report 
measure that evaluates caregiver attitudes and beliefs about their child’s anxiety, and the 
extent to which they believe they must protect their child from anxiety and distress. Items 
assess caregiver beliefs about appropriate levels of autonomy -granting, whether caregivers 
believe they should let thei r anxious child avoid anxiety -provoking situations, and issues of 
general enmeshment in the caregiver -child relationship. Psychometric research has found 
the measure and scale to exhibit strong convergent validity, divergent validity, and internal 
consiste ncy.135   
Technological literacy.  Caregiver and youth technological literacy  at baseline will be 
assessed via the Technological Ease and Computer Habits Inventory (TECHI)136 which 
consists of 17 items assessing the extent/frequency of technological usage in everyday life, 
as well as competency and patience with technology. Items are rated on 0 -5 scales, and the 
TECHI Total Score ranges from 0 -85 (with higher scores indicating  greater technological 
usage, competency, and patience). The TECHI has demonstrated strong psychometric

Openness to technology -based supports . The Beliefs and Attitudes about Technology as a 
Child Health Resource  (BATCH -R)137 is a brief supported self -report that assesses caregiver 
attitudes (e.g., comfort, trust) toward technology’s role in mental health supports and 
services, parenting information and resources, and professional guidance. The Openness to 
Technology -Based Men tal Health Supports and Treatment scale has caregivers rate  from 0 
(strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) their level of agreement with eight items (e.g., 
“Online computer -based mental health programs can be helpful for treating childhood 
anxiety”; “I a m open to seeking out information online about my child’s health and 
development”; “I trust the information I receive online about parenting”). The measure has 
exhibited strong psychometric properties, including a sound factor structure and great 
reliabili ty and validity.[ADDRESS_411030] evidence -based treatments . The Evidence -Based Practice 
Attitudes Scale  (EBPAS )[ADDRESS_411031]: (a) would adopt a new practice if it made sense and was used by 
[CONTACT_332402] ( Appeal  subscale); (b) would adopt a new practice if it was required by 
[CONTACT_332403] ( Requirements  subscale), (c) is open to trying new treatments ( Openness  
subscale), and (d) believes research -based interventions are not clinically useful 
(Divergence  subscale ). Respondents rate their agreement with items on a scale from 0 ( not 
at all ) to 4 (to a great extent ), resulting in four subscale scores and an EBPAS Total Score 
reflecting overall positive disposition toward adopting evidence -based treatments and 
protocols. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332305], and again 
after completing training.  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332306] . The Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332307] (TBES )[ADDRESS_411032] self -report questionnaire that measures negative attitudes 
they may hold about exposure therapy (e.g., “Compared to other psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], exposure 
therapy leads to higher dropout rates”). Respondents rate their agreement with each of 21 
beliefs about exposure therapy along a 5 -point scale (0= disagree strongly ; 4=agree 
strongly ). Items are summed, resulting in a TBES Total Score (range: 0 -84), with higher 
scores reflecting more negative views of exposure therapy. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332308].  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411033]  was created 
to assess therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ familiarity with basic research findings about child anxiety (e.g., fear is 
a natural emotion; physical sensations of anxiety cannot harm a child; differences between 
fear and anxiety) and its evidence -based treatment (e. g., the three -component model of 
CBT; the value of exposures). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332309].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332310] -efficacy . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332311] -Efficacy Scale -CBT for 
Anxiety in Youth  (TSES -CAY),[ADDRESS_411034] perceptions of their abilities treating anxiety in children and adolescents. 
TSES -CAY factor analysis has identified a three -factor structure: (a) CBT/Anxiety -Specific 
Self-Efficacy  (which measures perceived ability to conceptualize client problems using the 
CBT model, maintain the structure of CBT, teach CBT skills, putting anxious patients in 
anxiety -provoking situations, and instruct patients to practice skills outside of session) ; (b) 
Common Factors Self -Efficacy  (which  measures perceived ability to build therapeutic 
alliance, empathize with children/families, etc); and (c) Patient Responsivity Self -Efficacy 
(which measures perceived ability to adapt to patient/family needs, work collaboratively with 
patients/families, and address treatment barriers as they arise). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332312] -CAY prior to completing their training. Af ter completing their 
training, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332313] -CAY CBT/Anxiety -Specific Self -Efficacy

Organizational climate of treatment setting . The [LOCATION_007] Christian Association Organizational 
Readiness for Change  scale  (TCU ORC )[ADDRESS_411035] the 
overall success of treatment implementation. Prior to training and onboarding for the trial, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], supe rvisors, administrative directors, and staff across the clinics participating in 
the trial will complete the TCU ORC subscales that assess Adequacy of Resources 
(including Offices, Staffing, Training, Equipment, Internet, and Supervision) and 
Organizationa l Climate (including Mission, Cohesion, Autonomy, Communication, Stress, 
and Change). The TCU ORC has exhibited strong psychometric properties, and observed 
ORC subscale scores can be compared for interpretation against 25th percentile scores, 50th 
percentile scores, and 75th percentile scores reported from national data.[ADDRESS_411036] practices for promoting quality implementation of evidence -based treatment,107–110 a

 multi -component strategy is to be used that involves training workshops for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332314], followed by [CONTACT_332404][INVESTIGATOR_332315]. The same therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332316].  
7.7.1 Training workshop . Prior to treating patients on the Kids FACE FEARS trial, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332317] -day (8 hour) training or two half -day (4 -
hour) trainings. These trainings will be led by [CONTACT_332405], Fidelity and 
Sustainability C ore (e.g., [CONTACT_332464][INVESTIGATOR_35807], [CONTACT_332465], [CONTACT_332466], [CONTACT_332467], [CONTACT_332468], and Annie Dantowitz, LICSW). Those attending these trainings 
should be natural providers and supervisors in the pediatric health s ettings participating in 
the trial (i.e., clinical staff not employed by [CONTACT_332406]). Trainings can be provided in -person or on Zoom. All clinicians and 
supervisors will be provided with a full set of C ool Kids treatment workbooks prior to the start 
of the training. Trainings will incorporate didactic components and active teaching 
approaches (e.g., live role -plays, demonstrations of core skills, small break -out groups, 
interactive video presentations, o pportunities for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332318]).  
Trainings are to start with an introduction to the trial, followed by: (a) overviews of the core 
principles of CBT for youth anxiety, (b) detailed, step -by-step instructions in how to deliver 
the core skills in the Cool Kids and Chilled therapy protocols ( e.g., psychoeducation, 
cognitive restructuring, exposure, and parenting anxious behaviors), and (c) additional 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_332319], social skills building, and progressive muscle 
relaxation. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332320], factors that maintain youth anxiety, and evidence -based strategies for offsetting 
these factors. Trainings will also emphasize the importance of caregiver involvement in 
treatment (as appropriate, and when feasib le), between -session practice, and treatment 
fidelity within flexibility.69,111 Moreover, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332321], such as lack of between -session practice or poor 
treatment attendance, and how to problem -solve and support families through various 
challenges that ca n emerge during treatment.  
These trainings will also include a demonstration of the guided online programs (including 
illustrative video clips and how to log in and access the online materials) and will incorporate 
direct instruction on how to conduct check -in calls for the guided o nline treatment condition. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332322] a check -in call conversation

[ADDRESS_411037] who scores <80% on the post -training knowledge quiz will receive 
individualized follow -up training and support, and will then be retested with an a lternate form 
of the knowledge quiz, and will be required to meet the 80% training criterion prior to treating 
patients in the study.  
7.7.[ADDRESS_411038] training slides. 
A guided refresher course was created and is included on the website that includes audio 
and video training demonstration videos and interactive training activities.  
7.7.3 Consultation and support . Providers (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332315]) at the study 
performance sites will participate in regularly held group consultation videoconferencing 
calls led by [CONTACT_332407]. These consultation calls will be held 
in addition to any routine supervision that may be naturally afforded to providers in their local 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332323].   
All participants who attend a training workshop will be assigned to a recurring consultation 
call group. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332324] (i.e., twice monthly). These calls 
are designed to support therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332325], to prevent the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332326], and to afford 
education and scaffolding to providers. Approximately 4 -6 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332327]. The remote format enables consultation call groups to contain a mix of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332328]. C alls will each be one hour, and will be used 
to clarify and role -play therapy skills, to answer any questions about the two treatment 
formats, and to support therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332329]. Site supervisors will 
also participate in a separate , once -monthly supervisor group consultation call, also led by 
[CONTACT_332408].  
Each consultation call will be structured to formally review a specific rotating skill or topic, 
including: psychoeducation, fear hierarchies and exposures, cognitive strategies, cultural 
considerations, parenting factors, check -in calls, homework complian ce, general copi[INVESTIGATOR_25146], treatment flexibility, COVID -related anxiety, school anxiety, developmental 
considerations, and technology -related issues. Each call will also include a “Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332330],” in which a rotating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332331] y to receive more 
individualized attention and in -depth consultation about one of their patients. These

7.[ADDRESS_411040] participants if 
they were to become upset. If a participant becomes upset during the process of being 
interviewed and/or while completing assessment measures with an RA (Research  
Assistant), the RA will ask if the participant/ family would like to check -in with their doctor or 
one of the clinicians with behaviora l health training at the site.  Participants will also be 
provided with the phone numbers of their site research staff wh o they can contact [CONTACT_332409]. The research staff will connect 
them with an available clinician in these situations.  The study facility will be appropriate to 
children, as these facilities will be pediatric healthcare sites. We will make sure that all 
psycho -educational materials, treatment plans are written in a straightforward manner, at the 
appropriate literacy level.  We will use translators/language line as needed to further ensure 
guardian s fully unders tand study procedures and communicate concerns about their child's 
care.  
As all site staff and the investigators are mandated reporters, families will be informed that 
any disclosure of abuse, risk to a child or elder will need to be reported to the appropriate 
state protection agency. Endorsement of suicidality, risk to self or others will require 
emergency evaluation for safety and disposition by [CONTACT_332410] a 
contact [CONTACT_332411] . RAs will also contact [CONTACT_332412] D SMB . 
7.8.1 Safety policy  
The study intervention does not pose an additional risk to pregnant women and so pregnant 
women ( guardian s or youth participants) can be enrolled in the study.

 clinical determination.  The team will then report this to the study PIs to discuss if the child 
should be removed from the study . 
Research assistant  concern for patient mental health severity and/or safety:  
If the PROMIS  Short Form for Anxiety shows  an increase of 5 points on the T -score metric  
at an assessment point  (or the equivalent of 0.[ADDRESS_411041] deviation which is a clinically 
meaningful difference)  (Norman, Sloan, & Wyrwich, 2003) , the local RA will notify the 
participant’s therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] . Their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332337] a different model of care or 
level of treatment.  
If the DASS -21 completed by [CONTACT_332390] s shows severe or extremely severe in any dimension 
of the assessment (depression, anxiety, stress)  or if the guardian marks a score of 2 or 3 on 
item 21 (“I feel that life is meaningless”) at an assessment point, the RA will notify the 
family’s therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]  (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) . Their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332338]-being of the child and guardian . The clinical team will again di scuss with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_332339].  
Examples of situations where family/ child may need to be removed from the study include: 
emergence of a psychotic disorder, need for prolonged residential placement, youth 
detention, suicidal behavior, parental / guardian  psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Clinical decision 
making will be the first principle for addressing family treatment needs for any worsening 
mental health severity, safety a nd functioning.  
REDCap  will automatically send an email to the local RA at each site whenever a score is 
flagged  on either measures .  
Telehealth and Zoom Videoconferencing  
In order to protect patients during pandemics, such as COVID -19, patients and participants 
will have to option to complete study visits via Zoom Video Communications software. This  
will be provided as an option for study visits/ procedures including consent procedures, 
PARS baseline assessments, and technical orientation . Zoom Video Communications is a 
remote conferencing services company that provides remote conferencing services, that 
combines video conferencing, screen sharing services, online meetings, chat, and mobile 
collaboration, with both audio and video communica tion options. Participants can use zoom 
via their phone, computer, or tablet/Ipad. Study visits will not be recorded.  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
61 
 If the participant’s preference is for videoconference, the RA will send the participant a link 
to a Zoom meeting, along with a link to the Zoom Privacy Policy. The RA will also send 
instructions on how to use Zoom, including guidance on best practices for  sharing as little 
personal information with Zoom as possible. These best practices will be: (1) suggesting 
that the participant only enter their first name [CONTACT_332460], and (2) if they don’t 
want to give their email, that they should feel f ree to use 
[EMAIL_6480]<mailto:[EMAIL_6480]> as their email address. The link to join 
the Zoom meeting with only be accessible by [CONTACT_332413]. The RA will complete the video conference in a private roo m, and the meeting 
will not be recorded. If a participant is not comfortable with using the Zoom software, they 
will always have the option to call -in to the meeting via phone, or meet in -person.  
7.8.2 Removal of Participants . All instances of study dropout will be documented  using a 
Premature Termination form on  REDCap  including the reason for dropout, who decided that 
the participant would drop out (i.e., parent or guardian, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], study staff, adolescent 
patient), and whether the dropout resulted from burden of intervention, study assessment, or 
both. Withdrawn pa rticipants will be encouraged to continue to participate in study 
assessments throughout the 1-year follow -up period in order to op timize the intention -to-
treat assessment design. Participants may withdraw voluntarily at any time for any reason.  
There are two types of participant withdrawal: “treatment withdrawal” and “study withdrawal.”   
1. Treatment withdrawal  is when a participant drops out of treatment (either because 
they are no longer interested or because a clinician or study investigator feels that 
treatment is no longer appropriate), but still provides the research team with 
posttreatment data by [CONTACT_332414] 52.    
2. Study withdrawal  is when a participant (or a provider on behalf of the participant) 
explicitly communicates that they are no longer interested in being a part of the study 
at all – including future assessments and compensation. Cases of “treatment 
withdrawal” are not auto matically considered to be “study withdrawal” unless the 
participant specifically states that they never want to be contact[CONTACT_332415], or if a clinician or study investigator deems that any future contact [CONTACT_332416].    
Participants  may be removed if:  
• If the participant’s provider or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332340]’s health or wellbeing resulting in increasing severity of illness that is 
clinical assessed as such by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541]/ provider team. Such cases will be 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
62 
 assessed clinically, and an appropriate treatment plan will be determined and then 
discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_332341].  
• If there is an increase in the participant’s anxiety levels based on the PROMIS 
Pediatric Short Form for Anxiety and or other worsening of mental health status that 
leads to change in the treatment plan/ level of care determination by [CONTACT_332417].  
• If the participant becomes suicidal and presents with clinically determined safety risk 
to self or others.  
If staff or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332342], they will be 
asked to complete [ADDRESS_411042]:  
(1) They will continuously assess protection of data and participant confidentiality. If any 
breach in the protection of participant data is identified or breach of confidentiality, it 
will be reported as an adverse event to the lead site and be assessed t o determine if 
the event relates to the study and requires any protocol changes or study -wide 
action to ensure the protection of patient data.  
(2) They will meet with site PIs on a monthly basis to review study progress and elicit 
any concerns. They will be charged with minimizing any risk involved with 
participation, monitoring the risks and benefits during implementation of the project 
on a tim ely basis, and ensuring that the research is conducted according to high 
scientific and ethical standards.  
The principal investigators will also report the findings to the PCORI program staff. PCORI 
will be informed of any actions taken by [CONTACT_3016] a result of their continuing review.  
In addition, a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will meet twice annually to 
provide independent oversight of data management and integrity, and participant safety.  
Data Safety and Monitoring Board Co -Chairs:  Martha Tompson, PhD is Associate 
Professor of Psychology at [LOCATION_011] University and Director of the Family Development and 
Treatment Program; she is a renowned expert in the family -based treatment of pediatric 
mood and anxiety problems, and has extensive exp erience leading randomized clinical 
trials. Shannon Pruden, PhD is Professor  of Psychology at [LOCATION_012] International University 
and a leading expert on child development and individual differences. The Co -Chairs will 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411043], progress, and efficacy, and make recommendations for modifications if 
needed.  
7.8.4 Adverse Events Definition and Reporting . Potential Adverse events are defined as 
potential physical, emotional, legal or financial risk. We do not foresee any physical, legal, or 
financial risk for any of the study participants.  
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
Adverse Event (AE)  is any abnormal or harmful behaviors, increasing severity of symptoms 
that are identified by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541], suicidal behaviors or attempts, breach in the protection of 
participant data or breach of confidentiality whether or not considered related to the 
participants’  participation in the research.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(5) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant’s  health 
and well -being and requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], other mental health or medical 
stabilization, child protection services or other higher level of care.  
Life-threatening  means that the event places the  participant  at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  
of the following criteria:  
• is unexpected ; AND  
• is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
• suggests that the research places participants  or others at a greater risk  of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459].  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
64 
 Unexpected means the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
either:  
• the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures 
involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, 
and the current IRB -approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
• the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of 
the participant (s) experiencing the adverse event and the participant’s predisposing 
risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
7.8.5 Adverse Event Reporting Plan  
 
Reporting Adverse Events to IRB:  
If adverse events arise;  
1. Study staff will inform their site PI [INVESTIGATOR_332343] (provided by [CONTACT_332418]).  
2. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_332344] a serious 
adverse event or an unanticipated problem, or only meets the criteria of an adverse 
event.  
3. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_332345]'s IRB per their institution’s 
guidelines for reporting.  
At BMC, adverse events that are not unanticipated problems will be reported at the time of 
continuing review by [CONTACT_1201]. No other adverse events/serious adverse events are 
anticipated — any that arise and meet the definition of an unanticipated problem will be 
reported to the IRB within two business days of learni ng of the event if it is life -threatening. 
Other unanticipated problems will be reported within 7 days.  
 
Reporting Adverse Event to Lead Site (BMC):  
All adverse events must be reported to the lead site using an adverse event form.  
For all adverse events,

 1. The adverse event form and log should be emailed to the study PIs (Drs. Comer  and 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_35807]) and the lead site manager at least 2 days  prior to the biweekly  study PIs 
meeting (which will include all site PIs).  
2. Site PIs must disclose adverse events at the biweekly  meeting for the purposes of 
informing all site PIs and discussing any potential trends that need to be addressed 
across the study.  
3. The lead site will review all adverse events on a monthly basis to identify if any 
adverse event needs to be re -defined as a serious adverse event or unanticipated 
problem based on study -wide data and assess if any actions need to be taken as a 
result.  
If the event meets the definition of a serious adverse event , an adverse event form should 
be emailed to the study PIs (Drs . Comer  and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_35807]) and the lead site manager within 2 
business days . 
If the event meets the definition of an unanticipated problem , an adverse event form 
should be emailed to the study PIs (Drs. Comer  and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_35807]) and the lead site manager 
within 24 hours . 
7.9 Screening  for Anxiety  and Study Enrollment  
All participating primary and secondary pediatric care clinics use either the 8 -item PROMIS 
Anxiety Short Form v272–75, the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC -17),76 Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7),77 and/or the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9)[ADDRESS_411044] of care at either the primary care or behavioral health level. For 
clinics only using the PHQ -9 (which provides a depression score) for initial screening of 
potential internalizing problems, elevations are to be followed -up with administration of a 
validated anxiety assessment.  These screenings are part of their standard practice so every 
child is screened for anxiety related symptoms at every visit. Youth in participating primary 
and secondary pediatric care settings who show elevated anxiety scores are referred to 
integrated or co -located behavioral health teams in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332346]. Families at the partic ipating primary and secondary pediatric care 
clinics who voice concerns about youth anxiety (regardless of screener scores) are also to 
be referred to integrated or co -located behavioral health teams in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332347].  All sites have the option to refer 
patients to the study directly.  HIPAA waivers have been secured to access (but not store) 
screening data for the purposes of identifying and contact[CONTACT_332419]. 
Such referral and permission are documented through each pediatric health setting’s 
internal mechanism(s)  for referring families to ancilla ry services and case management. The 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
66 
 overall goal is to align referral and consent as closely as possible with existing workflows to 
reduce staff/family burden and to support sustainability. Primary and secondary pediatric 
care providers and staff should be educated about the study to increas e project awareness 
and facilitate referrals. Sites are not required to receive consent to screen because 
screening is part of standard care.  When a family is referred to the study, a Kids FACE 
FEARS staff member contacts them to inform them about the stud y, answer any questions, 
review eligibility (see Eligibility), and enroll them if interested and eligible. Once the patient is 
referred to a behavioral clinician, the clinician will use the [ADDRESS_411045] (a list of patients referred to behavioral 
health/psychiatry by [CONTACT_332420]) to check for 
referrals to anxiety treatment. The research staff at sites will follow up with the patient’s 
referring providers, or clinical staff responsible for reviewing and triaging referrals, to provide 
more information about the study and request permission to follow up directly with patients 
about the study. Once permission is received, staff should follow the same screening 
procedures outlined under the “direct referral” pathway in the MOP.  
Different sites may have varying referral mechanisms. However, all sites will obtain 
permission from the guardian or 18 -year-old, or their clinical provider, prior to contact[CONTACT_332421].  
A positive PROMIS 8a Anxiety v2 Short F orm screen is defined as a T -score above 55 
which is:  
A raw score of 17  or above on the pediatric parent proxy  
Or 
A raw score of 19  or above on the pediatric self -report  
A positive screen using the PSC -17 is defined as:  
An internalizing score of 5 or above  
Or 
Responding to item 15 (“worries a lot”) with “sometimes” or “often”  
Participant recruitment will be very closely monitored on a monthly basis. If the enrollment 
and randomization rate across the study falls short for any consecutive two -month period 
(i.e., <90% of the targeted goal for each two -month period) investigators will evaluate the 
underperformance, and may shift allocation of funds as necessary to sites that are meeting

7.10 Enrollment  
 
7.10.1. Eligibility  Determination  
Below are the steps completed for each participant before they are deemed eligible for the 
study:  
1. The participant is identified as potentially eligible (step 1 of eligibility)  by [CONTACT_332422] (refer to Section “Screening for Anxiety  and 
Study Enrollment” ). 
2. The participant is  invited to participate  in the study  by [CONTACT_332423].  
3. The local RA reaches out to the participant to initiate consent and enrollment 
procedures.  
4. The local RA completes the eligibility assessment screening form on REDCap to 
determine if they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria (step 
2 of eligibility).  
5. The participant completes their baseline assessment and has their fin al eligibility 
screening (step 3  of eligibility) . 
6. The participant is deemed eligible.  
There are 3 steps for screening in this study to confirm eligibility:  
 
Eligibility 1 – Standard of Care  
 
Screening in pediatric health site for potentially eligible patients : 
The s creening procedure for the first step of eligibility is a standard of care procedure 
already being implemented at all participating sites. All sites participating in the study will 
either screen in waiting rooms using the (1) PROMIS or (2) other  standardized behavioral 
health screening  to refer to the study, or (3) refer directly to the study based on clinical 
judgment.  For all [ADDRESS_411046] an initial screening using the 
PROMIS scale before referral to the study.  These patients will be identified as potentially 
eligible and invited to the study by [CONTACT_332424].   
 
Eligibility 2 – Eligibility Screening Form  
Screening after referral to the study:  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411047] been referred to 
the study to determine if they meet the study’s inclusion criteria and do not meet any 
exclusion criteria. If it is identified  that the patient requires a higher level of care , the safety 
protocol will be initiated and a clinician will follow -up to decide if this treatment is appropriate 
for this child and if they can be enrolled in the study.  
 
Eligibility 3 – Research Assessment  
Screening to determine final eligibility of study participants : 
Final determination of eligibility will be based on the participant’s PROMIS score 
from their baseline assessment. After a participant gives consent to participate in the 
study and completes the eligibility assessment, they will complete baseline 
assessmen t which includes the PROMIS measure. If either the parent -proxy or self -
report score at baseline is positive , they will be deemed eligible for the study.  
 
A positive PROMIS 8a Anxiety v2 Short Form screen is defined as a T -score above 
55 which is:  
 
A raw score of [ADDRESS_411048] been completed with the 
participant:  
a. Eligibility Screening  Procedures  
b. Informed Consent Procedures  
c. Baseline Assessment Procedures  
d. PARS Baseline Procedures  
e. Clinical Intake Procedures  
Once these procedures are complete, randomization procedures  are automatically initiated.  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411049] a positive PROMIS 
score (eligibility 1), the research staff will complete an eligibility screening to determine if 
they meet inclusion c riteria. The research staff member will first read the brief screening 
consent script and get permission to screen the patient. Once they have received 
permission to screen, they will complete the screening form on REDCap. This data will be 
collected on REDCap with no identifying patient information but the research staff at the 
clinic will hold the screen ID for eligible and interested patients to link the screening form to 
the patient. Sites will request a HIPAA wa iver to access screening data to identify and 
contact [CONTACT_91301]. If the participant meets inclusion criteria and does not 
meet any exclusion criteria, the research staff member will continue to informed consent 
procedures.   
7.10.3 Informed Consent Procedures . Consent can be done in person , on the phone , or 
via videoconference using Zoom software . Research staff will meet in -person with the family 
to complete informed consent while in the clinic when both research staff and family are able 
to do so, or families will be consented by [CONTACT_332425] (i.e., 
because family could not stay in clinic to provide informed consent or research staff were 
not present on site).   
Research staff will attain assent for patients under the age of 18. Sites will follow their local 
IRBs policy for attaining assent for minors. Sites will also follow their institution’s policy for 
re-consenting child participants in the study who turn [ADDRESS_411050] a HIPAA agreement 
during the time of consent to access patient’s diagnostic history coded in their medical 
record at clinical assessment. If consent procedures are done over the phone, the site 
coordinators will request a HIPAA agreement over the phone and collect the participant’s 
signature [CONTACT_328621] . If the site’s IRB requires a signed paper HIPAA agreement, site 
coordinators will work with clinic staff to find a time to meet with the  participant in person to 
request a HIPAA agreement, or

baseline but the child did not), continue to follow up with the family for [ADDRESS_411052] has not 
completed their baseline assessment, proceed with randomization of the family only if the 
necessary assessment has been completed (parent baseline for child ren <13 and child 
baseline for children ≥13).  
If the participant completes the assessment and their PROMIS score in the baseline 
assessment is negative, they are no longer be eligible for the study. The RA will notify the 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411053] to determine the patient’s clinical condition  and if outpatient  CBT is an 
appropriate level of care  for the patient. Participants will complete the designated program 
based on their age (Cool Kids for 7 -12 year olds, and Chilled for 13 -18 year olds).  
7.[ADDRESS_411054] been documented, the form 
can be submitted, and the random assignment will be released. Randomization assignments 
are made centrally at the FIU data coordination site. Families are randomly assigned to one 
of the two treatment conditions by [CONTACT_332426] (Baltimore, [LOCATION_011], Miami, or Seattle), Language of Treatment (English 
or Spanish), and Age (7 -12 years or 13 -18 years). An automated push notification is sent 
that reveals the family’s assigned condition simultaneously to the FIU data  management 
team (for data recording purposes) and to the research coordinators and clinical team at the 
participant’s site (to orient the family to their assigned treatment condition). The local RA will 
report the result to their clinical team and to the participant.  
7.[ADDRESS_411055] a signed HIPAA 
authorization agreement from the participant. The participant can refuse to give HIPAA 
authorization and still continue to be in the study.

HIPAA authorization form will be emailed to them for their signature. If the s ite IRB does not 
allow collection of their signature [CONTACT_328621], t he local RA will work with the clinic team to 
identify a day to review a HIPAA authorization agreement form with the participant in 
person. If the participant agrees, the form needs to be signed by [CONTACT_332427] a secure filing cabinet. Onc e an RA confirms on REDCap that a HIPAA authorization 
agreement has been signed by [CONTACT_2299], the assigned diagnoses form will be 
available in the participant’s REDCap record to be completed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_332348].  
A local RA will access diagnostic information via the participant’s medical record to complete 
the assigned diagnoses form on REDCap or the participant’s therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332349] [ADDRESS_411057] with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332350] -up according to which study arm they 
are assigned to . The scheduling and coordination effort for therapy delivery and check -ins 
for the self-paced online  version will be conducted at individual sites.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332351] . Before the beginning of treatment in the guided online  CBT arm, the following 
points of engagement must occur:  
1. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332352].  
2. A technical orientation on the self-paced online program must take place with the 
participant. The technical orientation will be conducted using tools provided by [CONTACT_332428]. This orientation will go over how to navigate the program and who to 
contact [CONTACT_332429]. This orientation can be conducted in -person, over the 
phone or via videoc onference using Zoom software. The participant will always be

7.15.2 Midtreatment, Posttreatment, and Follow -up Assessment Procedures  
[LOCATION_012] International University (FIU) will be responsible for emailing a link to participants to 
complete the midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow -up assessments . Specifically, a ll 
randomized families are invited to complete a midtreatment assessment (consisting of 
caregiver - and youth self -report questionnaires) once they complete half of their allocated 
treatment. Families who do not complete half of their allocated treatment by  [CONTACT_332430] a midtreatment assessment 
at Week 8. All randomized families are then invited to complete a posttreatment assessment 
(consisting of caregiver - and youth self -report questionnaires) once they fully complete their 
allocated treatment program. Families wh o do not complete their allocated treatment 
program by [CONTACT_332395] a 
posttreatment assessment at Week 20. All randomized families are then invited to complete 
a follow -up assessment at Week 52  (consisting of caregiver - and youth self -report 
questionnaires). Families  will be emailed 2 -4 weeks ahead of their follow -up assessment 
target date ( i.e., 2-4 weeks before week 52).  
BMC and FIU RAs will assist all sites in conducting follow -up calls to participants in order to 
increase assessment completion rates. A reminder email will be sent to the participa ting 
family  by [CONTACT_332431] [ADDRESS_411060] 2 weeks (or until the 
assessment is complete). FIU RAs will run weekly reports off REDCap to see which 
participants have not completed their assessments and inform local RAs of which of their 
participants have outstanding data. If a participant has not compl eted their assessment after 
2 weeks, the RA from the participant’s site will call the participant in an attempt t o complete 
the assessment over the phone. For posttreatment assessments, RAs should stop reminder 
contacts to participants when the participant 8 weeks after the assessment is initially 
emailed to them. At this point, the posttreatment assessment point is considered missing. 
For follow -up assessme nts, R As should stop reminder contacts  to participants 8 weeks after 
the assessment is initially emai led to them.  
7.15.3 Posttreatment  PARS  
PARS assessments will be completed at posttreatment for each family by [CONTACT_332432], BU, or BMC who are masked  to treatment assignment.  
 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411061] roughly 30 -50% attrition by [CONTACT_332433] -up timepoint, and roughly 
10% of data points to be missing with each collected timepoint. REDCap surv eys will be 
configured to minimize missing values (e.g., requiring participants to complete each item, or 
explicitly indicate “refuse to answer” before proceeding to the next item; providing real time 
alerts to the data management team when items or entire  forms are missing). Data will 
additionally be checked on a weekly basis by a research supervisor, and patterns of 
missingness will be identified and corrected in real time throughout the study. To further 
reduce instances of missing data, we have kept the  number of study forms to a minimum in 
order to minimize the burden to participants, and participants will be provided compensation 
for their time completing study forms. Finally, participants will be compensated for the 
burdens of completing study assessm ents (see below).  
Given the aim to evaluate treatment engagement and performance under typi[INVESTIGATOR_332362], families are not compensated for participating in treatment. To ensure 
generalizability and observe the treatment comparators under natural conditions, treatment 
is not funded by [CONTACT_332434]. Rather, treatment is to be paid for via the 
natural channels of payment in the participating health centers (e.g., insurance and co -
payments). In contrast, families are compensated for participation in study a ssessments that 
are not part of the treatment comparators under study. Specifically, families will receive the 
following compensations for completing various study assessment components:  
a. $50 for baseline assessment (staggered payments: $25 following baseline 
questionnaires and $25 following baseline PARS completion)  
b. $25 for midtreatment assessment  
c. $50 for posttreatment assessment  
i. $30 additional compensation for completing posttreatment PARS 
assessment  
d. $100 for completing follow -up assessment  
 
*Coaches (who are not guardians) will not receive compensation for the 
assessments they complete. Compensation will only be provided to the youth and 
guardian informants. One ClinCard that will be loaded with the above payments will 
be given to each family for each child enrolled in the study.  
Automatic email reminders and weekly emails and phone calls from Kids FACE FEARS staff 
members should be used to increase participation in study assessments. Families who do 
not complete the baseline assessment are not randomized. Families who do not compl ete

 their assigned treatment are still invited to complete all subsequent evaluations (i.e., 
midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow -up evaluations).  
FIU will run weekly reports to see which participants have completed their assessment and 
send this report to BMC. The lead site RA will load the appropriate compensation amount 
onto the participant’s ClinCard as each of the assessment points is complete.  
7.[ADDRESS_411062], there were multiple observations per child due to the repeate d measures 
design with four major assessment points. Second, there was additional clustering due to 
multiple children from each site. The intraclass correlation (ICC) is a quantitative estimate of 
clustering and allows for adjustment for non -independence. Study investigators estimated 
an ICC of .5, meaning it was anticipated that 50% of the variation in the observations would 
be due to differences between individuals and between sites (the remaining 50% of the 
variation was assumed to be due to individuals varying in their responses over time). The 
design effect (DE) reflects the extent to which standard errors are deflated if clustering is 
ignored. The DE is equal to 1 + (m – 1) × ICC, where m is the number of repeated 
measures. Accordingly, with [ADDRESS_411063] be multiplied by 2.5 in order to obtain a 
sample size appropriate for the observed clustering while maintaining nominal alpha and 
power levels.  
The required study sample size was calculated via conventional methods for repeated 
measures / mixed models analysis. Required sample size is a function of the alpha (type I 
error rate) and beta (1 – power) values. Required size per group is: 𝑛= 2∗(𝑍1−𝛼+𝑍1−𝛽)2. 
Before adjusting for the DE, these computations found n=60 was required in each group for 
an alpha=.05 (assuming family -wise error rates=.05 across the study to account for multiple 
comparisons) and power=.8 (corresponding to beta=.2). After adjusting fo r the DE of 2.5, 
this power analysis indicated n=150 was required per group (60 × 2.5), for a total of N = 
300.  
The needed sample size of N = 300 (outlined above) was based on the primary comparative 
effectiveness tests of this study (Aim I). That said, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted 
to evaluate the magnitude of effects that could be detected in moderatio n analyses 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
77 
 examining heterogeneity of treatment effects (Aim II). These analyses were conducted with 
G*power using the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Repeated 
measures ANOVA is similar to a mixed model in some respects, but simpler and uniformly  
less powerful80 using the repeated measures ANOVA, therefore, offers a conservative 
estimate of the effects able to be detected with each mixed model. With N = 300, alpha = 
.05, power = .8, two treatment conditions, four measurements, and a correlation between 
repeated m easures of .5, the trial was powered to detect moderation effects as small as 
Cohen’s d = 0.068. This is 7% of a SD difference and a very small effect.  
7.16.2 Handling of Missing Data  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prevention and monitoring . All study data will be collected via electronic capture 
and communication directly with the study team. Based on similar studies conducted by [CONTACT_332435], we expect roughly 10% of data points to be 
missing. REDCap surveys will be configured to minimize missing values (e.g., requiring 
participants to complete each item, or explicitly indicate "refuse to answer" before 
proceeding to the next item; providing real time alerts to the data management team when 
items or en tire forms are missing). Data will additionally be checked on a weekly basis by a 
research supervisor, and patterns of missingness will be identified and corrected in real time 
throughout the study. To further reduce instances of missing data, we have kept  the number 
of study forms to a minimum in order to minimize the burden to participants, and participants 
will be provided compensation for their time completing study forms. Finally, participants will 
be compensated for the burdens of completing study ass essments at a rate of $50 for 
baseline assessments (including PARS) and, $25 for midtreatment assessments, $50 for 
posttreatment assessments (including PARS), $100 for week 52 assessments and $30 for 
completion of PARS at posttreatment (note: compensation will not be provided for 
completion of measures that will be included as part of routine care). Coaches will not 
receive compensation for the assessments they complete.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical h andling of missing data.  All analyses will consist of intention -to-treat 
models drawing on all available data. To account for missing data, we will employ multiple 
imputation. Recommended procedures for single and multilevel multiple imputation will be 
conducted using BLIMP softwa re, using fully conditional specification multiple imputation 
(FCS -MI). For each model, 50 datasets with imputed values will be created using other 
model covariates as predictors of missingness. Model converge nce will be assessed across 
8 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) processes and verified for potential scale reduction 
(PSR) factor<1.05. Main analyses will be conducted on the imputed dataset and the results 
will be pulled for final estimates (using R 4.4.1 mi tml for imputation pooling per Rubin’s 
rules, and lme4 for multilevel models, or lm and glm for linear and logistic regression 
models).  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
78 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting dropout and missing data.  All instances of study dropout will be 
documented, including the reason for dropout, who decided that the participant would drop 
out (i.e., parent or guardian, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], study staff, adolescent patient), and whether the 
dropout resulted from burden of in tervention, study assessment, or both. Withdrawn 
participants will be encouraged to continue to participate in study assessments throughout 
the follow -up period in order to optimize intention -to-treat models. A C ONSORT diagraph 
will account for all participants across the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Loss to Follow -up and Withdrawal from Treatment.  This study will be using an 
intent -to-treat analysis so once a participant is randomized, they will always be included in 
analysis. If participants do not complete their entire treatment program (or withdraw from 
treatment) or take longer than [ADDRESS_411064] with data collection.  
7.16.3 Covariates  
Covariates for each model will include site, language of care, youth age, youth gender, 
youth race, youth ethnicity, and family resource insecurity (see Measures)  
7.16.4 Primary analyses: Comparative effectiveness analyses. For primary analyses on 
continuous outcomes that were measured across the 4 major timepoints (e.g., caregiver - 
and youth -reports on the PROMIS Anxiety Scale, CALIS), mixed models of change144 will be 
run separately for each outcome. Mixed models are preferred for longitudinal designs 
because they allow for individual estimates of change and have robust power in the 
presence of missing data and attrition.145,146 Covariates for each model will include site, 
language of care, youth age, youth gender, youth race, youth ethnicity, and family resource 
insecurity (see Measures), and any other baseline variables found to significantly differ 
across participants in the t wo conditions. The random effects of intercept (reflecting 
individual variation in mean outcome level) will be assessed. The fixed effects of Treatment 
Condition, Time, and the Treatment × Time interaction will be analyzed in the prediction of 
change. We w ill examine non -linear models of change (i.e., log transformations of Time), 
which afford examination of symptom trajectories across time that are not gradual and 
incremental (e.g., steep improvements during initial weeks of treatment, followed by a 
slowin g down of improvements toward the end of treatment, and then relative stability 
across the follow -up time interval). To aid interpretation of the meaningfulness of between -
group differences, Cohen’s d’s will be computed for each continuous outcome on model  
means at post and follow -up. 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
79 
 For primary analyses on the dichotomous categorical outcomes PARS Treatment 
Responder Status at posttreatment, baseline PARS scores will be examined for each 
participant to determine their individual thresholds for classification as Treatment 
Responders (i .e., 35% PARS score reduction). These thresholds will be used to classify 
each participant’s statuses as posttreatment. Logistic regression models will examine 
Treatment Condition (along with the study covariates) as a predictor of Treatment 
Responder Stat us and Remission Status at post. For primary analyses on continuous 
outcomes of Treatment Satisfaction at post, linear regression models will examine 
Treatment Condition (with the study covariates) as a predictor of caregiver - and youth -
reported posttreatm ent satisfaction.  
7.16.5 Heterogeneity of treatment effects . For Aim II analyses (heterogeneity of treatment 
effects)  predictor and moderator terms will be added to the models predicting youth anxiety 
severity that were outlined above. For study covariates being considered as 
predictors/moderators (e.g., language of care, youth age, youth gender, youth race, youth 
ethnici ty, and family resource security), this will entail only adding interaction terms, as the 
main effects of these variables will already be in the models. For  the additional variables 
considered as treatment moderators that are not already included as model covariates (e.g., 
caregiver nativity) this will entail adding main effects and interaction terms to the models. 
For each model examining heterogeneity of tr eatment effects, the relevant terms of interest 
will be the [ADDRESS_411065] interaction of Variable × Time (reflecting whether the variable uniformly 
predicted change across the two treatments) and the [ADDRESS_411066] interaction of Variable × 
Treatment Condition × Time (refl ecting whether the variable moderated treatment effects; 
i.e., whether the variable predicted differential response across the treatments). As with the 
Aim I comparative effectiveness analyses, log transformations of Time will be entered to

8 – Ethical Considerations  
8.1 Ethical Considerations  
Recruitment and retention strategies:  This study is designed as a pragmatic trial. To 
maximize external validity, CBT for child anxiety will be integrated into routine clinic 
workf lows and all children ages  7-18 years, with exception of those meeting minimal 
exclusion criteria described below, will be eligible.  
Retention strategies for CBT trial, data collection and follow -up assessments:  Families will 
provide primary and additional contact [CONTACT_332436]. Modest patient incentives ($25 -50) over the course of 
study participation  at each data point will be provided for completing assessments.  
Exclusion Criteria:  The intervention is  suitable for patients ages 7-[ADDRESS_411068] developmental delays or intellectual 
impairments with very severe challenges (e.g., complete absence of verbal communication 
unrelated to anxiety).  
Involvement of vulnerable populations:  The study wi ll recruit children between 7-18 years 
and a parent or legal guardian . It will not involve prisoners or institutionalized individual s. 
The study could involve four  populations considered to be vulnerable: pregnant women, 
children, and non -English speakers. As detailed elsewhere, we will obtain informed consent,  
child assent where applicable based on the child’s age,  protect confidentiality, prevent 
undue influence and coercion, and protect against risk s of the study .  
• Pregnant women:  Although the study will not specifically target pregnant women, 
given that the study enrolls young children and their famili es, it is possible that a 
participant  could be pregnant. Such women will not be excluded. Women of 
childbearing potential will be entitled the same protections as listed above. We 
foresee no extra risk for a woman of childbearing potential relative to other 
participants.  
• Children: This research targets youth with elevated anxiety. Parents between the 
ages of 16 -21 who are the legal guardians of the child referred for assessment, will 
not be excluded based on age; thus it is possible that we will enroll parents  who are 
under 21. Young parents often face additional barriers accessing health services for 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411069] enrolled such 
parents in previous studies, which were reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_332437].  Therefore, we are confident that 
protocols for the proposed research will be ethical, lawful and will be approved by [CONTACT_332438]' IRB.  
• Non-English speakers: We include non -English speakers (Spanish speakers) in 
order to address the need for research and an evidence base for effective treatments 
in this population. All materials, modules, and general resources presented to 
participants wil l be available in Spanish. We will have Spanish speaking RAs 
conducting screening and assessments who will also be available to answer any 
questions participants have. Additionally, many of our therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332363]. We are confident that our stu dy will have enough resources and staff 
available to Spanish speakers to ensure the ethical conduct of research.  
• Children and Parents Involved with DCF: Children who are wards of the state will be 
excluded. Children who are involved with DCF will still require us to obtain informed 
consent from the legal guardian and permission from DCF prior to study enrollment. 
A caregiver confirmed to be safe by [CONTACT_332439] t be available to voluntarily participate 
along with the youth as already outlined in the protocol for all youth/ family 
participants. We will not include study participants who are mandated to treatment. 
We will fol low all applicable laws for including children and parents who are involved 
with DCF.  
Research Sites:  The settings for the proposed project are Academic Medical Centers and 
Community Health Centers.  We will collect data from all of these sources via de -identified, 
coded data in REDCap.  
Material to be collected . The study will not make any use of biological specimens. 
Investigators will gather data from the following sources: (1) Patient and family reported 
measures; (2) Semi -structured interviews; (3) Provider fidelity measures; (4) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332364]; (5) administrative data and patient records.  
Access to individually identifiable private information . All research staff will complete CITI 
Human Subjects Training and Child Protection Training. Only  study staff completing training 
in HIPAA regulations and human subjects protections will have access to study data. For all 
sources of data, with the exception of the interviews, all identifying information will be 
removed and names replaced by [CONTACT_332440]. Furthermore, identifying information will not be 
shared with others outside this study. Names and contact [CONTACT_332441]. Project data will only be linked to the 
patient's record ID. For  the interviews, only names, phone numbers, and site information will 
be available to the qualitative team to contact [CONTACT_332442].

Data collection, management, and protection . Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 
located at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center will securely collect research data from across all four 
study regions, and [LOCATION_011] Medical Center will be responsible for overseeing the integrity 
and security of the data. REDCap  is a scalable, web -based electronic data capture system 
that allows the investigative team to build online surveys and databases and input remote 
data over a secure web connection (a SSL certificate is required). REDCap features 
authentication , auto-logout setting , data logging  (audit trails for tracking data manipulation 
and export procedures),  user privileges  (each user only has access to granted projects; 
privileges are granular on the project level, e.g., being able to export, enter, add or modify 
database metadata, to build/run reports, to modify user privileges, to view logs, etc). 
REDCap can be used to co llect data for 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA -compliant 
environments, and is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for 
research and operations. The Data Services Group of the FIU Center for Children and 
Families (CCF) will have co ntinuous 24/[ADDRESS_411071] and secure the data stored in REDCap’s 
database, the software application employs several methods to protect against mali cious 
users who may attempt to identify and exploit any security vulnerabilities in the system. 
Access to the REDCap data entry website will be based on permissions granted by 
[CONTACT_332443] d 
Translational Sciences Institute for the Medical Campus Office of Information Technology.  
Only authorized study members will be able to enter or view data.  The login information 
(username) of the person submitting the information, the date and time sub mitted, and other 
navigational information will be automatically obtained and stored in the database.  
Information posted on forms will be electronically encrypted using secure socket layering 
(SSL) encryption technology so that only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_332365].  Data 
will reside on a secure, password protected server at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center (BMC) to which 
only designated individuals have access, thus providing a secure environment for all project 
data.  The database will be automatically ba cked up on a nightly basis.  Files stored on BMC 
servers will be protected by [CONTACT_85405] ‘firewalls’ that restrict access to designated users.  
Restrictions and permissions to update the database will be controlled through the REDCap 
web application.

[ADDRESS_411072] access. In partic ular, 
the Data Services Group of the FIU Center for Children and Families (CCF) will have 
accounts created for them and will have continuous 24/[ADDRESS_411073] (IRB) Review  
This study is to be conducted according to applicable US federal regulations and institutional 
policies (which are based in federal regulations, guidance, and Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines).  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the [LOCATION_011] Medical 
Center and [LOCATION_011] University Medical Campus IRB, for formal approval of the study 
conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing 
to the i nvestigator. A copy of the initial IRB approval letter will be provided to the sponsor.  
All participants  for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and 
providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review 
and approval by [CONTACT_1201]. The consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, 
must be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure. Consent will be 
documented as required by [CONTACT_1201].   
This protocol was made in accordance with [LOCATION_011] University/ [LOCATION_011] Medical Center IRB 
policies and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB. The study's clinical sites in [LOCATION_011] will 
be overseen by [CONTACT_332444]'s IRB. Regional  sites will submit separate IRB 
applications using the study protocol and site specific forms  to their respective institutional 
IRBs for approval according to their institutional policies. Oversight of clinical sites outside of 
[LOCATION_011] will be conducted by [CONTACT_332445]. IRB oversight is by [CONTACT_332446] -PIs.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_411074] confidentiality  
● Because the research covers the topic of mental health and potential psychosocial 
stressors participation may be emotionally distressing to individuals in the study.  
● Although we will strive to maximize cultural sensitivity in delivery of the proposed 
intervention, it is possible that, among parents, their explanatory models of their 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
84 
 child’s condition will be incompatible with our proposed interventions and even 
assessments, which may upset some participants.  
● A potential risk to participants is potential loss of confidentiality. Although data will be 
stored in a secure and confidential manner, and we will de -identified all stored data, 
accidental breaches of confidentiality are technically possible.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_411075] Risk  
Recruitment and Informed Consent. We will obtain parental permission and child assent 
for all enrolled families. Youth 18 years of age will provide their own informed consent.  A 
written description of the study and other informational materials (in English, Spanish, and at 
appropriate literacy level) will be made available to all families to assist them in the informed 
consent process. For eligible families who are interested in participating, research staff will 
complete eligibility assessment and consent procedures. This could be done at the time of a 
positive screen in the clinic, later on the phone, or later in person depending on th e 
preference and availability of the parent/patient. T o mitigate risks, subjects will be given 
multiple opportunities to decline participation. They will be advised of their right to refuse 
participation in all or any part of the research. Families who decline to participate will still be 
offered usual clinical services at the participating clinical setting.  All participants will be 
assigned a numerical code and only project personnel will have access to a file linking 
names/contact [CONTACT_332447]. Research data will not include identifying 
information and will be encrypted and electronically stored  on a password -protected study 
server.  
To provide additional protections, we will assure that the investigative team has the 
appropriate expertise to deal with children and parents. Study facilities will be appropriate to 
children, as these facilities will be either families’ homes or pediatric  healthcare sites. We 
will make sure that all psycho -educational materials, treatment plans are written in a 
straightforward manner, at the appropriate literacy level. We will use translators/language 
line as needed to further ensure parents fully understa nd study procedures and 
communicate concerns about their child’s care. As all site staff and the investigators are 
mandated reporters, families will be informed that any disclosure of abuse, risk to a child or 
elder will need to be reported to the appropri ate state protection agency. Endorsement of 
suicidality, risk to self or others will require emergency evaluation for safety and disposition 
by [CONTACT_332410] a contact [CONTACT_332448].  
8.2.3  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others.  
The potential long -term benefits of participating in this study outweigh the risks.  All eligible 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411076] two models of CBT 
delivery (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led vs. guided online ca re) in pediatric healthcare settings in which low -
income, ethnically diverse children receive routine health care services will provide valuable 
information to pediatric care practices and integrated health networks about the potential 
benefits and barrier s to implementing this type of intervention for children with anxiety. The 
results can provide rigorous evidence -based information to support patient and provider 
decision -making and patient -centered care.  
8.[ADDRESS_411077]’s 
protections will have access to study data.  [LOCATION_011]  University Medical Campus’ Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system will securely collect and manage research data 
from across all four study regions. For all sources of data, all identifying information will be 
linked to ID codes.  [LOCATION_011] Medical Center and the participant’s site  will have access to the 
participant’s name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031] . Identifying information shared across sites will 
be limited to sites that need some information for their role in the study.  Sites will hold the 
master code for their participants and only coded data will be shared with other sites.  
FIU will have limited access to identifiable patient information. They will only have access to 
patient participant names, emails , and phone numbers  which will be linked to a record ID in 
a file that will be stored separately from any clinical data. Assessments will be sent to 
participants via email by [CONTACT_332449]. The FIU research team will have access to 
only record ID numbers , phone numbers,  and emails in order to; (1) create login usernames 
for participants randomized to the web -based treatmen t which will be linked to their study ID 
number; (2) send assessments to participants via email  and; (3) conduct follow -up calls for 
assessment completion  across sites . PARS administrators at FIU will have access to 
participant’s names and contact [CONTACT_332450].  FIU will  have continuous access to the data and will  be able to run 
weekly reports to see when participants have completed mid -treatment sessions/modules 
and post -treatment sessions/modu les. In order to provide all sites with data collection 
support, the regional site PI, Jonathan Comer, and his project manager  will have access to 
all data including identifiable data.  
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
86 
 BMC will be responsible for; (1) setting up participant’s ClinCards and loading compensation 
amounts onto the card and; (2) managing and providing assistance to sites  and; (3) 
conducting follow -up calls for assessment completion across sites . BMC will run weekly 
reports to identify participants who have completed assessments to provide compensation 
to participants. In order to set up ClinCards, BMC will need access to the patient’s 
participant  number and contact [CONTACT_332451], address, date of birth. In order 
to provide technical assistance to participants and sites, the BMC team will also need 
access to participant emails, phone numbers, and login information. All other participant 
data shared with BMC will be coded.  
The Cool Kids Online IT Support team will only have access to participant s’ name, email 
addresses , and Cool Kids login information. This team will consist of study assistants le d by 
[CONTACT_976] - [CONTACT_332469] n Comer  – who will reply to emails from participants regarding technical 
concerns with the Cool Kids Online program. Participants will be able to send emails to an 
encrypted BU email account regarding their technical issue. The support team will have 
access to this account and will be able to directly reply to participants .  
Our consulting team at Macquarie University will be providing technical support to the Cool 
Kids IT Online Support team with the Cool Kids online system. The Macquarie team’s 
involvement with the study will be strictly for technical support and troubleshooting any 
glitches in the Cool Kids Online system where the Cool Kids IT Support team needs support. 
The team will only have access to participant’s email addresses  and login information .  
Access to data involving therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/staff participants will be very limited. To maintain 
confidentiality, all identifying information will be linked to ID codes. Only BMC will hold the 
master code for these participants and only coded data will be shared wi th other sites, 
including their own site. FIU will only have access to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/staff participant emails which 
will be linked to a record ID in a file that will be stored separately from any clinical data. 
Assessments (except baseline assessment) will be sent to participants via email by [CONTACT_332452]. FIU will have continuous access to the data and will be able to run weekly 
reports to see when participants have to complete assessments.  
8.[ADDRESS_411078] data capture will attend in -
person or remote training (depending on geographical proximity). Study team members 
outside of the South [LOCATION_012] area will attend web -based training.  The goal of the training is to 
ensure uniformity of procedures among personnel, to achieve the ultimate aim of ensuring 
high quality protocol implementation and data collection . Subsequent training for new staff 
and booster sessions for existing staff will be conducted via webinar. The FIU CCF data 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
87 
 team will also provide quality control procedures for data collection and data entry. The 
quality control measures that we shall implement include detailed and unambiguous 
specifications for completion of each of the data collection forms. The FIU CCF data  team 
will also oversee and monitor randomization assignments and sequences.  
The CCF data team will provide regular status updates regarding data collection. They  will 
also provide regular statistical summaries to the investigative team that include reports on 
enrollment as well as the current status of each study participant . 
8.5 Data Collection  
All PROs will be collected over the phone  or electronically (i.e., no separate office -visits will 
be required for the collection of study data).  
Consent, eligibility assessment, and baseline assessment  will be completed on a tablet 
(through the electronic, HIPAA compliant REDCap). However, different clinics may choose 
to slightly alter the process in order for it to fit their current workflows (i.e. conducting paper 
and pencil screening). In all clinics , paper screening forms will be available for 
patients/ guardian s upon request if they prefer and the data enter ed into REDCap by [CONTACT_38992]. All data will be entered by [CONTACT_332453] a locked cabinet.   
The team a t Macquarie University will  collect non -clinical data related to participant use of 
the online program from the back end of the online Cool Kids program. This data includes 
participant’s login information, login times , content accessed at each login , module 
completion time , and their IP address. The study team will also have access to back end 
data from the online Cool Kids program that will be used for analysis including usage of 
program, clicks, and participant answers to questions.  
Due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, we have designed the data collection protocol to be 
concurrent and as integrated as possible with clinical encounters and participant 
progression through the Cool Kids therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led and self-administered online versions.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_411079]’s protections 
will have access to study data. After data collection is complete, the FIU CCF data team will 
work to create a data sharing file that comprises the following componen ts and 
accompanying annotation: the protocol, REDCap user's manual, annotated copi[INVESTIGATOR_332366], the schedule of assessments, the data dictionary providing data

[ADDRESS_411080] data interpretation.  
8.5.2 Data Storage/Security  
BUMC’s  Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system will securely collect and 
manage research data from across all four study regions. REDCap is a scalable, web -based 
electronic data capture system that allows the investigative team to build online surveys and 
databases and input remote data over a secure w eb connection (a SSL certificate is 
required). REDCap features authentication, auto -logout setting, data logging (audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures), user privileges (e ach user only has 
access to granted projects; privileges are granular on the project level, e.g., being able to 
export, enter, add or modify database metadata, to build/run reports, to modify user 
privileges, to view logs, etc .). REDCap can be used to collect data for 21 CFR Part 11, 
FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act), and HIPAA  (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act) -compliant environments, and is specifically geared to 
support online or offline data capture for research and operations.  
To help protect and secure the data stored in REDCap’s database, the software application 
employs several methods to protect against malicious users who may attempt to identify and 
exploit any security vulnerabilities in the system. Access to the REDCap da ta entry website 
will be based on permissions granted by [CONTACT_332454].  Only authorized study memb ers will be able to enter or 
view data.  The login information (username) of the person submitting the information, the 
date and time submitted, and other navigational information will be automatically obtained 
and stored in the database.  Information posted on forms will be electronically encrypted 
using secure socket layering (SSL) encryption technology so that only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_332367].  Data will reside on a secure, password protected server at [LOCATION_011] 
University Med ical Center (BUM C) to which only designated individuals have access, thus 
providing a secure environment for all project data.  The database will be automatically 
backed up on a nightly basis. Files stored on BUMC servers will be protected by [CONTACT_85405] 
‘firewalls’ that r estrict access to designated users.  Restrictions and permissions to update 
the database will be controlled through the REDCap web application.  
Non-BUMC sites will be able to access the REDCap system after submitting an end user 
agreement. A [LOCATION_011] University REDCap account will be created for them and the BMC 
Study: Kids FACE FEARS  
 
[ADDRESS_411081] access.  Planning, 
configuration and end -user support for REDCap  (https://redcap.bumc.bu.edu/)  will be 
provided by [CONTACT_332455].  The Data Services Group of the FIU 
Center for Children and Families (CCF) will have accounts created for them and will have 
continuous access to the data as well as project administration rights in order to fully 
execute their duties of data management, mon itoring, and analysis . All data will be stored at 
BUMC.   
All paper records will be stored in locked storage spaces (cabinets or drawers) at the 
participant's clinic site. Only study staff will have access to the key to get into these storage 
spaces. Participant forms will be stored in a single folder that is lab eled with their respective 
study ID number.  
8.6 Study Records  
Study records will include consent forms and patient data. We will gather data from the 
following sources: (1) Patient and family reported clinical measures; (2) Provider fidelity 
measures; (3) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332368].  
8.6.1 Retention of Records . Per [LOCATION_011] Medical Center policy, all study records will be 
retained for seven years after completion of the study.  The full data package will be 
deposited in a PCORI -designated data repository for 7 years.  The Full Data Package 
includes the Analyzable Data Set, Full Protocol, metadata, data dictionary, full statistical 
analysis plan (including all amendments and all documentation for additional work 
processes), and analytic code from a PCORI -funded research  project.  The package will be 
made available to third -party requests when PCORI makes the Final Research Report 
available on the PCORI website .

Dual PIs Jonathan Comer, Ph.D. and Donna Pi[INVESTIGATOR_35807], Ph.D. ), in consultation with the 
Scientific Steering Committee, the Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC), and the 
Study Advisory Committee. The Executive Committee coordinates with the Lead 
Investigators  (made up of the primary Kids FACE FEARS investigators from each 
participating region and clinic, plus key investigators with specific content expertise in 
biostatistics and/or technology -based care) to implement all aspects of the study. One -to-
two lead i nvestigators serve as Regional Lead(s) for each of the four Kids FACE FEARS 
study regions. These Regional Leads coordinate and oversee all study activities in their 
respective regions. Four “scientific cores” were designed for the Kids FACE FEARS project, 
as well: the Research and Methodology Core is responsible for the study design and 
overall research conduct; the Clinical  Training & Fidelity Core is responsible for all staff 
training and intervention delivery fidelity; the Methodology and Statistics Core  is 
responsible for overseeing statistical planning and oversight, randomization and allocation 
concealment, data collection and integrity, and statistical analysis; and the Technology

Title of Study:  A Phase 1b Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Clinical Activity 
of BGB -290 in Combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) in Subjects with 
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors  
Protocol No:  BGB -290-103 
Study Centers:  Approximately 35 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US), Europe, Asia, 
and the Pacific region  
Study Phase:  Phase 1b  
Treatment 
Duration:  Patients will receive daily treatment during the study until occurrence of 
progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, 
lost to follow -up, or study termination by [CONTACT_3211].  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To determine the safety and tolerability of pamiparib (also known as BGB -290) when given 
orally in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) (pulsed and continuous)  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for 
pamiparib c ombined with TMZ (pulsed and continuous)  
• To select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of pamiparib in combination 
with TMZ  
• To determine the preliminary antitumor activity of pamiparib in combination with TMZ  
Secondary:  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pamiparib and TMZ  
Exploratory:  
• To evaluate candidate biomarkers in tumor tissue and in peripheral circulation as potential 
markers of response, resistance, or disease progression  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration:  Pamiparib (BGB -290) administered orally (PO) twice a day (BID) in doses 
of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40  mg, or 60 mg capsules , depending on dose level and 
availability  
Temozolomide administered PO once a day (QD) in doses of 5 mg, 20  mg, 
100 mg, and 140  mg capsules, depending on dose level and availability  
Reference Therapy, 
Dose, and Mode of 
Administration:  Not applicable  
Study Design:  
This is an open -label, multi -center Phase  1b study to evaluate the combined use of pamiparib, a 
poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and TMZ, a DNA -alkylating agent in patients with 
locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase 
Version .[ADDRESS_418345] phase of the study consists of a modified 3+3 dose escalation scheme utilizing a 
fixed dose of pamiparib in combination with escalating d oses of TMZ. There will be two arms that will 
undergo dose escalation independently, starting with Dose Level 1. In Arm A, TMZ will be administered 
once a day during Days  1 to 7 of each 28 -day cycle (pulsed). In Arm B, TMZ will be administered once a 
day continuously during  each 28 -day cycle. The second phase ( dose expansion ) of the study will further 
evaluate the safety and anti -tumor activity of pamiparib in combination with TMZ at the dose and 
schedule that will be chosen based on all data available from the dose escalation phase. The expansion 
phase will enroll patients in 6 different cohorts according to indication and/or homologous recombination 
deficiency ( HRD ) status as follows: Cohort 1: HRD positive ( HRD+ ) ovarian ca ncer; Cohort 2: HRD+ 
triple -negative  breast cancer  (TNBC); Cohort 3: HRD+ metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer  
(mCRPC); Cohort 4: ES -SCLC; Cohort 5: G/GEJ cancer; and Cohort 6: patients who have HRD+ non- 
squamous  non-small cell lung cancer (NSC LC), squamous NSCLC, esophageal cancer, squamous head 
and neck cancer  or soft-tissue sarcomas.  Enrollment into these cohorts will occur simultaneously and 
independently.  
It is expected that approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in the entire study.  Each expansion cohort 
will enroll approximately 20 -25 patients; cohorts might enroll additional patients based on emerging data, 
but the total number of patients enrolled in the study will not exceed 250 patients . 
Enrollment  will start at Dose Level 1 and follow  the escalation scheme outlined below ( interim dose 
levels may be tested based on available clinical and PK data).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 The dose and schedule of pamiparib + TMZ intended for the second phase of the study will be 
determined once the safety and tolerability profiles of each dose escalation and schedule arms has been 
evaluated . The protocol allows for additional dose adjustments of pamiparib to be explored based on 
available safety data and the recommendation of the safety team. Patients in the dose expansion phase 
will be enrolled into one of 6 different cohorts based on their disease characteristics and/or HRD status . 
Patients  will be evaluated for adverse events (AEs), (all grades, according to National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 [NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 or higher]), 
serious AEs (SAEs), and any AEs requiring study drug int erruption or discontinuation, from initial dose 
of study drug until [ADDRESS_418346] dose of study drug or until study 
discontinuation/termination, or until they receive another anticancer  therapy, whichever comes first. 
Patients who, at the ti me of progression, have an ongoing AE that leads to treatment discontinuation will 
be followed until the event resolves, the investigator assesses the event as stable, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient starts a different antitumor therapy. I f a patient discontinues study drug due to 
reasons other than disease progression or death, then tumor assessments should continue to be performed 
following the scheduled assessment plan until disease progression, death, lost to follow -up, or withdrawal 
of consent to efficacy follow -up. 
In the absence of unacceptable toxicities or disease progression, patients  will be offered continued study 
treatment of BGB -[ADDRESS_418347] discontinued all study drugs should 
return to the clinic for an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit within [ADDRESS_418348] regular follow -up for safet y, efficacy, and survival.

 Study Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoints  
Escalation: Incidence and nature of DLTs  
Expansion: Incidence, nature, and severity of AEs, graded according to the NCI CTCAE v. 4.03  
                   Objective response rate (ORR), as assessed using RECIST v1.1  
Secondary Endpoints  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of pamiparib and TMZ, including but not limited to C trough 
Time -to event - endpoints: e.g., duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression -free 
survival (PFS), and overall  survivals (OS)  
Exploratory Endpoints  
Candidate predictive biomarkers, including, but not limited to, expression and mutations of genes in the 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response pathway, and relationship to efficacy and resistance  
Statistical Methods:  
Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase. A sample size of 20 -25 patients 
in an expansion cohort will provide the half width of the 90% confidence interval of the ORR

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 approximately  13% to 20% when the observed ORR is a pproximately  40%. Hence, the low bound is 
above 20%. This is considered adequate in the preliminary assessment of anticancer activity of pamiparib 
and TMZ combination therapy. An expansion cohort can be further expanded to confirm efficacy. Up to 
200 patie nts will be enrolled in the expansion cohorts.  
Populations:  
Safety Population includes all patients who received any dose of pamiparib and/or TMZ. The Safety 
Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Efficacy Evaluable Population includes patients i n the Safety Population who had measurable disease at 
baseline (or prostate cancer patients as per inclusion criteria 14f) and had at least one post -baseline tumor 
assessment unless discontinued treatment due to clinical progression or death prior to tumor  assessment.  
DLT Evaluable Population includes patients who received ≥ 70% of each study drug during the DLT 
assessment window and had sufficient safety evaluation. Additionally, patients who had a DLT event 
during the DLT assessment window despi[INVESTIGATOR_338466] < 70% of the scheduled dose will also be 
considered evaluable . 
PK Population includes all patients for whom valid pamiparib PK parameters can be estimated.  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_338503] v. 4.03 . 
Laboratory values (CBC, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital, physical exams, and ECG 
findings will also be used in determining safety. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze  all safety 
data in the Safety Population.  
DLT Analysis:  
Dose -limiting toxicity in the DLT evaluation period will be used to determine the dose and schedule of 
pamiparib plus TMZ in the expansion cohorts. The DLT events will be summarized descriptively at each 
combination dosing level in the DLT Evaluable Population.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
Population PK analysis may be carried out for pamiparib to include plasma concentrations from this 
study in an existing model. PK parameters such as C min will be summ arized and additional PK 
parameters, such as apparent clearance (CL/F) of the drug from plasma and area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC) may be derived from the population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653]. 
Population PK analysis may be repor ted separately from the final clinical study report (CSR).  
Trough and/or peak plasma concentrations of TMZ will be summarized and compared with appropriate 
historical controls.  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if  supported by [CONTACT_33653].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Poly (ADP -ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors and Pamiparib  
Poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins are involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
replication, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Inhibition of PARP converts 
common single -strand DNA breaks (SSBs) into double strand - breaks (DSBs) during DNA 
replication. DNA -bound PARP1/2 catalyzes the synthesis of poly (ADP -ribose) (PAR) into a 
range of DNA -associated proteins that mediate DNA repair. PARP1 also under goes auto -
PARylation, a molecular change that ultimately leads to its release from DNA . [1] 
Small -molecule inhibitors  of PARP1/[ADDRESS_418382] by [CONTACT_338504]1/2 and trap PARP proteins on 
damaged DNA. In normal cells, PARP trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338469] (HRR) factors such as BReast CAncer susceptibility gene ( BRCA )1/2, ataxia -
telangiectasia mutated (ATM),  and other HRR proteins. Thus, cancer cells with homologous 
recombination deficiencies (HRD s) are more susceptible to PARP inhibitors in a mechanism 
known as synthetic lethality, which is when two conditions in combination are lethal but 
independently would not cause cell death . [2] 
In the clinic, PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib, have 
demonstrated sustained anti -tumor responses as a single agent in patients with BRCA1 - or 
BRCA2 -mutant tumors, while achieving a favorable safety profile . Olaparib and rucaparib are 
approved as single agent for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have  germline mutations 
in the BRCA gene. (Approved product package inserts are available online ). 
Pamiparib (also known as BGB -290) is a potent and selecti ve inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. 
Pamiparib showed potent ability to trap PARP proteins on damaged DNA  (DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338470]) and anti -proliferative activity against a number of cell lines harboring BRCA gene 
mutations or homologous recombination defects.  
1.2. PARP Inhibitors in the Treatment of Solid Tumors  
As discussed above PARP inhibitors induce synthetic lethality in cancers with HRD. This study 
will enroll patients with tumors likely to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to 
treatment with P ARP inhibitors as described below.  
Breast Cancer  
Breast cancer is a clinically and biologically heterogenous disease characterized by [CONTACT_338505]. Up to 10% of breast cancers can be linked to 
germline mutations in BRCA1  and/or BRCA2  genes. [3] Both BRCA1 and 4 are tumor suppressor 
genes; and when mutated, can lead to a higher risk of cancer by [CONTACT_338506] . [4, 5]. Many investigations  have 
shown that HRD is critical for the response to both pl atinum and PARP inhibitor therapy.  
Triple -negative  breast cancer (TNBC) is considered an aggressive disease, characterized by [CONTACT_338507], absence of both hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and the HER2 
receptor and frequent association wi th BRCA1 mutations.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 Clinical studies support the use of platinum compounds in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_418383] cancer in the 
neo-adjuvant and advanced disease treatment setting including metastatic TNBC . [6, 7, 8, 9] The 
TNT study [ 9] demonstrated no difference in overall tumor response rates or progression -free 
survival (PFS) with carboplatin treatment compared to docetaxel for an unselected population of 
patients with TNBC. However, carboplatin was ass ociated with improved objective response rate 
(ORR) and PFS in the subgroup of patients with germline BRCA1/[ADDRESS_418384] cancer. When 
added to either docetaxel [ 10] or gemcitabine , [11] clinical outcomes were superior in the 
combinatio n treatment arms containing cisplatin over the comparator monotherapy arms.  
It has been hypothesized that inhibition of PARP, in combination with DNA -damaging 
chemotherapeutics, would be highly effective in tumors lacking BRCA function . [12, 13, 14, 15] 
PARP inhibitors have been tested clinically in breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2. In a single -
arm, open label study, olaparib (400 mg or 100 mg orally twice daily [BID]) was administer ed to 
women with BRCA1 - and/or BRCA2 -mutant, advanced breast cancer (of which > 50% were 
triple  negative ). [16] Patients in the 400  mg BID treatment group had an ORR of 41% and PFS 
of 5.[ADDRESS_418385] commonly reported grade 3 adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, 
and vomiting.  
Other Phase 3 studies investigating single -agent PARP inhibitors in patients w ith germline 
BRCA1/[ADDRESS_418386] cancer are ongoing (olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib).  
Ovarian Cancer  
Currently two PARP inhibitors, olaparib and rucaparib, have been Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved for women with advanced ovarian can cer with BRCA1/2  
mutation. In addition, olaparib was approved by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) as 
maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2  mutation.  
Data from clinical studies support the use of PARP inhibitors for women with plat inum -sensitive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296] (EOC ). [17, 18, 19] In a randomized study with ~300 women with 
platinum -sensitive high -grade recurrent EOC, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 
the PARP inhib itor olaparib or placebo . [20] Results from this study showed a significant 
improvement in PFS in patients treate d with olaparib compared with placebo (8 versus 5 months; 
hazard ratio [HR] for progression or death 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25˗0.49), 
although interim analysis found no overall survival (OS) benefit (30 months in both; HR 0.94; 
95% CI; 0.63 -1.39). A subanalysis of data from this study showed a significant benefit in PFS 
with olaparib compared with placebo among patients with a known BRCA mutation (median, 11 
versus 4 months; HR 0.18; 95% CI; 0.10 -0.31), with a trend towards improved OS (HR 0.7 3; 
95% CI; 0.45 -1.17), which became more pronounced at a longer follow -up (>5 years ). [17, 18] 
In a recent double -blind Phase 3 study (NOVA), 553 patients with platinum -sensitive, recurrent 
ovarian cancer were randomized 2:1 to receive a PARP inhibitor niraparib or placebo . [19] 
Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of a germline BRCA  mutation ( gBRCA ). 
The non -gBRCA  cohort was further classified by [CONTACT_84888] D status and also included patients with 
somatic  BRCA  mutations. Patients treated with niraparib had an increased PFS in all cohorts 
compared with placebo. In the gBRCA  group, PFS was 21.0 versus 5.5 months (HR 0.27; 95% 
CI; 0.17 -0.41). In the overall non -gBRCA  cohort, PFS was 9.3 versus 3.9 months (HR 0.45; 95% 
CI; 0.34 -0.61). In the HRD positive ( HRD +) subgroup of the non -gBRCA  cohort, PFS was 12.9 
versus 3.8 months (HR 0.38; 95%  CI 0.24 -0.59). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 associated with nirap arib were thrombocytopenia (34%), anemia (25%), and neutropenia (20%). 
Myelodyspastic syndrome (MDS) occurred in 5 of 367 patients (1.4%) who received niraparib.  
Another PARP inhibitor, veliparib, was evaluated in a Phase 2 study in 50 women with a known 
BRCA  mutation. Veliparib treatment resulted in a 26% ORR and the median PFS and OS were 
8 and 20 months, respectively . [21] 
Prostate Cancer  
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide . [22] Recent sequencing 
data indicates that more than 20% of metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
have HRD due to germline and/or somatic loss -of-function in key homologous recombinant 
genes including  BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, NSBP1, FANCJ , that could potentially confer a 
‘BRCAness’ phenotype and susceptibility to PARP inhibition via synthetic lethality . [23, 24, 25, 
26] Recently, it has been shown that prostate cancer patients with germline BRCA1/[ADDRESS_418387] a higher risk of nodal or distant metas tases and poorer overall survival than patients without 
mutations . [27] Data from clinical studies has demonstrated that these patients respond to 
treatment with PARP inhibitors . [28] 
 
In a Phase [ADDRESS_418388] two prior regimens and 
had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy were treated with the PARP  inhibitor olaparib 
(400 mg BID ). [24] In this study, 16 patients (33%), had DNA repair mutations. The primary 
endpoint of the study was a composite response rate that included ORR, a ≥  50% decrease in 
serum prostate -specific antigen (PSA) , and/or a decrease in circulating tumor cells. Fourteen of 
the 16  (88%) patients with DNA repair mutations  had a response based upon these criteria 
compared to only 1 of 33 (3%) patients without an identified DNA -repair gene abnormality.  
 
In another Phase 2 study, 153 patients with mCRPC were treated with abiraterone plus 
prednisone or abiraterone, prednisone, and veliparib . [29] There was a trend toward 
improvement in the PSA response rate (71 versus 64%) and in PFS (11.0 versus 8.8 mo nths) 
with the addition of veliparib, but neither were statistically significant. However, there were 
statistically significant differences in the PSA  response rate (89 versus 57%) and measurable 
disease response rate (80 versus 38%) in patients with an id entifiable defect in a DNA repair 
gene.  
Gastric Cancer  
Genetic abnormalities in gastric cancer include alterations in the DNA damage response gene 
ATM . The loss of ATM  has been demonstrated to be synthetically lethal with inhibition of PARP, 
supporting th e use of platinum -based treatment as well as PARP inhibitors.  
Studies showed that gastric cancer cell lines, particularly those with a low expression level of 
ATM protein, are sensitive to olaparib . [30, 31] A randomized, double -blind placebo -controlled 
Phase 2 study was conducted in 124 patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer treated 
with olaparib (100 mg BID daily) in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 
of every 28 -day cyc le ) or placebo . [32] Results from this study showed the combination therapy 
significantly improved OS in both the ov erall population (median 13.1 versus 8.3 months) and in

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 those whose tumors contained low levels of ATM protein. However, there was no difference in 
PFS in either the overall population or in those patients with ATM -low tumors.  
A Phase 3 clinical study with  paclitaxel with or without olaparib as a second line treatment 
recently reported results . [33] Asian patients with  advanced, previously treated gastric cancer 
were treated with either paclitaxel or paclitaxel in combination with the PARP inhibitor olaparib; 
18% of 535 randomized patients were ATM -deficient.  Results of the study in the overall 
population demonstrated n umerically higher overall survival for patients treated with olaparib 
plus paclitaxel (6.9 versus 8.8 months; HR 0.79; p =0.0262). However due to a statistical 
correction made due to inclusion of a co -primary endpoint of the ATM -deficient subgroup, this 
did not reach statistical significance (which would have required a p value of < 0.025).  In the 
ATM -deficient subgroup, radiological response rates were significantly higher for patients 
treated with olaparib (37% versus  16%; p=0.03), and a non -statistically significant trend towards 
improvement in overall survival was also noted (10 versus 12 months; HR 0.73; p = 0.25). [34] 
Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes about 15% of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases and 
occurs predominantly in cigarette smokers . [35] Approximately 50% of SCLC patients have 
brain  metastases at the time of postmortem examination.  
Preliminary data from Phase 1 studies has demonstrated some efficacy of PARP inhibitors in 
SCLC  patie nts. In a Phase 1 study, talazoparib was administered as a single agent in patients 
with previously treated, advanced SCLC with germline mutations in BRCA1  and BRCA2 . [36] In 
this study, 10% of patients treated with talazoparib had a partial response and 25% had a clinical 
benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] lasting ≥  16 
weeks) with a median duration or response of 13.7 weeks (95% CI; 12.0 -15.3 weeks). The most 
common adverse events in this study were myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, and alopecia.  
A Phase [ADDRESS_418389]  doses of cisplatin and 
etoposide was conducted in treatment naïve - patients with extensive stage SCLC (n = 9 ). [37] 
The recommended Phase 2 dose o f veliparib was 100 mg. The preliminary efficacy in 7 
evaluable patients were: 1 CR (14.3%), 4 PR (57.1%), and 2 SD (28.6%). Grade [ADDRESS_418390] has been identified in subsets of ovarian cancer, and in uterine , lung 
squamous, esophageal, sarcoma, bladder, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck and gastric 
cancer samples . [38, 39] 
A limited number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of niraparib, rucaparib, talazoparib and 
olaparib in different indications with HRD, as assessed by a variety of methods and 
demonstrat ed antitumor activity in HRD+ patients even in the absence of BRCA 1/2  mutations.  
Niraparib treatment of advance stage ovarian cancer patients (QUADRA study) elicited an ORR 
of 17.5% (N=126) in HRD+/ BRCA  wild type patients as determined by [CONTACT_338501]® 
assay, irrespective of platinum sensitivity . [40] 
Version .[ADDRESS_418391] loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) high/ BRCA  wild type disease by [CONTACT_338508] (ARIEL 2 trial) also showed an ORR= 29.3% (n=82 ). [41] Rucaparib 
treatment of HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients with LOH high or somatic BRCA 
mutant tumors as assessed by [CONTACT_338509] 10.8% (N=37). 
[42] 
Olaparib treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients without genomic BRCA 1/2  
mutations, but with mutations in DNA damage response genes (based on historical data) elicited 
an ORR of 2 1.8% (N=31 ). [61] Patients with biliary tract, bladder, colorectum, lung, esophageal 
and uterine cancer with genomic BRC A1/2  mutations treated with olaparib showed an ORR of 
8.3% (N=12 ).  [62]  
Finally, talazoparib treatment of patients with  solid tumors harboring mutations in a selected 
panel of genes ( PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, 
MRE11, ATR, PTEN, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL ) resulted 
in an ORR of 15% (N=20 ). [43]  
1.3. PARP Inhibitors and Temozolomide (TMZ)  
Temozolomide (TMZ) induces apoptosis and cell death by [CONTACT_338510] O6 position, initiating a  double -strand break in the DNA and cell cycle arrest. PARP1 and 
PARP2 have a key role in the base excision repair (BER) of N -methylpurines 
(N7-methylguanine and N3 -methyladenine) that are generated by [CONTACT_338511]. In the presence of a 
functional BER system, these  damaged bases are promptly repaired and do not contribute to 
TMZ cytotoxicity. The first step of the BER process is the excision of the modified base by N -
methylpurine glycosylase (MPG). The subsequent removal of the basic residues by 
[CONTACT_338512]/apyrimidini c endonuclease results in the generation of DNA damage that is finally 
repaired by [CONTACT_338513]1, DNA  polymerase, XRCC1, and ligase III. 
Inhibition of PARP activity hampers PARylation of PARP1 and PARP2, interrupting the 
completion o f the repair process mediated by [CONTACT_311088] . [44]  
Therefore, increased anti -tumor activity due to the combination of PARP inhibition and TMZ is 
the consequ ence of increased DNA damage that eventually results in apoptosis and/or growth 
arrest. Repeated treatments with TMZ and PARP inhibitors also downregulate transcription and 
delay recovery of BER components in tumor cells.  [45, 46] This might further contribute to 
sensitizing cancer cells to the TMZ and PARP inhibitor combination.  
Several clinical studies have been conducted with PARP inhi bitors (olaparib, rucaparib, 
veliparib, and talazoparib) in combination with TMZ . [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54] To 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in these studies, TMZ was administered at 
standard doses (135 to 150 mg/m2/day or up to 1000 mg/m2/month) with increasing doses of the 
PARP inhibitor. All studies experienced the challenge of significant myelosuppression as dose -
limiting toxicities (DLT)  and observed anti -tumor activity was only modest.  
In a single -arm Phase 2 study, veliparib was tested in combination with TMZ in 41 wome n with 
advanced TNBC (8 with BRCA  germline mutation) and the overall response rate was 7% across 
the entire study population. However, patients with BRCA mutations had a 37.5% overall 
response rate . [47]

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 Veliparib (40 mg BID) in combination with TMZ was also studied in patients with mCRPC. The 
primary endpoint was a ≥ 30% decrease in PSA level . [48] Modest activity was seen in the 
25 evaluable patients; 2 (8%) had a confirmed PSA response, 13 (52%) had stable PSA levels, 
the median PFS was 9 weeks (95% CI: 7.9 -17) and the median overall survival was 39.6  weeks 
(95%  CI: 26.6 -not estimable). The most common Grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in >10% of 
patients were thrombocytopenia and anemia.  
In a recent study talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor with very good DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471], was used 
in combination with TMZ in patients with advanced malignancies. In contrast to previous 
studies, mentioned above, standard doses of talazoparib (0.5 to 1 mg) were administered with 
low doses of TMZ in patients with non -BRCA1/2 -mutated cancers . [54] The starting dose of 
TMZ was 25  mg/m2, approximately 12.5% of the therapeutic dose, and the MTD was identified 
as 1 mg talazoparib plus 37 mg/m2 of TMZ. This regimen was better tolerated than reported for 
prior studies, with less thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Furthermore, promising efficacy was 
observed, with 11 patients (61%) experiencing either a PR or SD. These preliminary clinical 
results are in support  of the hypothesis that PARP inhibitors with strong DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338472] -tumor activity.  
Continuous dosing of TMZ is thought to enhance the antitumor activity through sustained 
depletion of the DNA repair protein O6 -alyklyguanine DNA alkyltransferase . [55] Several 
studies have used continuous dosing of TMZ in patients with solid tumo rs, lymphoma, 
melanoma, and glioblastoma . [55, 56, 57, 58] In these studies, the dose of TMZ ranged from a 
daily dose of 150 mg/m2 for 5 days during each 28 -day cycle to 75 mg/m2 daily for 6 to 7 weeks 
and 50 mg/m2 daily up to 1 year. In a study of continuous TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily f or 6 weeks), 
the most common AEs were lymphopenia (60%). Of note, 2 (2%) patients had opportunistic 
disease (pneumocystis pneumonia and aspergillus pneumonia ). [57] In a study of continuous 
TMZ (50  mg/m2 daily for up to 1 year), the most common Grade 3/4 AEs were nausea and 
vomiting; the most common hematological adverse event was Grade 3 lymphocytopenia, and 
Grade 1/2 opportunistic infections (thrush) but no pneumocystis pneumonia. [58]  
1.4. Nonclinical Data  
1.4.1.  Nonclinical Data on Pamiparib  
Pamiparib is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 that sets itself apart 
from other PARP inhibit ors by [CONTACT_338514] -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338473].  In addition, pamiparib has shown anti-tumor activity against a number of cell lines 
harboring BRCA  gene mutations or homologous recombination defects as well as in vivo  models.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Noncl inical Safety Data for Pamiparib  
The nonclinical toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of pamiparib was characterized in single and 
up to 91 -day repeat -oral-dose studies in rats and dogs, and in a core battery of genotoxicity tests, 
including in vitro  Ames an d chromosomal aberration assays, and in vivo  bone marrow 
micronucleus assays in rats. Safety pharmacology assessments included in vitro  human ether -a-
go-go related gene (hERG) channel activity assays and in vivo  studies of cardiovascular function 
in dogs, as well as central nervous system (CNS) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_338474].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 The main toxicity findings were bone marrow inhibition that correlated with clinical pathology 
changes and gastrointestinal toxicity that presented as emesis, decreased food consumption, and 
decreased body weight. The systemic exposure increased dose -proportionally without apparent 
sex differences or accumulation. The MTD was considered to be 6  mg/kg in rats and 3 mg/kg in 
dogs for both 28 -day and 91 -day toxicity studies.   
Pamiparib was not mutagenic in the in vitro  Ames (bacterial reverse mutation) assay, but 
clastogenic in the in vitro  chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells and in the in vivo  bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats, wh ich is consistent with 
its mechanism of action. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as 
DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage repair. Pamiparib interacts with and 
inhibits the enzymatic repair machinery that car ries out detection and repair of SSBs.  
In the general toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no gross lesions or histopathological changes 
were noted in male and female reproductive organs. No embryo -fetal toxicity studies were 
conducted or are planned as they  were not considered essential because of its genotoxicity and 
bone marrow inhibition.  
There was no apparent inhibition of pamiparib on hERG channel as the half inhibitory 
concentration (IC 50) was 12.4 μM; for comparison, the IC 50 of the positive control amitriptyline 
was 1.9 μM. No effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiograms (ECGs) were noted 
in telemetry -instrumented conscious dogs. No effects on CNS or respi[INVESTIGATOR_338475] -Dawley rats. No abnormal changes in the cardiovascular, CNS, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_338476] - or repeat -dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs. No QT 
interval prolongation was noted in cardiovascular function studies in conscious dogs and in 28 -
day and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs. Embryo -fetal toxicity studies were not 
conducted because of the already established genotoxicity of and bone marrow inhibition by 
[CONTACT_338515].  
In summary, all available toxicological studies and data are adequ ate to support clinical 
development of pamiparib for treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information . [59] 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PARP Trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338477]  
A subset of PARP inhibitors are able to trap PARP enzymes at damaged DNA sites, and these 
trapped PARP -DNA complexes appear to be more cytotoxic than unrepaired DNA breaks caused 
by [CONTACT_338516] . [60] The DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338478] a 
fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay simila r to the method described in the literature. 
[60] Fluorescence -labeled nicked DNA was pre -incubated with PARP1and PARP inhibitors 
(pamiparib, olaparib, and veliparib). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was added to 
initiate PARylation reaction. PARylation reduced the FP signal by [CONTACT_338517]1. 
The potency of PARP inhibitors to trap PARP1 -DNA comple xes was derived from measuring the FP 
signal as a function of compound concentration. Pamiparib showed potent DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471] 
(with IC 50 of 13 nM), similar to olaparib and 30 -fold more potent than veliparib ( Figure  1).

GB cell lines resistant to single -agent TMZ (EC 50 of 32 M or greater). In 7 of 8 cell lines, 
pamiparib demonstrated synergism with TMZ with a shift in half maximal effective 
concentration (EC 50) for TMZ of 5 -fold or greater. This synergism was also demonstrated in vivo  
in an  H209 small cell lung cancer  xenograft model (Figure  2). Pamiparib (2.73 mg/kg BID  x 21 
days) as single -agent treatment had no significant effect on tumor growth. TMZ (50 mg/kg QD , 
Days 1 -5 of eac h 28-day cycle) as single -agent treatment was quite effective in this model 
resulting in objective responses in all animals (1 PR and 7 CRs in 8 animals) after the first cycle 
of treatment. However, 6 of these 8  animals developed TMZ resistance after three  cycles of 
treatment, and the mean tumor volume reached 505 mm3 on Day 66. Addition of pamiparib 
(0.68  mg/kg BID , Days 1 -5 of each 28-day cycle)  resulted in objective responses in all animals 
(2 PRs and 6 CRs in 8 animals) after the first cycle of treatmen t. After completion of 3 cycle s of 
treatment ( on Day 66), most animals were still tumor -free (6/8), and the mean tumor volume was 
12 mm3. Thus, the c ombination of pamiparib and TMZ significantly enhanced TMZ anti-tumor 
activity and delayed resistance.

MTD, preliminary anti -tumor activity, and the PK of pamiparib given as a monotherapy in a 
3+3 dose escalation scheme. Pamiparib was administered in doses ranging from 2.5 mg orally 
(PO) BID up to 120 mg PO BID.  
The study was conducted in 5 Australian study centers and preliminary data for 45 patients are 
available (cut -off date of 30 September 2016 ).  
The preliminary safety data indicate the  most frequent related AEs (  10% of patients) assessed 
as related were n ausea ( 58%, n = 26), vomiting (51%, n = 23), fatigue (29%, n = 13), diarrhea 
(18%, n=8), dry mouth (16%, n=7), and decreased appetite (11%, n=5). Hematologic AEs, 
regardless of relatedness, were reported in 40% of patients (n=18). Anemia was most frequent 
(33%, n=15), followed by [CONTACT_127867] (11%, n=5) and thrombocytopenia (2%, n=1).  
Twenty -six percent of the patients experienced a Grade 3  AEs (regardless of relatedness), and no  
Grade 4 AEs were reported. Eleven Grade 3 AEs in 9 patients (20%) were consider ed related to 
BGB -290: anemia (n=5), neutropenia (n=3), hypophosphatemia (n=1), nausea (n=1), and fatigue 
(n=1). Serious AEs reported as related to BGB -290 included anemia (n=2) and nausea (n=1).  
The DLT of BGB -[ADDRESS_418397] medical therapy 
observed in the 120 mg BID cohort (n=2) and in one patient each in the 40 mg and 80 mg BID 
cohorts. The MTD of BGB -290 was 80 mg PO BID.  
Ten patients achieved either complete (n=2) or partial (n=8) responses; all responses we re 
observed in patients  with gynecological cancers, and responses were observed in the lowest dose 
cohorts (2.5  mg BID).  
Based upon the overall safety, efficacy, and PK profile of pamiparib, the dose for further 
investigation was determined to be [ADDRESS_418398] as catalytic inhibitors, leading to 
accumulation of unrepaired SSBs . [60] Thus PARP inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of the 
BER pathway, and therefore, enhances TMZ cytotoxicity . 6261, 62] 
The study populations proposed for the expansion phase of this study are patients with tumors 
likely to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to treatment with PARP inhibitors. 
It is hypothesized that increased DNA damage by [CONTACT_338519] -tumor activity in advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, 
the clinical data for the use of PARP inhibitors in patients with TNBC, ovarian cancer, mCRPC,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 1.6.1.  Rationale for Dose Selection of Pamiparib  
In the clinic, pamiparib has shown favorable PK properties, has been well -tolerated, an d 
achieved maximum pharmacodynamic target modulation in PBMCs at a dose level below the 
regimen for this study (10 mg versus 60 mg BID). The dose of pamiparib chosen for this study is 
based on the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in the Phase 1 m onotherapy study, 
BGB -290-AU-002, discussed in Section  1.5.  
1.6.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection of Temozolomide (TMZ)  
As discussed in Section  1.3, previous combination studies using standard doses of TMZ and 
increasing low doses of PARP inhibitors had only modest anti -tumor effects and in creased 
cytopenia. A recent study that used sub -therapeutic doses of TMZ with standard doses of 
talazoparib showed more promising anti -tumor effects and a better safety profile [36]. Similarly, 
this study is designed to use the RP2D of pamiparib (60 mg BID) with low doses of TMZ, 
starting from 40  mg/day up to 120  mg/day (23  mg/m2/day to 69  mg/m2/day) or higher which 
corresponds to 15 %-46% of its recommended dose (150 mg/m2/day) when administered daily for 
5 days every 28  days (see  Section  6.1 , Table  2). In addition, continuous dosing of TMZ will start 
at 40 mg/day and would pot entially increase up to 120 mg/day of TMZ, which translates to 30% 
and 92%, respectively, of a daily dose of 75  mg/m2. [56, 59] 
In summary, pamiparib is a promising selective inhibitor of PARP [ADDRESS_418399] ivity making it  an excellent candidate to determine the effects of 
combining PARP inhibition with TMZ in these patient populations.  
1.7. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Pamiparib  has been studied in nonclinical toxicity and Phase 1 clinical studies. Pamiparib 
toxicitie s are largely consistent with the safety profile shared by [CONTACT_338520]. PARP inhibitors, 
including pamiparib, show a partial overlap with the safety profile of TMZ. There fore, patients of this 
study may experience AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_338480] a higher frequency and/or severity. In 
addition, patients may encounter AEs that are uniquely caused by [CONTACT_338521](s).  
However, with the lower doses of TMZ being us ed in this study, it is possible there could be 
fewer myelosuppressive -related  AEs than previously seen in other studies using TMZ in 
combination with PARP inhibitors.  
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been reported in a small 
number (< 1%) of patients treated with PARP inhibitors, especially in patients harboring a 
germline BRCA  mutation . [63] Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], patients who develop MDS and AML while on PARPi 
[INVESTIGATOR_338481] a history of extensive previous chemotherapy and some had a history of previous 
cancer or bone marrow abnormalities. To date, th ere have been no reports of MDS or AML in 
patients treated with pamiparib and no fatal drug reactions. Patients in this study will be 
monitored monthly for hematological toxicities and events of MDS and AML will be reported as 
serious AEs (SAEs).  
Prelimina ry data show that pamiparib appears to be generally well tolerated in patients with 
advanced solid tumors. The safety profile for single -agent pamiparib is similar to that of other 
PARP inhibitors. Given the dire prognosis of the patients that will be enro lled in this study and

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is an open -label, multi -center Phase  1b study to evaluate the combined use of pamiparib, a 
PARP inhibitor, with a DNA -alkylating agent, TMZ, in patients with locally advanced and 
metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion 
phase. The dose escalat ion phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary 
efficacy, and PK, in addition to determining the MTD and/or MAD for the combination. In the 
dose expansion phase of this study, the safety, preliminary efficacy, and PK profile of t he 
combination will be further evaluated in specific patient populations. Preliminary biomarkers for 
efficacy will also be explored during both phases of the study.  
Dose Escalation:  
The dose escalation phase of the study consists of a modified 3+3 dose esc alation scheme 
utilizing a fixed dose of pamiparib in combination with escalating doses of TMZ. There will be 
two arms that will undergo dose escalation independently. In Arm A, TMZ will be administered 
once a day during Days 1 to 7 of each 28 -day cycle (pulsed). In Arm B, TMZ will be 
administered once a day continuously during each 28 -day cycle . 
Dose Expansion:  
The dose expansion phase of the study will further evaluate the safety and anti -tumor activity of 
pamiparib in combination with TMZ at the dose and schedule that will be chosen based on all 
data available from the dose escalation phase.  
It is expected tha t approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in the entire study . Patients will be 
enrolled in 6 different cohorts based on their disease characteristics and/ or HRD status as 
described in Section  4.3; Enrollment into these cohorts will occur simultaneously and 
independently of each other.  Each expansion cohort will enroll up to 20 -25 patients each and 
may enroll additional patients based on emergin g data, but the total patients enrolled in the study 
will not exceed 250 patients .  
Adverse events  (AEs) that occur during and after the treatment period with study drug(s) will be 
followed and documented as outlined in Section  7.4 and Section  10. AEs will be graded 
according to NCI  CTCAE v4.03.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed for both pamiparib and TMZ during Cycle 1. 
Biomarker analysis will include but is not limited to germline BRCA1/[ADDRESS_418401] v1.1 
criteria ( Appendix  5). Tumor response will also be evaluated according to the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria for patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, the Prostate 
Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria will be used for patients with prostate 
cancer.  
Version .[ADDRESS_418402] to follow -up, or 
withdrawal of consent to efficacy follow -up. 
In the absence of unacceptable toxicities or disease progression, patients will be offered 
continued study treatment of BGB -290 plus TMZ . Regardless of discontinuation of one or more 
study drugs, patients should continue on study with regular follow -up (Section  8.5). Patients who 
have discontinued all study drugs should return to the clinic for an end -of-treatment (EOT) visit 
within [ADDRESS_418403] study treatment (Section  8.4). After the EOT visit, patients should 
have regular follow -up for safety, efficacy, and survival as outlined in Section  8.5. 
Study procedures and assessments are further detailed in Section  7 and Section  8, and a Schedule 
of Assessments can be found in Appendix  1 Table  1. 
4.2. Details of Dose Escalation  
4.2.1.  Starting Dose and Dose Escalation Approach  
The dose escalation phase consists of two arms as follows:  
Arm A  (pulse TMZ dosing): continuous pamiparib (60 mg BID) i n combination with 
increasing doses of TMZ (flat doses of 40, 80, 120 mg QD and higher, if tolerated) 
administered on Days 1 to 7 of each 28 -day cycle  
Arm B  (continuous TMZ dosing): pamiparib (60 mg BID) in combination with 
increasing doses of TMZ (flat do ses of 20, 40, 80, 120 mg QD and higher, if tolerated) 
administered continuously . 
A minimum of three patients will be enrolled in Arm A, Dose Level 1, before patients are 
enrolled into Arm B, Dose Level 1. Subsequently, enrollment and dose escalation decis ions for 
the two arms will occur independently of each other.  
The dose for pamiparib will be the RP2D of 60 mg PO BID (‘full -dose’ pamiparib) based on the 
rationale outlined in Section  1.6. Since TMZ is given as a DNA -damaging sensitizer for 
pamiparib and to simplify TMZ dosing, flat -dosing will be used for TMZ. The first dose level of 
40 mg QD corresponds to 23 mg/m2 assuming an average body surface area of 1.73 m2. 
Subsequent dose levels of 80 mg and 120 mg correspond 46 mg/m2 and 69  mg/m2, respectively. 
Additional  higher  dose levels may be explored, and the TMZ dose will not be increased by [CONTACT_26813] 50% each time nor will it  exceed the approved daily dose at the corresponding schedule.  
Once the MTD has been determined in Arm A (pulse dosing) and taking into consideration all 
data available for Arm B at that time, further dose escalation may be pursued for Arm A by 
[CONTACT_48775] t he time window of TMZ administration by [CONTACT_338522]. For example, TMZ administration at the MTD dose level may be extended 
to Days 1 to 14 and then to Days 1 to 21 following dose escalation rules outlined in 
Section  4.2.2 .

If the MTD is exceeded for a combination regimen that is considered inadequate for further 
exploration based on all data available at that time , alternative regimens may be explored after 
discussions with all investigators. For example, alternative regimens for pamiparib dosing may 
be explored such as  lower doses of pamipa rib continuously or full -dose pamiparib for Days 1 to 
21 of each 28 -day cycle.  
Depending on emerging safety data from this and other pamiparib Phase 1 studies, the pamiparib 
regimen may be switched to QD (≤ 120 mg QD) for one or both  of the  arms at any tim e during 
or after dose escalation. The first QD regimen of pamiparib will be at a dose level already 
cleared for the BID regimen.  
4.2.2.  Rules for Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation will occur in accordance with the following modified 3 + 3 dose escalation rules:  
A minimum of three patients will be initially enrolled per cohort.  
• If none of the first three evaluable patients enrolled in a given cohort experience a 
DLT, dose  escalation may proceed.  
• If one of the first three evaluable patients enrolled in a given cohort  experiences a 
DLT, additional patients (for a minimum of six evaluable patients) will be enrolled in 
that cohort.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 − If less than one third - of evaluable patients in a given cohort experiences a DLT 
(e.g., DLTs in fewer than two of six patients), escalation  will proceed to the next 
higher dose level . 
If a DLT is observed in at least one -third or more of patients (e.g., two or more of up to six 
patients ), the MTD will have been exceeded, and dose escalation will be stopped.  
• Additional patients (for a minimum of six evaluable patients) will be assessed for 
DLTs at the preceding dose level (if a minimum of six evaluable patients had not 
already been assessed at that dose level).  
• If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level, a lower or  intermediate dose level may  
be assessed for toxicity in the same manner as described above.  
If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level, the next highest dose level at which less than one 
third of evaluable patients in a given cohort experiences a DLT (e.g., DLTs in fewer than two of 
six patients) will be declared the MTD.  
If less than one third - of evaluable patients (e.g., DLTs in fewer than two of six patients) at the 
highest dose level experience a DLT, this dose level will be declared the MAD.  
Available data relevant for  dose escalation decisions for TMZ , including AEs, laboratory 
assessments, and PK analyses, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1689], investigators, 
PK scientist, and clinical trial  manager. On the basis of a review of these data and in consultation 
with the inves tigators, a  determination will be made as to the next appropriate dose escalation 
step. 
4.2.3.  Assessment of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicities will be assessed during the DLT assessment window starting with the 
first day of study drug administration  for each arm and all dose levels.  
The DLT assessment window will encompass the first cycle of 28 days.  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment 
window for reasons other than a DLT will not be considere d evaluable for DLT and will be 
replaced, if needed, to meet patient number requirement for dose escalation. Patients who do not 
receive ≥70% of scheduled pamiparib and TMZ dosing during the DLT assessment window will 
not be considered evaluable for DLTs a nd will be replaced, if needed, to meet patient number 
requirement for dose escalation.  
4.2.4.  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as one of the following toxicities occurring during the DLT  assessment 
window and considered by [CONTACT_093] t o be related to pamiparib:  
• Grade  3 non -hematologic, non -hepatic major organ AE, with the following 
exceptions:  
− Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that resolves to  Grade  1 with optimal 
medical management within 3 days  
− Grade 3 electrolyte disturbanc es that respond to correction within 3 days

clinical emerging data.  
If the frequency of Grade ≥ 3 toxicities or other unacceptable chronic toxicities in the 
cohort -expansion phase suggests that the MTD has been exceeded at that dose level , any

6.1. Study Drugs  
6.1.1.  Pamiparib (BGB -290) 
Patients will receive pamiparib as 10 mg, 20 mg, 40  mg, or 60 mg capsules, depending on dose  
level and capsule availability.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Packaging and Labelling  
Pamiparib capsules are provided in a container with a chil d-resistant closure and labelled  in 
accordance with all applicable local regulatory requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling and Storage  
The instructions for drug ordering are in the Pharmacy Binder. Pamiparib must be kept at 
15-30°C. An accurate study drug accountability l og must be maintained and kept up -to-date at all 
times.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dosage and Administration  
Pamiparib 60 mg will be administered PO BID, once in the morning and once in the evening, 
approximately 12 hours apart, each day for the protocol -prescribed dosing period. Pa miparib can 
be dosed with TMZ.  
A lower dose of pamiparib or a QD regimen for pamiparib may be explored (see Section  4.2.1 ). 
Patients will be instructed to swallow the capsules whole, in rapid succession, with water. 
Patients will be required to fast for at least 2  hours before and 1 hour after each pamiparib 
administration. Water is allowed during the fasting period.  
A dose of pamiparib should be skipped if it is not taken within 2 hours of the scheduled time. An 
extra dose of pamiparib should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If vomiting occurs 
during the course of treatment, no re -dosing of the patient is allowed before the next sched uled 
dose.  
On days with PK assessments, pamiparib (first dose) and TMZ should be administered in the 
clinic.  
6.1.2.  Temozolomide  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Packaging and Labelling  
Capsules of TMZ are available in 5  mg, 20  mg, 100  mg, and 140  mg, depending on dose  level and 
capsule availabi lity. Please refer to the package insert for detailed information.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 [IP_ADDRESS].  Dosage and Administration  
Temozolomide will be administered PO QD, preferably in the morning (see dosing sc hedule 
below  Table  2). TMZ can be administered with pamiparib. The daily dose and schedule will be 
determined as outlined in Section  4.2.[ADDRESS_418432] 2  hours before and one hour after each TMZ  
administration. Water is allowed during the fasting period.  
A dose of TMZ should be skipped if it is not taken within 2 hours of the scheduled time. An extra 
dose of TMZ should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If vomiting occurs during the 
course of treatment, no re -dosing of the patient is allowed before the next scheduled dose.  
In this study, TMZ will be administered as a flat dose rather than based on body surface area  
(BSA). The conversion of dose levels for TMZ for this study into BSA -based doses are as 
follows in  Table  2.  
Table  2: Comparison  of Temozolomide Dosing: Flat fixed versus BSA -based  
Flat Dose QD  BSA Equivalent1

On days with PK assessments, pamiparib and TMZ should be administered in the clinic.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Temozolomide and Pamiparib Drug -drug Interaction Potential  
Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species, 
5-(3-methyltriazen -1-yl)-imidazole -4-carboxamide (MTIC) and to TMZ acid metabolite. MTIC 
is further hydrolyzed to 5 -amino -imidazole -4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an 
intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed 
to be the active alkylating species. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role  in the 
metabolism of TMZ and MTIC (USPI).  
A CYP phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_338482]3A is the major CYP isoform responsible for 
pamiparib metabolism while CYP2C8 contrib utes to pamiparib metabolism to a lesser extent. 
Pamiparib is a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C9 (IC 50 = 6.48 M) while its IC 50 for other CYP 
isozymes are all greater than 10 M. Pamiparib is not a time -dependent CYP inhibitor of the 
7 major CYP isozymes tes ted (please refer to the IB for additional information [ 59]. 
Consequently, the drug -drug interaction potential between pamiparib and TMZ is believed to be 
low when co -administered.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 6.1.3.  Modifications of Study Drugs  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Considerations for Modifications of Study Drugs  
AEs should be assessed as best as possible regarding their relatedness to one or both study 
drug(s). Investig ators should discuss potential dose modifications with the Medical Monitor prior 
to implementation, if feasible. Regardless of discontinuation of one or both study drugs, patients 
should continue on study, with regular follow -up as outlined in Section  8.5. 
Patients who experience a DLT during the DLT assessment window, or a clinically significant 
Grade 2 toxicity or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered r elated to study drug(s) after the DLT 
assessment window, may temporarily suspend study drug. Depending on the toxicity, study drug 
may resume within 28 days after discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
Dosing of pamiparib and TMZ can be interrupted for appro ximately 28 days for medical events 
that are not associated with toxicity related to these study drugs or disease progression without 
discontinuing the patient from the study. If study drug is planned to be held > [ADDRESS_418433] be conta cted before permanent patient discontinuation.  
Criteria for dose modifications and suggested guidelines for the management of toxicities related 
to pamiparib and/or TMZ are summarized below. These general guidelines may be modified at 
the discretion of the  investigator based on best clinical judgement at that time. Any toxicities 
related to pamiparib and/or TMZ should be managed according to standard medical practice.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Interruption and Modification of Pamiparib and Temozolomide  
As discussed in Section  1.[ADDRESS_418434] partial overlap with 
the safety profile of TMZ, thus making it likely that patients in this study may experience 
pamiparib and TMZ -related AEs at a higher frequency and/or severity. In addition, patients may 
encounter AEs that are uniquely caus ed by [CONTACT_338526].  
In the context of this study, the role of TMZ is to sensitize tumor cells to pamiparib through 
DNA damage that can be caused by [CONTACT_338527]. Given the favorable safety 
profile of pamiparib (Section  1.5), it is reasonable to assume that a Grade [ADDRESS_418435], and a maximum of 
two TMZ dose reductions are allowed.  
Patients enrolled in the pulsed schedule (Arm A) who undergo AEs may re -start TMZ after the 
AE has recovered at the same dose or at a reduced dose as specified in  Table  3, provided [ADDRESS_418436] not 
recovered to NCI -CTCAE Grade  1 or less after 4  weeks, further investigations should be

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 6.1.6.  Treatment of Overdose from Study Drugs  
Overdose is defined as a patient having taken (accidentally or intentionally) a dose of pamiparib 
or TMZ that exceeded the dose assigned per protocol by ≥ 20%. Patients with a suspected 
overdose should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy as determined by [CONTACT_165778]. Any AEs occurring as a result of an 
overdose should be reported to the Medical Monitor as well as being included in stand ard AE 
reporting.  
6.1.7.  Occupational Safety  
Pamiparib is not expected to pose significant occupational safety risks to the study center 
personnel under normal conditions of use and administration. A material safety data sheet 
describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions will be provided to the 
investigator, where this is required by [CONTACT_1207], or is available upon request from the sponsor.  
6.2. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
6.2.1.  Permitted Medications  
All treatments and supportive care, including antiemetic therapy, hematopoietic growth factors 
and/or red blood cell/platelet transfusions, that the investigator considers necessary for a 
patient’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_338483]. All concomitant medications taken during the study will be 
recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) including all prescription and over -the-
counter (OTC) drugs, herbal supplements, and intravenous (IV) medications a nd fluids. If 
changes occur during the study period, documentation of changes in drug dosage, frequency, 
route, and date will also be included on the eCRF.  
All concomitant medications taken by [CONTACT_338529] [ADDRESS_418452] include the dose, regimen, route, indication, and start and stop dates of use 
of the prior and concomitant medications.  
6.2.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Patients are not allowed to rece ive other anticancer  therapy, including surgery, radiation therapy 
(RT), and cytotoxic, biologic, investigational agent, anticancer Chinese medicine, or hormone 
therapy. Bisphosphonate and denosumab use are permitted if the patient had already been 
receivi ng it at a stable dose ≥ 28 days prior to Day 1.  Palliative treatment of  isolated lesions 
(except target lesions ) with local radiation therapy is allowed.  
The primary metabolic pathway for pamiparib involves the CYP3A isoform, thus co -
administration of strong/moderate inhibitors of CYP3A with pamiparib should be avoided. Also 
avoid strong CYP3A inducers with pamiparib. Please refer to the drugs/substances pr esented in 
Appendix  4 and to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/  for a more complete list 
of medications that should be avoided.

Torsades des Pointes. Please refer to Appendix  [ADDRESS_418453] of these drugs. If the use of any of 
these drugs is necessary, the Medical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Avoid valproic acid as it decreases oral clearance of temozolomide (see package insert for 
temozolomide).  
Grapefruit juice is not  allowed throughout the study. No other dietary restrictions will apply.  
6.2.3.  Medications to Be Used with Caution  
Based on preliminary in vitro  screening assays, pamiparib is not a strong inhibitor of other 
human CYP isoenzymes tested. It is a moderate inhibito r of CYP2C9 (IC 50 = 6.48 M). 
Investigators need to be aware that pamiparib has the potential to interfere with the appropriate 
metabolism of medications that rely on CYP2C9 and follow the prescribing information 
recommendations for use with CYP2C9 inhibit ors. Therefore, careful monitoring should be used 
when co -prescribing CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as phenytoin and 
warfarin.  
Examples of these medications are listed in Appen dix 7, and these should be used cautiously 
with drug concentration monitoring where appropriate.  
In addition to CYP3A, pamiparib can also be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 in human liver 
microsomes, but to a lesse r extent. See Appendix  7 for medications that should be used with 
caution for that reason.

Information will also be collected regarding prior medications/significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
smoking history, childbearing potential ( Appendix  2) and any other assessments that are done for 
the purpose of eligibility for inclusion into the study (physical examination, vital signs, complete 
blood count [CBC] and blood chemistry, urinalysis, pregnancy test, and ECG). For fur ther 
details on eligibility assessments, please see Section  5 and Appendix  1. 
7.3. Physical Examination, Vital Signs, ECOG Performance Status, 
Weight, a nd Height  
A complete or limited physical examination, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
[SBP and DBP, respectively], pulse rate, oral, temporal, or tympanic temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862]), weight, height (Screening only) and ECOG perfo rmance status will be performed at 
timepoint s specified in Appendix  1. 
A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of general appeara nce as well as 
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, neck, heart, chest (including lungs),  abdomen, extremities, skin, 
lymph nodes, cardiovascular status  and neurological status. A limited physical examination should 
be directed at the evaluation of symptoms or specific safety issues. New or worsening 
abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.  
ECOG performance status will be determined as outlined in Appendix  8.

read of ECGs  obtained during the PK assessments will be performed for dose escalation and 
dose expansion cohorts 1 -5. 
Locally obtained ECGs should be performed if clinically indicated for all patients enrolled in the 
study. To minimize postural variability, it is important that patients are resting and in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_31774]  5 minutes prior to each ECG collection. Blood draws and other procedures should 
be avoided during the period immediately before ECG measurement, and activity should be 
controlled as much as possible to minimize variability because of the effects of physio logic 
stress.  
7.6. Laboratory Studies  
Samples for a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, and coagulation profiles will be drawn 
and analyzed locally. All other required blood samples will be sent to central laboratory for 
analysis throughout the study.  
A det ailed description of the procedures for sample collection, handling, storage, and shipment 
of the laboratory samples and all materials, such as test tubes and labels, is provided in the Study 
Manual.  
Laboratory studies will be performed at the timepoint s specified in Appendix  1 (including 
allowed windows of assessment) and may also be performed as medically necessary. Laboratory 
assessments should be don e before study drug administration.  
Screening blood and urine tests must be performed within 14 days of Day 1. If they were 
performed within 4 days of Day 1, they do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.

7.6.8.  PSA Measurements  
PSA levels will be collected for prostate cancer patients and tested in a certified local laboratory 
during screening and every 8 we eks (±7 days) following the first administration of the 
investigational medical product ( Appendix  1). In addition, the three most recent PSA levels pr ior 
to screening will need to be provided to determine a baseline doubling time.  
Increases and decreases in PSA will be tracked in order to assess PSA responses by [CONTACT_338532]2 
criteria described in Appendix  10. PSA changes from baseline (either increment or decline) and 
maximal change in PSA will be recorded and responses assigned by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria. PSA 
responses and progression must be  confirmed [ADDRESS_418459] tumor gr owth without 
impacting PSA secretion. PSA response and PSA progression will be defined according to the 
consensus guidelines of the PCWG2 criteria ( Appendix  10).

Tumor imaging (CT or MRI, with preference for CT) will be performed at screening and every 
8 weeks (±7 days) from C ycle [ADDRESS_418460] be 
documented at screening and reassessed at  each subsequent tumor evaluation. At the 
investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is 
suspected. An objective re sponse is considered confirmed once repeat assessments  [ADDRESS_418461] v1.1 by 
[CONTACT_338533]. Routine use of positron emission tomography (PET) scans 
should not be used to assess radiologic response to treatment for this study.  
Unless contraindicated, intravenous contrast product must be used to maximize visualization of 
all lesions. Patients  who are at increased risk of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast media 
should not have enhanced CT, but should instead be provided magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) with gadolinium enhancement patient per local protocol, with mandatory imaging 
coverage  from thoracic inlet to symphysis pubis plus unenhanced CT scanning with coverage 
from the thoracic inlet to the inferior costophrenic recess. Patients with bone pain or biochemical 
changes suggestive of bony disease without other clear explanation should have a bone scan at 
baseline and if bone metastases are documented should then have bone scans or other appropriate 
imaging examinations as clinically indicated.  
The same imaging technique should be used on the same patient throughout the study.  
After fi rst documentation of response (CR or PR), imaging performed at the next regularly 
scheduled timepoint  may be used for response confirmation.  
Patients who permanently discontinue study drugs prior to progressive disease will continue with 
regular tumor ass essments as per protocol every 8 weeks (±7 days) until disease progression, 
administrative issues, start of other anticancer  therapy or any other reason listed in Section  8.4, 
whichever occurs first. This imaging schedule will be maintained regardless of any intermediate 
unscheduled scans. Patients who withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic 
deterioration before objective documentation of progressive disease will be requested to undergo 
appropriate imaging to confirm progressive disease. Every effort will be made to confirm a

sent to the central laboratory for biomarker testing (either a formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded 
block with tumor tissue [preferred] or approximately  10 unstained slides). The most recent tumor 
block is preferred.  
In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is highly 
recommended. Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
An optional biopsy wi ll also be taken at the EOT visit for the patients who have confirmed 
disease progression from accessible tumor sites. These samples will be used to explore resistance 
mechanism(s). If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be from the same tumor lesion as the 
baseline biopsy. Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions (e.g., skin, peripheral lymph 
nodes, lung, liver, or internal lymph node metastases which can be readil y accessed using 
CT guidance).  If performed, a tissue cylinder should be obtained that has proper size for 
histological examination and biomarker analysis.   
Patients from Dose Expansion Cohorts 1 -3 with unknown BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_418468] provide a 
mandatory archival tumor tissue sample (either a formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded block with

assessments and procedures are shown in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix  [ADDRESS_418471] to be repeated on Day 1.  
8.3. Assessments during Treatment Period  
Safety assessments should be performed at all visits to the study center and throughout the study.  
8.3.1.  PK Intensive Visit (Day -2 to Day 1) (Dose Escalation Cohort  ONLY)  
To better characterize the pamiparib PK profile prior to TMZ administration, the first 
approximately [ADDRESS_418472] baseline assessments performed 
on Day -2 before pamiparib dosing rather than on Day 1 as detailed in Appendix  1 Table 2. 
Note: The collection of blood for the pamiparib PK [ADDRESS_418473] occur 
prior  to the administration of pamiparib and TMZ on Day 1.  
8.3.2.  Cycle 1 (28 days)  
During Cycle 1, all assessments (except for PK post -dose blood collection) performed during the 
clinic visit must be done prior  to study drug administration. On days with PK assessments, 
pamiparib (first dose) and TMZ should be administered in the clinic.  
For the Dose Expansion Cohorts, a [ADDRESS_418474] of all of the activities during Cycle 1 is found  in the Schedule of Assessments Table 
(Appendix  1 Table  1). 
8.3.3.  Subsequent Cycles  
A list of all of the activities during subsequent cycles  in the first year  are listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments Table (Appendix  1 Table  1). 
All assessments performed during the clinic visits and subsequent cycles must be done prior  to 
study drug administration (unless otherwise noted).  
8.3.4.  Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time at the patient’s or the inve stigator’s request 
and may include vital signs/physical examination; ECOG Performance Status; AE review; 
concomitant medications and procedures review; radiographic assessments; physical 
examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; disease -related consti tutional symptoms; and 
hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory assessments. The date and reason for the 
unscheduled visit must be recorded in the source documentation.  
If an unscheduled  visit is necessary to assess toxicity or for suspected PD, then d iagnostic tests 
may be performed based on the investigator assessment as appropriate, and the results of these 
tests should be entered on the unscheduled visit eCRF.  
8.4. End-of-Treatment Visit  
Patients who discontinue from study drug for any of the reasons lis ted below will undergo an 
EOT visit within 7 days of discontinuation of all study drugs. If routine laboratory tests 
(e.g.,  hematology, clinical chemistry) were completed ≤  7 days before the EOT Visit, these tests 
do not need to be repeated.  
However, the EOT visit may occur later than 7 days after discussion with the Medical Monitor 
for specific circumstances, such as prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If the EOT Visit did not occur until 
30 days (±  7 days) or later after the last dose of pamiparib and TMZ, the EO T Visit may also be 
used as the Safety Follow -up Visit.  
Patients with a required EOT visit may discontinue study drug for any of the following reasons:  
• Disease progression

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 • Investigator decision  
• Adverse event(s)  
• Pregnancy  
• Patient withdrew consent for study drug 
− Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from study drug at any time  
− Patients may continue to participate in the Follow -up Phase, if the patient 
withdraws consent from the Treatment Phase  
• Start of other anticancer  therapy  
• Patient noncompliance  
Study site staff should first counsel patients who are significantly noncompliant 
(e.g.,  missing 2 treatment cycles) on the importance of study drug compliance and 
drug accountability. The investigator may, in consultation with the medical monitor, 
discontinue p atients from treatment who are consistently noncompliant  
The reason for discontinuation from study drug will be recorded on the eCRF.  
All the assessments performed for the EOT visit are listed in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  1 Table  1). 
The visit at which the assessment showed progressive disease may be used as the EOT visit 
provided that all required assessments were performed. A CT does not ha ve to be repeated at the 
EOT visit if it was performed within [ADDRESS_418475] occurred after the patient 
discontinued from the study drugs as well  as concomitant medications. The investigator or 
his/her designee will also contact [CONTACT_338534]. A laboratory assessment is only 
required if the  patient had an ongoing laboratory abnormality at the previous visit that the 
investigator considered to be related to study drugs.  
8.5.2.  Efficacy Follow -Up  
Patients who were not discontinued from study drugs due to disease progression and meet 
criteria otherwise (e .g., discontinued for AE and no new anticancer  therapy) will be followed 
every 8  weeks (± 7  days) until disease progression, administrative issues, start of other anticancer  
therapy or any other reason listed in Section  8.4, whichever occurs first.

8.5.3.  Survival Follow -Up  
Patients enrolled during the dose expansion phase of the study will be followed for survival and 
further anticancer  therapy information post progression via phone c ontact (with the patient’s 
guardian, if applicable) or other means (e .g., clinic visit or review of medical records) 
approximately every 3 months ( Appendix  1 Table  1). 
8.5.4.  Lost to Follow -Up  
If attempts to contact [CONTACT_338535], additional attempts should be 
made to obtain protocol -required follow -up information. It may be possible to obtain the 
information from other contacts, such as referring physicians or relatives. Attempts of contact 
[CONTACT_338536]’s source documents. If a patient cannot be contact[CONTACT_75126][INVESTIGATOR_338485], the patient will be considered lost to follow -up, and death information should be 
obtained through a public record search if local agencies permit.  
8.6. End of Study for Individual Patients  
Patients who end participation in the study do not contribute additional data at any subsequent 
visits (including the EOT and all follow -up visits). Pati ents who end participation in the study 
may do so under the following circumstances:  
• Patient withdrew  consent for study participation  
− Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from the study at any time.  
• Lost to  follow -up 
• Death  
• Study termination by  [CONTACT_3211]  
• Other, as per the discretion of the sponsor or health authority  
The reason for discontinuation from study participation will be recorded on the eCRF.  
8.7. End of Study  
The end of study is defined as the timepoint when the final data point is collected from t he last 
patient in the study. This is when the last patient dies, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow up. 
Alternatively, the end of study is when the sponsor decides to terminate the study.  
The sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study 
early include but are not limited to the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to patients  
• Overall patient enrollment is unsatisfactory

operating procedures (SOPs), working practice do cuments, and applicable regulations and 
guidelines. Site audits may be made periodically by [CONTACT_456]’s or the contract research 
organization’s (CRO’s) qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function 
from the study team responsible f or conduct of the study.  
9.1. Data Collection  
Data required by [CONTACT_338537] (EDC) 
system that is compliant with all regulatory requirements or transmitted to BeiGene by [CONTACT_338538], as applica ble.  
Data collection in the eCRF must follow the instructions described in the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines (eCCGs). The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting 
of all clinical data entered in the eCRF. The investigator or designee as identified on Form FDA 
[ADDRESS_418479] parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized 
representatives of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
9.2. Data Management/Coding  
All final patient data, both eCRF and external data (e.g., laboratory data), collected according to 
the protocol, will be stored at BeiGene at the end of the study.  
Standard procedures (including following data review guidelines, computerized validation to 
produce queries, and maintenance of an audit file which includes all database modifications) will 
be followed to support accurate data collection. Data will be reviewed for outliers, logic, data 
inconsistencies, and completeness.  
During the course of the study, a study monitor will make site visits to review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs against indiv idual patient’s medical records, and ensure that the 
study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  
eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure tha t patient confidentiality is maintained. Checking the eCRFs 
for completeness, clarity, and cross checking with source documents is required to monitor the 
progress of the study. Direct access to source data is also required for inspections and audits and 
will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA®). Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organiza tion Drug 
Dictionary (WHO -DD). Concomitant diseases/medical history will be coded using the 
MedDRA®.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 10. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
10.1. Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  Definition and Reporting of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of a n AE include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug adminis tration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a concurrent medicat ion (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory results, and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the AE  or SAE. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_69780]. In this instance, all patient identifiers  will be blinded on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_1091].   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study. AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded  based upon the NCI  CTCAE v4.03.  
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations 
only, intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147064] d, disabling, limiting self -
care ADL  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2
BGB -290-103 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 Note: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or 
life-threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_338539]. Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations from the sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section  10.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drugs and the 
occurrence of each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug will 
be considered and investigated. The investiga tor will also consult the Pamiparib Investigator’s 
Brochure  [59] and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in th e determination of his/her 
assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always makes assessme nt of causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the 
SAE report/eCRF to the sponsor since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when 
determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_338486] y in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE report/eCRF accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_1694] “related” or 
“not related”. An AE is considered related  if there is “a  reasonable possibility”  that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest 
possible causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, 
including:  
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the adminis tration of study drug(s)/study 
procedure  
• Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
• Mechanism of action of the study drugs  
• Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ‘related’ to study drug if any of the following are met:  
• There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  
• There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely.  
• There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the AE occurred within 
a reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of 
other factors may have contributed to the AE (e .g., the patient’s clinical condition or 
other concomitant AEs).  
An AE should be considered ‘u nrelated’ to study drug if any of the following are met:  
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2
BGB -290-103 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 • An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the study drug and 
the onset of the AE (e.g., the AE occurred either before or too long after 
administration of the product for it to b e considered product -related)  
• A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is biologically implausible 
(e.g., death as a passenger in an automobile accident)  
• A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE is present (e.g., typi[INVESTIGATOR_338487] a concomitant drug and/or typi[INVESTIGATOR_5194] -related AE)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the pat ient’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_69846]/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the A E or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up or the patient 
withdraws consent. Once resolved, the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated. 
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigati ons as may be 
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request tha t the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient dies during particip ation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report/eCRF, 
with all ch anges signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The updated SAE report/eCRF should  be 
re-sent to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  10.5.1 .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, CBC, coagulation, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs, X -rays, or vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_338540] y meet the definition of an AE (as 
defined in Section  10.1.1 ) or an SAE (as defined in Section  10.2).  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start 
of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being 
studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_338541]’s 
condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and  do not worsen, will not be

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 reported as AEs or SAEs. They should only be reported as AEs or SAEs if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, need active intervention, require dos e interruption or discontinuation or are 
clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
The investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is cl inically significant.  
10.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does not refer to an AE 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338488]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69783] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the AE 
is serious. When in doubt as to whethe r “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an SAE.  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience consi derations is not considered an SAE.  
− Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience, is not considered an SAE.  
• Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a significant medical AE by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator based on medical 
judgement (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
The following are NOT considered SAEs:

from baseline  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations  
• Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience  
10.3. Definition of a Suspected Unexpected  Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is a serious adverse reaction that is both 
unexpected (i.e.,  not present in the study drug’s reference safety information) and meets the 
definition of a serious adverse drug reaction , the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with those noted in the Pamiparib Investigator’s Brochure . [59] 
10.4. Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capturing Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events  
10.4.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until [ADDRESS_418481] questions:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
10.5. Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
10.5.1.  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF (and SAE 
report, as applicable), rather than the individu al signs and symptoms (e.g., record only hepatitis 
rather than elevated transaminases, bilirubin, or jaundice). However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reportin g, each individual AE should be recorded as an SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE 
report, if applicable). If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should replace the individual 
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2
BGB -290-103 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 signs and/or symptoms as the AE term on the eCRF (and SAE report, if applicab le), unless the 
signs/symptoms are clinically significant.  
10.5.2.  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other AEs (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of AEs) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For ex ample, if severe vomiting is known to result in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as the SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE 
report, if applicable). However, if a patient initially has a non -serious AE, and it subsequently 
becomes an SAE, bo th AEs should be reported separately on the eCRF. The onset date of the 
non-serious AE should be recorded as the start date of the non -serious AE. The onset date of the 
SAE should be recorded as the start date when the non -serious AE becomes an SAE.  
10.5.3.  Persi stent or Recurring Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
timepoint s. Such AEs should only be recorded once on the AE eCRF (and SAE report, if 
applicable). If a persistent AE worsens in grade, it should be recorded as a new AE on the eCRF 
(and a stop date should be recorded in the previous AE).  
A recurrent AE is one that  occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoint s, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded separately on the eCRF (and SAE 
report, if applicable).  
10.5.4.  Disease Progression  
Disease progression is measured as an efficacy endpoint a nd is not considered to be an AE. 
However, if there are separate identifiable clinical sequelae that result from disease progression, 
those sequelae are reportable as AEs. For instance, a patient with pleural effusion presents with 
shortness of breath. The  cause of the shortness of breath is a pleural effusion resulting from 
disease progression. The AE term should be reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease 
progression or metastasis to lungs. If a patient has a seizure that is determined to be asso ciated 
with a brain metastasis, the term “seizure” should be recorded as the AE instead of disease 
progression or brain metastasis. If a patient experienced multi -organ failure due to disease 
progression, the term “multi -organ failure” should be reported a s the AE instead of disease 
progression. Deaths that are assessed by [CONTACT_338542]. They 
should not be reported as an SAE. If deat hs are assessed by [CONTACT_338543], whether they are assessed as related or not related to the study drug, they 
should be reported as SAE immediately.  
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to disease progression, it should be 
reported as an AE.  
10.5.5.  Death  
Death is an outcome, not an event. If an AE/SAE results in death, then the term of the AE that 
caused or contributed to fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept. If the 
cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record 
“unexplained death”.

10.6.1.  Timeframes for Submitting Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events will be reported promptly (within 24 h ours) to the sponsor or designee as 
described in Table  4 and the Study Manual once the investigator determines that the AE meets

information to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_418483] all information regarding an SAE, he/she is not to wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE and 
completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is receive d. The 
investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .The sponsor w ill provide contact [CONTACT_338544].  
10.6.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section  10.5.[ADDRESS_418484] under 
clinical investigation. The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, 
will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/I EC. 
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be submitted to all applicable regulatory 
authorities and investigators for pamiparib studies.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up safety report or other safety information 
(e.g.,  revised Investigator’s Brochure) from the sponsor, the investigator or designated 
responsible person is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC. The investigator should 
place copi[INVESTIGATOR_69784].  
Version .[ADDRESS_418485] dose of study drug, a 
pregnancy report form should be completed and expedi tiously submitted to the sponsor to 
facilitate outcome follow -up. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded 
to the sponsor. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any premat ure termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether acc idental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should always be reported as an 
SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
10.8. Expedited Reporting to Health Author ities, Ethics Committees, and 
Investigators  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify 
and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, investigators, IRBs 
and IECs based on applicable legislation.

All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_338545]. Details  of the statistical analyses will be included in a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
11.1. Primary, Secondary, and Exploratory Study Endpoints  
Please refer to Section  [ADDRESS_418486] (e.g. objective response rate and disease 
control rate).  
11.2.1.  Analysis Populations  
Safety Population includes all patients who received any dose of pamiparib and/or TMZ. The 
Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Efficacy Evaluable Population includes patients in the Safety Population w ho had measurable 
disease (or evaluable disease for patients enrolled into the dose escalation phase) at baseline (or 
prostate cancer patients as per inclusion criteri on 14f) and had at least one post -baseline tumor 
assessment unless discontinued treatment  due to clinical progression or death prior to tumor 
assessment.  
DLT Evaluable Population includes patients who received ≥ 70% of each study drug during the 
DLT assessment window and had sufficient safety evaluation. Additionally, patients who had a 
DLT ev ent during the DLT assessment window despi[INVESTIGATOR_338466] < 70% of the scheduled dose 
will also be considered evaluable.  
PK Population includes all patients for whom valid pamiparib PK parameters can be estimated.  
11.2.2.  Patient Disposition  
The number of patients enrolled, treated, discontinued from study drug, and those with major 
protocol deviations will be counted by [CONTACT_9084]. The primary reason for study drug discontinuation 
will be summarized according to the categories in the eCRF. The end of study status (aliv e, dead, 
withdrew consent, or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff date will be summarized using the data 
from the eCRF.  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_338546].  
11.2.3.  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_338547]. Continuous variables include age, weight, vital signs, time

group (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years), race, disease stage, ECOG -PS, prior line of therapy in the 
metastatic setting, and geographic region.  
11.2.4.  Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the WHO -DD drug codes. 
Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate anatomical therapeutic 
chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification. Prior and concomitant medications 
will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_338548] (CSR) for this 
protocol. Prior medications will be defined as medications stopped before the first dose of study 
drug. Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that (1) started before the first 
dose of study drug and  were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started 
on or after the date of the first dose of study drug up to 30  days after the patient’s last dose. A 
listing of prior and concomitant medications will be included in the CSR of thi s protocol.  
11.2.5.  Efficacy Analyses  
No formal hypothesis testing is planned in this Phase 1b study.  
For solid tumor s other than prostate cancer, tumor assessment based on investigator assessment 
according to RECIST v1.1 will be used to calculate ORR, DCR, PFS, and DOR, as well as 
timepoint estimate PFS -6m. Overall survival (OS) and OS -6m will be summarized as well. For 
patients with ovarian cancer, tumor response may also be assessed by [CONTACT_338549] -125 (CA -125) in combination with 
RECIST  v1.1 (Appendix  9).  
For patients with prostate cancer, PSA and tumor lesions will be evaluated together to determine 
the tumor response according to PCWG2 criteria ( Appendix  10). 
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response (BOR) of CR or  
PR, where BOR is defined as the best response recorded from the first dose of study drugs until 
data cut, disease progression, or start of new anti -neoplastic treatment. Binomial exact 90% and 
95% confidence interval s will be calculated for ORR in each co hort. 
DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with BOR of CR, PR, and SD. It will be 
summarized similarly as ORR.  
PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drugs to disease progression or 
death, whichever occurs first.  
PFS censoring rule will follow FDA Guidance for Industry, Clinical Trial Endpoints for 
Approval of Cancer drugs and Biologics (2007). Patients who have a clinical determination of 
progression should undergo imaging and laboratory assessments, if possible, to correlate 
radiographic findings with the clinical findings. Data for patients without disease progression or 
death by [CONTACT_338550]. Data f rom 
patients who are lost to follow -up prior to d ocumented disease progression will be censored at 
the last tumor assessment date when the patient is known to be progression -free. More details 
will be given in the SAP.  
Version .[ADDRESS_418487] dose of study drugs to death.  
Time to event variables PFS, DOR, and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
method. KM estimates of PFS, DOR, and OS will be plotted over time. Median PFS, DOR, and 
OS, if estimable, in each cohort will be pres ented, along with their 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals using a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method. The PFS -6m and OS -6m, 
defined as the percentages of patients in the analysis population who remain alive and 
progression  free at 6  months (or alive at 6 months for OS -6m), will be estimated using the KM 
method along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval constructed using Greenwood’s 
formula.  
Maximum tumor shrinkage per patient will be presented in waterfall plots.  
Primary analysis of efficac y endpoints will be carried out based on the maturity of the efficacy 
and safety data in the study, which will be determined by [CONTACT_456].  
ORR and DCR will be summarized in the specified subgroups: sex, age group (< 65 versus ≥ 
65), race, disease stage, ECOG -PS (0 versus 1), number of prior lines of therapy, and geographic 
region.  
11.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
For patients who contributed full PK profiles up to 48 hours on Cycle 1 Day 1, and up to 6 hours 
on Cycle 1 Day 15 ( Section  8.3.1 ), the following PK parameters will be derived: C max, Tmax, t1/2, 
apparent clearance of the drug from plasma (CL/F), and V z/F. 
For the remaining patients, population PK a nalysis may be carried out for pamiparib to include 
plasma concentrations from this study in an existing model. PK parameters such as C min will be 
summarized, and additional PK parameters such as CL/F and AUC may be derived from the 
population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653]. Population PK analysis may be reported separately 
from the final CSR.  
Trough and/or peak plasma concentrations of TMZ will be summarized and compared with 
appropriate historical control.  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints ) analysis may be carried out if supported by 
[CONTACT_33653].  
11.2.7.  Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory endpoints include blood and tumor biomarkers and will be analyzed using the Safety 
Population. The correlation of predictive biomarkers with efficacy endpoints for study t reatment 
will be explored.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 11.3. Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_338551] v4.03 . 
Laboratory values (CBC, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital, physical e xams, 
and ECGs findings will also be used in determining the safety.  
11.3.1.  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to each study drug will be summarized in each cohort descriptively as the 
number of cycles received (number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), 
cumulative total dose received per patient (mg), dose intensity, and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of patients requiring dose reductions, dose delay, and drug 
discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994]. Frequency of dose reduction and 
dose delay will be summarized by [CONTACT_10611].  
Patient data listings will be provided for all dosing records and for calculated summary statistics.  
11.3.2.  Dose -limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicity in the DLT evaluation period will be used to determine the dose and 
schedule of pamiparib plus TMZ in the expansion cohorts. The DLT events will be summarized 
descriptively at each combination dosing level in the DLT evaluable Popula tion.  
11.3.3.  Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the eCRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using MedDRA®. Adverse events will be coded to 
MedDRA® (Version 19.0 or higher) lower level term closest to the v erbatim term. The linked 
MedDRA® preferred term (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC) are also captured in the 
database.  
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that had an onset date on or 
after the first dose of study drugs up t o 30 days following study drug discontinuation or was 
worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment). Only those AEs that were treatment 
emergent will be included in summary tables. All AEs, treatment emergent or otherwise, will be 
presented in patient  data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_3592]. A patient will be counted only once by [CONTACT_338552]  v.4.03  within an SOC an d PT, even if the patient experienced more than one TEAE 
within a specific SOC and PT. The number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_53429]. Treatment -related AEs include those events 
considered by [CONTACT_338553]. Serious adverse events, deaths, TEAE with Grade 3 or 
above, related TEAE and TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or d ose 
delay will be summarized.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 11.3.4.  Laboratory Analyses  
Clinical laboratory (i.e., CBC, serum chemistry, and qualitative urinalysis) values will be 
evaluated for each laboratory parameter by [CONTACT_9084]. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged 
and identified as those outside (above or below) the normal range. Reference (normal) ranges for 
laboratory parameters will be included in the CSR for this protocol. Descriptive summary 
statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous 
variables; n [%] for categorical variables) for laboratory parameters and their changes from 
baseline will be calculated. Laboratory values will be summarized by [CONTACT_338554] -
baseline visit.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI CTCAE v.4.03  will be summarized by [CONTACT_3596]. In the summary of laboratory parameters by [CONTACT_3229], parameters with CTCAE 
grading in both high and low directions (e.g., calcium, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium) 
will be summa rized separately.  
11.3.5.  Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital sign parameters (SBP and DBP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
temperature, weight) and changes from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_296303]. Vital signs 
will be listed by [CONTACT_69867] . 
11.3.6.  Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram assessments will be performed at Screening and during BGB -290 PK 
collection timepoint s (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts 1 -5) or at Screening, EOT 
and as clinically indicated (Cohort 6) as specified in the Sc hedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  1 Table  1). Change  from baseline to each post -baseline visit in ECG findings will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_234530]/or timepoint . Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters and changes 
from baseline will be presented.  
11.4. Sample Size Consideration  
Approximately 250 patients (50 in the dose escalation phase and 200 in the dose expansion 
phase) will be enrolled.  A sample size of 20-25 patients in an expansion cohort will provide the 
half width of the 90% confidence interval of the ORR approximately  13% to 20% when the 
observed ORR is a pproximately  40%. Hence, the low bound is above 20%. This is considered 
adequate in the prelimina ry assessment of anticancer activity of pamiparib and TMZ 
combination therapy. An expansion cohort can be further expanded to confirm efficacy.

consent. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by  [CONTACT_338555]’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent.  
Informed consent will be obtained before the patient can participate in the study. The case 
history or clinical records for each patient shall document the in formed consent process and that 
written informed consent was obtained before participation in the study.  
The ICFs will be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when new 
information becomes available that may affect the willingness of th e patient to participate. The 
final revised IRB/IEC -approved consent forms must be provided to the sponsor for health 
authority submission purposes.  
Patients must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICFs (or to a significant new 
information/ findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/IEC policy) during 
their participation in the study. For any updated or revised ICFs, the case history or clinical 
records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that wr itten informed 
consent was obtained using the updated/revised ICFs for continued participation in the study.  
A copy of each signed ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain  in each patient’s study file or in the site 
file and must be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534].  
12.2.4.  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
As indicated in Section  10.1, the investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations. Furthermore, the 
investigator may be required  to provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at 
his/her study center and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB. Such periodic safety 
updates and notifications are the responsibility of the investigator and not of the sponsor.  
12.2.5.  Conf identiality

In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study either at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons including, but 
not limited to, safety or ethical issues or significant n on-compliance. If the sponsor determines 
such action is needed, the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons 
for taking such action) at that time. When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification 
to the investigato r of the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all other investigators and/or institutions conducting the study 
if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons and will also inform the regulatory 
authoritie s of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If 
required by [CONTACT_5279], the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and 
provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely  discontinued, all study data must be returned to the sponsor. In 
addition, arrangements will be made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the 
applicable sponsor procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutio ns will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between the investigator and the sponsor.  
12.5. Records Retention and Study Files  
12.5.1.  Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of t he study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) patient 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study  file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) would include (although not be limited to) 
the following: patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s  notes, appointment book, 
Version .[ADDRESS_418492] be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed 
(e.g., audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facil ity, supporting systems, and personnel. Where permitted 
by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in 
a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to 
be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must assure that all reproductions are 
legible, are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval 
standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Further more, the investigator must 
ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality 
control process exists for making these reproductions.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these r ecords to comply 
with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_69882], or the spon sor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the 
retention period will default to [ADDRESS_418493] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, 
but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility or tr ansfer of ownership of the 
records in the event the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriat e copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786].  
Biological samples at the conclusion of this study may be retained as outlined in the agreement 
with the CRO managing the biological samples, a period of up to 10 years or as allowed by [CONTACT_266277]/IEC,  whichever is shorter.  
12.5.2.  Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
When the clinical study report is completed, the sponsor will provide the major findings of the 
study to the investigator.  
In addition, details of the study drug assignment will be provided to the investigator to enable 
him/her to review the data to determine the outcome of the study for his/her patient(s).  
The sponsor will not routinely inform the investigator or patient the test results, because the 
information generated fr om this study will be preliminary in nature, and the significance and 
scientific validity of the results will be undetermined at such an early stage of research.

If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes ownership provisions 
inconsistent with this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that 
contract’s ownership provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
All information provided by [CONTACT_338565] (other than a patient’s medical records) will be kept by [CONTACT_69888]. This information and data will not be used by [CONTACT_338566].  
These restrictions do not apply to:  
• Information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator or 
study center personnel  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in confidence t o an IEC/IRB solely for the 
evaluation of the study  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical 
care to a patient  
• Study results which may be published as described in Section  12.2.[ADDRESS_418494]’s provisions shall apply rather than this stateme nt. 
12.7. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities  
12.7.1.  Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the study monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the eCR Fs for 
consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the 
data being entered on them. The monitor shou ld have access to any patient records needed to 
verify the entries on the eCRFs. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure 
that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

1. For Dose Expansion Only : Patients with an unknown germline or somatic BRCA  mutation or unknown HRD for Expansion Cohorts 1 (ovarian cancer), 
2 (TNBC),  3 (mCRPC) and Coho rt 6 (multiple indications ) will undergo pre -screening for HRD testing for a period of up to 8 weeks prior to eligibility 
screening ( Section  8.1). A separate pre -screening informed consent must be obtained. Any tissues taken during pre -screening period will not be re -
collected during the screening period.  
For Dose Escalation O nly: Cycle 1 encompasses the DLT assessment window, and assessments of Day 1 of Cycle 2 at the end of the DLT assessment 
window are required for a patient to be DLT -evaluable. Assessments shown for Cycle 3 apply to all subsequent cycles except for MRI that occurs  every 
second cycle (every 8 weeks).

were performed. If routine laboratory tests (e.g.,  hematology, clinical chemistry) were completed ≤  [ADDRESS_418521]/MRI does not have to be repeated if it was performed within [ADDRESS_418522] to be repeated if it was performed within 14 days of the  EOT visit.  If the EOT Visit did not occur 
until 30  days (±  7 days) or later after the last dose of pamiparib and TMZ, the EOT Visit may also be used as the Safety Follow -up Visit.  
4. All patients who permanently discontinue study drugs will have a safety fol low-up approximately [ADDRESS_418523] occurred after the patient discontinued from the study drugs. If the patient does not require any labo ratory assessments, the 
investigator or his/her desig nee will contact [CONTACT_338568].  (Protocol Section  8.5.1 ). 
5. Following permanent discontinuation of study drugs and/or Safety Follow -up parts of the study, every effort should be made to follow up with all patients 
by [CONTACT_122919] 3 months for their s urvival status until patient death (Protocol Section  8.5.3 ).

CHILDBEARING POTENTI AL 
Contraception guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group (CTFG) recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. 
These methods include the following:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral, injectable, implantable  
• An intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatment). Total sexual abstinence 
should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line with the Patient’s usual 
and preferred lifest yle. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to 
study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note, barrier contraception (i ncluding male and female condoms with or without spermicide) 
is not considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this method must be 
used in combination with another acceptable method listed above.  
Definition of childbearing potential  
Childbearing potential is defined as being physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. No 
childbearing potential is defined as one or both of the following criteria:  
• Surgically sterile (bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy)  
• Post-menopausal, defined as  
− ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR  
− < 55 years of age with no spontaneous  menses for ≥ [ADDRESS_418534]-menopausal follicle -stimulating (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/mL

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 112 APPENDIX  5. THE RESPONSE EVALUAT ION CRITERIA IN SOLI D 
TUMORS (RECIST) GUID ELINES  
The text below was obtained from the following reference:  
Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, Schwartz LH, Sargent D, Ford R, et al. New response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumors: revised RECIST guideline (Version 1.1). Eur J Cancer 
2009;45:228 -47. 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in t his study using the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee (Version 1.1). 
Changes in only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteri a. Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the 
criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used 
because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Mu st be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_418535] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
slice thickness and a minimum of 10  mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial).  
• [ADDRESS_418536] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_28638])  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_418537] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including sm all lesions (longest diameter ≥ 10 to < 15 mm 
with conventional techniques or < [ADDRESS_418538] scan), are considered non -measurable 
disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic  involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_338571] -measurable.  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence 
or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_338572].  
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2
BGB -290-103 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 113 • Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic  lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be  considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are no rmal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥[ADDRESS_418539] in which the ima ge is 
obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may 
be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an 
abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 m m has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measura ble dimension of the disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required, and

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 114 these lesions  should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g., “mul tiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during fo llow-up. Imaging -based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_12148].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and P10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_338573], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progressi on is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
CT, MRI: CT is the best cu rrently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_418540] slice thicknes s 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used  as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from  one assessment to the 
next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_118582]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in studies where recurrence following c omplete response or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete response. Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for 
their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 115 guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA respo nse (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been published. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
has developed CA -[ADDRESS_418541] -line studies in ovarian cancer.  
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a 
potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment can be considered if th e measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive 
disease.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for progressive d isease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if complete response 
criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis  of < [ADDRESS_418542] achieve 
a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD, and progressive disease, the actual short axis measurement of 
the nodes is to be included in the sum of tar get lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure”. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However,  sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scans that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small to 
measure .” When this occurs, i t is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF. If it is the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be 
Version .[ADDRESS_418543] a definable size when normal and are frequently 
surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a l ymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_418544] slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varyi ng CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is 
potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses 
or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to  
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target  lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion .” 
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoint s specified in the protocol.  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker levels. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -progressive disease: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non -target 
lesions. (Note: The appearance of on e or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
When the patient also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in no n-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
“increase” in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not suffic ient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare. 
When the patient has only non -measura ble disease: This circumstance arises in some phase III 
studies when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease. The same general 
concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment t o factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease burden. 
Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions 
are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare progressive disease for measurable dise ase: i.e., an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increased 
diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” 
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2

Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 117 to “large ,” an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy”. If “unequivocal 
progression” is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall progressive disease at 
that point . While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, 
the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be 
substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes d isease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions. However, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to  differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). This is particularly 
important when t he patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it 
is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s br ain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of progressive disease even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -
up evaluation will clarify if it tr uly represents new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporat e the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible “new” disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET 
imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, wi th a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
progressive disease based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
progre ssive disease. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new 
site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there 
is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of progressive disease will be 
the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not progressive disease.  
Evaluation of Best Overal l Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study until the end of 
the study taking into account any requirement for confirmation. On occasion a response may not 
be documented until after the end of therapy, so protocols should be clear if post -treatment 
Version .0 VV-CLIN-021494 2
BGB -290-103 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 3.0  19 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 119 In studies where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ timepoint  assessments may 
complicate best response determination. The analysis plan fo r the study must address how 
missing data/assessments will be clearly explained in determination of response. For example, in 
most studies it is reasonable to consider a patient with timepoint  responses of PR -NE-PR as a 
confirmed response. Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response, it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and unevaluability” are study specific and 
shou ld be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment cycle).  
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish local lesion from normal tissue. When 
the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination , it is recommended that 
biopsy be conducted before the local lesion is assigned a status of complete response. FDG -PET 
may be used to confirm a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a local 
radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_338574]. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead 
to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy (including resolution/sensitivity). 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions, cystic changes, 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
 
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/DURATION OF RESPONSE  
In non -randomized studies where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has  
been confirmed in such studies. However, in all other circumstances, i.e., in randomized studies 
(phase II or III) or studies where stable disease or progressive disease are the primary endpoints, 
confirmation of response is not required since it will not  add value to the interpretation of study 
results. However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation may increase the 
importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies which are not 
blinded. In the case of SD, m easurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6 to 8 weeks).  
The duration of overall response  is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded on study). The duration of overall complete response is measured from the t ime 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease 
is objectively documented.  
The duration of stable disease  is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized studies, 
from date of randomizatio n) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
Version .[ADDRESS_418545] sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of 
progressive disease). The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varie s in different 
studies and diseases. If the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period 
of time is an endpoint in a particular study, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval 
required between two measurements for deter mination of stable disease. Note: The duration of 
response and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are influenced by [CONTACT_118583] -up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this guideline to define 
a standard fol low-up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters 
including disease types and stages, treatment cycle, and standard practice. However, these 
limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into account if compar isons 
between studies are to be made.

3.1 Synopsis 
Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-B lind, Parallel-Group, Active and 
Placebo Controlled Study to Assess the Safet y, Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral DFD -29 
Extended Release  Capsules for the Treatment of Inflammatory Lesions of Rosacea Over 
16 Weeks 
Name [CONTACT_790]: [CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories Ltd., India  
Name [CONTACT_2756]: DFD-29 Extended Release Capsules  
Name [CONTACT_3261]: Minocycline HCl 
Objectives 
Primary : To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of oral DFD-29 (Minocycline HCl 
Extended Release Capsules) , 40 mg (hereafter referred to as DFD- 29) compared to placebo in 
the treatment of papulopustular rosacea for 16 weeks 
Secondary : To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of DFD- 29 compared to  
Doxycycline capsules 40 mg ( an authorized generic of Oracea® in the [LOCATION_002])  in the 
treatment of papulopustular  rosacea for 16 weeks  
Study Design: This is a 16-week, multicenter, ra ndomized, parallel-group, double-blind, 
controlled study. After assessi ng eligibility during a screening period of up to [ADDRESS_122440] 18 years ol d who are diagnosed with moderate to severe 
papulopustular rosacea will be randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to DFD-29 (40 mg), D oxycycline 
capsules  [ADDRESS_122441] visits are scheduled at Screening, Ba seline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
Clinical assessments of  efficacy will be conducted based on Investigator’s Global Assessment 
modified scale without erythema (IGA), Clin ician’s Erythema Assessme nt (CEA), and total 
inflammatory lesion count at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 compared to Baseline.  
Laboratory assessments of blood (hematology and biochemistry) and urine (routine tests) will 
be conducted at Screening and Week 16 (end of st udy [EOS] or early termination) to assess for 
any changes in the safety para meters. Other safety assessments  include vital signs, physical 
examination, urine pregnancy tests (for females of childbearing potential), and collection of AE 
data.  
The impact of the treatment on the quality of life  (QoL) of the subjects will be assessed using 
the rosacea -specific tool RosaQoL in addition to the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at 
Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16.  
Number of Study Centers: Approximately 29 study centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US) to enroll 
a total of approximately 320 subjects.  
Duration of Participation: Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 
[ADDRESS_122442] signs the informed consent f orm (ICF) through the final 
contact. The screening period is up to 30 days and duration of treatment  is 16 weeks. 
Duration of Study: The study will require approximately 10 months from the beginning to the 
end of the study (first subject signing the ICF to last contact [CONTACT_110169]). 		

Protocol Template  Confidential MW501.T01 Version 2019OCT11 Key Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  Male and female subjects at least 18 years of age in good 
general he alth with a clinical diagnosis of papulopustular rosacea, IGA grade 3 (moderate) or 
grade 4 (severe)  at Baseline will be selected  to participate in the study. Subjects must have 15 
to 60 (both inclusive) inflammatory lesions (papul es and pustules) of rosacea over the face and 
not more than [ADDRESS_122443], Dose, Route of Administration, and Regimen: 
To maintain the double -blind design, all 3 study medications will be over- encapsulated with the 
original capsules enclosed within a second, larger  (size 0) capsule shell. 
Investigational product : DFD-29 (Minocycline Hydroc hloride Extended Release Capsules), 
40 mg ([CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories, Ltd. ) 
Active control : Doxycycline Capsules 40 mg [ an authorized generic of Oracea® in the United 
States  (marketed by [CONTACT_110170], Mason OH [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003])] 
Placebo : Capsules matching DFD- 29 with same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_110135] ([CONTACT_110229]’s Laboratories Ltd.)  
The study medication will be taken at a fixe d time of the day once a day for [ADDRESS_122444].  
Statistical Methods:   
Analysis Populations:  
x Intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects (i.e., assigned to a 
treatment group). The ITT population will be the pr imary population for the efficacy 
analysis. 
x Safety population includes subjects who receive d at least one dose of study medication 
and had at least one safety assessment post- Baseline. The safety population will be used 
for analysis of tolerability and safety variables.  
x Per-protocol population (PP) comprises all subjects who did not violate the protocol in 
a way that might affect the evaluati on of the effect of the study medic ation on the primary 
endpoint (without major protocol violations or deviations). Key protocol deviation 
categories that would influence the decision to include  a subject in the PP population at 
time of final review before study  database lock will be pre- specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).   
Sample Size:  The sample size was calculated based on  results of a Phase 2 study with orally 
administered DFD -29 (40 mg) in the treatment of i nflammatory lesions of papulopustular 
rosacea.  Based on the sample size ca lculations and an assumed dropout rate of 20%, the final 
planned sample size is [ADDRESS_122445] both placebo and D oxycycline 
capsules 40 mg in terms of efficacy on both co-primary endpoints.

Protocol Template  Confidential MW501.T01 Version 2019OCT11 6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background 
Rosacea is a chronic relapsing inflammatory cutane ous disorder, primarily of the convexities of 
the central face (cheeks, chin, nos e, and central forehead). The main clinical forms of the disease 
are erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (subtype 1), papulopustular rosacea (subtype 2), phymatous 
rosacea (subtype 3), and ocular rosacea (subtype 4) [ 25]. In addition to the classification system, 
the National Rosacea Society Expe rt Committee on the Classifi cation and Staging of Rosacea 
devised a standard method for assessing gr adations of the severity of rosacea [ 26]. This standard 
grading system is essential to perform researc h, analyze results, and compare data; provides a 
common reference for diagnosis, treatment, and asse ssment of results in clinical practice; and is 
the basis for the Investigator’s Global Assessment in rosacea.  
The accurate incidence of rosacea is not known but it is estimated by [CONTACT_110171] 16 million Americans suffer from the signs and symptoms of rosacea, and millions more may be in temporary remission [ 17]. An earlier preliminary study conducted in the US in 
2993 women aged between 10 and 70 years found a prevalence rate for rosacea of 16% in 
Caucasian women and an overall rosacea incidence of nearly 10% in the total population including 
Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians, and Indians [ 23]. A recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_110138] 1.6 5 per 1000 person-years in the [LOCATION_008] 
[18]. In 3052 and 3013 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years drawn from the general populations 
of [LOCATION_013] and Russia, respectively, the preva lence of rosacea was found to be 12.3% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 10.2-14.4) in Germ any and 5.0% (95% CI, 2.8-7.2) in Russia [ 21]. In a 
Swedish study in a non-selected population of 80 9 office employees (454 women and 309 men), 
81 people were diagnosed as having rosacea givi ng a prevalence of 10% (women 14%, men 5%) 
[2]. In a cross- sectional study of 348 subjects randomly selected from a working population ≥ 30 
years of age in Estonia, 78 (22%) had one  or more primary features of rosacea [ 1]. Rosacea is a 
chronic skin condition that disproportionately affects fair-skinned persons of European and Celtic 
origin. 
The pathogenesis of rosacea is poorly understood. Contributing factors may include immune and 
inflammatory abnormalities, vasc ular alterations, neurogenic dysregulation, presence of cutaneous 
microorganisms, ultraviolet (UV) damage, and skin barrier dysfunction [ 10, 14, 20, 24, 27]. 
Clinical features and trigger factors of rosacea indicate a complex dysregulation of inflammatory, 
vascular, and neuronal systems at  an early stage. Elevated leve ls of antimicrobial peptides 
(cathelicidins), processing enzymes (epi[INVESTIGATOR_110139] 5), proinflammatory 
cytokines, and toll-like receptors (TLR) seem  to play a role in maintaining chronic inflammation 
in rosacea, which may induce modification of dermal structures mediated by [CONTACT_110172]. Complex vascular m echanisms contribute to local vasodilation, 
angiogenesis, and tissue fibrosis in rosacea. Th e involvement of the nervous system is supported 
by [CONTACT_110173]. 
Consistent with its immuno-inflammatory and neurovascular pathophysiology, rosacea was found 
to be associated with seve ral autoimmune diseases [ 8], with cardiovascular disease risk factors and 
cardiovascular diseases [ 7, 15], with migraine [ 19], and with a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of 
depression and anxiety disorders [ 9, 13]. In addition, almost half of the rosacea subjects report a 
significant impairment in  their quality of life [ 3, 21]. Taking into consideration these findings and 
that about 50% of the subjects receive no rosacea care, effective treatmen t might contribute not 		

DFD-29-CD-004 Version: 2.[ADDRESS_122463] as oxygen scavengers, and impr ove epi[INVESTIGATOR_110140]. All of these 
biological activities could contribute to the ef fectiveness of low-dose tetracyclines in rosacea 
treatment. The use of tetracyclines was also found to be associated with a decreased incidence of 
vascular disease in veterans with rosacea [ 6]. 
Details about specific benefits and risks for subjec ts participating in this study may be found in the 
accompanying consent documents for this study.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with  the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and 
all applicable regulatory requirements. 
6.2 Rationale for the Study and Study Design 
6.2.1 Study Rationale 
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, dou ble-blind, parallel-group, active and placebo-
controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral DFD-29 (Minocycline 
Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules), 40 mg (hereafter referred to as DFD-29) for the 
treatment of papulopustular rosacea over [ADDRESS_122464] comm on form of the disease and represents a more 
inflammatory subtype. Papulopustular rosacea is ch aracterized by [CONTACT_110174]  a central facial distribution, but it can also 
present with telangiectasias (usually masked by [CONTACT_110175][INVESTIGATOR_110141]) and can occur 
concomitantly with acne vulgaris [ 25, 27]. Although multiple therapeutic options are available for 
the treatment of papulopustular ros acea, the most widely used systemic agents are oral tetracycline 
derivatives, particularly doxycycline and minocycline. 
The main concern with the long-term use of te tracyclines in rosacea ha s been antibacterial 
resistance. However, the recent findings that tetr acyclines exert anti-inflammatory effects and 
seem to be effective in papulopustular rosacea at  low sub-antimicrobial doses opens new options 
for its clinical use in this indication that warrant further investigation [ 10, 11, 12, 22]. Doxycycline 
and minocycline show a variety of biological actions independent of their antibiotic activity, 
including scavenging of oxygen radicals, anti -inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions, and 
inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Tetracyclines may reduce the 
inflammation associated with rosacea by  [CONTACT_110176] [ 10, 11, 12]. 
Minocycline modulates glutamate-induced excitotoxi city and has anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects th at proved beneficial in experimental models of 
various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatological, autoimmune, vascular, 
psychiatric, and neurological conditi ons, for which it has been postulated as an adjunctive therapy 
[4, 11, 12]. The lack of photosensitivity represents a potential advantage of minocycline for the 
treatment of papulopustular rosacea because doxycyc line exhibits a dose-related phototoxicity [ 5]. 
Minocycline demonstrated benefit in the trea tment of inflammatory lesions in subjects with 
rosacea [ 16, 22] and proved remarkably effective in de creasing serum C-reactive protein (CRP) 		

antimicrobial doses in improving the clinic al symptoms and reducing serum CRP in 
papulopustular rosacea has not been investigated. 
[CONTACT_23015]’s completed a Phase 2 study in November 2018, which evaluated the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of DFD-29 for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea over 16 weeks, in [LOCATION_013]. 
This study demonstrated a significantly great er efficacy with DFD-29 (40 mg and 20 mg) 
compared to placebo, and with DF D 29 (40 mg) compared to Oraycea® (Doxycycline Capsules 
40 mg) (EU product). Based on the assessment of clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs) as well as all other safety parameters, DFD-[ADDRESS_122465]. Reddy´s Laboratories Ltd. was safe 
and well tolerated.  
This Phase 3 study is intended to provide eff icacy data across a larger study population with 
approximately 29 study centers in the US. 
6.2.2 Dose Selection 
The proposed dose strength of DFD-29 to be evaluated in this study is 40 mg. The safety, efficacy, 
and tolerability of DFD-29 at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg were evaluated in the Phase 2 study referenced above. Based on the assessment on the clinical and laboratory AEs as well as other safety parameters, DFD-29 (40 mg) demonstrated no significant safety or tolerability issues and therefore is considered to be safe and well tolera ted when used in subjects with rosacea. 
Minocycline, along with doxycycline and tetracyc line, has found a place in dermatologists’ 
therapeutic armamentarium for treatment of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) in 
subjects with moderate to severe rosacea; howev er, only a sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline 
has been approved in the US for this indication.

risk. Discontinuation will be made at the discretion of the investigator or at the subject’s request.  
A subject must be discontinued from the study  and study medication for any of the following 
reasons: 
x The subject or legal representative withdraws consent 
x The subject becomes pregnant 
x The subject’s medication code is unblinded  
x There is a significant protocol violation or non-compliance with the protocol 
A subject may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
x AE, including intercurrent illness, for which the subject desires to discontinue treatment or 
the investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best interest to be discontinued  
x Condition worsens and requires alternative or supplemental therapy for treatment of 
rosacea during the study 
x Noncompliant use of the study medication 
x Lost to follow-up 
x Investigator discretion 
Discontinuation is permanent; after a subject has be en discontinued, he/she will not be allowed to 
enroll again. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study for an y reason, the Visit 7 (EOS or early termination) 
procedures should be completed and any outst anding data and study medication should be 
collected. Data, including the date and primary r eason for discontinuation, must be documented 
on the EOS electronic case report form (eCRF) and source document.  
If a subject discontinues the study at any time du e to an AE, the reason for discontinuation, the 
nature of the AE, and its clinical course must be fully documented. The investigator must strive to 
follow the subject until the AE has resolved, b ecome clinically insignificant, is stabilized, or the 
subject is lost to follow-up. For any SAE, follow procedures provided in Section 8.9.[ADDRESS_122482]’s case record form and included 
in the study report.  Any decision by [CONTACT_110177] a subject from the study for 
reasons of violation of inclusion/exclusion criteri a or protocol deviations should be discussed with 
the CRO/Sponsor medical monitor, as far as possible, prior to discontinuing the subject. 
As far as possible, investigators must advise s ubjects to refrain from consuming the prohibited 
medication (as specified in Table 8.1 ). In case a subject consumes  a prohibited concomitant 
medication or needs to take one, a joint decision will be taken by [CONTACT_110178] s ubject should continue in the study or be

Upon screening, the subject will be assigned a unique 5-digit subject number preceded by [CONTACT_110179] 
“S”, where the first [ADDRESS_122486] number that 
increments sequentially at  the site (i.e., S10-001, S10-002).   At the Baseline Visit (Visit 2/Day 1), 
subjects eligible for participation will retain the same subject number without the letter “S” 
preceding it (i.e., 10-001, 10-002).  All subjects will  retain this subject number for the remainder 
of the study.  Each subject will be dispensed a total of 4 bottles and will be randomly assigned a 
unique bottle number at each visit study medication is dispensed (Visit 2/ Day 1, Visit 4/Day 29, 
Visit 5/Day 57 and Visit 6/Day 85), using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 
Subjects who satisfy all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 
3:3:[ADDRESS_122487]. One capsule 
of the assigned study medication will be swallowed with 240 mL (1 glass) of still water on an 
empty stomach.  
Substances that can potentially interfere with  absorption of minocycline like antacids, 
multivitamins, or other products containing aluminum, magnesium and calcium, oral iron 
preparations, bismuth subsalicylate, and milk and other dairy products should be avoided from 1.5 
hours before to 3.0 hours after intake of study medication. 
The dosage regimen in this study is that approved for Doxycycline capsules 40 mg [ 28].  
8.4.4 Blinding of Study Medication 
A double-blind technique will be used. DFD-29, its matching placebo, and Doxycycline capsules 
40 mg are indistinguishable after over-encapsulati on. The investigator and study staff (including 
lab personnel), the subjects, the monitors, med ical monitors, the CRO personnel involved in 
clinical operations, and the s ponsor’s staff will remain blinded to the treatment until study closure.  
See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for a description of the method of unblinding a subject during the study if such 
action is warranted.

8.9.2 Definitions of Terms 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurr ence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug-related (21 Code  of Federal Regulations [CFR] 312.32 (a)). An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a drug, without 
any judgment about causality. 
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE)  is any AE temporally associated  with the use of a study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
AEs will be collected by [CONTACT_110187] m subjects, either verbal or recorded in the 
subject’s diary, by [CONTACT_110188], and by [CONTACT_110189]. All AEs from the time of 
signing of the ICF up to the EOS visit will be recorded. 
Adverse events include: 
x Exacerbation of a pre-existing disease. 
x Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-e xisting epi[INVESTIGATOR_110150]. 
x Disease or medical condition detected or dia gnosed after study drug administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. 
x Continuous persistent disease or symptoms pre sent at Baseline that worsen following the 
start of the study. 
x Events considered by [CONTACT_110190]-mandated procedures. 
x Abnormal assessments, e.g., vital signs or physical  examination findings, must be reported 
as AEs if they represent a clinically significa nt finding that was not present at Baseline or 
worsened during the course of the study. 
x Laboratory test abnormalities must be reported  as AEs if they represent a clinically 
significant finding, symptomatic or not, which was not present at Baseline or worsened 
during the course of the study or led to dose reduction, interruption or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. 
Adverse events do not include: 
x Medical or surgical procedure, e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion. 
However, the event leading to the procedure is an  AE. If this event is serious, the procedure 
must be described in the SAE narrative. 
x Pre-existing disease or medical condition that does not worsen. 		

[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is defined as any AE for which there is reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected Adverse Event 
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or seve rity that has been observed or, if an Investigator Brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described elsewhere (for example, 
approved prescribing information) (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in th e view of the investigator or sponsor, results in 
any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): 
x Death 
x Life-threatening AE (Note: the term “life -threatening” as used here refers to an event that 
in the view of the investigator or sponsor places  the subject at immediate risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not include an AE or SAE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have cau sed death [21 CFR 312.32(a)]) 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411] 
x Persistent or significant incapacity or substa ntial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
x Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Any “other” important medical event.  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110151], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The following are not considered an SAE: 
x Treatment on an emergency or outpatient basis fo r an event not fulfilling the definition of 
seriousness given above and not  resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
x The following reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110152], and therefore not SAEs:  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110153] s urgery, social and/or convenience reasons. 
o Standard monitoring of a pre-existing disease or medical condition that did not 
worsen, e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110154] a subject with stable 
angina pectoris. 		

elicited from subjects. Subjects having AEs will  be monitored with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory tests, as deter mined by [CONTACT_093]. 
AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow-up  results must be recorded in the eCRF, as well 
as in the subject’s source docum entation. Follow-up laboratory results should be filed with the 
subject’s source documentation.  
For all AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from the study and SAEs, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests w ill be repeated as clinically a ppropriate until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s). 
All laboratory assessments will be performed centr ally at a certified laboratory selected by [CONTACT_103]. The clinical laboratory values will be reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_110192].  
8.9.4 Assessment of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity 
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions: Mild: Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does not 
require intervention. 
Moderate: Event may make subject uncomfortab le; performance of daily activities may be 
influenced; intervention may be needed. 
Severe: Event may cause noticeable discomfort; usua lly interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or intervention is usually needed.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality 
AEs should be assessed by [CONTACT_110193] a reasonable possibility of 
causal relationship to the study drug and reported as either definite, probable, possible, not related, 
as defined below: 
x Not Related: The event is clearly due to ex traneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.) or the event is most probably produced by [CONTACT_110194]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concom itant therapy and does not follow a known 
response pattern to the study product. 
x Possibly Related: The event is temporally related  to study product use but can be explained 
by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study product withdrawal may be lacking. 
x Probably Related: The event is temporally relat ed to study product use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product.  
x Definitely Related: The event follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from the time of 
study product administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study product 
and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_110195]´s clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention, or c oncomitant therapy, and either occurs immediately following 		

within the Safety Management Plan.  
The Sponsor must notify FDA of any SAE observe d during conduct of the study, which is serious 
and unexpected and for which there is a reasonable possibility that it has caused the SAE, for which 
there is basis to believe there is a causal re lationship between the drug a nd the occurrence of the 
adverse event (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i)), as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar 
days after becoming aware of its occurrence as per regulatory guidelines. (21 CFR 320.31(d)(3)).  
If the AE is fatal or life-threatening, and with reas onable possibility of its being related to the study 
drug, the Sponsor must also notify the FDA as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar 
days after becoming aware of its occurrence as per regulatory guidelines (21 CFR 320.31(d)(3)). 
Unblinding Instructions: 
Breaking the blind The blind should ordinarily be broken for all SAE IND safety report submitted to FDA. 
The unblinding procedures and follow-up will be pe rformed in accordance with the protocol and 
the Sponsor’s SOPs.  
All SAEs observed in the investigational drug group, if considered drug related (Suspected 
Adverse Reaction) will be reported to the FDA as an unblinded IND Safety Report 
If the blind is broken and a subject with an adve rse event was receiving placebo, the event should 
not be reported in an IND safety report because there is not a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event. 
The blind should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency (where 
knowledge of the study drug received would affect the treatment of the emergency) or regulatory 
requirement (e.g., for SAEs or death).  
For medical emergency, the blind must only be  broken following discussion on a case-by-case 
basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating physician/sponsor. 
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason m ust be recorded in the subject’s source record, 
eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing asse ssments, or subject, is unblinded, the unblinding 
incident and unblinded subject must be listed as a major protocol deviation. 
A subject for whom the blind is broken will di scontinue study product and be scheduled for a 
safety follow up visit and then discontinued from th e study. The subject will be encouraged to stay 
in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized. 
For regulatory requirement, reporting of SAEs not previously unblinded at the site level, the blind 
will be broken by [CONTACT_110199].  
All other individuals, including primary investigators , will receive notification of the SAE in the 
form of a blinded report unless the SAE was previously  unblinded at the site level due to a medical 
emergency. 
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities should be reported  as an AE if they are considered to be 
clinically significant, as per Investigator’s judgmen t. If an abnormal laborat ory value is associated 		

associated abnormal laboratory result s hould be considered additional information. 
Subjects who have had an SAE must be followed clinically until the event has resolved, become 
clinically insignificant, has stabilized, or the subj ect is lost to follow-up. The investigator must 
provide a written follow-up report as soon as possi ble when any additional information is received. 
New SAEs occurring at any time after the 30-d ay follow-up period after study drug discontinuation 
(whichever comes first) may be reported to [CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories Ltd, Clinical

See Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_122522] is discontinued early from 
the study, the activities specified for Vi sit 7 on the Study Flow Chart (Section 3.2) should be 
completed if possible. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Interruption 
A subject may have the study medication temporarily interrupted for any of the following reasons: 
x An AE 
x A diagnostic or therapeutic procedure 
x An abnormal assessment (e.g., vital signs or laboratory abnormalities) 
x Administrative reasons, in particular withd rawal of the subject’s consent, or subject 
becomes uncooperative. 
The reason for study drug interruption or premature  discontinuation must be documented in the 
eCRF and the Sponsor must be informed. If the reason for discontinuation from study drug is an 
abnormal result on a laboratory test or vital sign this information will be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRF. The subject will remain under the supervision of the investigator until satisfactory health 
has returned.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Modification of Dose of Study Medication 
The dose of study medication to any subject may not be modified. If necessary, a subject must be 
discontinued for the reasons described in Section 8.3.3 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unblinding Treatment for a Subject During the Study 
IWRS will be used for emergency unblinding. The identity of the study drug may be revealed only 
if the subject experiences a medical eme rgency whose management would benefit by [CONTACT_110200]. Subjects who have been unblinded by [CONTACT_110201]. 
The occurrence of any unblinding during the study must be clearly justified and explained by [CONTACT_1275]. Before unblinding, every attempt must be made by [CONTACT_110202] 		

DFD-29-CD-004 Version: 2.[ADDRESS_122523] be informed 
as soon as possible before or after the code break. 
8.10 Criteria for Early Termination of the Study 
There are no prespecified criteria for terminating the study early.  
Further recruitment in the study or at (a) particular site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and/or ot her applicable regulatory requirements, procedure-
related problems, or the number of discontinuations  for administrative reasons is too high.  
9 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Prior to the database lock, a detailed, finalized Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed 
and placed on file. The Statistical Analysis Plan will contain a more comprehensive explanation 
than that provided here of the methodology used in the statistical analyses, as well as the rules and 
data handling conventions used to  perform the analyses and th e procedure used to account for 
missing data. In case of any conflicting /discrep ant information pertaining to statistical analysis 
between the methodology specified hereunder and in  the final SAP, the information in the final 
SAP will supersede the protocol. 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be writ ten and finalized before the study closure, i.e., 
database closure and unblinding of the randomizati on code of the study. The SAP will provide full 
details of the analyses, level of significance to be us ed, the data displays and the algorithms to be 
used for data derivations.  
9.2 Analysis Populations 
Three populations are defined for the analyses: 
x Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: This analysis population includes all randomized subjects 
(i.e., assigned to a treatment group). The IT T population will be the primary population for 
the efficacy analysis. 
x Safety population: This analysis population includes subjects who received at least one 
dose of study medication and had at least one sa fety assessment post-Baseline. The safety 
population will be used for analysis of tolerability and safety variables.  
x Per-protocol population (PP): This analysis population comprises all subjects who did not 
violate the protocol in a way that might affe ct the evaluation of the effect of the study 
medication on the primary endpoint (without major protocol violations or deviations). Key 
protocol deviation categories that would influenc e the decision to include a subject in the 
PP population at time of final review before study database lock will be pre-specified in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
9.3 General Considerations 
9.3.1 Handling of Missing Data 
All safety analyses will be performed on data available at the time point considered. In summary 
tables, the number of subjects with missing data will be presented unless otherwise specified. In 
calculation of percentages, subjects with missing da ta will not be considered in the numerator or 
denominator unless otherwise specified. 		

9.4 Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant 
Medications 
The statistical significance of any treatment group difference in the distribution of categorical 
variables such as gender w ill be tested using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test for general 
association adjusted for site. Continuous variables, such as age, will be analyzed using a 2-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with site and treatment as a fixed effect. 
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard  deviation, min, max, number of available 
observations) will be provided for continuous dem ographic variables (e.g., age, height, weight). 
Individual subject listings of demographic data will be provided. 
Qualitative demographic characteristics (gende r, race) will be summarized by [CONTACT_110203]. Medical history will be summarized  by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term

x Males versus females 
x Baseline rosacea severity: moderate (IGA 3) versus severe (IGA 4) 
x Baseline total inflammatory lesion count  below versus above the median count 
x Fitzpatrick skin types I-III versus IV-VI 
9.9 Sample Size Determination 
The sample size for this study was calculated on th e basis of the results obtained from the preceding 
Phase 2 study with orally administered DFD-29 (4 0 mg) in the treatment of inflammatory lesions 
of papulopustular rosacea. 
Assuming a difference in treatment means of 8.[ADDRESS_122531] deviation of 16.3 for the e ndpoint of inflammatory lesion count reduction, 
the sample size required is calculated to be 100 DFD-29 s ubjects and 65 placebo subjects to 
achieve 90% power, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05, for a 3:2 randomization ratio. 
Assuming the proportion of IGA treatment success w ill be 0.60 in the DFD-29 group and 0.15 in 
the placebo group, the sample size of 100 DFD-29  subjects and 65 placeb o subjects will provide 
greater than 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference in these proportion at 
alpha=0.05 (two-sided), for a 3:[ADDRESS_122532] de viation of 16.3 for the endpoint of inflammatory 
lesion count reduction, the sample s ize required is calculated to be  101 subjects in each treatment 
group to achieve 90% power, with a two-sided al pha of 0.05. In addition, the sample size of 
100 subjects per group will yield greater than 90% power to detect a difference in the assumed 
proportion of IGA success of 0.60 in the DFD-29 group 0.35 in the Doxycycline capsules 40 mg group, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  
Based on these sample size calculations and an as sumed dropout rate of 20%, the final sample size 
will be [ADDRESS_122533] both plac ebo and Doxycycline capsules 40 mg in terms 
of efficacy on both co-primary endpoints. 
Efforts will be made to minimize the dropout ra te and to ensure proper follow-up of subjects.

adherence to the protocol. The CRA will review the ICFs and verify eCRF entries by [CONTACT_110217] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/office records) that will be made available for this 
purpose. The CRA will review the mainten ance of regulatory documentation and drug 
accountability (to the bottle level). The monitor will review the progress of the study with the 
investigator and other site personnel on a regular basis. At the end of the study, a closeout 
monitoring visit will be performed. Monitoring vi sits will be arranged with site personnel in 
advance at a mutually acceptable time. Sufficient time must be allowed by [CONTACT_110218]. The coordinator and/or investigator 
should be available to answer questions or reso lve data clarifications. Adequate time and space for 
these visits should be made availab le by [CONTACT_110219].  
11.4 Audits and Inspections 
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, 1 or more sites may be audited 
by [CONTACT_110220]. The purpo se of the audit is to  determine whether or 
not the study is being conducted and monitore d in compliance with recognized GCP/ICH 
guidelines and regulations. 
Additionally, the study may be inspected by [CONTACT_110221]. These inspections may take 
place at any time during or after completion of  the study and are based on local regulations. 
11.5 Modifications to the Protocol 
The procedures defined in the protoc ol and eCRFs will be carefully reviewed to ensure that all 
parties involved with the study fully understand the prot ocol. To ensure the validity of the data, no 
deviations from the protocol (with minimal exce ptions) may be made unless the issue is broad 
enough to warrant revision of the protocol. Such revisions must be submitted to and have 
documented approval from the sponsor and IRB pr ior to implementation. The only circumstance 
in which an amendment may be initiated without prior IRB approval is to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to a subject or subjects. In su ch a case, however, the investigator must notify 
the sponsor immediately and the IRB within [ADDRESS_122543] eCRFs and all other relevant data and records to CRO. The 
investigator will complete and report (submis sion of eCRFs) his/her study in satisfactory 
compliance with the protocol as soon as possible after the completion of the study. 
The investigator must submit a final report to the IRB and the sponsor within 1 month of study 
completion or early termination. 		

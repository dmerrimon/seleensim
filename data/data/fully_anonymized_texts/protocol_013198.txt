Page 8PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Background and Rationale: 
Palbociclib is an orally  active py ridop yrimidine, first -in-class compound that is a potent and 
highly  selective reversible inhibitor of Cy clin-Dependent Kinase ( CDK )4/6. The compound 
prevents cellular Deox yribonucleic Acid ( DNA) synthesis by  [CONTACT_196333] G1 into the S phase, as demonstrated both in laboratory  models and in earl y 
clinical trials. There is a strong link between the action of estradiol and the G1 -S phase 
transition, wher e it drives transcriptional activation of cy clin D1 leading to formation of the 
cyclin D1 -CDK4/6- Rb complex which facilitates the G1 to S phase transition. Preclinical 
data, both [COMPANY_007] internal data and also from other laboratories, suggest that estrogen resistant 
models are e xquisitel y sensitive to the combination of palbociclib with antihormonal therap y 
or palbociclib alone. 
Blockade of the Estrogen Receptor ( ER)signaling pathway  is sy nergistic with cell cy cle 
arrest induction, as demonstrated by  [CONTACT_196334] (PFS)observed to date in the ongoing trial evaluating ER+ metastatic breast cancer
patients treated with the combination of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) and palbociclib
compared with aromatase inhibitor alone . Overcoming resistance to endocrine therapy  in 
breast cancer patients is a major challenge and there is a high unmet need for safe and 
efficacious treatment options in women resistant to endocrine therap y.
Postmenopausal women with hormone recepto r (HR)+/Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_54567] 2( HER2 )-negative breast cancer that ha ve progressed after treatment with letrozole 
or anastrozole are now able to receive everolimus (Afinitor) in combination with 
exemestane.  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_196309] y demonstrated in the BOL ERO -2 
trialin ER+/HER2- negative patients (median PFS 6.9 months for the everolimus -exemestane 
combination vs. 2.8 months for exemestane alone per investigator’s assessment) , a high 
percentage of patients discontinued everolimus due to a challenging tolerability  profile. The 
potential of everolimus to improve overall survival and clinical benefit in women with 
endocrine sensitive disease, or who present with advanced breast cancer in the pre-or 
perimenopausal status,is not y et known .
Data from the open- label Phase 2 study  PALOMA -1 (A5481003) in a patient population of 
ER+/HER2 -negative postmenopausal patients with newly  diagnosed metastatic breast cancer 
indicate that the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significa ntly extends PFS with a tolerable 
safet y profile .The results of two interim anal yses showed a consistent trend of clinically  
meaningful improvements in PFS. In the first interim analy sis (Part 1; N=66), the median 
PFS for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was 18.2 months versus 5.7 months for the 
letrozole alone arm (H azard R atio (HR) =0.35; 95% confidence interval ( CI): 0.17, 0.72; 
p=0.006).  The second interim anal ysis (N=165) demonstrated a statistically  significant 
improvement in PFS (26.1 vs. 7.5 months, respectively; HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.63; 
p<0.001).

A5481023 (PALOMA- 3)
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_233081] menopausal, comprise a large high-risk population for whom more the rapeutic options 
are needed. 
Fulvestrant is a potent anti- estrogen drug that binds and degrades ER . Recent data with 
fulvestrant administered 500mgmonth ly to patients with recurrent HR+/HER2 -negative 
breast cancer indicate significant antitumor activity after both antiestogen and AI failure. In 
a Phase 2 study ,the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus has shown efficacy  in 
postmenopausal women after failure of AI treatment similar to that of the combination of 
tamoxifen with everolimus (median tim e to progression 7.4 months). Fulvestrant is currently  
indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic HR+ breast cancer 
following the failure of antiestrogen therap y.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_196310], it 
has not been studie d extensively  in pre - or peri-menopausal women. However, it is expected 
to also add benefit to the treatment of pre- and peri -menopausal women if given concurrentl y 
with ovarian suppression/ablation. 
Clinical experience demonstrates that ovarian ablation produces comparable outcomes to 
tamoxifen monotherap y and support stheuse of goserelin (Luteinizing Hormone -Releasing 
Hormone [ LHRH ]agonist) concurrently  with fulvestrant in premenopausal women with 
metastatic breast cancer. In fact, Phase [ADDRESS_233082] cancer.   The growing data about the activity of fulvestrant after antihormonal therapy  
failure ,together with emerging effica cy data ofpalbociclib support their combined use in 
women with HR+, HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed 
after prior endocrine therap y. The present study  will establish the degree of added benefit of 
palbociclib in HR+/HER2 -negative recurrent breast cancer patients treated with fulvestrant 
versus fulvestrant alone. 
The present stud y (PALOMA -3/A5481023) met its primary  endpoint as per protocol at the 
interim analy sis based on the recommendation of the external data monitoring committee.  
The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant substantially  improved PFS in pre/peri -and 
postmenopausal women with HR -positive, HER2 -negative advanced breast cancer whose 
disease had progressed after prior endocrine therapy .  The median PFS was 9.2 months (95% 
CI, 7.5 to not estimable) in the palbociclib -fulvestrant arm and 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 
5.5) in the placebo -fulvestrant arm (HR= 0.422; 95% CI , 0.318 to 0.560; 1 -sided 
P<0.000001).. 
In the open- label P hase 2 study  PALOMA -1(A5481003) in patients with ER- positive, 
HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer who had never received s ystemic therapy  for their 
advanced disease , palbociclib in combination with letrozole improved PFS compared to 
letrozole alone , suggesting palbociclib has activit y when combined with endocrine therap y in 
both endocrine -naive and -resistant settings.

Page 10In the present stud y, adverse events seen with palbociclib and fulvestrant were consistent 
with previously  reported data.  Overall, palbociclib was well tolerated, with a discontinuation 
rate due to adverse events similar to that seen with placebo , and manageable by [CONTACT_196335], dose reductions, and/or standard medical care.  The majority  of adverse events 
were mild to moderate in severit y with the exception of hematological toxicties.
In addition, the patient -reported outcomes support the positive impact of palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant, maintaining global Quality  of Life (QoL )on treatment and resulting in a 
statistically  significant ly higher on -treatment global Q oL compared to placebo plus 
fulvestrant .
Double blinding of the present study  will be maintained to allow ongoing collection of data 
for other pre -specified secondary  endpoints including patient reported outcomes .
Study Design:
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, Phase 3 clinical trial with the primary objective of demonstrating the 
superiority  of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (Faslodex) over fulvestrant alone 
inprolonging inve stigator -assessed PFS in women with HR+ /HER2-negative metastatic 
breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therap y.The safet y 
between the two treatment arms will also be compared. 
Eligible patients must have histologically  or cy tologically  proven diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of recurrent advanced (locall y or metastatic) 
disease. Their breast cancer must have progressed during or within 12 months of completion 
of adjuvant therap y (with an AI , if postmenop ausal ,or with tamoxifen ,if pre -or 
perimenopausal ). Alternatively ,it must have progressed while on, or within 1month after 
the end of prior therap y for advanced/metastatic breast cancer (with an AI ,if 
postmenopausal, or other prior endocrine treatmen t,if pre -or perimenopausal ). One 
previous line of chemotherap y for metastatic disease is allowed. Patients must have 
measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST)v.1.[ADDRESS_233083] 417 patients will be randomiz edin a 2:1 ratio and stratified b y documented 
sensitivity  to prior hormonal therap y (yes vs. no), menopausal status at study  entry  (pre-/peri-

Patients in Arm A (at least 278) will receive palbociclib 125 mg/day  orally  for 3 weeks 
followed b y 1week off plus fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularl y on Days 1 and 15 of Cy cle1,

At the time of approva l ofAmendment 3, patients will undergo tumor assessment according 
to local practice. . 
Patients will continue to receive assigned treatment until objective Progressive Disease ( PD), 
symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity , death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever 
occurs first.  Crossover between treatment arms will not be allowed.  Patients showing PD 
can continue with stud y treatment at the discretion of the investigator as long as that is 
considered to be in the best interest of the patient and no new anticancer treatment is 
initiated . Inthiscase, the patient would continue with routine safet y relevant assessments as 
per the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES fortheactive treatment period.
In addition, should palbociclib/placebo related toxicity  mandate palbociclib/placebo 
discontinuation, patients can continue to receive fulvestrant alone. Patients discontinuing the 
active treatment phase (ie, discontinuing both palbociclib/placebo and fulvestrant) will enter 
a follow -up phase during which survival and new anti -cancer therap y information will be 
collected, every  3months from the last dose of study  treatment going forward after approval 
of Amendment 3 .
An external data monitoring committee (E-DMC) will perform an earl y review of safety data 
from approximatel y the first 40 randomized patients with sufficient pharmacokinetic (PK) 
sampling to confirm safety  and tolerability  of the combination.  The early  safet y review by 
[CONTACT_941] E -DMC will also include Pharmacokinetic ( PK)data from the se initial approximatel y
40 patients to explore potential Drug- Drug -Interactions (DDI s) between fulvestrant, goserelin 
(if applicable) and palbociclib. The study  will continue while these anal yses and review are 
ongoing.
In addition, b lood samples will be collected from all patients to assess trough concentrations 
of palbocic lib for exposure/response anal ysis for safet y and efficacy findings.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) will be collected to evaluate health -related quality  of life 
and health status. 
The study  will also include a molecular profiling component aimed at assessing the 
relationship between breast tumor sensitivity  and resistance to palbociclib and the alteration 
of cell cy cle pathway -related genes and proteins in tumor tissues.
Study Objectives:
Primary  Objective: 
To demonstrate the superiority  of palbociclib i n combination with fulvestrant (with or 
without goserelin) over fulvestrant alone (with or without goserelin) in prolonging

Page 17a.Active Treatm ent Phase: Assessments should be performed prior to dosing on the visit day unless otherwise indicated.  Acceptable time windows for 
performing each assessment are described in the column headers. No time window  is to be considered for treatment schedule of palbociclib/placebo. 
One cycle consists of 28 days. A cycle could be longer than 28 days if persistent toxicity delay sinitiation of the subsequent cycle.  Day 1 of any cycle 
visit should coincide with the da y the palbociclib/placebo treatm entbegins.   If there are delays due to toxicity, then the start of the next cycle visit 
will be delayed until the patient ha s recovered and can begin study treatment again.  F ulvestrant injection will be given e very 28 days (+/ -7 day s)with 
the exception of Cycle 1 during which it will be administered on Days 1 and 15 (2 days allow ed according to the protocol visit time windows).  
Goserelin will be administered every 28 days (+/ -number of days allowed accordin g tothe protocol visit time windows).   The active treatment phase is 
ongoing as long as the patient is receiving both study drugs (ie, palbociclib/placebo and fulvestrant) or fulvestrant alone.
b.Cycle 1/Day 1: Blood chemistry, hematology, and physical exa mination not required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 7 days 
prior to randomization. 
c.End of Treatment/Withdrawal: Visit to be performed as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_233087] Treatm ent Follow -up: Patients who discontinue study treatment should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 28 calendar days ( 7 day s) after disco ntinuation of study 
treatment (palbociclib/placebo or fulvestrant) to assess if there have been any new adverse events and /orany change to any previously reported adverse 
events.  This follow -up should occur 28 calendar days (7 days) regardless of any ne w anti-cancer therapy that may have started .  Telephone contact [CONTACT_196336].  Follow -up visits to assess survival status will be conducted every [ADDRESS_233088] after approval of Amendment 3 . See table

Page 271.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Indication
Women of any  menopausal status with hormone receptor- positive (HR+) , Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_196311] 2 (HER2)-negative advanced/metastatic1breast cancer (BC) after 
failure of prior endocrine therap y.
1.2.Background and Rationale
HR+ /HER2- negative breast cancer is the most common subset of breast cancer.1Most 
patients are diagnosed at an early stage and remain re lapse -free if treated with a prolonged 
course of endocrine therapy .  Unfortunatel y, not all patients respond to first -line endocrine 
therap y (primary or de novo resistance), and even patients who have a response will 
eventuall y relapse (acquired resistance ).About one -third of all HR+/HER2- negative 
patients, diagnosed initially  with earl y stage disease, experience disease recurrence.2As a 
result the HR+/HER2- negative subset is responsible for the majorit y of b reast cancer related 
deaths.  The fundamental problem is that endocrine agents are onl y partially effective, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y causing cell cycle arrest and tumor dormancy  rather than true cure.  As a result, 
secondary  resistance to endocrine therapy  is a major cl inical challenge.
In postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- negative metastatic BC, aromatase inhibitors 
(AIs) have become the treatment of choice in first -line therap y.3On the contrary , most pre-
or perimenopa usal women with HR+ breast cancer present with early  stage disease and are 
treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen with or without ovarian ablation (by [CONTACT_44850] , 
chemotherap y or luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone (LHRH) ) in the adjuvant setting .4
Upon initial presentation with metastatic disease during premenopause , the recommended 
approach is to suppress ovarian function ( by[CONTACT_196341] -releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy ),5and then to concurrently  follow 
post-menopausal treatment guidelines, switching treatment from tamoxifen to AI s or 
fulvestrant .4Thus, in clinical practice so called “pre/perimenopausal” patients with HR+ 
metastatic breast cancer will be rendered postmenopausal by  [CONTACT_196342].
Upon disease progression on hormonal therap y, historically the treatment options have been 
limited to a change in AIs (steroidal or nonsteroidal) or the use of the estrogen -receptor (ER) 
antagonists fulvestrant and tamoxifen .6,[ADDRESS_233104] few years the search for newer, non -endocrine related agents to treat recurrent 
metastatic ER+ breast cancers has expanded to include agents targeting the PI 3K/mTOR 
pathway  as well as cell cy cle specific agents. Everolimus, recentl y approved in advanced, 
recurrent disease, is an example of the former,8and palbociclib, is an example of the latter.9
In both cases , successful development of molecular patient selection criteria has so far 
prove n to be elusive. More efficacious and safe therapeutic options are still needed, 
                                                          
1 The terms “advanced” and “metastatic” breast cancer are used interchangeably in this document.

cancer patients who have tumor progression following endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_196312], represent an important unmet medical need, regardless of their menopausal status .
1.2.1. Overview of Palbociclib
PD-0332991 (palbociclib), an orall y active p yridopyrimidine, is a potent first -in-class, highly  
selective reversible inhibitor of CDK 4 a nd CDK6 
(IC50= 11 nM; Ki = 2 nM) with a 
molecular weight of 573.67. 
The compound prevents cellular DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_196343] p rogression of the cell cy cle 
from G1 into the S phase, as demonstrated both in laboratory  models and in earl y clinical 
trials.  CDK4 and CDK6 control G1 to S phase transit by  [CONTACT_4639] D -type cy clins.10,11,12
The CDK4/6/Cyclin D1 complex phosphory lates the retinoblastoma susceptibility  (RB1) 
gene product (Rb), releasing the E2F and DP transcription factors that drive expre ssion from 
genes required for S -phase entry .12CDK activity  and G1 progression is negatively  regulated 
by [CONTACT_196344]-Kip and INK4 family , typi[INVESTIGATOR_196313] b y p16.13,14,15,16,17Overexpression of p16 in cells with 
normal Rb inhibits both CDK4- and CDK6 -associated kinase activity  and Rb 
phosphory lation, with subsequent cell cy cle arrest.18,[ADDRESS_233105], as demonstrated by  [CONTACT_196345]+ metastatic breast cancer patients treated 
with the combination of an aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib compared with aromatase 
inhibitor alone.9Overcoming resistance to endocrine therap y in breast cancer patients is a 
major challenge and there is a high unmet need for safe and efficacious treatment options in 
women resistant to endocrine therap y. 
There is a strong link between the a ctions of estradiol and the G1 -S phase transition, where

To date, PK data have been collec ted in 8 clinical studies for a total of over 250 advanced 
cancer patients and 30 healthy  volunteers (A5481001, A5481002, A5481003, A5 481004, 
A5481008, A5481009, A5481010, and A5481011).  In the first -in-human Study A5481001,
the exposure (AUC (0-10)and C max) increased in a dose proportional manner over the dose 
range of 25 to 225 mg once dail y (QD) following palbociclib administration on Day s1 and 
8of Cy cle1,although some variability  (low to moderate) around these doses was observed 
particularl y at the 150 mg QD dose level.  Following repeated daily  dosing to steady  state, 
palbociclib was absorbed with a median T maxof ~4 hours. The mean palbociclib Vz/F was 
2583 L , which is significantly  greater than total body  water (42 L), indicating that palbociclib 
extensively  penetrates into peripheral tissues. Palbociclib was eliminated slowly ; the mean 
elimination half -life (t1 ⁄2) was 28.8 hours and the mean CL/F was 63.1 L/hour. Palbociclib 
accumulated following repeated dosing with a median R acof 2.4, which is consistent with t he

free base capsule, was investigated in Study  A5481021.  The administration of the free base 
formulation of palbociclib with food (including a high fat or a low fat meal given together 
with palboci clib, or moderate fat meals given 1 hour before and 2 hours after palbociclib) 
resulted in more uniform drug absorption and significantly  reduced the intersubject 
variability  in drug exposure when compared to the administration of free base formulation of 
palbociclib in a fasted state.  The relative bioavailability  of the commercial free base capsule 
administered with food and the isethionate capsule administered under overnight and 
minimal fasting conditions was investigated in Study  A5481036.  The two fas ting conditions 
for administration of isethionate capsules represent the [ADDRESS_233109] to food intake in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 1/[ADDRESS_233110] from 1 hour before until 2 hours after 
palbociclib dosing.  The administration of palbociclib free base capsule formulation with 
food was found to be bioequivalent to palbociclib isethionate capsule formulation given 
under both the overnight and minimal fasting conditions . As a result of these findings, 
patients should be instructed to take palbociclib with food. 
Study A5481018 showed thatcoadministration of palbociclib and QD doses of the proton -
pump inhibitor ( PPI)rabeprazole administered under fasted con dition decreased single- dose 
palbociclib AUC infand C maxby 62% and 80%, respectivel y, when compared with those after 
a single dose of palbociclib administered alone.  Another clinical trial (Study A548 1038) 
showed that administ ration of palbociclib with f amotidine and Mi -Acid Maximum Strength 
Liquid under fed conditions had no impact on the exposure of palbociclib.  C oadministration 
of a single 125 -mg palbociclib dose with multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor
(PPI)rabeprazole under fed conditions d ecreased palbociclib Cmaxby 41%, but it had
limited impact on AUC inf(13% decrease) compared with a single dose of p albociclib
administered alone .  The concomitant use of PPI s with palbociclib should be

Palbociclib is metabolized to multiple metabolites in a qualitatively  similar manner in rat, 
dog and human liver microsomes.  In vitro, palbociclib is primarily  metabolized by  
[CONTACT_13439] P -450 (CYP) 3A4 enzymes.  An exploratory  evaluation of the circulating 
metabolites for palbociclib was conducted in plasma samples obtained from patients treated 
with palbociclib 200 mg QD (Schedule 2/1) in Study  A5481001.  Preliminary  assessment of 
the pooled plasma samples on Day 14 of C ycle1 indicated that the glucuronide conjugate of 
palbociclib and the lactam of palbociclib (PF- 05089326) were the main metabolites present 
in plasma.  Other metabolites observed were the glucuronide conjugates of hy droxylated 
palboc iclib and the glucuronide conjugate of reduced palbociclib.  PF -05089326 was also 
observed in the circulation of rats following repeated daily  oral administration of palbociclib 
at the dose levels of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day .  Plasma protein binding of palboci clib and 
PF-05089326 is ~85% and 95%, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from an itraconazole DDI study  where the effect of 
multiple dosing of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (200 mg QD), on the single -dose 
PK of palbociclib (125 mg) was evaluated in 12 healthy  fasted subjects (Study  A5481016). 
Median palboci clib plasma concentrations were higher in the presence of itraconazole than 
those in the absence of itraconazole. Palbociclib mean plasma AUC from time 0 to infinity  
(AUC inf) and C maxvalues increased approximately 87% and 34%, respectively , when 
administ ered in combination with itraconazole compared to when administered alone.
Therefore, concomitant administration of agents known to be strong /moderate inhibitors of 
CYP3A isoen zymes (such as ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
clarithrom ycin, er ythromy cin, telithrom ycin, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, indinavir, 
saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, and 
grapefruit juice) should be avoided.
Pharmacokinetic data are available from a rifampin DDI study  where the effect of multiple 
dosing of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg QD), on the single -dose PK of 
palbociclib (125 mg) was evaluated in 15 healthy  fasted subjects (Study  A5481017). Median 
palbociclib plasma concentrations were substantially  lower in the presence of rifampin than 
those in the absence of rifampin. Palbociclib mean plasma AUC from time 0 to infinity  
(AUC inf) and C maxvalues decreased appro ximately  85% and 70%, respectively , when 
administered in combination with rifampin compared to when administered alone. 
Therefore, co -administration of palbociclib with strong/moderate CYP3A inducers (such as 
phenobarbital, rifampin, pheny toin, carbamazep ine, rifabutin, rifapentin, and St. John’s 
Wort) should be avoided .

The present study  A5481023 (PAL OMA -3)met its primary  endpoint at the preplanned 
interim analy sis (data cutoff date of 05 December 2014) based on the recommendation of the 
external data monitoring committee.  The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant substantially  
improved PFS in pre/peri - and postmenopausal women with HR- positive, HER2 -negative 
metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after prior endocrine therap y.  The 
median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI , 7.5 to not estimable) on palbociclib -fulvestrant and 
3.8months (95% CI , 3.5 to 5.5) on placebo- fulvestrant ( HR= 0.422; 95% CI, 0.318 to 0.560;

letrozole alone, suggesting palbociclib has activit y when combined with endocrine therap y in 
both endocrine -naive and -resistant settings.
In addition, the patient -reported outcomes support the positive impac t of palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant, maintaining global quality  of life ( QOL )on treatment and resulting in a 
statistically  significantly  higher on -treatment global QOL compared to placebo plus 
fulvestrant .

1.2.2. Overview of Fulvestrant (Faslodex)
Approximately  two thirds of breast cancers express ER42andthe role for estrogens in breast 
cancer etiolog y and progression is well established. Modification of estrogen activity  or 
synthesis represents the treatment of choice for women with hormone receptor -positive 
advanced breast cancer, particularl y for those with slowly  progressive disease (PD) and 
limited tumor -related sy mptoms.43Conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase 
enzy me action represents the main source of estrogens in postmenopausal wome n.  Women 
with disease recurring early  after AI or tamoxifen therapy  are candidates to receive 
fulvestrant. 
Fulvestrant (Faslodex) is a competitive ER antagonist with an affinity  comparable to 
estradiol. It blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any  partial agonist (estrogen -like) 
activity , and is currentl y indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen 
therap y.[ADDRESS_233127] shown that fulvestrant 
significantly  down-regulates ER protein in ER- positive tumo urs compared with placebo. 
There was also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor (PR) expression consistent 
with a lack of intrinsic estrogen agonist effects. It has also been shown that fulvestrant 
500 mg/month downregulates ER and the prolifer ation marker Ki67 to a greater degree than 
fulvestrant 250 mg/month in breast tumours in postmenopausal neoadjuvant setting.45

Page 391.2.3. Study Rationale
The present study  is an international,  multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo- controlled, parallel -group, Phase 3 clinical trial with the primary  objective of 
demonstrating the superiority of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (Faslodex) over 
fulvestrant alone in prolonging PFS in women with HR+, HER2- negative metastatic breast 
cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therapy . The safety  between the 
two treatment arms will also be compared. Pre-and perimenopausal women must be 
receiving therap y with the LHRH agonist goserelin (Zoladexor generic). 
Palbociclib is an orally  active py ridop yrimidine, first -in-class compound that is a potent and 
highly  selective reversible inhibitor of Cy clin-Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). The 
compound prevents cellular DNA s ynthesis b y prohibiting progression of the cell cycle from 
G1 into the S phase, as demonstrated both in laboratory  models and in early  clinical trials.   
There is a strong link between the action of estradiol on the G1 -S phase transition, where it 
drives transcriptional activation of cy clin D1 leading to formation of the cyclin 
D1-CDK4/6- Rb complex which facilitates the G1 to S phase transition. In non clinical 
experiments, palbociclib synergizes with antiestrogen to cause tumor regression in invitro 
ER+ advanced breast cancer cell lines.
Preclinical data, both [COMPANY_007] internal data and also from other laboratories,52(unpublished
data by L.Ma rtin, Roy al Marsden, London, [LOCATION_006]) suggest that estrogen- resistant models are 
exquisitely  sensitive to the combination of palbociclib with antihormonal therap y or 
palbociclib alone. Moreover, a small set of data in patients with HR+/HER2- negative 
recurrent breast cancer treated with monotherap y palbociclib suggests that about 25% of 
patients derive some degree of clinical benefit from monotherapy .38
Blockade of ER+ signaling pathway  is sy nergistic with cell cy clearrest induction and results 
in significant clinical benefit as measured b yPFS in patients with hormonal receptor positive 
metastatic breast cancer. Overcoming resistance to endocrine therap y in breast cancer is a 
major challenge and there still is an unmet need for safe and efficacious treatment options in 
women resistant to endocrine therap y. 
Postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- negative breast cancer that have progressed after 
treatment with letrozole or anastrozole are now able to receive everolimus ( Afinitor) in 
combination with exemestane. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_196316] -2 trial in ER+/HER2- negative patients (median PFS 6.9 months for the 
everolimus- exemestane combination vs. 2.8 months for exemestane alone p er investigator’s 
assessment), a high percentage of patients discontinued everolimus due to a challenging 
tolerability  profile. The potential of everolimus to improve overall survival and clinical 
benefit in women with endocrine sensitive disease, or who present with advanced breast 
cancer in the pre- or perimenopausal state , is not y et known.53
Data from the open- label Phase 2 study  PALOMA -1 (A5481003) in a patient population of 
ER+/ HER2 -negative postmenopausa l patients with newly  diagnosed metastatic breast cancer
indicate that addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantly  extends PFS with a tolerable 
safet y profile .While the study  included patients whose disease had relapsed at various

Page 40timepoints after prior endocrine therap y, there is limited clinical data on the activity  of 
palbociclib in patients who se disease recurred on or early after antihormonal therap y, a 
population that may be less sensitive to retreatment with antihormonal therapy .  Such 
patients, who could be pre -, peri -, or postmenopausal, comprise a large high -risk population 
for whom more therapeutic options are needed. 
Fulvestrant (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) is a potent anti -estrog en drug that binds and degrades ER .  
Recent data with fulvestrant administered at the dose of 500 mg/month ly to patients with
recurrent HR+/HER2 -negative breast cancer indicate significant antitumor activity  after both 
antiestogen and aromatase inhibitor ( AI) failures. In a Phase 2 study  the combination of 
fulvestrant and everolimus has shown efficacy  in postmenopausal women after failure of AI 
treatment similar to that of the combination of tamoxifen with everolimus (median time to 
progression 7.4 months) .54Fulvestrant is currently indicated for the treatment of 
postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer following 
the failure of antiestrogen therap y. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_196317], it has not been 
studied extensively  in pre - or peri- menopausal women. However, it is expected to also add 
benefit to the treatment of pre -and peri -menopausal women if given concurrently  with 
ovarian suppression/ablation. Clinical expe rience demonstrates that medical (or surgical) 
ovarian ablation produces comparable outcomes to tamoxifen monotherapy and support the
use of goserelin (LHRH agonist) concurrentl y with fulvestrant in premenopausal women 
with metastatic breast cancer.5,55In fact, Phase [ADDRESS_233135] cancer.56
The growing data about the activity  of fulvestrant after antihormonal therapy  failure57
together with emerging efficacy  data of palbociclib support their combined use in women 
with HR+, HER2- negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior 
endocrine therap y. The present study  will establish the degree of added benefit of 
palbociclib in HR+/HER2 -negative recurrent breast cancer patients treated with fulvest rant 
versus fulvestrant alone. 
Potential Drug- Drug -Interactions (DDIs)
The sponsor considers the potential for a clinically significant DDI between palbociclib and 
fulvestrant to be very  low. The routes of elimination for fulvestrant include combinations of 
a number of possible biotransformation pathway s analogous to those of endogenous steroids, 
including oxidation, aromatic hy droxylation, conjugat ionwith glucuronic acid and/or 
sulphate.   There are no known drug- drug interactions. Fulvestrant does not significantly  
inhibit any  of the major CYP isoenzy mes, including CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 
invitro, and studies of co -administration of fulvestrant with midazolam indicate that 
therapeutic doses of fulvestrant have no inhibitory  effects on CYP 3A4 or alter blood levels 
of drug metabolized by  [CONTACT_196347]. Although fulvestrant is partly  metabolized by  
[CONTACT_097] 3A4, a clinical study with rifampin, an inducer of CYP 3A4, showed no effect on the 
PK of fulvestrant. Also results from a health y volunteer stud ywith ketoconazole, a potent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4, indicated that ketoconazole had no effect on the PK of fulvestrant and 
dosage adjustment is not necessary  in patients with co-prescribed CYP 3A4 inhibitors or 
inducers .44

[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 3
The scope of Amendment 3 will be to reduc e efficacy  and safet y assessments mainly  due to
the following reasons: 1) the study  met its primary endpoint of efficacy  at the preplanned 
interim analy sis; 2) additional efficacy  analy ses of the primary  and secondary  endpoints had 
been conducted upon request of Health A uthorities (HAs); 3) additional analy ses of safet y 
had been conducted to comply  with HAs requests.  At the time of the amendment a smaller
number of patients will beon study  treatment and patients will remain under observation for 
a follow -up period of approximately  1 year and a half. 
Asummary  of efficacy  results at the time of i nterim analy sis was added.
Main modification concern s the tumor assessments that will be conducted according to local 
practice at the institutions once this amendm ent is approv ed.  The ev aluation of the 
assessments as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) version 1.1 will 
not be mandatory  any longer.  Tumor lesions and their measurements will not be recoreded in 
the case report form ( CRF ), nor wi llthe RECI ST assessments.  Only  the date of progression 
of disease will be recorded.
As a consequence of this modification , the tumor assessments showing progression of the 
disease will not be collected an y more during follow -up for those patients who dis continued 
study  treatment without an objectively  documented progression.
Since the random sample -based BICR audit approach has shown no investigator bias in favor 
of the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and the analy sis results of BICR also corroborated th e 
results of investigator -assessed PFS , the third- party core imaging laboratory will nolonger 
perform blinded independent central review of PFS data and the investigators will stop 
sending the imaging studies to the central laboratory .
Considering the saf ety profile of palbociclib as shown at the time of interim analy sisand 
subsequent safet y analyses, it was decided to perform blood chemistry  only  every  3 cy cles
(Day  1).  However, when an adverse event occurs that mandate sblood chemistry  to be 
performed (eg, hepatic function abnormality ), the additional laboratory  data will be recorded 
in the CRF.  Hemoglobin A 1c must be tested at the time of blood chemistry collection .  
Ophtalomologic examination will continue.
It was also clarified that strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors/inducers and proton pump 
inhibitors listed in the protocol are permitted for those patients who permanently  
discontinued pal bociclib/placebo and continue on fulvestrant monotherap y only.
A modification of timing for survival follow- up was added.  S urvival follow -up visits wi ll be 
conducted every  [ADDRESS_233146] dose of study  treatment after approval of 
Amendment 3.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, Phase 3 clinical trial with the primary  objective of demonstrating the 
superiority  of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (Faslodex) over fulvestrant alone 
in in women with HR+, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer,regardless of their 
menopausal stat us,  whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therapy . The safet y

visits.
Randomization will be stratified b y documented sensitivity  to prior hormonal therapy  (yes 
vs. no), by  [CONTACT_196349]  (pre-/peri-vs. post menopausal), and by  [CONTACT_196350] (y es vs. no). 
Sensitivity  to prior hormonal therap y is defined as either: (i) Documented clinical benefit 
(CR, PR, SD  24weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therap y in the metastatic setting, OR 
(ii) At least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy  prior to recurrence. “Visc eral” refers to 
lung, liver, brain, pleural and peritoneal involvement.
Patients will continue to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, 
symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity ,death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever 
occurs first. Crossover between treatment arms is not allowed.  However, patients may  
continue treatment as assigned at randomization bey ond the time of PD at the discretion of 
the investigator if that is consid ered to be in the best interest of the patient and as long as no 
new anticancer treatment is initiated. In thiscase, the patient w ould continue with routine 
safet y relevant assessments as per the SCHEDULE OF ACTI VITIESfor the active treatment 
period. In addition, should palbociclib/placebo related toxicity mandate palbociclib/placebo 
discontinuation, patients can continue to receive fulvestrant alone.
Upon approval of Amendment 3, p atients discontinuing the acti ve treatment phase will enter

Drug -Drug -Interactions (DDIs) bet ween fulvestrant, goserelin (if applicable) and palbociclib.  
The study  will continue while these anal yses and review are ongoing.
In addition, trough concentrations of palbociclib will be collected from all patients and will 
be used for exposure/response analysis for safet y and efficacy  findings.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) will be collected in this trial to evaluate the impact on

Page 575.3.4. Dose Modification
Every  effort should be made to administer study  treatment on the planned dose and schedule.  
However, in the event of significant treatment -related toxicity , administration of
palbociclib/placebo may  need to be adjusted as described in the following sections. Dose 
adjustment is permitted for palbociclib/placebo only .The fulvestrant dose cannot be 
adjusted; its dosing can only  be delay ed or interrupted.
Depending on the nature of the toxicity  observed, treatment interruption ma y be required for 
one or both study  drugs in the combination.  I n the event treatment interruption is deemed 
necessary  for just one of the study  drugs in the combination, treatment with the other study  
drug will continue as planned. 
The start of a cycle i s defined as the day  when palbociclib /placebo administration begins ,
starting with the first palbociclib /placebo dose at baseline ( Cycle1, Day1).  In case of 
palbociclib/placebo dose delay s, administration of fulvestrant and goserelin will continue 
accor ding to the pre -planned schedule. 
Every  effort should be made to sy nchronize Day 1 of palbociclib /placebo administration with
the first injection of fulvestrant (and with the first on -study  goserelin injection, if applicable 
and if administered at the stu dy site) and other study  related activities according to the 
SCHEDUL E OF ACTIVITIES table .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fulvestrant 
No dose adjustment for fulvestrant is permitted. A single fulvestrant injection can be skipped 
in case of a f ulvestrant -related toxicity or dosing can be delay ed.  Treatment delay  for 
fulvestrant -related toxicities will be performed as per the investigator’s best medical 
judgment, but by  [CONTACT_23818] 7 days.If delay  of longer than 7 days is required then the 
dose should be skipped. In the event of a toxicity  requiring dosing delay  of
palbociclib /placebo, fulvestrant can also be delay ed by  a maximum of 7 days.
Fulvestrant should not be administered if the platelet count is <50,000 /mm3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Palbociclib/Placebo
In the event of significant treatment- related toxicity , palbociclib/placebo dosing may  be 
interrupted or delay ed and/or reduced as described below.  In the event of multiple toxicities, 
dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity  observed.  Patient s are to be 
instructed to notify  Investigators at the first occurrence of any  adverse sign or sy mptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cy cle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery  followed b y dose 
reduction, if required .

when a new cy cle is due to start .
At start of the new cycle: dose reduction may  be required in a subsequent cy cle based 
on toxicity  experienced in the previous cy cle.
Patients disc ontinuing palbociclib/placebo treatment due to treatment- related toxicity  may  
continue on the active treatment phase of the stud y receiving fulvestrant monotherap y as per 
the investigator’s discretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Dosing Interruptions/Delays
Patients experiencing the following adverse events will have their treatment with 
palbociclib/placebo interrupted/delay ed until criteria for retreatment are met: 
Uncomplicated Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3).
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3) associated with a docum ented infection 
or fever  38.5C.
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocy topenia (Platelet <50,000/mm3).
Non-hematologic toxicity  persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_196320] 2 lasting more than 3 weeks, or Grade 3 (including, nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhe a).  Patients should not hold or discontinue palbociclib /placebo for 
non-hematological side effects potentiall y or likely related to concomitant 
antihormonal therap y (eg, Grade 3 or long lasting Grade 2 joint pain) as per the 
investigator’s judgment. 
Grad e3 QTc prolongation (QTc  [ADDRESS_233165] two separate ECGs).
Concurrent >3x ULN ALT and 2x ULN Total Bilirubin. If those occur, the dose 
needs to be held while the cause is being investigated. 
Doses should be held until toxicity  resolution. Appro priate follow up assessments , as 
defined b y the investigator, should be undertaken until adequate recovery  occurs. Criteria 
required before treatment can resume are described in the Retreatment Criteria Section.
Depending on when the adverse event resolved, a treatment interruption may  lead to the 
patient missing all subsequent planned doses within that same cy cle or even to delay  in the 
initiation of the subsequent cy cle. A new cy cle only  starts when the retreatm ent criteria 
listed below are met and blinded study  treatment may be administered, otherwise initiation of 
the new cy cle must be delay ed until such criteria are met.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 59In the event that the start of a new cy cle is delay ed due to treatment- related toxicity , 
procedures required on Day  1 of the given cy cle will be performed when palbociclib/placebo 
treatment is resumed. New cy cle Day  1 procedures (ie , phy sical examination, ECOG 
performance status, ECG, Quality  of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry , hematology ) that 
were performed prior to knowing the need to delay the start of the cy cle do not need to be 
repeated (1) if not required to determine whether study  drug may  be resumed and (2) if 
performed within 7 day s prior to study  drug resumption.   In these cases , Day 1 procedures 
performed before the dose of palbociclib/placebo of the new cycle will be reported in the 
CRF at Day  1 of the new cy cle.If the adverse event that led to the treatment interruption 
recovers within the same cy cle, then re -dosing in that cy cle is allowed.  Doses omitted for 
toxicity  are not replaced within the same cy cle.  The need for a dose reduction at the time of 
treatment resumption should be based on the criteria defined in the Dose Reductions Section 
unless an alternative plan is expressly  agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor.  
If a dose reduction is applied in the same cy cle, the patient will need to return to the clinic to 
receive new drug supply .
In the event of a treatment i nterruption for reasons other than treatment -related toxicity
(eg,non-cancer related surgery ) lasting >3 weeks, treatment resumption will be decided in 
consultation with the sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Retreatment Criteria
Retreatment with palbociclib/placebo following trea tment interruption for treatment-related 
toxicity  or at the start of any  new cy cle may  not occur until all of the following parameters 
have been met:
Platelet count 50,000/mm3.
ANC 1000/mm3and no fever .
Grade 3 non- hematologic AEs (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
hypertension only  if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4570]), have recovered to 
Grade 1 or baseline.
QTc 500 msec and potential reversible causes (eg, electrol yte imbalance, 
concomitant medications known to prolong QTc) corre cted.  If QTc remains above 
480msec, treatment may re- start but a cardiologist should be consulted and the ECG 
monitored more frequently  as per the investigator’s best medical judgement until QTc 
480msec.
If a treatment delay  results from decline in hem atologic parameters, the frequency  of blood 
count assessments should be adjusted as clinically  indicated.
If the retreatment parameters are met within 3 weeks of treatment interruption (which may  
include dose holding due do toxicity , the scheduled week off treatment and up to 7 days of 
cycle delay ), palbociclib/placebo may  be resumed.  R efer to theDose Reductions section
below for adverse events requiring dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption.

Page 60If these parameters hav e not been met after 3 weeks of dos inginterruption, the patient should 
permanentl y discontinue palbociclib/placebo treatment. Treatment resumption for patients 
recovering from treatment -related toxicit y after > 3 weeks of treatment interruption but 
deemed to be suitable for a trial of lower dose, is recommended but left at the investigator’s 
discretion and upon discussion and agreement with the sponsor (see below for suggested 
dose adjustments).

No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1 or short lasting (<3 weeks) 
treatment -related Grade [ADDRESS_233166] s manage their 
patients according to their medical judgment based on the individual clinical circumstances.
In case of a Grade 2 toxicity  lasti ng for >3 weeks or a Grade 3 toxicity  (both assessed in the 
presence of maximum supportive care as judged by  [CONTACT_093]), dose reduction is 
recommended for the subsequent cy cles. Dose reduction of palbociclib/placebo by  [CONTACT_31806], and, 
if needed, b y two dose levels (Table 2) is recommended depending on ty pe and severit y of 
the toxicity .  Patients requiring more than two dose reductions will be allowed to receive 
75mg/day  for 2 weeks on followed by  2weeks off study  treatment (if , per the investigator’s 
judgment, and in consulation with the sponsor, such a change in schedule is manageable and 
prefer able to permanent palbociclib/placebo discontinuation and treatment continuation with 
fulvestrant only ). All dose modifications/adjus tments must be clearl y documented in the 
patient's source notes and I nvestigational product administration CRF. 
Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cy cles should be 
administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductio n is required.  Dose re -escalation 
is not allowed.

Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the adverse 
event (AE) page, and if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on AE CRF page. 
5.3.6. Compliance
Patients will be required to return all bottles of palbociclib/placebo as well as the completed 
patient diary  at the beginning of each cy cle for drug accountabilit y.  Drug accountability will 
be perf ormed on Day 1 of every  cycle prior to dispensing drug supply  for the next cy cle.  The 
number of remaining capsules/tablets will be documented and recorded. 
To be considered compliant, each stud y patient must have received at least 80% of the 
planned numb er of doses of primary  therapy  based on the number of day s of actual dose 
administration during the study .  Dose adjustments must follow instructions provided in the 
dose adjustment guidelines section. 
Fulvestrant will b e administered b y qualified study personnel at the site in accordance with 
the fulvestrant label. Fulvestrant administration will be documented on the corresponding 
study  drug administration CRF.
5.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
Storage conditions stated in the Single Reference Safety  Document (ie, Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB), [LOCATION_002] Package Insert (USPI), Summary  of Product Characteristics 
(SPC), or L ocal Product Document (LPD)) will be superseded by  [CONTACT_4671].
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures dail y (ie,manually  or by 
[CONTACT_196355]) and ensure that thermometers are working 
correctly  as required for proper storage of investigational products.  These include 
thermometers fo r both the room storage and refrigerator storage.  Any  temperature 
excursions must be reported to the sponsor.  The investigational products must be stored as 
indicated. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any  actions taken, must be 
docume nted and reported to the sponsor.
Once a deviation is identified, the investigational products (palbociclib/placebo or 
fulvestrant) must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of 
permission to use the investigational product s.

5.4.1. Palbociclib/Placebo Storage and Accountability
Palbociclib/placebo capsules should be stored at controlled room temperature (15 -30C, 
59-86F) in their original container.
Medication should be kept in a secured locked area at the study  site in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requirements.  Returned medication should be stored separately  from 
medication that needs to be dispensed.
To ensure adequate records, palbociclib/placebo capsules will be accounted for as instructed 
by [CONTACT_456].  Patients are requested to return previously  dispensed containers as well as 
their completed patient diary to the clinic at each visit for accountability  purposes even if 
they will not be issued with new medication at that visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fulvestrant Storage and Accountability
Fulvestrant must be stored according to the instructions described in the local package ins ert. 
5.5.Concomitant Medications
Patients must be instructed not to take an y additional medications (over -the-counter or other 
products) during the study  without prior consultation with the investigator.  Any  medications 
including herbal supplements, vitamins ,or treatment taken by  [CONTACT_4672] [ADDRESS_233169] be recorded on the CRF. 
Routine postoperative care, s uch as dressing changes, suture removal, drain removal, or 
venous access (central or peripheral), does not need to be recorded.  Anesthetics used for an y 
surgical procedures performed during the patient’s participation in the study can be recorded 
as “unsp ecified anesthesia” on the concomitant treatment records; it is not necessary  to list 
the specific anesthetics.  Palliative and supportive care for cancer -related s ymptoms will be 
offered to all patients in this study .
5.5.1. Prohibited Medications
The following treatments are prohibited throughout the duration of the active treatment 
phase: 
Anticancer agents : No additional investigational or commercial anticancer agents 
such as chemotherap y, immunotherapy, targeted therap y, biological response 
modifiers, or endo crine therapy  other than fulvestrant (and goserelin for pre -and 
perimenopausal women) will be permitted during the active treatment phase.  I n 
general, an y drugs containing “for the treatment of breast cancer” on the product label 
are not permitted on stu dy.

5.6. Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery
Any concurr ent radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherap y as specified below) or 
cancer -related surgery  is prohibited throughout the duration of the active treatment phase of 
the study .  Patients requiring any  of these procedures will be discontinued from the activ e 
treatment phase and will enter the follow -up phase.
Palliative radiotherap y is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions provided that the 
lesions were known to be present at the time of study  entry  and the investigator clearl y 
documents that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.  
In view of the current lack of data about the interaction of palbociclib with radiotherap y, 
palbociclib/placebo treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherap y, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
1day before and resuming treatment 1 week after.  For patients with bone involvement, it is 
suggested to institute palliative radiotherap y before study  initiation if possible and clinicall y 
appropriate (eg, lesions at risk for spontaneous micro -fractures or painful lesions).  Palliative 
radiotherap y during the active treatment phase will be considered alternative cancer therap y 
and will result in censoring of the PFS endpoint.  The dates on which palliative radiotherap y 
is administered should be re corded on the appropriate CRFs. 
Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for an y surgical procedures during the study .  The 
appropriate interval of time between surgery  and palbociclib required to minimize the risk of 
impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined.  Based on the available 
pharmacokinetic data, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4568]/placebo is recommended at least 7 days prior to 
elective surgery .  Postoperativel y, the decision to reinitiate palbociclib/placebo treatment 
should be based on a cl inical assessment of satisfactory  wound healing and recovery  from 
surgery .
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Prior to undergoing any study specific procedures (with the exception of certain imaging 
assessments if meeting the criteria defined in the Screen Failure Section) patients must read 
and sign the consent form.  All study  procedures and the timing when they must be 
performed are detailed in the SCHEDUL E OF ACTIVITIES tables.  All data obtained for 
these assessments must be supported in the patients' source documentation.
One cy cleconsists of 28 day s.  A cy cle could be longer than 28 day s if persistent toxicity  
delay sinitiation of the subsequent cy cle.

specific procedures are performed (with the exception of certain imaging assessments if 
meeting the criteria defined in this section); All assessments should be performed prior to 
dosing w ith study  medications on the visit day  unless otherwise indicated.  Acceptable time 
windows for performing each assessment are described in the SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES .
Radiographic tumor assessments (as documented on the Tumor Assessment Requirement 
Flowchart ) that were performed before the signing of the informed consent form as routine 
procedures (but within 28 days prior to randomization ) do not need to be repeated and may  
be us ed as baseline assessments, as long as:
The tests were performed per the method requirements outlined in the 
Tumor Assessment Requirement Flowchart, the Efficacy  Assessments sections. 
Appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments 
were performed as standard of care is available in the patient’s source notes.
Bone scans performed as routine procedures within 12 weeks prior to randomization may  
also be accepted as baseline assessment if they  meet the same requirements listed above.
Bone scans performed before the signing of informed consent as routine procedures (but 
within 12 weeks before randomization) do not need to be repeated and may be used as
baseline assessments as long as (1) tests were performed using the method requirements 
outlined in RECI ST v.1.1 (2) the same technique/modality  can be used to follow identified 
lesions throughout the trial for a given patient (3) appropriate documentation indicating that 
these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care is available in the 
patient’s source notes.
Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_4562] (ie, hotspots) identified on the bone scans at baseline and on 
subsequent bone scans shall be confirmed b y X-ray, CT or MRI to confirm its tumor -related 
malignancy .  The same modality  must be used throughout the trial for confirmation for a 
given lesion/patient.  Bone lesions identified at baseline will be followed up according to the 
same assessme nt schedule (ie, Week 8 7days from randomization) as for all other lesions.  
Areas that have received palliative radiotherap y cannot be used to assess response to study  
treatment. 
Brain scans performed as routine procedures within 6 weeks prior to rando mization may  also 
be accepted as baseline assessment if they  meet the same requirements listed above.
Once Amendment 1is approved, a minimum of 100lens grading evaluable ,newly  enrolled 
patients will undergo the following ophthalmic procedures at screeni ng:

Funduscopy  (Ophthalmoscopy  -pupil dilated examination). 
Patients with ophthalmic conditions (eg, anophthalmus, phthisis, aphakia, pseudophakia) that 
would prevent grading of the lens in both ey es will not be considered evaluable for this 
ophthalmic assessment and do not need to undergo these ophthalmic procedures. Reasons for 
not being evaluable must be clearly documented in the patient source notes. 
All ophthalmic examinations will be performed b y an ophthalmologist. Refer to
Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_233174] provide the following information using the 
appropriate CRFs: screening number, demographic data as well as the final patient summary

type of post study  anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , tumor response and date of progression of the diseas e 
during or after the subsequent anticancer therapy ) will be collected every  3months from the 
last dose of study  treatment going forward after approval of Amendment [ADDRESS_233177] 
is acceptable.
For details on follow- up visit procedures, see the SCHEDUL E OF ACTIVITIES tables. 
6.6.Patient Withdrawal
6.6.1. Active Treatment Phase Discontinuation
The term "interruption" refers to a patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_196324] y, but then re -starting it at a later time in the study .  The reason for dosing 
interruption will be collected on the appropriate CRF. 
The term "discontinuation" refers to a patient's withdrawal from the active treatment phase , 
ie,discontinues treatment of palbociclib/p lacebo AND fulvestrant .  The reason for 
discontinuation from treatment will be collected on the appropriate CRF. 
Patients may  be withdrawn from the active treatment phase in case of:
Disease progression);
Symptomatic deterioration (ie, global deteriorati on of health status without objective 
evidence of disease progression);
Need for new or additional anticancer therap y not specified in the protocol;
Unacceptable toxicit y; 
Investigator’s conclusion that discontinuing therapy is in the patient’s best inter est;
Lost to follow -up;

* Patients may continue treatment as assigned at randomization beyond the time of PD at the discretion of the 
investigator if that is considered to be in the best interest of the patient and as long as no new anticancer treatment is 
initiated. In thiscase, the patient w ould continue with routine safety -relevant assessments as per the SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES during the treatment period.
Patients who discontinue from the active treatment phase must have end of 
treatment/withdrawal evaluations performed as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_233178] dose of investigational products and prior to initiation of any  new anticancer 
therap y.  Data to be collected for the end of stud y treatment/withdrawal are described in the 
SCHEDUL E OF ACTIVITIES tables. 
If apatient opts to discontinue from the active treatment phase as a result of an unacceptable 
adverse drug reaction, "withdrawal of consent" should not be the reason for discontinuation.  
Instead, the reason for discontinuation of active treatment phase must be recorded as 
“Unacceptable toxicity ”and an appropriate action taken must be assigned on the AE CRF to 
the adverse event leading to the patient’s withdrawal of consent. 
6.6.2. Study Discontinuation
Patients may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol required schedule of study  
visits or procedures at a given study  site.
Patients will be withdrawn from study in the case of:
Withdrawal of patient consent (ie, refuses tumor assessments or follow -up on survival 
status after the end of treatment);
Lost to follow -up;
Death. 
If a patient does not return for a scheduled vis it, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677].  If after three unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_102], one of which is by  
[CONTACT_4678], the patient should be considered “lost to follow -up”.  Steps taken to contact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc) must be clearly documented in 
the source documents.  In any  circumstance, every  effort should be made to document patient 
outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, 
request the patient returns all unused investigational product(s), request the patient returns for 
a final visit, if aplicable, and follow- up with the patient regarding any  unresolved AEs.
Data to be collected for the end of stud y treatment/withdrawal are described in the

7.1.Pregnancy Testing
For women of childbearing potential, a s erum pregnancy  test, with a sensitivity  of at least 
25mIU/mL will be performed before starting investigational product sat screenin gand 
repeated at the baseline visit.  A negative pregnancy  result is required before the patient may  
receive the study  treatment . 
No routine pregnancy  test will be carried out after baseline as patients will be rendered 
postm enopausal by  [CONTACT_196359]. However, pregnancy  
tests will also be done whenever a potential pregnancy  is suspected. In the case of a positive 
hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from study medication but may  remain onstudy for 
survival follow up .  Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as per request of Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)/IECs or if required by  [CONTACT_56812]. 
In this protocol, a woman is defined of childbearing potential ifpre-or perimenopausal at the 
time of consenting to study  enrollment (see Inclusion Criterion n. 1for details) .
Additionally , for wome n who are <[ADDRESS_233180]

to confirm postmenopausal status. 
7.2.Efficacy Assessments
7.2.1. Tumor Assessments 
Screening/baseline tumor a ssessment will be carried out within 28 days of randomization 
(unless otherwise specified below). 
Disease assessment for all patients at baseline will include:
CT or MRI  scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Clinical assessment of superficial disease which will include photographs of all 
superficial metastatic lesions.  All lesion measurements must be recorded in the CRF. 
Bone scans in order to detect bony  sites of disease.  Any  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_4562] 
(ie,hotspots) identified on the bone scans at baseline must be confirmed b y X-ray, 
CTscan with bone windows or MRI .  Bone lesions identified at baseline as only  site 
of disease will follow the same assessment schedule as for measurab le lesions.  
Baseline brain CT or MRI are onl y required in case signs and symptoms suggest the 
presence of metastatic brain disease.  Refer to the Screening Section for further 
details on timing allowance for basel ine brain and bone scans. 
Post- baseline tumor assessments .  Upon approval of Amendment 3, tumor 
assessments /imaging studies will be performed according to local practice.  
If tumor assessments are scheduled as per the original protocol, upon approval of 
Amendment 3, they  can be performed at a different schedule if this is common practice at 
that institution or it is recommended by  [CONTACT_196360]’s clinical 
conditions.  
Upon approval of Amendment 3, selection of imaging studies wil l depend on treating 
physician and radiologist as per local practice. RECI ST 1.1 may  be used to evaluate imaging 
assessments but will not be mandatory .  Evaluation of imaging studies will be conducted as 
per the practice at the institution.
Tumor lesions [ie, target lesion(s), non -target lesion(s) and target ly mph node(s)] will no 
longer be recoreded in the CRF ,nor will the RECIST assessments .  Only  the date of 
progression of disease will be recorded.  
7.2.2. Ocular Safety Assessments
Amendment 3 will not affec t ocular safet y assessments which will continue to be collected as 
per the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Snellen Best Corrected Visual Acuity and Refraction
Snellen visual acuity  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_2329] a standard wall or projection chart before 
implementing any  proce dures that can affect vision (eg , pupil dilation, tonometry , and 
gonioscopy ).  The same optoty pe will be used throughout the study  for a specific patient, and 
the right ey e should be tested first.  The refr active error will be determined at the Screening 
visit.  The examiner should ensure that patients are seated comfortabl y and that they do not 
move their head forward or backward during testing.  Patients will be told that the chart 
contains only letters.
The line read with 2 or fewer errors will be recorded.  If 3 of the 5 letters on a line are read 
correctly , the patient will be given credit for that line.  For example, if the patient reads 
20/25 +3, 20/20 will be recorded.

20/125, 20/150, and 20/200.  If the acuity at screening is better than 20/20, the decrease will 
be calculated from 20/20.  
In the event of a decrease in visual acuity  of 3 lines or more from screening, refraction will 
be rechecked at all subsequent study  visits.  A change in refraction power (spherical or 
cylindrical) of +/ – 1.25 diopters compared with the screening examination will be reported as 
an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intraocular Pressure Measurement
Intraocular press ure(IOP) will be measured using a calibrated Goldma nn applanation 
tonometer.  Both ey es will be tested, with the right ey e preceding the left eye.  The operator 
will initially  set the dial at [ADDRESS_233182] the results, inc luding the time assessment is made. 
Any IOP increase of greater than 10 mmHg above baseline or an y IOP that increases above

unconscious, that cataract is a uni directional disease that steadily gets worse with age. 
Because of this bias, if one knows the baseline or any  prior lens grade, it is likely  that the 
grade assigned at a follow- up visit will be higher. To avoid this potential observation bias, 
the grader will remain masked to earlier lens grading and should alway s start with a blank 
case report form (CRF).  The Wisconsin AREDS 2008 Clinical L ens Opacity  Grading 
Procedure will be used .61(Appendix 8).  Once the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_196326] 5 mm, use slit 
lamp with ~10X magnification and brightest beam intensity .
Nuclear opacit y:
Orient beam at 45° to viewing axis ;
Adjust slit beam to standard parameters: 8 mm height and 0.3 mm widt h;
Compare opalescence of nucleus with those on the provided pocket card of 
standard photos.
Cortical and PSC opacities :
Select wide slit beam setting optimum for retro -illumination of lens ;
Visualize lens opacities against red fundus reflex background ;
Count only  opacities definitely  visible against red reflex ;
Mentally  combine all cortical opacities into one contiguous area ;
Compare total opacit y area with those on the provided pocket card of standard 
photos.
Grade each type of opacity in half steps from <1 to >3 (1=mild, 2=moderate and 
3=severe) using the scale defined on the provided pocket card of standard photos.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Funduscopy (Ophthalmoscopy)
Funduscopy  (Ophthalmoscopy ) will be performed after dilation of the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_4584] , retina , and optic nerve head.  At screening, an y abnormalities and pathologic 
findings will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.  
Any new findings or deterioration from baseline findings will be reported as an adverse 
event.

ECG interval readings by [CONTACT_4635]’s algorithm will be read and interpreted at the 
investigational site for eligibility  determination and patient safet y monitoring and 
documentation stored in the source docume nts. 
Additional ECGs may  be performed as clinicall y indicated at an y time.
For the purpose of the study , triplicate ECGs are defined as three consecutive ECGs 
performed approximatel y 2minutes apart at the protocol specified timepoints (see 
SCHEDUL E OF ACTIVITIES table for details) to determine the mean QTc interval. 
Refer to the Dose Modification Section for details on dose management in case of abnormal 
ECGs considered related to invest igational product.

analysis and data review are ongoing. Details of the anal ysis (along with other safet y data 
included in the earl y safety  review) will be provided in the E- DMC charter.
For patients who receive palbociclib and f ulvestrant, PK samples will be analy zed for 
palbociclib and fulvestrant concentrations.   For patients who receive fulvestrant and placebo, 
PK samples will be anal yzed for fulvestrant. For pre -and perimenopausal women 
also 
receiving goserelin, PK samples will be anal yzed for palbociclib, fulvestrant AND goserelin 
concentrations. For patients who receive fulvestrant, goserelin and placebo, PK samples will 
be anal yzed for fulvestrant and goserelin. Concentrations of fulvestrant and Goserelin will 
be compar ed between the palbociclib and placebo subgroups.   The concentrations of 
palbociclib will be compared with historical data. 
In these approximately  40patients, two (combinations without goserelin) or three 
(combinations with goserelin) 3 mL samples of venous blood will be collected in 
appropriatel y labeled collection tubes for assessment of palbociclib, fulvestrant, and/or 
goserelin levels at the protocol -specified times, as described above. 
In all other patients (not participating the early  safety  review ), plasma concentrations will be 
drawn on Day 15 of C ycle1 and C ycle 2 for palbociclib determination. These trough 
concentrations will be used for exposure/response anal ysis for safet y and efficacy findings.
  
From those patients, one [ADDRESS_233187] operating procedures. 
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time AND
collected prior to administration of the investigational product son that day will be 
considered protocol compliant.  P atients must be instructed to withhold their daily dose of 
study  drugs on PK sampling day s until the pre -dose PK sample and safet y assessessments 
(iehematolog y, blood chemistry, and ECGs) have been completed.  The exact time of the 
sample collection and t he most recent dosing time will be recorded on the CRF.  The date of 
missing dose should also be recorded in the CRF. 
Additional PK blood samples for palbociclib and fulvestrant (and goserelin if applicable) 
may be collected from patients experiencing unexpected or serious adverse events, or adverse 
events that lead to discontinuation.

Patient reported outcomes of health -related quality  of life and health status will be assessed 
using the EQ- 5D instrument, the EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -BR23 ( Appendix 5, 
Appendix 6, Appendix 7,respec tively).
Patients will complete each instrument at pre- dose on Day  1 of C ycles 1 -4, then on Day 1 of 
every  other subsequent Cycle starting with Cy cle6 (eg, Cycles6, 8, 10, etc), and then at the 
end of treatment visit.  Completed questionnaires are alway sconsidered source document 
and must be filed accordingly .
Patients must complete these instruments in clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to 
having an y tests and to any discussion of their progress with healthcare personnel at the site.  
Interviewer a dministration in clinic may  be used under special circumstances (eg, patient 
forgot their glasses or feels too ill).  The instruments will be given to the patient in the 
appropriate language for the site. 
7.5.1. EuroQol Health Utilities Index EQ -5D 
The EuroQol -5D (EQ -5D) (version 3L) (see Appendix 5) is a 6 item instrument designed to 
assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility  score.  It consists of 
5descriptors of current health state (mobility , self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety /depression); a patient is asked to rate each state on a three level scale (1=no problem, 
2=some problem, and 3=extreme problem) with higher levels indicating greater 
severit y/impairment.  I t also includes a visual analogue scale: the EQ VAS.  The EQ VAS 
records the patient’s self rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 
100 (best imaginable health state).  Published weights are available that allow for the creation 
of a single summary  score.  Overall scores range from [ADDRESS_233188] health.
7.5.2. EORTC QLQ -C30
The EORTC -QLQ -C30 (see Appendix 6) is a 30 -item questionnaire composed of f ive 
multi- item functional subscales (ph ysical, role, cognitive emotional, and social functioning), 
three multi -item sy mptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health/quality  
of life (QOL) subscale, and six single items assessing other ca ncer-related sy mptoms 
(dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite, diarrhea, constipation, and the financial impact of 
cancer).  The questionnaire emplo ys 28 4- point L ikert scales with responses from “not at all” 
to “very  much” and two 7 -point L ikert scales for global health and overall QOL.  For 
functional and global QOL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning and 
are converted to a 0 to 100 scale.  For s ymptom -oriented scales, a higher score represents 
more severe s ymptoms.
7.5.3. EORTC QLQ -BR23 
The EORTC -QLQ -BR23 (see Appendix 7) is a [ADDRESS_233189] cancer- specific companion 
module to the EORTC- QLQ -C30 and consists of two functional scales (body  image and 
sexuality ); three s ymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and s ystemic side effects) and single 
items covering sexual enjoy ment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.

Page 807.6. Biomarker Assessments
Tumor tissues are required from all patients for study  participation. 
HR and HER2 status for eligibility  will be based on local results utilizing an assay  consistent 
with local standards for entry  into the trial and for reporting of the efficacy  endpoints.
Central assessment of ER, PR ,and HER2 on suitable samples will be performed 
retrospectivel y at a quali fied central laboratory .
A biomarker will be nominated as the primary  marker for anal ysis using data external to the 
current stud y. The interaction between this primary  marker (eg, pRb or other from a set of 
biomarkers to be anal yzed) and benefit from palbociclib in terms of prolongation of PFS will
be examined. In addition, other tumor tissue biomarkers, including DNA, RNA and protein 
analytes, will be anal yzed to investigate possible associations with resistance/sensitivity  to 
treatment with palbociclib .  Biomarkers that will be anal yzed will be selected based on their 
known relevance to mechanisms involved in cell cy cle regulation.  Examples of such 
biomarkers include ,but are not limited to, CCND1 and CDKN2A gene copy number, cdk4 
and cdk6 RNA expressi on, and Ki67, pRb, cy clin E and p16 protein expression. The 
relationship between centrally  reported ER /PRand HER2 status and resistance/sensitivity  to 
treatment with palbociclib will also be assessed. 
All patients with archived samples need to provide a FFPE tissue blocks of adequate size to 
allow for three 0.6 mm diameter x 5 mm deep core punches that will be used to generate a 
tissue microarray .  If FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, a minimum of 12 unbacked 
glass slides each containing an unstained 5-micron FFPE tissue section, will be required for 
patient participation.  Archived FFPE specimen from the metastatic or recurrent tumor tissue 
will be collected and sent to the sponsor-designated central laboratories for assessment of 
biomarkers potential ly associated with sensitivity  and/or resistance to palbociclib (eg, Ki67,
p16/CDKN2A, pRb, PI K3CA, CCNE1). 
Plasma samples will be collected for anal yses of circulating free DNA or RNA, and the 
relationship with resistance/sensitivity  to treatment with Pa lbociclib /placebo.
If archived FFPE tissue from a recurrent tumor or distant metastasis is unavailable, a de novo 
biopsy is required for patient participation, except those with bone metastasis only , when, in 
the investigator’s judgment, such biopsy  is fea sible and can be safel y performed.  Original 
diagnostic tumor tissue will be used for biomarker anal yses in the event that patients have 
bone disease onl y. Patients who had surgery  (but without neoadjuvant chemotherap y prior to 
surgery ) within the last 3 yearsand relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy  may  provide 
tissue from that surgery . Provision of de novo metastatic tissue in these cases is strongly  
encouraged but not mandated. 
Detailed information about biomarker sample collection, preparation, storage, labeling, and 
shipment is indicated in the central laboratory  manual.

sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an 
serious adverse event ( SAE ) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative.  For all AEs, suffic ient information should be obtained by  [CONTACT_8889].  The investigator is required to assess causality .

As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigation al product, through and including [ADDRESS_233191].  Serious adverse events occurring to a patient 
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the 
investigato r becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug are 
to be reported to the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on th e Case Report Form ( CRF )from the 
time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through the patient’s last visit. 
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatmen t is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the 
SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y 
intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clini cal investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:

an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study ,

period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196327].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome during the study or within the 
safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an 
SAE with Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTC AE)Grade 5 (see Section 
on Severity  Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an e mergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

Page 868.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced l iver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.   Patients who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  value s:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T 3times the upper limit of normal 
(XULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin [ADDRESS_233193] with no evidence of hemoly sis 
and an alka line phosphatase 2X ULN or not available.
For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For patients with pre- existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_233194], or [ADDRESS_233195] 
(whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with :
For patients with pre- existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin i ncreased from baseline b y an amount of at least onetime the 
upper limit of normal ORif the value reaches 3 times the upper limit of normal 
(whichever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible , 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  For oncology  studies the 
possibility  of hepatic neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be con sidered.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/I nternational Normalized Ratio (I NR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of conta ct with a jaundiced person , surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( eg,biliary  tract) 
may be warranted.   All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria

Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical c ondition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Severity Assessment
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.0 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)   
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences: urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necess arily an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAEs, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessmen t of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements 
if applicabl e.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship s hould be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is “ unknown but not related to investigational product ”, 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator de termines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

exposed (eg, because of treatment or envir onmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/ or 
being exposed to the investigational product. An example of environmental exp osure
would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_57999] h a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman
(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic 
products ).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or aro und the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must subm it this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form and 
Exposure in Utero (EIU) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In 
addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmenta l exposure to a 
[COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been 
exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EIU Form.  This must be 
done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and with in 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see 
below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to 
the initial EI U Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be 
assessed at the time of birth.  I n the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination 
should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus 
should be assessed b ygross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test findings are 
conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fe tal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes th at are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;

Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Par tner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet yunitwithin 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the informat ion is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF) ;however ,a copy  of the 
completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient.  In addition, each study  patient will be question ed about AEs.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requireme nts
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_233198] be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE info rmation.  This timeframe

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 91also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy , exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it an d document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requeste d by [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  I n general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a pat ient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It should be not ed that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.13.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
have been documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which have be endated and 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; 
however, an y major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will 
also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  The planned data analysis in this section was 
performed when t he study  A5481023 (PALOMA -

All primary  and secondary  endpoints based on radiological (and photographical where 
applicable) assessments of tumor burden (ie, PFS, OR, DR, CBR) will be derived using the 
local radiologist’s/invest igator’s assessment.  Radiographic images (approximately  40%, 
randomly  collected) and clinical information collected on -study  will also be reviewed b y a 
blinded independent third -party core imaging laboratory  to verify  investigator reported tumor 
assessmen ts.  This information will be used for supportive anal yses.
In addition to analy ses driven by  [CONTACT_196362], subset anal yses may  be conducted, for 
example ,by [CONTACT_654], regions, race, performance status, line of therapy  in metastatic setting, 
biomarkers, and others as deemed appropriat e.
All of the above secondary  anal yses will be conducted at a one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_233200] documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to 
any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first.  PFS data will be 
censored on the da te of the last tumor assessment on study  for patients who do not have 
objective tumor progression and who do not die while on study.  Patients lacking an 
evaluation of tumor response after randomization will have their PFS time censored on the 
date of rand omization with the duration of one day .  Additionall y, patients who start a new 
anti-cancer therap y prior to documented PD will be censored at the date of the last tumor 
assessment prior to the start of the new therap y. Patients with documentation of PD o r death 
after an unacceptabl y long interval ( ie,2 or more incomplete or non-evaluable assessments) 
since the last tumor assessment will be censored at the time of last objective assessment that 
did not show PD.
The primary  anal yses of PFS will be performe d in the ITT population.  A stratified log -rank 
test (one -sided) will be used to compare PFS time between the 2 treatment arms at the 
interim and/or final anal yses with the overall significance level preserved at 
0.025 (one-sided).  The stratification factors used to conduct the stratified log- rank test for 
the primary  analy sis will be specified in the SAP. 
PFS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized for the ITT population 
using the Kaplan- Meier method and display ed graphicall y where app ropriate.  CI s for the 
25th, 50thand 75thpercentiles of the event -free time will be reported.  The Cox Proportional 
hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment hazard ratio and the corresponding 
95% CI .
PFS will also be evaluated in the AT Popu lation and the stratified long -rank test (one -sided, 
=0.025) will be used.

Overall Survival (OS)
OSis defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any  cause.  In 
the absence of confirmation of de ath, survival time will be censored to last date the patient is 
known to be alive. 
All patients randomized will be considered evaluable for OS.  OS will be hierarchicall y 
tested for significance at the time of PFS analy sis, provided the primary  PFS endpoi nt is 
statistically  significant at the interim and/or final analy ses.  A stratified log -rank test (using 
the same stratification factors as for the PFS analy sis) will be used to compare OS between 
the treatment arms.  OS for the two treatment arms will be assessed using Kaplan -Meier 
methods and displayed graphicall y where appropriate.  The median event times and 95% CIs 
will be estimated. Cox regression models will be used to estimate the treatment hazard ratio 
and its 95% CI .
The 1 -year survival probability  will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and a two 
sided 95% CI  for the log [ -log(1- year survival probability )] will be calculated using a normal 
approximation using the Greenwood’s formula, and then back transformed to give a CI  for 
the 1- year survival probability  itself. 
The 2 -year and 3 -year survival probabilities will be estimated similarly. 
Objective Response (OR) 
OR is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to 
RECI STv.1.1 ( Appendix 4) recorded from randomization until disease progression or death 
due to an y cause. 
A patient will be considered to have achieved an OR if the patient has a sustained CR or PR 
according to RECI ST v.1.1 definitions.  Otherwise, the pat ient will be considered as 
non-responders in the OR rate anal ysis.  Additionally , patients with inadequate data for 
tumor assessment (eg, no baseline assessment or no follow- up assessments) will be 
considered as non -responders in the OR rate anal ysis. 
TheOR rate (ORR) on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by  [CONTACT_196363] (CR or PR) by  [CONTACT_196364] (“response rate”).  A 95% CI  for the response rates will be 
provide d.  Response rate comparisons between the 2 treatment arms as randomized will be 
assessed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with the same stratification factors as 
for the PFS analy sis. 
Analy ses of ORR will be performed on the ITT population based on the investigator’s 
assessment as well and also on the review of the blinded independent third -party  core 
imaging laboratory .

Duration of Response (DR) 
DR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or 
PR) to the first documentation of objective t umor progression or to death due to any  cause, 
whichever occurs first.  DR data will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on 
study  for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not die due to 
any cause while on study. DR will only  be calculated for the subgroup of patients with an 
OR.  DR for the two treatment arms will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods and 
display ed graphically , where appropriate.  The median event time and 95% CI  for the median 
will be provide d for each endpoint. 
Clinical Benefit Response (CBR)
CBR is defined as CR or PR or SD  24weeks according to the RECI ST version 1.1 
(Appendix 4) recorded in the time period between randomization and disease progression or 
death of an y cause. 
The CBR rate on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by [CONTACT_196365], PR, or SD 24weeks b y the number of patients randomized to the 
treatment arm.  A 95% CI for the CBR rates will be provided.  CBR r atecomparison between 
the two treatment arms as randomized will be assessed using CMH test with the same 
stratification factors as for the PFS analy sis.
Analy ses for CBR will be performed on the ITT population based on the investigator’s 
assessment as w ell and also on the review of the blinded independent third -party  core 
imaging laboratory . 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
Breast cancer -specific quality  of life scores and change from baseline scores will be 
compared between the treatment arms using a mixed model repeated measures approach 
adjusting for specified covariates.  In addition, analy ses will be performed to determine if the 
change from baseline scores achieve the appropriate minimally  important difference (MID) 
cut-off for the scale being exami ned. 
In addition to the above analy ses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) 
composite endpoint will be carried out using survival anal ysis methods.  A composite 
definition for deterioration based on death, tumor progression, and/or breast ca ncer-specific 
quality  of life subscale MIDs may  be used.

11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimat e responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616].  Any corrections to entries made in the CR Fs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .

these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be re corded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating pat ients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documen tation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA), whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be tran sferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_233205] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IE C.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is n ecessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.

Page [ZIP_CODE].5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction impose d (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be info rmed immediately . 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP t hat the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed th e study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature te rmination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries
End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of palbocicli b at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_196371][INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within a week of noti fication.  As directed b y [COMPANY_007], all 
study  materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.
15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS

Opacity Grading Procedure
Dilate pupi[INVESTIGATOR_4610] 5 mm diameter;
Use slit lamp with ~10X m agnification ;
Use brightest beam intensity ;
Nuclear opacit y:
Orient beam at 45° to viewing axis ;
Adjust slit beam to standard parameters: 8 mm height and 0.3 mm width ;
Compare opalescence of nucleus with that in standard photos.
Cortical and PSC opacities :
Select wide slit beam setting optimum for retro -illumination of lens ;
Visualize lens opacities against red fundus reflex background ;
Count only  opacities definitely  visible against red reflex ;
Mentally  combine all cortical opacities into one contiguous a rea;
Compare total opacity area with that in standard photos .
Classify  each opacity with scale defined by  [ADDRESS_233237] photos.
Select nearest half -step:
Similar to standard or between two standards;
Obviously  less than mildest standard or greater than most s evere .

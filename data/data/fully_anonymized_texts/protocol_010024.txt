II. Introduction  
 
The optimal treatment for distal tibia fractures remains controversial. A  recent systematic literature 
review found a reduced risk for malalignment for plate fixation compared to intramedullary nailing 
[2]. However, for bone union, wound complications and superficial infection or deep infection no 
statistically significant differences were identified.  
 
In the last decade locking plates gained popularity not only for distal tibia fra ctures but fracture 
treatment in general. Recent studies raised concerns because of the inherent stiffness of these 
locking devices and found they might suppress fracture healing [3][4][5]. To address this issue the 
concept of Far Cortical Locking (FCL) was developed [6][7] and has been  commercially available 
since 2010 in the Zimmer  MotionLoc  Screw for NCB® Polyaxial Locking Plate System and since 
2014 in the  Zimmer  MotionLoc  Screw for Zimmer  Periarticular Lock ing Plate System  (Zimmer Inc.).  
 
FCL screws lock rigidly into the plate and into the far cortex, but retain a controlled motion 
envelope in the near cortex. The screws have an elastic shaft portion that can deflect within this 
motion envelope. This flexion  of FCL screw shafts induces symmetric axial motion at the fracture 
site in response to load bearing. FCL screws are optimized to reduce the initial stiffness of a locked 
plating construct while retaining its construct and fixation strength. MotionLoc  Screws for Zimmer  
Periarticular Locking Plate System  reduce the locked plating construct stiffness by [CONTACT_726] 58% 
while retaining construct strength [8]. 
Recently, a prospective observational clinical study in 31 distal femur fractures treated with Zimmer 
MotionLoc  Screws for NCB  Polyaxial Locking Plate System has shown a fracture healing rat e of 
97% (30 out of 31) after a  [ADDRESS_446868] ate System applied in distal tibia 
fracture treatment and confirm safety and performance  of the screws . 
III. Study Objectives  
 
The objective of this observational prospective study is to systematically document the clinical 
outcome of Zimmer  MotionLoc  Screws for Periarticular Locking Plate System applied in distal tibia 
fracture treatment and confirm safety and performance.  
 
Primary Endpoint:   
 Radiographic & clinical fracture healing at [ADDRESS_446869] -surgery.  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
 Complications  
 Radiol ogic & clinical fracture healing at [ADDRESS_446870] -surgery.  
 Callus size & distribution at [ADDRESS_446871] -surgery.  
 
Radiologic fracture healing is defined as bridging of three of the four cortices as seen on x -ray/CT 
[10][11].  Clinical healing will be assessed using the Function Index for Trauma (FIX -IT) [12].  The 
Zimmer MotionLoc in Distal Tibia Fractures:  An Observational Study   
Page 6 of 25 
FIX-IT instrument quantifies clinical healing by [CONTACT_358243] -bearing and fracture site pain on 
an ordinal scale.  It has been initially validated in pat ients with tibia and femur fractures [12].  
 
Callus size of the anterior, posterior, and medial aspect will be assessed for each time point using 
a validated and published computational method [13].  
 
IV. Study Device  
 
Description of the Device  
 
Zimmer MotionLoc  is a screw technology developed to reduce construct stiffness of locking plates 
while retaining construct strength. Further, it creates constructs that allow nearly parallel 
interfragmentary motion compared to standard locking screws constructs w hich allow motion under 
load at the far cortex while motion at the near cortex remains negligible. The parallel 
interfragmentary motion creates an environment that is thought to promote a symmetric callus  [9]. 
The Zimmer  MotionLoc  screw is designed for use with Zimmer’ s Periarticular Locking Plate 
System. In this trial the 3.5mm diameter stainless steel version will be used. The screw is available 
from 22 to 44mm and  22 to 60mm length in two millimeter increments, non-sterile and sterile , 
respectively . The Zimmer  MotionLoc  Screw for the Periarticular Locking Plate System ( Figure 1) 
has a standard cortical thread section (self -tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], single helix); an expansion secti on, intended to 
create the gap for motion in the near cortex; a mid -section thread with a reduced core -diameter 
and reverse cutting flutes to aid in screw removal; a non -threaded collar section; and a double lead 
threaded head for engagement in the plate.

written Informed Consent approved by [CONTACT_1383]/ IRB. Prio r to performing any study related 
treatment, the Investigator will discuss details of the study with the patient and hand  out the Patient 
Informed Consent Form. During the Informed Consent process, the Investigator must introduce the 
patient to the clinica l study by [CONTACT_358245], and 
describing the study procedures, alternative treatments, risks and benefits of the participation as 
well as how the data will be handled and protected. If the patient decides, after the Investigator’s 
explanations and after receiving adequate time to read the Patient Information Form, to participate 
in the clinical study, she/he must fill in and sign the Patient Consent Form. No patient will be 
enrolled without signing the Informed Consen t.  Any new significant information on the study 
device or the study which may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to participate or to continue 
participation in the study will be provided to new and existing patients throughout the clinical study.  
 
Informed  Consent  Log 
 
An Informed Consent Log must be maintained throughout the study.  All patients who are 
consented for the study must be entered in the log regardless of eligibility.  In the event subjects 
must sign additional study -required consent fo rms after enrollment, per IRB/EC or other 
requirements, subsequent consents must be entered in the Informed Consent Log as well.  
 
Determination of Eligibility  
 
Patient eligibility for enrollment will be determined for consenting candidates based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria in order to be offered enrollment into the study.  Determination of eligibility may 
include an interview to assess significant patient surgical/m edical history, history of present 
illness/injury, evaluation of present pain and functional capacity, and a radiographic assessment.  
All eligible patients will be offered enrollment into the study.  For the purposes of this clinical study, 
patients will be considered subjects after enrollment has been completed.  
 
Subject Enrollment Log  
 
A Subject  Enrollment Log must be maintained throughout the study and is included in the 
Investigator Binder. All patients enrolled in the study must be entered into the Enrollment Log and 
the “Inclusion /Exclusion” form must be completed. Patients must be entered into the Enrollment 
Log sequentially.

Baseline/Preoperative Assessment  
 
Following enrollment, demographic and injury classification data will be entered into the  
“Demographic Information & Injury Classification” set of forms.  
 
Surgical Technique  
 
Implantation will be performed in accordance to the manufacturer’s surgical technique. The distal 
articular segment will be fixed to the plate(s) (medial and/or lateral  Zimmer  Periarticular Distal 
Tibial Locking Plate) with the appropriate number of standard locking screws. All fractures will be 
treated with a “bridge plating” strategy - working length (empty screw holes between the distal and 
proximal segment, see Figure  ) is up to investigator/surgeon discretion. A minimum of three 
MotionLoc screws will be applied into the proximal shaft segment. No inter -fragmentary la g screws 
are permitted across non -articular fractures.  
 
 
Figure 2: Working length  
 
After surgery, intraoperative data will be entered into the “Operative Information” set of forms.  
 
Postoperative Care 
 
Weight bearing will be at the surgeon’s discretion based on the degree of fracture healing.  
 
Surgery until Discharge  
 
After surgery, but before the subject leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], standard anterioposterior  and lateral x -
rays of the operated side must be obtained and the “Discharge” set of forms must be completed.  
 
Follow -up Procedures (Data Collection)  
 
Follow -up evaluations will be performed at 6 weeks (± 14 days), 3 months (± 14 days), 6 months (± 
30 day s) and 12 months (± 30 days) post -surgery. Standard anterioposterior and lateral x -rays of 
the operated side must be obtained at each follow -up. If the treating surgeon is unable to 
adequately assess cortical healing due to radiographic obstruction of the implant(s), additional x -
ray(s) should be performed. At [ADDRESS_446875] be performed in 
addition. The “Follow -up” set of forms must be completed at each follow -up time point. This 
includes the assessment of radiologic fracture healing. At [ADDRESS_446876] assess the FIX -IT Score and document on the corresponding set of forms. At the 12 

Zimmer MotionLoc in Distal Tibia Fractures:  An Observational Study   
Page 12 of 25 
month follow -up the “Study Completion” form must be completed additionally.   Copi[INVESTIGATOR_358238] x -ray films and CT scans must  be sent to the Sponsor.  
 
Patient Withdrawal  
 
Patient withdrawal has to be documented on the “Study Completion” form. In particular the reason 
for withdrawal must be documented. The occurrence of any of the following situations gives reason 
to withdraw a patient from the study:  
 
 Voluntary patient withdrawal.  Patients are at liberty to withdraw from the study at any time 
and for any reason without affecting future treatment.  
 Development of a concurrent condition which would interfere with the p atient's continued 
participation.  
 Reoperation including complete removal of study device(s).  
 Patient is non -compliant.  
 
Lost to Follow -up 
 
Patients will be considered lost to follow -up after they have missed a visit and a reasonable 
number of attempts to locate and evaluate them have failed. This has to be documented on the 
“Study Completion ” form and in particular the reason should be docume nted. Patients lost to 
follow -up will not be replaced within the study . 
 
Minimization of Subjects Lost to Follow -Up 
 
Subject follow -up is extremely important for the conduct of a clinical study. The expectation is to 
maintain the highest rate of follow -up compliance possible throughout this study. No replacement is 
foreseen for any patient lost to follow -up.  In an effort to minimize lost -to-follow -up subjects, the 
following recommendations and/or study requirements are essential to ensure proper patient 
selection and compliance:  
 
1. Patient Eligibility : Subjects will be selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
detailed in Section 8 and are expected to return for all follow -up visits.  
2. Patients Counseled:  Patients will be counseled during the Info rmed Consent process on the 
importance of returning for follow -up visits.  
3. Patient Exclusion:  Patients who are not willing to return for study required follow -up visits 
and/or are not willing to comply with the follow -up schedule will not be considered for  
enrollment into the study.  
4. Subject Due Listings:  In addition to proper patient selection, Zimmer  Biomet  will provide 
subject due notices to the sites on a regular basis in order to track each study participant 
and monitor adherence to the required follow -up visit timeframes. The subject due listings 
will facilitate scheduling the subjects for their return office visits.  
5. Contact [CONTACT_358246]:  Attempts to contact [CONTACT_358247]’s 
medical record. It is recommended that the first  three attempts be made by [CONTACT_756]. If

all attempts to contact [CONTACT_358250] “Study Completion” form will be 
completed and will specify the reason the 
subject is no longer participating in this 
study.  
 
 
Radiographic Management  
 
All radiographic imag ing performed according to the protocol will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_358251] -operative assessment for standard patient 
management purposes.  If a radiographic adverse event is identified by [CONTACT_358252], the Inves tigator must document the event and report the radiog raphic 
findings on a Complication  Case Report Form for Sponsor review.  It is possible that radiographs  
taken within this study  could be used for future regulatory submissions and/or product evaluations,  
and may therefore require radiographic review  by [CONTACT_358253] . 
 
Recommended Revision Procedure  
 
If a device has to be removed1, the investigator will choose the best revision treatment method for 
the subject.  Before revision surgery, the Investigator must document any significant radiographic 
findings related to the need for revision.  Additionally, once the revision surgery has been 
completed, the Investigator must complete an Adverse Event CRF, as well as a Study Completion 
CRF, terminating the subject from the study.  
1Device removal after fracture healing, upon patient request or as part of standard treatment, is not 
considered a “Recommended Revision Procedure”.

Zimmer MotionLoc in Distal Tibia Fractures:  An Observational Study   
Page [ADDRESS_446882] scans are frequently used to assess healing because they provide cross -sectional 
imaging along the  entire fracture site; this is particularly useful when orthopaedic implants partially 
obscure the fracture lines on plain x -ray. In the p roposed study, the CT scan will be performed to 
definitively characterize the healing pattern at the fracture site and  to quantify the amount of callus 
(new healing bone) present. As a result, all subjects will be exposed to the radiation associated 
with the CT scan of the tibia fracture site at [ADDRESS_446883]

 Resolved:  The outcom e of the medical event has been resolved and/or no further 
treatment is required to treat the reported condition or illness.  
 
 Tolerated:  The outcome of the medical event will most likely never be resolved.  The 
patient “tolerates” the illness or condition as a matter of life.  
 
 Pending:  This outcome indicates treatment or diagnostic studies were prescribed for the 
medical event and the outcome of the medical event is not yet known.  
 
 Study Withdrawal:  Due to the medical/adverse event, the patient was withdraw n from the 
study.  
 
 Device Removal/Reoperation:  The outcome indicates the medical event resulted in the 
removal of the investigational device or required reoperation of the investigational device.  
 
 Death:  The outcome indicates the patient death is a direct result of the reported 
medical/adverse event.  
 
 
IX. Reporting  
 
The use or disclosure of all protected health information will comply with the HIPAA Privacy Act 
and Safe Harbor Requirements.  All informat ion will be treated with strict adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality and will be filed by [CONTACT_358254].  All reports and communications relating to subjects in 
the study will identify each patient by [CONTACT_102]’s initials, year of birth, assigned study 
identification number and date of surgery only.  
 
The Investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of data 
reported to the Sponsor in accordance with this protocol. The Investigator or designee will provide 
periodic reports to their IRB/EC as required to maintain IRB/EC approval throughout the study, and 
will provide any required final reporting to the IRB/EC upon study comple tion/termination.   A copy 
of all IRB/EC re -approval letters must be submitted to the Sponsor.  If the IRB/EC terminates or 
suspends its approval of the study, the Investigator or designee will suspend study -related 
activities and will promptly notify the Sponsor.  The Investigator should also promptly provide 
written reports to the Sponsor and the IRB/EC regarding any changes significantly affecting the 
conduct of the study, and/or increasing risk to the subjects.  
 
Reporting Prior to Study Start -Up 
 
The fo llowing must be  submitted to Zimmer Biomet prior to beginning t he study . 
 
Clinical Trial Agreement   
The Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) must be signed by [CONTACT_358255].  At this 
point, it must be submitted to Zimmer  Biomet  prior to the investigator participating in the clinical 
invest igation.  The CTA includes the I nvestigator Agreement.  
 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee  Protocol Approval  
The protocol must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_358256] 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) of the participating surgeon.  The investigator may not participate in

Page 18 of 25 
the study until the IRB/EC has fully approved the study protocol  and a copy of the protocol 
approval has been received by [CONTACT_358257] . 
 
Approved Informed Consent Form  
The Informed Consent Form must be approved by [CONTACT_114021]/EC before it c an be used in 
the study.  The Informed Consent  provided to Zimmer Biomet must be date stamped by [CONTACT_5040]/EC ; if the IRB/EC does not stamp the appro ved consent, the consent version must be clearly 
stated in the IRB/EC approval letter, and visible in the Informed Consent .  Each patient must be 
consented using the most recently approved Informed Consent Form.   If the IRB/EC requires an 
Informed Consent form different than the one provided in the investigational plan, a sample copy of 
the new Informed Consent form must be submitted to Zimmer Biomet for internal review and 
approval.  Written informed consent must be obtained for each subject before they ma y be enrolled 
in the study.  
 
 
Data Management Plan  
 
Case Report Forms  
Data from each subject will be collected on spe cific Case Report Forms (CRFs) p rovided for this 
study.   Specific data will be collected at the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative visits.  The 
schedul e for data collection is in Section V – Study Design.   
 
Instructions for Case Report Form Completion  
All study data will be collected electronically.  The Investigator will be responsible for the accuracy 
and completeness of the CRFs.   All data must be completed in the pre -defined CRFs.   No items 
should be left blank unless directed.  
 
The investigator must retain the patient data sources in accordance with local law and regulations. 
The investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or early destruction of the study 
related materials.  The standard procedures for handling and processing records will be followed 
per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011  [1]0, Zimmer  Biomet ’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs , Zimmer 
Biomet QM -System, Warsaw ) and the Data Management Plan  for this study.  
 
Submission of CRFS / X -rays / CT Scans  
 
The CRFs will be submitted electronically via a tool provided by [CONTACT_358257] . Anonymized 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_200929] x -ray film s (JPEG or TIF) and CT scan ( DICOM 3) taken at the site during the 
indicated evaluations have to  be sent to the Sponsor  either via e -mail or post mail (CD or DVD) to  
the Zimmer Biomet Clinical Study Manager for this study.  Alternatively anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] x -ray 
films and CT scans can also be provided via Zimmer  Biomet  representatives within the respective 
countries.  
 
Data Entry  
 
A central database maintained by [CONTACT_358258].  
Data will be entered directly by [CONTACT_358259]. Data discrepancy 
(incomplete or inconsistent data) will be raised automatically during  or shortly after the data ent ry, 
Zimmer MotionLoc in Distal Tibia Fractures:  An Observational Study   
Page [ADDRESS_446886]. All electronic systems are validated according to U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulation 21 CFR Part 11 and Good Clinical Practice standards. Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations deals with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)  regulatory 
guidelines on electronic records and electronic signatures in the [LOCATION_002]. Appropriate audit 
trails exist on both the front and back end of the data management systems. Back -up files are 
maintained by [CONTACT_358260] [ADDRESS_446887] to be 
reported to the IRB/Ethics Committee , according to the timeframe required by [CONTACT_241750]/EC guidelines  and to the Sponsor as soon as possible. Further, any inciden ts must  be 
documented on the Complication  form for the dura tion of the investigation. The outcome s of such 
complications must  be documented and any changes in outcome s must  be updated during the 
course of the study.  
 
Protocol Deviations  
The investigator should not deviate from the study protocol unless it is to reduce the risk of bringing 
harm to the patient.  If a deviation from the protocol does occur, then the deviation must be 
documented on the Protocol Deviation CRF.  This deviation should be reported to Zimmer  Biomet  
within ten (10) working days of the deviation occurring.   All Protocol Deviations must be reported to 
the governing IRB/EC within the timeframe required by [CONTACT_114021]/EC guidelines and to the 
Sponsor as soon as po ssible after the deviation has been discovered.  
 
Failure to Obtain Informed Consent  
Study subjects must sign an ICF prior to their participation in this study. However, if the Investigator 
implants a device and enrolls the patient into this study without obtaining informed consent, the 
Investigator shall submit a completed Protocol Deviat ion CRF indicating the circumstances for the 
occurrence to Zimmer Biomet and the reviewing IRB /EC (if applicable)  within five (5) working days 
after the occur rence . The Investigator must obtain informed consent from the patient after 
discovery of the occur rence  before the subject may continue in the study .  If an Investigator has 
recurring failure to obtain patient informed consent, Zimmer Biomet may suspend research 
activities on an individual basis.

Quality  Assurance of Data  
 
The study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [15] and the ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 [1]. The Investigator will be required to permit representative(s)  of the Sponsor’s 
monitoring team to inspect all Case Report Forms and corresponding sections of the study patients 
office records and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358240]. These audits will be done for quality 
assurance purposes, i.e. verifying adherence to the Clinical Investigation Plan and the 
completeness and accuracy of the data being entered on the Case Report Forms.  
 
The Clinical Investigation Plan will be provided to all participating study centers. The Investigators 
will be fully trained in the pr oper reporting and submission of trial data prior to patient enrollment . 
The Clinical Study Manager is responsible for generating data queries for missing or unclear data if 
needed. It is the responsibility of the Clinical Study Manager to ensure data qual ity. There are 
regular meetings between the Investigators and Zimmer Biomet Clinical Affairs staff. Written 
correspondence to all sites is used to inform the Investigators of routine study details and to update 
them on study status.  
 
The Investigator shoul d ensure that all data reported to the Sponsor on the CRFs is accurate and 
complete.  Study records must be retained by [CONTACT_345471] a minimum of 2 
years from the Investigator’s study termination date, or per applicable regulatory and/o r IRB or EC 
requirements (whichever time period is greater).  
 
Zimmer Biomet Study Monitoring  
During the investigation, Zimmer Biomet will conduct periodic monitoring visits and maintain 
contact [CONTACT_358261] -related adverse events.   These visits will take place as necessary to ensure full compliance 
by [CONTACT_779].   The monitor will report any non -compliance observed at the site to Zimmer  Biomet .  
The monitor will also review the submitted CRFs for completeness, accuracy, and to ensure no 
increased subject risk has occurred.   When any discrepancies are identified, they will be 
addressed with the investigator or coordinator.  
 
Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
Zimm er Biomet may decide to suspend or prematurely terminate  the clinical study in one or more 
investigation al sites if information that the risk to the study subjects is higher than initially indicated 
becomes available and/or interim analysis indicates that the results significantly differ from the 
expected outcomes  or statistical endpoints.  In the case of an early termination  of the study the 
regulatory authority( ies) and EC(s)/ IRB(s) should be informed according to local and national 
regulations. The reasons for termination should be provided and documented.  Further follow -up of 
the patients shall proceed according to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358241].  
 
Indemnity  
Sponsor shall indemnify participating patients for any damage which may result from the Sponsor’s 
breach of any applicable data protection laws with respect to this Study.  
 
Amendments to the Clinical Investigation Plan

Page 21 of 25 
All amendments shall be agreed with the Sponsor and the Investigator(s) and be recorded with a 
justification for the amendment. Approval of the EC/ IRB that reviewed the original Clinical 
Investigation Plan must be obtained if required according to the corresponding regulations.  
 
Publication  Policy  
Both the Clinical Investigator and the Sponsor have the right to publish or allow the results of the 
clinical trial to be published. The Clinical Investigator recognizes that the Sponsor has a special 
interest in the results of the clinical study a nd will, in accordance to the clinical trial agreement, 
submit manuscripts to the Sponsor prior to submission. If the Sponsor desires changes to be 
made, these are communicated to the Clinical Investigator for consideration.  
 
Pooled data may be used for tr aining and meetings.

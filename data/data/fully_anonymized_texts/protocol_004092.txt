CONFIDENTIAL  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Disease Background  
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are major contributors to human 
morbidity and mortality and have a staggering impact on societal productivity. More than [ADDRESS_452598] that the prevalence of DM within the [LOCATION_003] may be plateauing with 
approximately 50% of our adults affected with f rank DM (13%) or pre -DM (38%)2. One of the 
most frequent end -organ manifestations of DR is diabetic macular edema (DME), the most 
common cause of visual loss among working -age populations.3-[ADDRESS_452599] validated treatment for DME, laser photocoagulation o f the macula, was established by 
[CONTACT_319770] (ETDRS) in the 1980s.6 More recently, both 
intravitreal anti -vascular endothelial growth factor -A (VEGF) and steroid injections have proven 
effective in DME management7-[ADDRESS_452600] progressively replaced focal laser as the primary 
treatment of center -involving DME with visual acuity loss.7, 12 -17  Multiple large, randomized, 
controlled trials directly comparing focal laser with either anti -VEGF or steroid 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_363346].7, 13, 17, 18 Currently 4 agents are approved by [CONTACT_363353]: aflibercept (Eylea®, Regeneron), ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech), 
dexametha sone (Ozurdex®, Allegan), fluocinolone acetonide (Iluvien®, Alimera), and one agent 
is regularly used off label, bevacizumab (Avastin®, Genentech).  
5.2. Scientific Rationale  
Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections have become the overwhelming choice for first line tr eatment 
of DME causing visual acuity loss19.  The only prospective trial directly comparing the 3 
commercially -available anti -VEGF agents was recently reported by [CONTACT_112860] (DRCR.net): Protocol -T, A comparative effe ctiveness study of 
intravitreal aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab for DME.20, [ADDRESS_452601]  
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension , is a preservative -free, terminally 
sterilized, aqueous suspension, formulated for administration into the eye. It will be administered 
as a single suprachoroidal injection of 4 mg in 100 microliters ( L) using Clearside’s proprietary 
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clears ide Biomedical, Inc

Aflibercept (EYLEA®) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescription 
medicine. Full prescribing information for aflibercept in the treatment of diabetic macular edema 
involves injection of 2 mg (0.05 mL) administered by [CONTACT_78759] [ADDRESS_452602] 5 injections followed by [CONTACT_39773] 8 weeks.

5.4. Summary of Clinical Experience  and Justification for Route of 
Administration and Dose Selection  
Triamcinolone  acetonide  (TA) has been used safely and effectively in human ocular therapeutics 
to treat conditions involving inflammation in the eye, for over 50 years. The initial recommended 
dose of the TA formulation approved by [CONTACT_363354] 4 mg in 100 μL 
(TRIESENCE®). The dose of CLS -TA administered as a single suprachoroidal injection will be 
the same (4 mg in 100 μL). TRIESENCE® and CLS -TA contain the same active and inactive 
ingredients at approximately the same concentrations. Both formulations are aqueous injectable 
suspensions that have been terminally sterilized and designed for ophthalmic use.  
Clearside is developi[INVESTIGATOR_363347] -TA, a proprietary TA formulation for the treatment of non -
infectious uveitis by [CONTACT_363355] 2 clinical trials in patients 
with non -infectious uveitis and one clinical trial in patients with retinal vein occlusion . 
The completed clinical study, CLS1001 -101, was a Phase 1/2, open -label, safety and tolerability 
study in subjects with intermediate -, posterior -, or pan - non-infectious uveitis. Each subject 
received a single suprachoroidal injection of 4 mg in 100 µL TA (Triesence). Nine (9) of the [ADDRESS_452603] subjects  in the safety analysis set (82%) completed the [ADDRESS_452604] one AE, with a total of 37 AEs reported. One unrelated serious adverse event (pulmonary 
emboli; SAE) occurred. No deaths were reported. No significant increases in IOP  were reported. 
The most commonly reported AE, eye pain, was reported in [ADDRESS_452605] a mean 
reduction in central subfield of thickness (CST) of 164 mic rons (p=0.002)  when measured from 
baseline at 2 months ; further, a mean improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with a 
gain of 9.2 letters when measured from baseline at 2 months  was also seen . No subjects 
discontinued due to an adverse event an d there were no investigator -reported increases in IOP at 
follow -up visits.  
The completed clinical study, CLS100 3-201, was a Phase 2, randomized, masked safety and 
efficacy study in subjects with macular edema  following RVO . Forty -six subjects were 
randomized 1:1 to either suprachoroidal injection of CLS -TA administered in conjunction with 
an intravitreal injection of aflibercept (ACTIVE), or an intravitreal injection of aflibercept alone 
(CONTROL) . Subjects were evaluated over the thr ee month study period with monthly visits; 
additional intravitreal aflibercept treatments were determined using as needed (PRN) criteria that 
included the presence of central retinal fluid or losses in visual acuity. Since a key goal of the 
study was to de termine if suprachoroidal CLS -TA affected the requirement for additional 
treatment when administered along with intravitreal aflibercept, a count of the requirement for 
additional intravitreal aflibercept injections over the 3 -month trial served as the pri mary outcome 
measure. The study met the primary endpoint with sixty percent fewer additional IVT aflibercept 
injections (p=0.013) required in the ACTIVE group receiving the combination of SC CLS -TA 
and IVT aflibercept compared with subjects in the CONTROL arm. In terms of secondary 
endpoints, mean improvements from baseline in BCVA were 16, 20, and [ADDRESS_452606] of 446 µm in the 
ACTIVE (combination) group, and a [ADDRESS_452607] in the ACTIVE 
(combination) group was maintained through the [ADDRESS_452608] at both months 2 and 3. No 
subjects discontinued due to an AE and no SAEs were reported. A total of 4  subjects in the 
active group reported AEs pertaining to e levated IOP:   [ADDRESS_452609] commonly 
reported AE. Additional information regarding clinical experience with TA administered to the 
SCS, is available in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The current trial aims to evaluate  the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CLS -TA 
with or without intr avitreal aflibercept for the treatment of eyes with DME.

[CONTACT_363356].   
If a subject is early terming the procedures for Visit 7 (M onth 6) should be completed.  
 
8.4.6.  Anterior Segment SD -OCT  
Anterior segment SD -OCT imaging will be performed pre-and post-dose at  visits where subject’s 
meet  re-treatment and at the exit visit. If a subject has exited the study , they will be called an d 
asked to return for one visit  to complete anterior segment SD -OCT imaging.  Sites will have [ADDRESS_452625] of one unilateral injection of SC 
CLS-TA.  
Subjects will be assigned  to either of the following groups:  
1. TX Naive : IVT aflibercept [2 mg (50 µL)] + SC CLS -TA [4 mg (100 µL)]  
2. Previous TX : SC CLS-TA [4 mg (100 µL)]  
Approximately 20 subjects will be assigned  in a 1 :[ADDRESS_452626] is enrolled. The 
determination of the study eye will be based on Visit 1 (screening/ba seline) information.  
If both eyes meet study criteria, the eye, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], with the better chance of 
achieving an improvement in anatomic findings on SD -OCT should be used as the study eye. If 
both eyes qualify for the study, and appear  similar in their chance of improvement, the right eye 
should be designated as the study eye. The eye that is not designated as the study eye will be 
denoted as the fellow eye.  
9.3. Fellow Eye Treatment  
The fellow eye may receive any standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_363349].  
9.4. Re-Treatment Criteria

 Systemic anti-angiogenic drugs (anti -VEGF) including e.g. pegaptanib sodium, 
bevacizumab, ranibizumab  
 Any investigational drug or device  
In cases where there is anticipated need for the above listed medications during the study or if a 
subject presents to the Inves tigator having initiated treatment during the study with one of these 
medications or classes of medications, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to notify the 
Sponsor immediately. If additional therapy is necessary to treat worsening of DME  in the  study 
eye and normal standard of care requires these medications, they will be recorded in the subject’s 
case report form and should follow the guidelines presented for re-treatment  criteria. Subjects 
will not be discontinued from the study due to initiat ion/change in a prohibited medication.  
9.6. Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will only be administered by [CONTACT_359215] (principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator) in the office. No study drug will be dispensed to subjects; therefore, subject 
treatment compliance is not applicable.  
9.7. Randomization and Mask ing 
Subjects will be assigned to a  study arm based upon their DME treatment history. No 
randomization will occur in this study. This study is an open -label study; no masking is 
necessary.

 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
 
12.1.1.  Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured by [CONTACT_363363] (Goldmann) and results 
will be recorded in mmHg. Tonometers must be calibrated for accuracy . 
12.1.2.  Biomicroscopy  
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, including magnification, will be performed consistent with standard 
clinical practice. This procedure should be conducted in the same manner for all subjects and 
will include an assessment of each of the following as normal or abnormal: eyelids, cornea, 
anterior chamber, iris and lens. All abnormal findings will be described.  
12.1.3.  Indirect Ophthalmoscopy  
Dilated ophthalmoscopy should be performed according to the investigator’s standar d dilation 
procedure. This procedure should be the same for all subjects observed at the investigator’s site. 
The fundus will be examined thoroughly and the following variables (including but not limited 
to): vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic nerve/disc . Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy will be 
assessed at every visit.  
12.1.4.  Fluorescein Angiography  
FA will be performed on the study eye only at all visits at which it is performed. Disease 
characterization will be assessed  and will include the area of fluorescein  leakage.  The technician 
is encouraged to use the same equipment throughout the subject’s study participation. All images 
should be taken by [CONTACT_363362], whenever possible, on each subject per research site.  
12.1.5.  Fundus Photography  
Wide color fundus p hotos will be obtained. It is recommended that when both fundus photos and 
FA are conducted in the same visit, the Fundus Photos should be taken first.  The technician is 
encouraged to use the same equipment throughout the subject’s study participation. All photos 
should be taken by [CONTACT_363362], whenever possible, on all subjects per research site.  
12.1.6.  Heart Rate and Blood Pressure  
Vital signs will be measured on subjects after they have been seated for about 5 minutes. Resting 
heart rate and resting b lood pressure (systolic and diastolic, preferably on the same arm each 
time) will be measured at the Screening/Baseline Visit .

Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all women of childbearing potential at each treatment 
visit.  
HbA1C wi ll be collected on all subjects at Screening and Exit Visits.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre -
existing medical con dition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or 
not considered casually related to the product.  In clinical studies, an AE can include an 
undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout period s, even 
if no study treatment has been administered.  
 
All AEs that occur after any patient/subject has been enrolled, before treatment  or during study 
participation , whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following:  
 Results in death  
 It is i mmediately life -threatening  
 It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any patient/subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during 
treatment, or during study participation , wheth er or not they are related to the study, must be 
recorded . 
 
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clearside Biomedical, Inc   
CLS1004 -[ADDRESS_452633] for each AE ( Unrelated or Related).  The Investig ator should decide 
whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a 
relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  
 
12.4. Recording Adverse Event s 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102]/subject and/or in response to an open 
question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_49899].  Clinically significant changes in labora tory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as AEs.  However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs and Serious Adver se Events (SAEs) will be collected from the signing of 
consent form until the end of the study.  The AE term should be reported in standard medical 
terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset 
(date and time) , resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study . 
 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
 Mild (awareness of sign or s ymptom, but easily tolerated)  
 Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
 Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a m easure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS] .  An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious.  
 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported to Clearside Biomedical .  Pregnancy in itself is 
not regarde d as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_363350] a contraceptive medication.  
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clearside Biomedical, Inc

 The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnor mality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions witho ut complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
 
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until the end 
of the study .  Any SAEs considered possibly or probably related to the investigational product 
and discovered by [CONTACT_363364] s hould be reported.  All SAEs must 
be reported to Clearside Biomedical w ithin one business day of the first awareness of the event.  
The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the 
information recorded on the SAE page s with the corresponding source documents, and send a 
copy by [CONTACT_363365] .   
 
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be faxed to Clearside 
Biomedical  within one business day of receipt and this should be completed on a follow -up SAE 
form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the 
CRF and/or study file.  
 
Clearside Biomedical  is responsible for notifying the  relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events.  It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at 
his or her site.  Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events 
(7/15 D ay Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial.  Each site is responsible for 
notifying its IRB of these additional SAEs.

The study population will include approximately 20 adult subjects (18 years or older) wi th 
diabetic macular edema who meet all of the Inclusion criteria, and Exclusion criteria and receive 
some amount of study drug. Approximately [ADDRESS_452634] one dose of study drug. This is a safety and tolerability study however 
efficacy analyses will be presented for the safety population as well. Such an analysis will ensure 
that benefit to risk is properly evaluated.  
13.3. Analysis  
All data collected in the  study database will be presented in the listings.  Listings will include 
change from baseline.  Baseline is the Visit 1 pre -dose.  
Summary statistics from Investigator findings will be tabulated and summarized descriptively. 
For categorical outcomes (e.g.,  normal or abnormal). For continuous outcomes (e.g., change in 
IOP), descriptive summary statistics will include the sample size, mean, median, standard 
deviation, standard error, minimum and maximum values.  
No other statistical analysis will be prepared f or this study.

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of  Clearside 
Biomedical will evaluate  the investigational study site to: 
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
 Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their respon sibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Clearside Biomedical or its 
representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Clearside Biomedical  and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from  Clearside Biomedical  or representative will have regular 
contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
 Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
 Confirm that the investigational team is a dhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
 Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case repor t 
forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient 
(e.g. clinic charts).  
 Record and report any protocol deviations not pr eviously sent to Clearside Biomedical . 
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to Clearside Biomedical  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor wi ll be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Clearside Biomedical, a regulatory authority, an Independent 
Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a Clearside Biomedical audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine  whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded,

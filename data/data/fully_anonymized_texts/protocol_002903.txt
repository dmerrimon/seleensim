Title of Study:  A Phase 1, First -in-Human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  of IMGN853 in Adults with Ovarian Cancer and 
other FOLR1-positive Solid Tumors 
Study center(s):  up to 10  in the [LOCATION_002] and 1 site in Canada  
Studied period (months): Approximately 50 mo nths 
(including follow up) 
First patient  enrolled: June 28, [ADDRESS_230688] patient dosed: July 9, 2012 Phase of development: 1 
 
Purpose/rationale:  IMGN853 is a specific, targeted antibody maytansinoid  conjugate (A MC) that binds 
with high affinity to folate receptor 1 ( FOLR1 ), a GPI- linked protein, which is highly expressed  on the 
surface of solid tumors , particularly  epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296], endometrial cancer, NSCLC  and renal cell 
cancer .  IMGN853 consists of a humanized anti -FOLR1 monoclonal antibody (M9346A) attached via a 
disulfide containing linker to the cytotoxic maytansinoid, DM4.  Once released within the target cell, 
DM4 acts as an anti- mitotic agent that inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly, 
resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.  
In vitro , IMGN853 binds cell surface FOLR1 with high apparent affinity (≤ 0.1 nM) and shows potent 
(IC50 ≤ 1 nM) and selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing FOLR1.  IMGN853 additionally 
demonstrates significant activity against FOLR1 -positive xenografts, with partial and complete 
remissions observed in ovarian and NSCLC models.  Together with the selective upregulation of FOLR1 
in solid tumors, these results provide the rationale for exploring the clinical utility of IMGN853.  
This first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1 study is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
determine the r ecommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN853 when administered intravenously as a 
single agent in adult patient s with relapsed or refractory ovarian cancer and other FOLR1 -positive solid 
tumors .  The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (Pd), immunogenicity,  and 
preliminary anti-tumor activity of IMGN853 will be characterized.  Two dosing schedules will be 
evaluated in this study:  
Schedule A: IMGN853 administered on Day 1, with cycles repeating every 21 days  (Q3W)  
Schedule B: IMGN853 administered on Days 1, 8, and 15, with cycles repeating every 28 days  (modified 
weekly ) 
Amendment 10 Update:  further evaluation of dosing Schedule B has been discontinued in this study.  
Objectives: The primary objective s of this study are to determine the MTD (dose escalation) 
and define the RP2D (MTD expansion) for the two dosing schedules.  The secondary objectives 
are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMGN853 and to characterize the PK, P d, 
immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of IMGN853.  The exploratory objectives are to 
determine any association between FOLR1  expression levels and clinical response and to 
evaluate potential biomarkers in  blood and tumor tissue that might predict response to 
IMGN853.  
The study objectives are detailed in Sections 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5, and corresponding study 
endpoints are defined in Section s 2.2, 2.4, and  2.6. 
Number of patients (planned):  
IMGN853 Dated  02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 9 of 138 It is estimated that 209 patients * will be enrolled into the study.  
• Dose Escalation Phase: (1) Schedule  A: 44 patient s (2) Schedule  B: 25 patients  
• Dose Expansion Cohort 1: Patients with e pi[INVESTIGATOR_12253] c ancer (EOC) which is 
resistant to platinum- based therapy : 40 patient s  
• Dose Expansion Cohort 2:  Advanced or recurrent uterine cancer : 20 patients   
• Dose Expansion Cohort 3 : Patients with relapsed EOC , which is amenable to biopsy: 20 
patient s 
• Dose Expansion Cohort 4:  Relapsed/refractory NSCLC adenocarcinoma or 
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma  (BAC): 20 patient s 
• Dose Expansion Cohort 5: Patients with EOC which has relapsed following platinum-
based therapy : 40 patients; this cohort of patients will receive prophylactic corticosteroid 
eye drops  
*NOTE:  Every effort will be made to ensure the requisite number of patients are accrued in 
each cohort, and to this end, communications with the site will be monitored carefully. There 
are instances however, where, as a result of simultaneous screening activities, patients may 
qualify for the study at the same time , resulting in slight over-enrollment in individual cohorts 
The estimated study duration is approximately 50 months for patient  accrual, dosing, and follow 
up. 
Study Design Overview and Schema : This is an open label, Phase 1, non-randomized, FIH  
study of IMGN853 in adult patient s with FOLR1 -positive solid tumors that have relapsed, or 
are refractory to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  Two dosing schedules will be evaluated in this study:  
Schedule A : IMGN853 administered on Day 1, with cycles repeating every 21 days (Q3W) 
The dose escalation phase will initially enroll [ADDRESS_230689] 3+3 design, with each cohort 
consisting of 3 or 4 to 6 patients.  Amendment 10 Update : Dose escalation is complete and the 
MTD was determined to be 6 mg/kg (AIBW) and available data available to date indicate that 
the MTD is equal to the RP2D. Schedule A is currently being evaluated in the dose expansion cohorts.   
Schedule B:  IMGN853 administered on Days 1, 8, and 15, with cycles repeating every 28 days 
(modified weekly)

The starting dose of IMGN853 was  1.1 mg/kg, which was 1/3 the 3.3 mg/kg dose level, which 
was deemed clinically safe in nine patients  on a Q3W schedule.  All doses were calculated  
according to adjusted ideal body weight ( AIBW ).  Patients were enrolled in cohorts of 3 to 6 
patients and the MTD was determined to be 2.0 mg/kg (AIBW).  The CRC convened to review 
safety, PK and efficacy data from the dose escalation cohorts, as well as available data from 
patients treated on S chedule A .  These findings were presented at the ASCO annual meeting 
(Borghei  2015).  
The modified weekly schedule did not provide any apparent safety or efficacy advantage. Based on safety and overall response data collected through May 2015, the CRC determined that all 
new patients will receive IMGN853 treatment according to  Schedule A (Q3W) only ( Figure  2). 
All new patients enrolled in the trial will receive IMGN853 at the MTD of 6 mg/kg once every 
three weeks. Of note, safety data that are available to date indicate that the MTD is equal to 
the RP2D.  
The study design and methodology is outlined in detail in Section 4.1.

Additional exclusion criteria are detailed in  Section 3.1.2.   
Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration: Two IMGN853 administration 
schedules will be investigated:  
Schedule A: IMGN853 administered IV on Day 1, with cycles repeating every 21 days  (Q3W) 
• The starting dose was  0.15 mg/kg  based on total body weight. 
• With amendment 5, the starting dose using adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW ) was  
5.0 mg/kg. 
Schedule B: IMGN853 administered IV on Days 1, 8, and 15, with cycles repeating every 28 days  
(modified weekly  schedule ) 
• The starting dose was  1.1 mg/kg , calculated using AIBW . 
• The MTD was 2.0 mg/kg (AIBW). This schedule of administration will not be further 
evaluated in this study.  
The dose of IMGN853, used in both Schedule A and Schedule B dose escalation schedules and 
in all expansion cohorts, will be calculated using adjusted ideal body weight ( AIBW ).  Treatmen t 
guidelines and dose modification guidelines are detailed in Section  5.9. 
IMGN853 Dated  02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 14 of 138 Duration of treatment: The period of observation extends from the time the patient  receives the first 
dose of IMGN853 until the final follow -up study visit .  Patient s will continue to receive IMGN853 until 
they develop progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent , or until the Sponsor 
terminates the study . Patient s who discontinue study drug for reasons other than PD will be followed 
until PD or s tart of new anti -cancer therapy, or death, whichever occurs first .   
Statistical methods: There will be no formal hypothesis testing .  All descriptive statistical analyses will 
be performed using the most recently released and available SAS statistical software, unless otherwise 
noted.  For categorical variables, the number and percent of each category within a parameter will be 
calculated.  For continuous variables, the sample size (n), mean, median, and standard deviation, as well 
as the minimum and maxi mum values, will be presented .  Missing data will not be imputed unless 
otherwise stated .  There will be a detailed description of patient  disposition; patient  demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized .  PK data will be presented descriptively and graphically.  
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study .  However, a review of safety data and available 
preliminary PK data will be conducted by [CONTACT_194447] (CRC, Section  4.1.2 ) upon 
completion of each dose escalation cohort , and every  2 or 4 weeks during MTD Dose Expansion . A 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) will fully  describe the planned analyses for this study.   
Sample Size:   Ascending doses of IMGN853 will  be evaluated to identify the MTD for both 
dosing schedules.  The actual number of patient s accrued during this phase will be determined 
largely by [CONTACT_194448].   
Following identification of the MTD  for S chedule  A (Q3W) , there will be an expansion phase 
which will accrue two cohorts each at the MTD :  
(1) Dose Expansion Cohort 1:   [ADDRESS_230695] a difference of 20% (rate of Blurry vision 
drop from 50% to 30%) is 68% using one-sided alpha of 20% and Chi- Square test statistics. (2) 
Dose Expansion Cohort 2: 20 patients with advanced or recurrent uterine  cancer . 
Amendment 10 Update:  The CRC committee met and reviewed the available safety and response data. 
The decision was made to proceed with Schedule A only. All new patients enrolled in the trial will 
receive IMGN853 at the MTD of 6 mg/kg once every three weeks. Safety data available to date indicate 
that the MTD is equal to the RP2D.  
(3) Dose Expansion Cohort 3:  20 patients with relapsed  ovarian cancer, which is amenable to 
biopsy.  
(4) Dose Expansion Cohort 4:  20 patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC adenocarcinoma or 
BAC.  
(5) Dose Expansion Cohort 5:   [ADDRESS_230696] a 
difference of 20% (rate of Blurry vision decrease from 50% to 30%) is 68% using one -sided alpha 
of 20% and Chi -Square test statistics.

1.1. Target Background  
Folate receptor 1 (FOLR1; aka folate receptor α, FRα) is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -
anchored cell surface protein that binds and internalizes folates, which are essential co -factors for 
one carbon transfer reactions that are required for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell growth and 
proliferation.  Marked upregulation of FOLR1 occurs during neonatal development and in cancer, suggesting that the receptor functions primarily under conditions of high folate demand.  
In contrast, normal adult tissues generally lack FOLR1 expression and employ alternative 
transporters such as folate receptor β (FRβ), reduced folate carrier (R FC) and proton-coupled 
folate transporter (PCFT) for folate uptake  (Weitman  1992, Mantovani  1994, Elnakat  2004, 
Kelemen  2006, and IMGN853 Investigator’s Brochure ).  
Published studies have demonstrated FOLR1 over expression by [CONTACT_194452][INVESTIGATOR_220], particularly serous and endometrioid ovarian cancers, serous and endometrioid 
endometrial cancers, NSCLC (adenenocarcinoma or BA C histology) and clear cell renal 
carcinomas (Scorer  2010, Garin -Chesa 1993, Kalli  2008, Crane 2012, Franklin  1994, Dainty  
2007, Jones  2008, Akram  2004, and Allard  2007 ).  IHC results obtained at ImmunoGen are 
generally consistent with the literature ( Table 1).

Other cancers including small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 0/13 positive), colorectal cancer (0/92 
positive), pancreatic cancer (1/4 positive) and head and neck cancer (1/17 positive) tested at IMGN were largely negative for FOLR1 expression by [CONTACT_194454]  (refer to Investigator’ s 
Brochure ). 
Several additional studies have further validated FOLR1 as a target in serous ovarian cancer.  First, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) studies show ubiquitous FOLR1 mRNA 
expression in serous ovarian cancer ( Hough  2001) and high levels of FOLR1 mRNA correlate 
with poor response to chemotherapy and decreased disease free survival ( Chen  2012).  Second, 
both Kalli et al and Crane et al have demonstrated that recurrent tumors retain FOLR1 expression comparably to primary tumors as shown by [CONTACT_194455] ( Kalli 
2008, Crane 2012).  Third, studies with FOLR1- specific imaging agents have demonstrated real -
time FOLR1 expression at primary and metastatic tumor sites ( Fisher  2008, Ghamande  2011, 
and van Dam 2011 ).  Finally, a truncated form of FOLR1 has been detected in ascites and blood 
of ovarian cancer patients ( Basal  2009, Mantovani  1994), further confirming expression in this 
disease and suggesting that the receptor may serve as a circulating biomarker .  Collectively, 
these data suggest that FOLR1 is a promising target in solid tumors,  particularly ovarian cancer.  
1.2. IMGN853 
Because of its tumor specific expression and capacity to internalize small and large molecule 
ligands, FOLR1 has emerged as a promising target for antibody maytansinoid conjugate (A MC) 
therapy.  A MCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to tumor antigens with the 
extraordinary cytotoxicity of maytansine derivatives, which are potent anti- micro tubule agents 
that target proliferating cells .  IMGN853 is an AMC designed to target FOLR1.  It consists of the 
humanized anti-FOLR1 monoclonal antibody M9346A attached via a cleavable disulfide linker to the cytotoxic maytansinoid, DM4 ( Figure  1).

DM4 is ~ 2% by [CONTACT_194456], the number of DM [ADDRESS_230708] and cell death.  Cellular processing 
of maytansinoid conjugates can also generate lipophilic catabolites that cross cell membranes and kill neighboring cells ( Erickson 2006).   
1.3. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_115345]  (EOC), Endometrial Cancer  (EC)  and 
NSCLC 
The dose expansion phase of the study focuses on EOC , EC and NSCLC because they frequently 
express high levels of FOLR1and constitute significant unmet medical need.   
1.3.1. EOC  
EOC is a lethal disease with 21,990 new cases and 15,460 deaths expected in 2011.  The high-
grade serous subtype comprises 60 to 80% of all epi[INVESTIGATOR_194417], with less than 25% of cases diagnosed in the early stages (tages I 
and II) .  This characteristic is further reflected in the poor survival statistics ( Cannistra  2004).  
Treatment for advanced disease involves surgical de- bulking, followed by [CONTACT_70101]/taxane -based 
chemotherapy.  Although most patients initially respond to platinum- based chemotherapy, nearly 
all relapse and eventually develop drug resistant disease.  Disease recurring within six months of 
platinum- based chemotherapy  is classified as platinum resistant , whereas, disease recurring  
greater than six months after therapy is  termed platinum sensitive .  Patients with platinum 
resistant disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_194418] ( e.g. liposomal doxorubicin, 
topotecan, gemcitabine, paclitaxel , or other) at relapse.  Unfortunately, response rates a ssociated

months ( Cannistra  2010, Matsuo  2010).  Similarly, overall survival rates are poor with a median 
overall survival rate of ~11 months.  Because platinum resistant ovarian cancer remains a 
significant unmet medical need, the NCCN guidelines recommend that platinum resistant patients participate in clinical trials ( Morgan  2011 ). 
1.3.2. NSCLC 
Lung cancer  is the leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] .  Approximately 220,000 
new cases of lung cancer  are diagnosed in the US per year.  Of these, NSCLC comprises about 
75% of all lung cancers, with adenocarcinoma being the most common histology subt ype.  
Although several chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194419] , no agents are curative and approximately 150,000 patients die each year 
of progressive disease.  Patients with advanced disease and good performance status may benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy doublets; however, objective response rates are low and one-year survival rates remain at about 30-40% ( Kelly  2001, Schiller  2002).  Thus, NSCLC remains 
a prevalent, unmet medical need that requires new therapeutic approaches. 
1.3.3. Endometrial Carcinoma  
In the US an estimated 49,560 news cases will be diagnosed, and 8,190 deaths from endometrial 
cancer  (EC) will occur in 2013 ( American Cancer Society  2013).   The 1 - and 5 -year relative 
survival rates for uterine corpus cancer are 9 2% and 82%, respectively.  The 5 -year survival rate 
is 95%, 67%, or 16%, if the cancer is diagnosed at a local, regional, or distant stage, respectively.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_194420] , for patients with 
recurrent or advanced disease, there remains unmet medical need for more effective treatments .  
To date, there is no approved treatment for adjuvant treatment of advanced or recurrent EC.  Platinum agents , paclitaxel, and doxorubicin have been investigated as single agents and in 
combination for primary advanced and recurrent disease.  Not surprisingly, higher response rates, and greater toxicity, were observed with the combination regimens ( Akram  2004, Humber  
2007).  The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is gaining favor as the preferred regimen 
for treating advanced and refractory EC; however, toxicity remains problematic; therefore, new 
treatment modalities are needed.  
1.4. Non-Clinical Studies of IMGN 853  
1.4.1. Pharma cology 
Results of nonclinical pharmacology studies demonstrate the following: 
• Marked expression of FOLR1 occurs in epi[INVESTIGATOR_220], particularly serous and endometrioid ovarian cancers, serous and endometrioid endometrial cancers, clear cell 
RCC and NSCLC adenocarcinoma and  BAC as assessed by [CONTACT_4658] ( Table 1 and 
Investigator’s Brochure ). 
• IMGN853 shows potent (IC
50 ≤ 1 nM) and selective cytotoxicity towards FOLR1 -
positive tumor cells in vitro  via a mechanism that involves binding to target antigen 
followed by [CONTACT_194457]853 internalization and degradation of M9346A, the antibody moiety 
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230709] and consequent apoptosis. 
•  In vitro  cytotoxicity studies suggest that cells sensitive to IMGN853 express higher 
levels of FOLR1 and release 10- to 100-fold more cytotoxic maytansinoid than cells resistant to IMGN853. 
• IMGN853 retains the inherent activities of its antibody moiety, M9346A, including binding affinity (apparent affinity ≤ 0.1 nM ) and selectivity for FOLR1, capacity for 
uptake, internalization,  and degradation by [CONTACT_194458]1- postive target cel ls, and ability to 
induce ADCC in vitro . 
• IMGN853 shows significant in vivo  efficacy against ovarian (IGROV -1, OVCAR -3, and 
OV-90 models) and NSCLC (NCI-H2110 model) tumor xenografts. 
1.4.2. Pharmacokinetics  
Nonclinical studies with IMGN853-cross reactive (monkey) and non- cross reactive (mouse) 
species were conducted to define PK parameters and to determine the stability of the linker and impact of conjugation on antibody clearance.  An additional PK study with free DM4 was 
conducted in monkey.  These studies are summarized here and further detailed in the IMGN853 
Investigator’s Brochure .   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Single Dose Non- GLP Studies in CD -[ADDRESS_230710] of conjugation on the clearance of the parental M9346A antibody component of IMGN853, PK studies were performed with radiolabeled antibody species: 
unconjugated M9346A[
3H] and IMGN853 (M9346A[3H]-sulfo -SPDB -DM4) .  Unconjugated 
M9346A[3H]  and IMGN853 (M9346A[3H]-sulfo -SPDB -DM4)   show biphasic 
pharmacokinetics upon intravenous administration in CD-[ADDRESS_230711] -order kinetics .  The 
clearance -dependent pharmacokinetic parameters, t
1/2, CL, and AUC 0-∞, were similar for both 
unconjugated M9346A[3H] and IMGN853 (M9346A[3H]-sulfo -SPDB -DM4) , indicating that 
conjugation of DM4 has minimal impact on the plasma pharmacokinetic properties of M9346A 
antibody in CD- 1 mice.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Single Dose Toxicokinetics of IMGN853 in Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of IMGN853 and its M9346A antibody component were determined as part of a study to evaluate the toxicit y of IMGN853 in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered as a single intravenous (slow bolus) injection.  The plasma clearance of IMGN853 
was measured using sandwich ELISA techniques, and showed an initial distribution phase of 
about 24 hours followed by a slower terminal elimination phase , with half -life of about 4 days 
for the conjugate.  At all dose levels of IMGN853 (1, 3, 5 and 10 mg/kg) , the conjugate clearance 
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 32 of 138 profiles and distribution volumes were similar, and both C max and AUC 0-∞ increased with 
increasing conjugate dose, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics.  The volume of distribution at 
steady state (V SS) estimated from plasma concentrations of IMGN853 assessed over time , was in 
the range of the expected plasma volume of the animal.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. PK of Free DM4 in  Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The plasma concentration of the maytansinoid in IMGN853, DM4, was evaluated in the 
cynomolgus monkey following administration of an IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  Free maytansinoid levels were measured using a sensitive ELISA method (LLQ = 3.6 ng/mL) that utilized a murine 
monoclonal anti-maytansinoid antibody.  The free maytansinoid concentration in plasma was 
about 0.56 µg/mL at [ADDRESS_230712] infusion.  The observed rapid reduction in plasma concentration for free DM4 in the 
monkey is consistent with the pharmacokinetic parameters reported for maytansine in mice, 
which are characterized by a rapid initial distribution phase, a large volume of distribution (9.8 L/kg), and a rapid t erminal elimination phase (t
½ about 2h) . 
1.4.3. Toxicology 
A comprehensive nonclinical toxicology program has been conducted in mice and monkeys to support the use of IMGN853 in clinical trials in humans.  These studies are summarized here and further detailed in  the IMGN853 Investigator’s Brochure.  Cynomolgus monkey was considered 
the most appropriate species for GLP toxicology based on preclinical work, which included sequence comparisons of FOLR1 orthologs, IHC studies of human and monkey (rhesus and cynomolgus) and binding affinity studies with rhesus monkey cell lines.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Single -Dose GLP Cynomolgus Monkey Toxicology Study 
A single dose GLP toxicology study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys with doses of, 1, 3, 
5, or 10 mg/kg IMGN853 administered intravenously.  Vehicle and IMGN853- treated animals 
were evaluated after a [ADDRESS_230713] article -related effects were observed at 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg.  IMGN853- related 
alterations were typi[INVESTIGATOR_194421]-dependent and had returned to control levels or demonstrated a significant restoration towards normal by [CONTACT_4475] 29. 
The principal findings included: 
• Bone marrow and lymphoid toxicity (5 and 10 mg/kg groups) characterized by [CONTACT_194459] (mean WBC and lymphocyte counts), red cell mass ( i.e. Red blood cell 
count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit),  and reticulocyte counts .  Bone marrow findings 
were characterized by [CONTACT_194460], with  decreased density of 
myeloid and erythroid elements.  Lymphoid findings included lymphocyte depletion, 
germinal center loss and decreased cortical follicle size in lymph nodes and depletion of 
white pulp in spleen.  All alterations in hematology parameter s had resolved by [CONTACT_4475] 7.  
Except for the observation of minimal bone marrow depletion in a single 10 mg/kg group 
male, no bone marrow and lymph node histopathology alterations were noted at the day 29 recovery necropsy. 
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 33 of 138 • Transient increases in mean neutrophil count (3, 5, and 10 mg/kg groups) and fibrinogen 
level (10 mg/kg group) observed on study day 2 and study days 2 and 5, respectively.  Both alterations resolved by [CONTACT_53813] 7.    
• Injection site histopathology changes observed at the day 5 interim necropsy .  These 
changes included superficial and perivascular inflammation, ulceration, and edema of the dermis and subcutis.  Except for the observation of minimal superficial and perivascular injection site inflammation in a single 10 mg/kg group male, no injection site histopathology alterations were noted at the day 29 recovery necropsy.  
• Non-adverse test article -related serum chemistry findings included lower phosphorous 
and potassium levels in the 3, 5, and/or 10 mg/kg group females.  The lower serum levels of potassium and phosphorus did not correlate with other serum chemistry, histopathology, or clinical findings, and were considered changes of minimal toxicological or biological importance.  
Although a formal in vivo  safety pharmacology study has not been conducted with IMGN853, no 
treatment -related  cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  or central nervous system alterations were noted  in 
cage-side clinical observations or veterinary physical examinations . 
All laboratory abnormalities and histopathology alterations were considered non -adverse and 
reversible as they had returned to control levels or demonstrated a significant restoration towards 
normal by [CONTACT_4475] 29.  Based on these findings, the highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was 
considered 10 mg/kg.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Single -Dose IV Toxicity Studies with DM4 in Mice and Monkeys  
Single dose toxicity studies were performed in mice and monkeys to assess the toxicity of DM4, 
the cytotoxic payload of IMGN853 and to c ompare its toxicity with the parent maytansinoid 
molecule, maytansine, and the closely related chemical analogue, DM1.  
In the mouse study, a single dose of DM4 (1.2-4.1 mg/kg), DM1 (1.0-3.5 mg/kg), maytansine (1.2-3.2 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered int ravenously and the mice were assessed clinically 
daily for 15 days.  Necropsy was performed at day 15 or earlier for severe morbidity.  The LD50 
was about 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m2) for DM4 and DM1 and 1.8 mg/kg (5.4 mg/m2) for 
maytansine.  DM1 and DM4 showed a similar toxicity profile at all 4 tested doses.  All mice survived the 1.0 mg/kg DM1 dose and only 1/8 mice died in the group treated with 1.2 mg/kg 
DM4, a DM4 dose equivalent to the amount of DM4 present in a ~59 mg/kg dose of IMGN853.  
Drug -related changes were observed in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow in mice 
terminated early due to morbidity .  The incidence and severity of the tissue lesions generally 
increased with increasing dose.  The gastrointestinal lesions were characterized by [CONTACT_194461], glandular cell loss,  and necrosis.  Bone marrow depletion roughly paralleled the 
incidence of changes in the alimentary tract, and was characterized by [CONTACT_194462].  The observed changes in the alimentary tract and bone marrow were 
generally resolved by [ADDRESS_230714]- administration in the surviving animals .  No compound-
related histopathologic abnormalities were observed in the liver, heart, lung, or kidney at any dose level of maytansinoid tested.    
In the cynomolgus monkey study, DM4 was administered at 0.1 mg/kg via intravenous infusion.  
Animals were assessed clinically daily and necropsies were performed on Days [ADDRESS_230715] blood pressure, heart rate, urinalysis, or organ weight assessments.   
DM4 -related clinical pathology alterations included mild leucopenia primarily due to 
neutropenia, which corresponded microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_194422] .  Transient 
elevations in alkaline phosphatase values were noted in DM4- treated animals.  Decreases in red 
blood cells and increases in platelets were seen in both control and treated animals.  
Morphologic changes associated with administration of 0.1 mg/kg DM4 were limited to 
depletion of bone marrow cellular elements only at Day 5.  No morphologic changes were noted 
at Day 29.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Acute Toxicity Profile of IMGN853 (M9346A- sulfo -SPDB -DM4) and M9346A-
SPDB -DM4 in Female CD -[ADDRESS_230716] with the 
murine FOLR1 antigen, and these results represent the non- targeted tolerability profile for these 
conjugates.  The  tolerability profile and MTD (1.4 – 1.6 mg/kg based on DM4 concentration) of 
IMGN853 (M9346A-sulfo- SPDB -DM4) and M9346A- SPDB -DM4 were similar in CD- 1 mice .  
The MTD of 1.4 – 1.6 mg/kg based on DM4 concentration is approximately 72-91 mg/kg based 
on antibody weight.  A second study with additional animals (N=24/group) confirmed the results 
of this study (s ee Investigator’s Brochure ). 
1.5. Rationale for the starting dose  
The selection of the maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) for this clinical trial was performed 
according to ICH S9 guidance.  The highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) observed in the GLP 
toxicology studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys HNSTD was 10 mg/kg.  Based on allometric 
scaling, the MRSD is 0.5 mg/kg, which represents 1/6 the HNSTD observed in the cynomolgus  monkey 
toxicology study.  Specifically, the value represents 1/6 of 10 mg/kg, scaled to mg/m2, then cal culated as 
a flat dose for a human with body surface area = 1.74 m2 and 70 kg.  
1/6 x 10 mg/kg (cyno HNSTD) x 12 (cyno conversion factor to mg/m2) = 20 mg/m2 
20 mg/m2 x 1.74 m2 x 1/70 kg = 0.497 mg/kg ≈ 0.5 mg/kg  
To allow an additional margin of safety, t he starting clinical dose chosen was 0.15 mg/kg, which 
represents approximately 1/20 the HNSTD observed in the GLP toxicology study.  
1.6. Clinical Hypothesis  
A formal hypothesis will not be tested in this study .  Analysis of safety, tolerability, PK, Pd, and 
preliminary anti-tumor activity data will help guide future development of IMGN853. 
1.7. Rationale for the Study Plan  
This is a two part Phase 1, FIH study consisting of a dose escalation phase evaluating two dosing 
schedules of IMGN853 administration  and up to 6 dose expansion groups at the MTD.   The 
primary aims of the dose- escalation are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMGN853, to 
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 35 of 138 identify the MTD, and to characterize the PK profile of IMGN853 when administered IV for two 
dosing schedules: 
Schedule A: IMGN853 administered on Day 1, with cycles repeating every 21 days   
Schedule B: IMGN853 administered on Days 1, 8, and 15, with cycles repeating every 28 days  
The patient population for the dose escalation will include patients with tumors known to express FOLR1 at high incidence ( e.g. serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer, serous and endometrioid 
endometrial cancer, NSCLC adenocarcinoma and BA C, clear cell carcinoma) and patients with 
other solid tumors with  detectable FOLR1  (≥1% of tumor staining at ≥1+ intensity ) by [CONTACT_4658].  
Based on the favorable safety margins suggested by [CONTACT_11339] -clinical cynomolgus monkey 
toxicology study and to minimize patient exposure to biologically-inactive doses of IMGN853, an accelerated dose escalation will be used for the first four cohorts as detailed in Section 4.1. 
Schedule  A (Q3W):  Once the MTD has been identified, enrollment to MTD dose -expansion 
Cohorts [ADDRESS_230717] meet the minimum requirement 
of FOL R1 positivity by [CONTACT_4658] (≥25% of tumor staining at ≥2+ intensity)  and patients enrolled to 
Cohort [ADDRESS_230718] tumors with  an H score ≥ 100 for  FOLR1 by [CONTACT_4658].  The use of Schedule A in 
Cohort 3, 4, and 5 will be determined following review of the data for both dosing regimens, by 
[CONTACT_10186].  
Schedule  B (modified weekly) : Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until the 
MTD is defined.  
Amendment 10 Update - The Schedule B MTD was established  at 2.0 mg/kg (AIBW). T he 
CRC to review safety , PK and efficacy results from both schedules.  The modified weekly 
schedule did not provide any apparent safety or efficacy advantage; moreover, while the Q3W 
schedule PK profile analysis indicated no accumulation  of IMGN853, accumulation of 
IMGN853 was observed using the modified weekly schedule. Based on safety and tumor 
response data collected and reviewed through May 2015, the CRC determined that Schedule B 
will not be evaluated further in the cu rrent study ( Borghei  2015 ). 
All new patients enrolled in the trial will receive IMGN853 at the MTD of 6 mg/kg once every three 
weeks ( Figure  3). Safety  data available to date indicate that the MTD is equal to the RP2D. Patients 
currently receiving IMGN853 study treatment according to Schedule B will continue to do so. 
Safety and tolerability will be further defined for the patient populations evaluated in the Dose 
Expansion phase of the study.  The dose expansion cohorts will additionally investigate 
IMGN853 Pd (MTD Expansion Cohort3), preliminary anti- tumor efficacy  (MTD Expansion 
Cohorts 1, 2 and 4) , and will assess the effectiveness of primary, prophylactic steroid eye drops 
in preventing or lessening ocular toxicity (Cohort 5).

Schedule A or Schedule B had been chosen has been updated for clarification purposes.  Available 
clinical data indicates that the MTD defin ed for the Q3W schedule is equal to the RP2D; therefore, 
that statement has been added for clarification.  
2. A separate cohort of patients with relapsed  ovarian cancer has been added. Patients enrolled into 
this cohort (Cohort 5) will self- administer corticosteroid eye drops for the first [ADDRESS_230733] been revised accordingly.

For detailed information regarding clinical safety of IMGN853, please refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
1.10. Clinical Pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined for Cycle 1 dosing in each patient.  The clearance of 
IMGN853 is shown to be rapid at low doses (CL= 1.1 mL/hr/kg) with a half -life of approximately 1.5 days.  
While the clearance of IMGN853 is rapid (CL= 1.1 mL/hr/kg) at the lowest dose level (0.15 mg/kg), the 
clearance decreases with increasing dose with a half- life of about 5 days at doses ≥ 2.0 mg/kg.  The 
exposure (AUC) and the C max are shown to increase in a generally linear fashion with increasing dose o f 
IMGN853.   These data are summarized in detail in Section 5.3.1  of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.10.1. Rationale for Dosing Based on Adjusted Ideal Body Weight 
Initial PK parameter analysis demonstrated that mean C max increased proportionally with the dose of 
IMGN853, however there was significant variability in inter- patient C max levels .  The variability  in C max 
was particularly striking in the 5 mg/kg cohort, w here PK was analyzed in 10 patients with a wide range 
of body weights ( 48.2  kg – 135.8 kg).  Further analysis identified a correlation between C max levels and 
the occurrence of TEAEs of ocular disorders , with higher C max values correlating with the occurrence of 
TEAEs of eye disorders .  Results from these analyses are detailed in Section 5.3. 3 of the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
A number of dosing strategies were investigated  in an effort to maximize IMGN853 exposure, while 
maintaining C max and AUC 0-24 levels  within a range that was not associated with TEAEs of eye diso rders 
for the great majority of patients  (less than 150 µg/ml and 2785 hr*mg.ml, respectively)  and with the 
least possible inter -patient variability in C max.  To this end, C max values were estimated using alternative 
dosing calculations for all patients treated in the 3.3 (n=3), 5.0 (n=10) and 7 .0 mg/kg (n=5) dose groups.  
Calculated C max values were normalized to a 5 mg/kg dose level and compared to C max values  observed 
from total body weight (TBW) dosing.   Three alternate formulas were evaluated: (1) I deal body weight 
(IBW), Lean Body Weight (LBW) and Adjusted Ideal Body Weight ( AIBW ).  Of the three methods, d osing

dosing by [CONTACT_194466] C max compared to dosing according to TBW for 
patients across a spectrum of weights.   Refer to Section 5.3.3  of the Investigator’s Brochure   for details.

ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 45 of 138 Figure  2: Correlation Between C max and Total Body Weight (TBW), Ideal Body 
Weight (IBW), Lean Body Weight (LBW), and Adjusted Ideal Body Weight 
(AIBW ) 
 
 
The results of the PK modeling, suggest that dosing according to adjusted ideal body weight may reduc e the variation in exposure within dosing cohorts .  Therefore , the adjusted ideal body 
weight calculation will be used to dose IMGN853 ( see Section 5.8.4).  For Schedule A (Q3W) a 
new cohort of patients will be enrolled and treated at a starting dose level of 5 mg/kg based on AIBW .  In the ten patients previously treated at 5 mg/kg  based on total body weight ( TBW ), 
ocular toxicity was observed in some patients , but the MTD was not exceeded  and none of the 
ocular changes met the threshold for a DLT.  Modification of the dosing method to calculate 
dose based on adjusted ideal body weight is predicted to reduce ocular toxicity , by [CONTACT_194467] (C
max and AUC 0 -24hrs).  The adjusted ideal body weight calculation will 
also be used to dose patients treated on Schedule B (modified weekly).  The starting dose will be 
1.1 mg/kg. 
1.10.2. Rationale to Explore a Modified Weekly  Dosing Schedule  
As described in Section 1.10.1 a significant correlation between high C max values (≥ ~150 µg/ml) and 
incidence of ocular toxicity was observed across the 5 and 7 mg/kg dose levels when IMGN853 was 

IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 46 of 138 administered on day 1 of a 21 -day cycle  dosed by [CONTACT_126054] .  Alternate dosing schedules were 
explored  via simulation to identify the  dose levels that would  achieve maximal exposure with limited 
accumulation and a C max below 150 µg/ml in order to minimize ocular toxicity risk.   
A population PK model based on rich and sparse (peak and trough) concentration -time profiles of 
IMGN853 following Q3W dosing (escalating dose) was developed.  Plasma concentrations of IMGN853 
were best modeled by a 3 -compartment model and this model was used to simulate steady -state 
exposure to IMGN853 for various dosing schedules, including weekly (QW), every 2 weeks (Q2W), and weekly  for 3 weeks in a 4 week cycle ( modified weekly schedule).  
The modified weekly  dosing regimen had minimal accumulation between cycles (accumulation index of 
1.06), while the QW dosing regimen resulted in the highest accumulation (accumulation index of 1.9 7).  
Comparing doses that gave equivalent C
max levels, the modified weekly  schedule allowed overall 
exposure increases of almost  ~2-fold while limiting C max to levels below that observed with ocular 
toxicity ( Table  2).

The population PK model was also used to simulate a hypothetical population of 500 patients via Monte Carlo resampling.  Descriptive statistics were derived in order to determine a dosing regimen with the percentage of subjects with C
max < 150 µg/ml  to opt imize the safety profile of IMGN853.  Using total 
body weight dosing, for the Q3W regimen, dose levels of 2.0, 3.3, and 3.8 mg/kg resulted in 99%, 95% and 90% of the population with a C
max < ~150 µg/ml , respectively.  For the modified weekly regimen, 
dose levels of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mg/kg per dose (or 4.5, 6, and 7.5 mg/kg per cycle) resulted in 99%, 95% 
and 90% of the population with a C max < 150 µg/ml , respectively.   
Results from the simulation studies suggest fractionated dosing may increase overall exposure while maintaining a lower C
max and thus improve the toxicity profile.  The schedule on which IMGN853 is 
administered on Days 1, 8, and 15, with cycles repeating every 28 days ( modified weekly), appears to 
minimize accumulation while simultaneously maximiz ing total exposure, and  maintaining C max levels 
below 150 µg/ml.

2015).  
Based on safety and overall response data collected through May 2015, the CRC determined 
that all  new patients enrolled in the trial will receive IMGN853 at the MTD of 6 mg/kg once 
every three weeks.  Safety data available to date indicate that the MTD is equal to the RP2D. 
Moving forward, Schedule B will not be evaluated any further in this study; however, patients enrolled to Schedule B prior to the CRC decision, will continue on this schedule.   
The period of observation extends from the time the patient receives the first dose of IMGN853 
until the final follow -up study visit.  Patients will continue to receive IMGN853 until 
unacceptable toxicity  or withdraw al of consent, whichever comes first, or until the Sponsor 
terminates the study .  Patients who meet the RECIST criteria for PD  while on study may remain 
on study, provided there is evidence of clinical benefit and no unacceptable toxicity, as agreed upon by [CONTACT_194464] .  Patients who discontinue study drug for 
reasons other than PD will be followed until PD, start of new anti- cancer therapy, or death, 
whichever occurs first.    
The primary aims of the Dose Expansion phase are to further evaluate safety and tolerability and to assess IMGN853 Pd and preliminary efficacy.  
CTCAE version 4.03 will be used to grade adverse events.

4.1.2. Cohort Review Committee  
The CRC is comprised of the ImmunoGen Medical Monitor and Investigators from participating 
sites.  Once the last patient in a given cohort has completed a cycle of study treatment, a CRC 
meeting will be convened to review all safety data and decide whether to continue or halt dose 
escalation, further expand individual dose levels to gain additional safe ty data, or explore lower 
or intermediate dose levels.  

IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 57 of 138 Amendment 10 Update: The CRC convened to review safety, PK and efficacy data from the 
dose escalation cohorts, as well as available data from patients treated on Schedule A. The 
modified weekly schedu le did not provide an apparent safety or efficacy advantage; moreover, 
while the Q3W schedule PK profile analysis indicated no accumulation of IMGN853, 
accumulation of IMGN853 was observed using the modified weekly schedule ( Borghaei, 2015). 
Based on safety, PK and overall response data collected through May 2015, the CRC 
determined that the study will proceed with IMGN853 administered under Schedule A (Q3W) 
only ( Figure  2). All new patients enrolled in the trial will receive IMGN853 at the MTD of 6 
mg/kg once every three weeks.  Safety data available to date indicate that the MTD is equal to 
the RP2D. Patients currently being treated using Schedule B will continue to be dosed 
according to this schedule. 
4.1.3. Dose Escalation Guidelines  
Schedule A dose escalation is complete and the MTD is 6 mg/kg (AIBW); data available to 
date indicate that the MTD is equal to  the RP2D . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Schedule  A 
The starting dose (Dose Lev el 1) for IMGN853 is 0. 15 mg/kg, which is equivalent to 1/[ADDRESS_230750] 3+3 design, with each cohort enrolling 3 or 4 to 6 
patients.    
Table 3: Planned Dose Levels  (Schedule  A) 
Dose Level  Dose (mg/kg) Percent Increase 
From Previous Dose 
Level  Number of Patient s 
(Planned)  
1 0.15 N/A 1/20 HNSTD 1 
2 0.5 233% 1

6 5.0 52% 3 or 4-6 
7 7.0 40% 3 or 4-6 
8 9.0 28% 3 or 4-6 
NOTE: If additional dose exploration is required to define the MTD then dose escalation may proceed 
at increments ≤ 40% .  The CRC will determine the magnitude of the dose escalation increments 
following review of available clinical and PK data from patients treated in the current cohort.  
 
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230751] patient enrolled into the trial.  All subsequent 
cycles of treatment for this patient and all other patients will be of 3 weeks duration .  This additional 
week of observation is employed to provide an additional margin of safety to address skin findings that were improved but not completely resolved in all animals by [CONTACT_4475] 28 in the GLP toxicology study .  During 
this time period, if there are no observations of CTCAE v4.03 ≥ G rade 2 dose limiting toxicities then dose 
escalation to 0.5 mg/kg will proceed and will follow the rules outlined below .  If a patient develops a ≥ 
Grade [ADDRESS_230752] be added to this dose level .  If no ≥ Grade 2 TEAEs are observed, dose escalation will 
revert to single patient cohort s through the 2 mg/kg dose level  (inclusive) . 
For Cohort 2 and beyond, decisions regarding dose escalation will be based on the occurrence of 
Cycle 1 dose limiting toxicity.  
In the absence of any > CTCAE Grade 2 or greater AEs observed at dose level 1 through 4, dose 
escalation will proceed according to the accelerated titration schema outlined in  Table 3.  If the 
patient develops a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_230753] be added to this dose level.  If no ≥ Grade 2 TE AEs are 
observed, dose escalation will revert to single patient cohorts through the 2 mg/kg dose level 
(inclusi ve). 
The occurrence of DLT for which a causal relationship to IMGN853 cannot be excluded, will trigger a transition to the standard 3+[ADDRESS_230754] 3+3 design ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Schedule  B 
Schedule B dose escalation is complete and the MTD is 2 mg/kg (AIBW). The modified weekly 
schedule will not be evaluated further in this study.  In Schedule B, the starting dose o f 
IMGN853 will be 1.1 mg/kg, which is 1/3 the 3.3 mg/kg Q3W dose level, which was deemed clinically safe in nine patients.  
Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until the MTD is defined ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Planned dose levels are listed below in Table 4 and will be administered based on AIBW  body 
weight.   Based on emerging dat a, the CRC will decide the magnitude of the dose escalation and 
may determine that exploration of lower or intermedia te dose levels is warranted .  If at any time,  
the administration of IMGN853 on a weekly basis is deemed to be suboptimal or PK/  
Pharmacodynamics data supports a less frequent dosing regimen, the decision may be made by [CONTACT_194469].  
A patient will be deemed non -evaluable for dose escalation decisions and will not be counted 
toward the total co hort size if the patient did not receive a full course of treatment (i.e., all 
planned doses of IMGN853 for the first  treatment cycle) and did not experience a DLT; or 
discontinued from the study prior to completing necessary safety evaluations through the  end of 
the first cycle of treatment and  did not experience a DLT .  Non-evaluable patients will be 
replaced unless accrual to the cohort has stopped due to the occurrence of at least two patients with DLT.

NOTE: If additional dose exploration is required to define the MTD then dose escalation may proceed at 
increments ≤ 25%.  The CRC will determine the magnitude of the dose escalation increments following 
review of available clinical and PK data from patients treated  in the current cohort. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Escalation Rules (3+3 Design) 
• If none of the 3 or 4 patient s experience a DLT, then dose escalation to the next dose 
level will occur.  
• If 1 of the initial 3 or 4 patient s experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to up to 
6 patient s.  If no further DLT is seen, dose escalation to the next dose level may proceed. 
• If at least 2 out of 2 to 6 patient s or more than 33% of patient s in any given cohort 
experience a DLT, the maximum administered dose (MAD) is reached, and no further 
dose escalation will  occur.  Enrollment into a cohort at lower dose level will be 
considered. 
• Each dose level will be evaluated in a similar fashion.  
The M TD is defined as the highest dose at wh ich 1 or fewer among 6 patient s or ≤ 33% 
experiences a DLT.  
Once the MTD has been exceeded, the CRC will decide whether lower dose level s should be 
explored further or whether an intermediate dose level should be evaluated.  If additional dose 
exploration beyond the highest dose shown in Table 3 is required to define the MTD then dose 
escalation may proceed at increments specified in Table 3 and Table 4.  The CRC will determine the magnitude of the dose escalation increments following review of available clinical and PK data from patients treated in the current cohort.  
If there is evidence of late-occurring or cumulative DLT(s), an ad hoc  CRC may be scheduled 
with participating Investigators to discuss dose level or MTD reduction.  If agreed, the 
Investigators and Sponsor may incre ase the number of patients treated at a given dose level, or to 
enroll additional patient s at the previously- completed dose level if doing so is necessary to better 
define the study drug’s safety .  Additionally, upon review of the safety data from the current 
cohort, the Sponsor, together with the Investigators may decide to evaluate an intermediate dose level.  
4.1.4. Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) will be defined as a TEAE or abnormal laboratory value related to 
study treatment (i.e., assessed as unrelated to disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications), including those TEAEs and abnormal laboratory values that result in a failure to 
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230755] cycle will be neces sarily considered for decisions regarding dose escalation.  Clinically 
significant toxicities or treatment -emergent adverse events that meet the definition of dose 
limiting but occurring after Cycle 1 (dose modifying events) may be considered when 
determin ing the RP2D.   
If a patient  experiences a DLT as outlined in Table 5, the study treatment must be stopped and 
the toxicity (ies) in question must be followed until resolution or stabilization .  If treatment is to 
be resumed then retreatment criteria must be met ( Section 5.9.3) and administration must be 
resumed at a lower dose ( Section 4.1.3).

4.1.5. Dose Expansion Cohorts 
Once the MTD is established, additional patient s will be treated in a dose expansion phase that is 
designed to further evaluate safety and tolerability, assess preliminary efficacy at the MTD, and 
characterize IMGN853 P d.  
Data obtai ned in the dose expansion phase will help define the RP2D.

aggregate in the expansion cohorts.  If at any time ≥ 33% of patients treated in an expansion 
cohort experiences a Cycle 1 DLT, further enrollment to that cohort will stop and a CRC will be 
convened.  The CRC will review all available safety data and  PK data to determine how further 
dosing should proceed.  If it is decided that a new dose should be investigated, enrollment to the 
cohort will begin anew .

ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 65 of 138 5.8. IMGN853 Preparation and Administration  
5.8.1. Premedication to Prevent Infusion Reaction  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Schedule A  
Patients should receive 10 mg IV dexamethasone, 25 -50 mg diphenhydramine (IV or PO) and 325 -650 
mg acetaminophen (IV or PO) approximately 30 minutes prior to each infus ion.  If individual patients 
require more intensive treatment to prevent infusion reaction, investigators may modify the regimen 
accordingly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Schedule B  
Premedication with corticosteroids will not be employed initially.  For individual patients who 
experi ence signs of infusion- related  reaction s, the premedication regimen outlined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] should be administered prior to all subsequent IMGN853 infusions.  All patients dosed 
according to Schedule B should receive 325- 650 mg of acetaminophen (PO or IV) approximately 
30 minutes prior to each infusion of IMGN853 to prevent infusion- related headaches.  
5.8.2. Premedication with Corticosteroid Eye Drops  (Dose Expansion Cohort#5 
ONLY)  
All patients enrolled into Cohort Expansion 5 will be instructed to self- administer 1% 
prednisolone (Pred  Forte® or generic equivalent) six times daily on Days 1 -5 and four times daily  
on Days 6-10 of each cycle during the s tudy ( Figure  4).  
These medications will be prescribed by [CONTACT_194473].  Patients will record their eye drop administration in a patient diary, which will be entered 
on the CRF. 
5.8.3. Lubricating Eye Drops  
In order to prevent dry eye, which may predispose a patient to corneal irritation, patients will be 
required to use preservative- free, lubricating artificial tears  o n a daily basis (as directed by [CONTACT_194474]) for the duration of their IMGN853 treatment.   
Patients in Cohort#5 will use the corticosteroid eye drops as described in Section  5.8.2 and will 
use the lubricating eye drops for the remainder of the cycle (Days 11 through 21 inclusive). If 
patients need to use lubricating drops during Days 1-10, while steroid eye drops are being 
administered, they should be advised to wait at least 15 minutes following steroid administration before instilling lubricating eye drops.

IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230764] their eye drop administration in a 
patient diary, which will be recorded on the CRF. 
5.8.4. Calculation for Adjusted Ideal Body Weight 
Based on the results of the PK modeling, as described in Section  1.10.1, which suggested that 
dosing according to adjusted ideal body weight ( AIBW ) may reduce the variation in exposure 
within dosing cohorts, the adjusted ideal body weight calculation will be used to dose IMGN853 
going forward .  
The total dose of drug will be calculated based on each patient ’s adjusted body weight using the 
following formula: 
 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight ( AIBW )  
1. IBW1 + 0.4  ( Actual weight – IBW1) 
Where:  
Ideal Body Weight (IBW)  
1. IBW1 (male) = 0.9H1-88 
2. IBW1 (fem ale) = 0.9H1-92 
 
(1H=height in cm; W=weight in kg ) 
The weight used for calculation should be obtained prior to first treatment and thereafter should only be modified for significant (≥ 10%) changes i n body weight (not influenced by [CONTACT_194475]).  The desired amount should be withdrawn from the vial(s) 
and diluted using 5% dextrose to a final concentration as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Note:  IMGN853 is incompatible with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) .  Therefore,  dilutions 
should be made using 5% dextrose.  Infusion bags must be labeled with the protocol number, 
patient  number, storage temperature, dose, and volume of IMGN853 filtered into the bag, or 
according to institutional protocol.  Once the solution is prepared, the infusion bag must not be 
left in direct su nlight, and the infusion must be completed within 8 hours of preparation. 
Study  drug from two different  drug lots cannot be mixed in a  single do se administration.  
5.8.5. IMGN853 Administration    
During the dose escalation phase, t he starting dose of IMGN853 was  0.15 mg/kg  for patients 
enrolled to Schedule A and 1.1 mg/kg for patients enrolled to Schedule B.  Following 
Amendment 10 implementation, IMGN853 will be administered to all patients at the MTD of 6 
mg/kg every three weeks. (Note: Available safety data indicate that the MTD is equal to the RP2D). IMGN [ADDRESS_230765] be 
used for infusion.  Initially the study drug should be administered at a rate of 1 mg/min; after 30 minutes, the rate can be increased to 3 mg/min if well tolerated.  If well tolerated after 30 
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 67 of 138 minutes at 3 mg/min, the IMGN853 infusion rate may be increased to 5mg/min. Subsequent 
infusions may be delivered at the tolerated rate.  Therefore,  the overall length of infusion will 
vary depen ding on dose and patient  tolerability .  Following infusion, the IV line should be 
flushed with 5% dextrose as needed to ensure delivery of the full dose.   
Patient s will be carefully observed during each infusion and vital signs taken as outlined in the 
Schedule of Clinical Assessments  (Appendix A  and Appendix B ).  They will remain in the clinic 
under observation for [ADDRESS_230766] experienced concurrent infusion -
related reacti ons with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions (see NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03).  The signs and symptoms may include headache, fever, facial 
flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, 
diaphoresis, shivers, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and somnolence .  Anaphylaxis might 
occur at any time during an infusion.  Before any infusion is started, appropriate medical personnel, 
medication (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids),  and other 
required resources to treat anaphylaxis must be readily available .  In general, Investigators should 
manage acute hypersensitivity reactions according to Institutional practices.  General guidelines for management of acute reactions and subsequent retreatment with IMGN853 are provided in Table  6 
below .  Due to long half -life of the antibody, the potential exists for infusion –related reactions to recur 
after appropriate treatment;  therefore,  patients should be advised to seek immediate medical 
treatment if symptoms recur after discharge from clinic.  
Patien ts who experience an infusion- related reaction during or immediately following administration of 
IMGN853 will have blood drawn for determination of drug concentration, antibodies to IMGN853 (HADA, HAHA).  The sample should be obtained within three hours of  the onset of the reaction and 1 
week later .  Such patients should undergo all scheduled efficacy and safety evaluations.

5.9. Treatment Guidelines  
5.9.1. Re-treatment Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]. To Begin a New Cycle of Treatment  
In the absence of otherwise dose- limiting toxicity, for a patient  to begin a new cycle of therapy, 
the following criteria must be met.  
• ANC must be ≥ 1.5x109/L (1 ,500/µL) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/ µL) 
• All non- hematologic toxicities for which a causal association to study treatment 
cannot be ruled out, must be ≤ Grade 2 (except alopecia) or returned to baseline; the 
exception  to this rule is treatment- emergent ocular symptoms , which must have 
recovered to < Grade [ADDRESS_230775] been met .  However, if 
the next cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_7809] 14 days because of insufficient recovery from a 
treatment -related toxicity, this will be viewed as a dose- limiting event ( Section  4.1.4).  For 
patients treated on either dosing schedule, if the next cycle is delayed due to treatment -related 
toxicity by [CONTACT_7809] [ADDRESS_230776] 
experienced clinical benefit if agreed upon between the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
The use of granulocyte growth factors in accordance with ASCO guidelines may be implemented 
at the discretion of the treating physician  after Cycle 1 .

Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 75 of 138 [IP_ADDRESS]. To Continue Treatment within a Cycle - Schedule B (modified weekly)  
Amendment 10  Update : Following completion of the Schedule B Dose Escalation portion of the 
study, the CRC reviewed safety, PK and efficacy data from both dosing schedules and based this 
review,  made the decision to discontinue further investigation of Schedule B dosing. While 
patients currently receiving IMGN853 study treatment according to Sched ule B will continue to 
do so, new patients enrolled to the study will receive treatment according to Schedule A only. 
In the absence of otherwise dose- limiting toxicity, for a patient to continue treatment within a 
cycle , the following criteria must be met. 
• ANC must be ≥ 1.0x109/L (1, 000/µL) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/ µL) 
• All non- hematologic toxicities for which a causal association to study treatment 
cannot be ruled out, must be ≤ Grade 2 (except alopecia) or returned to baseline ; the 
exception  to this rule is treatment-emergent eye disorders, which must have recovered 
to < Grade 1 or baseline 
• A minimum of 7 days (~ 168 hours) must have elapsed between IMGN853 doses 
If the patient does not meet these criteria, dosing will be delayed and the patient should be re-
evaluated within [ADDRESS_230777] been met.  If the criteria  are 
not met due to insufficient recovery from a treatment- related toxicity, then that week’s dose will 
be considered “missed”.   
The use of granulocyte growth factors in accordance with ASCO guidelines may be implemented 
at the discretion of the treating physician after Cycle 1.  
5.9.2. Follow- up for DLTs and AEs Leading to Discontinuation  
Patients who experience a non -laboratory DLT must be evaluated weekly, at a minimum, until 
resolution to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_230778].  For abnormal laboratory values that qualify as a DLT, patient s will be followed twice weekly until values return to < Grade [ADDRESS_230779].   
5.9.3. Criteria for Re- Initiation of Study Treatment Following Occurrence of a DLT  
Study treatment will be stopped if a patient  experiences a DLT at any time during the study .  It 
may resume, with applicable dose adjustments ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) if the following criteria are met:  
• ANC  must be ≥ 1.5 x109/L (1 500 /µL) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/ µL) 
• All clinically -significant non- hematologic toxicities for which a causal association to 
study treatment cannot be ruled out must be ≤  Grade 1 (except alopecia) or returned 
to baseline 
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230780] been met .  However, if 
the next cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_7809] 14 days because of insufficient recovery from a 
treatment -related toxicity, this may  be viewed as a dose- limiting event ( Section 4.1.4).  For 
patients treated on either schedule, if the next cycle is delayed due to treatment -related toxicity 
by [CONTACT_7809] [ADDRESS_230781] experienced clinical benefit if agreed upon between the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
5.9.4. Dose Modification Guidelines  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Reduction  Following DLT 
Patients  who develop DLTs or adverse events requiring  holding of the study drug may resume 
treatment at a reduced dose level as shown in Table 11  provided the criteria  outlined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] are met .  
Table 11: Dose Modification Guidelines  
Dosing Schedule  If the patient was receiving IMGN853 at:  Dose should be reduced to:  
Schedule A  6.0 mg/kg  5.0 mg/kg  
5.0 mg/kg  4.0 mg/kg  
Schedule B * 2.0 mg/kg 1.8 mg/kg 
1.8 mg/kg 1.1 mg/kg 
*IMGN853 should be dose-reduced one dose level; a second dose reduction may be allowed as needed.  Dose 
reductions to intermediate dose levels may be allowed based on emerging data with the approval of the Sponsor.  
Amendment 10  Update : Schedule B  will not be evaluated further in the current study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Re- initiation of Study Treatment Following Occurrence of a DLT  
The AE reverts to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within 14 days of the next scheduled Day 1 dose ; the 
patient  is clearly deriving clinical benefit , and the patient  has an otherwise favorable risk/benefit 
profile.  
Once a dose level reduction has occurred, patient s must remain at this reduced dose.  
5.9.5. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Due to Toxicity 
Study treatment should not be resumed in the case of the following treatment- related events.  
• ≥ Grade 3 cardiac event  
• other non-hematologic events of Grade 4 severity 
• Failure to meet re -treatment criteria within [ADDRESS_230782] experienced clinical benefit if agreed upon 
between the Sponsor and the Investigator.

Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 77 of 138 5.10. Removal of the Patient s from the Trial or Study Drug  
The patient  or legal guardian acting on behalf of the patient  is free to withdraw consent and 
discontinue participation in the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment.  For this 
protocol, patient s withdrawn for reasons other than toxicity during Cycle 1 may be replaced. 
Patient s will be removed from the study when their disease worsens, and show no clinical 
benefit .  Additionally, a  patient ’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  The following may be justifiable  reasons for the Investigator 
to remove a patient  from the study: 
• The patient  suffers an intolerable adverse event  
• Non-compliance, including failure to appear at one or more study visits 
• The patient  was er roneously included in the study 
• The study is termin ated by [CONTACT_194480] a patient  or the patient’s legal guardian(s), acting on behalf of the patient , discontinues 
participation in the study, or the patient  is discontinued by [CONTACT_737], the reason for 
discontinuation must be captured in the eCRF.  Any AEs experienced up to the point of discontinuation must be documented on the AE eCRF.  All SAEs, and those AEs assessed by [CONTACT_194481], whic hever comes first.  
5.10.1. Replacement of Patient s who are Withdrawn Prior to the End of Cycle 1  
Only patient s who sign the informed consent and receiv e any study treatment will be considered 
enrolled .  If an enrolled patient  is discontinued from study treatment for reasons other than safety 
(e.g., withdrawal of consent, non- compliance, death due to disease progressio n) prior to the end 
of Cycle 1, he or she will be replaced ( i.e., an additional patient  will be added to the cohort).  
Patient s who do not complete Cycle [ADDRESS_230783] dosing until the final evaluation during the study, including the 28-day follow-up safety visit.  Short-
term follow-up for patients who discontinue study therapy without documented progressive 
disease will continue every three months until the patient’s disease worsens , until the patient  
begins subsequent anti- cancer treatment , or until the patient dies, whichever comes first . 
5.12. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All concomitant medications and supportive therapy taken within [ADDRESS_230784] be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF ).  The identity of all medications, dosage, and route of administration, 
frequency, duration of administration, and indication for use will be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF.

5.12.2. Corticosteroid Eye Drops  
All p atients enrolled in Cohort 5 will be required  to self -administer  corticosteroid eye drops (1% 
prednisolone; Pred Forte® or generic equivalent ) during active  study treatment  (Section  5.8.2) . 
Patients will record their eye drop administration in a patient diary, which will be entered on the 
CRF.  
5.12.3. Antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications  
Antiemetic  (e.g. 5-HT 3 serotonin receptor antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or 
ondansetron) and antidiarrheal (e.g. loperamide) medications may be used at the discretion of the 
treating physician , but they are not to be used prophylactically. 
5.12.4. Acetaminophen  
All patients dosed according to Schedule B should receive 325-650 mg of acetaminophen (PO or IV) approximately 30 minutes prior to each infusion of IMGN853. 
5.12.5. Folate-Containing Vitamins 
Folate -containing vitamins are not to be taken during the course of the study. 
5.12.6. Antineoplastic Therapy  
Other chemotherapy, investigational agents, or biologic therapy will not be permitted  during the 
study.  
Palliative radiotherapy for local peripheral metastases not being used as target lesions is allowed .  
However, the need for such therapy may be an indication of disease progression and should be 
discussed with the Sponsor prior to implementation.  Radiotherapy for central metastases (e.g. 
vertebral, meditational) will not be allowed; the need for such radiotherapy while on study will be seen as an indication of disease progression and the patient  should be withdrawn from 
therapy.  
5.12.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Patient s receiving recombinant erythropoietin or darbepoietin- α prior to study start may continue 
to receive pre- treatment doses.  
The use of erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors in accordance with ASCO guidelines may be implemented at the discretion of the treating physician  after Cycle 1. 
5.12.8. Anticoagulants 
The use of low dose anticoagulants for maintenance of line patency  is allowed.   Thrombosis 
prophylaxis is allowed.

Medications for the treatment of adverse events or cancer symptoms  (e.g. packed red blood cells 
and pain medications) , are allowed .  Prophylactic use of steroids and/or antihistamines will be 
considered if needed to alleviate mild -moderate infusion reactions.  Additionally medications 
(not addressed above) used to treat underlying medical conditions at study entry including anti-
emetics and anti -diarrheals will be allowed to continue.  
5.13. Overdose and Medication Error  
Overdose – There is no known treatment/antidote available for IMGN 853.  Supportive measures 
should be instituted if an instance arises in which a patient  suffers an overdose of study drug. 
Medication Error – The Sponsor must be immediately notified in the event of error in prescribing, dispensing, administering and/or use o f IMGN 853, and the event must be reported 
on the eCRF.

Translational research studies will be performed to generate data that will demonstrate proof -of-
mechanism and characterize pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor effects of IMGN853.  In 
addition, several biomarkers, including FOLR1, will be evaluated as potential biomarkers of 
clinical response to IMGN853.  These will help guide further clinical development of IMGN853. 
7.1. Correlation between FOLR1 Expression  and IMGN853 an ti-tumor 
activity  
FOLR1 expression varies with tumor histology, as reported in the literature and demonstrated in 
our pre- clinical studies ( Section s 1.1 and Investigators’ Brochure ).  Based on the hypothesis that 
tumors expressing higher levels of FOLR1 are more likely to be susceptible to anti-tumor 
activity of IMGN853, a threshold for FOLR1 expression was determined for each tumor 
histology studied in the expansion cohorts.  This was done based on molecular epi[INVESTIGATOR_194434] a number of patient samples representative of different tumor types, as well as pre-clinical efficacy data.  
7.1.1. Evaluation of FOLR1 Expression in Tumor T issue D uring Dose-Escalation and 
Dose Expansion 
FOLR1 expression in tumors will be analyzed via IHC.  All patient s must submit archived tumor 
tissue , formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded  (FFPE ) slides for analysis of FOLR1 expression by 
[CONTACT_4658].  For dose escalation, patient s with tumors known to have high incidence of FOLR1 
expression (serous and  endometrioid ovarian cancer, serous and endometrioid endometrial 
cancer  and NSCLC adenocarcinoma or BA C) may submit archived tumor tissue for retrospective 
analysis after enrollment .  All other patient s must submit archived tumor tissue for 
documentation of FOLR1 positivity by [CONTACT_194482].  Any level of FOLR1 expression (i.e., ≥1% of tumor staining at ≥1+ intensity ) is acceptable for enrollment in the dose escalation 
portion of the study.  If a patient  does not have archival material available for analysis, the 
patient  may alternatively undergo a biopsy to assess FOLR1 expression.  The decision to biopsy 
will be made once patient  eligibility has been determined and on the basis of tumor accessibility 
and patient  safety.  
Only patient s with the required FOLR1 expression levels  by [CONTACT_194483].  I f a patient wishes to enroll and does not have archival material 
available for analysis, he or she must undergo a biopsy to assess FOLR1 expression.  In the 
ovarian cancer cohorts (Cohort #s 1 and 3) eligible patients must meet the minimum requirement 
of FOLR1 positivity by [CONTACT_4658] (≥25% of tumor staining at ≥2+ intensity) , and in the uterine cancer 
and NSCLC cohorts, patients will be required to have an H score ≥ 100 for  FOLR1 expression  
in order to be eligible to enroll.   
The tumor samples will be analyzed for folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) expression in the Companion 
Diagnostics Pharma Services CAP -accredited and CLIA- certified laboratory and Pathology Services  at 
Ventana Medical Systems, In c. 
 
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 83 of 138 IHC data will be used to define any potential associations between FOLR1 expression and 
clinical response.  
7.2. Exploratory Biomarker Studies  
Studies in tumor tissue and blood will be performed to explore potential markers of IMGN853 
sensitivity and resista nce.  The sections below describe specific activities that are planned, but 
other additional biomarkers/biological pathways may be investigated based on emerging data. 
7.2.1. Potential Markers of Drug Sensitivity  
As IMGN853 targets proliferating cells, Ki67 IHC staining will be assessed as a marker of cell 
proliferation on fresh biopsy samples from patients in Expansion Cohort 3.  Potential 
associations between Ki67 levels and clinical response will be examined.  
IMGN853 retains the ADCC activity of the parent al M9346A antibody.  FcγR is the principle 
leukocyte receptor that mediates ADCC and FcγR polymorphisms modulate leukocyte ADCC 
activity.  Therefore, all patients will be genotyped for FcγR alleles via PBMC analysis at 
screening.  Potential associations between FcγR genotype and clinical response will be examined.  
7.2.2. Potential Markers of Drug Resistance  
Drug efflux transporters and p-glycoprotein (PgP) in particular play an important role in cancer cell resistance to cytotoxic agents, including microtubule -targeting agents.  Therefore, PgP IHC 
staining will be assessed as a marker of drug resistance in archived tumor tissues for all patients 
and on fresh biopsy samples obtained from patients in the Expansion Cohorts.  Potential 
associations between PgP levels and clinical response will be examined.  
7.2.3. Folate Pathway Markers 
Preclinical studies suggest that FOLR1 is upregulated in folate deficiency and downregulated 
following folate repletion ( Zhu 2001, Sadasivan  2002).  Because folate deficiency can enhance 
FOLR1 expression via a homocysteine-dependent upregulation of FOLR1 mRNA translation 
(Antony  2004 ), plasma total homocysteine levels will be assessed in all patients at baseline , 
during Cycle [ADDRESS_230788] folate deficiency.  Vitamin B12 deficiency 
similarly elevates homocysteine levels and also elevates plasma methylmalonate (MMA) levels.  
Plasma MMA will therefore  be analyzed in parallel with plasma total homocysteine to 
differentiate folate and B12 status.  Potential associations between plasma total 
homocysteine/MMA, FOLR1 expression, and clinical response will be examined.  
7.3. Pharmacodynamic (Pd) and Proof of Mecha nism (POM) Analyses 
7.3.1. Pd and PoM studies in Tumor Biops ies (EOC Expansion Cohort #3 Only)  
For this, patients with biopsy-accessible tumors will undergo core tumor biopsy at baseline and 
at Cycle 2, Day  8±[ADDRESS_230789]-dose 
tumor biopsy samples.  The presence of IMGN853 will also be detected in  tumor cells using IHC 
methods directed at  the maytansinoid payload of IMGN853 (using an anti -maytansin oid 
antibody).  Changes in Ki67 and other markers describing anti-proliferative and/or apoptotic 
effect of IMGN853 may also be investigated.   
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230790] provide written informed consent before 
any study-required procedures are conducted, unless those procedures are performed as part of 
the patient’s standard care.   
8.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed during screening (within [ADDRESS_230791] dose of any study drug on Cycle 1, Day 1).  A patient  is considered enrolled when 
administered the first dose of any study drug. 
Procedures for completion of enrollment information, and requirements to communicate with the 
Sponsor about enrollment, are detailed in the Study Manual. 
8.3. Confirmation of Disease Diagnosis  
At screening, disease diagnosis, and current disease status will be confirmed from inform ation in 
the source record . 
8.4. Demographic/Medical History  
The age, race,  and gender of the patient  are to be recorded during screening. 
During the Screening period, a complete medical history will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_194435] .  The 
history will include the b ackground and progress of the patient ’s primary malignancy and 
include a description of all prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194436].  
8.5. Physical Examination, Weight and Height  
Physical examination, height (screening only) and weight must be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Clinical Assessments ( Appendix A  and Appendix B ).  A complete physical 
examination  - including assessments of general appearance, skin, head (eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat), neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and neurological system - will be completed at screening  and end of treatment.  Directed physical examinations will be 
completed at additio nal time points as specified in the Schedule of Events and Section 10. 
Weight will be measured at screening and at other times specified in the Sched ule of Clinical 
Assessments ( Appendix A  and Appendix B ).

8.15. Eligibility based on FOLR1 Expression  
Instructions regarding processing and shipment of biopsy samples and archival tissues are detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
8.15.1. Dose Escalation Cohorts 
Patients with serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, uterine cancer or NSCLC adenocarcinoma 
or BA C, tumors known to have a high incidence of FOLR1 expression do not require IHC 
screening prior to enrollment ( Section  1.1 and  Section  7.1.1, and the  Investigators’ Brochure ).  
Archival tumor tissue should be submitted for retrospective analysis of FOLR1 expression.  Patients with other tumor types may be  eligible, but require documented expression of FOLR1 
by [CONTACT_4658]  (≥1% of tumor staining at ≥1+ intensity ) on archival tissue prior to enrollment.  If 
archival tissue is not available, then a fresh tumor biopsy must be obtained to confirm FOLR1 expression by [CONTACT_194482].  De-identified pathology reports should be included with sample shipment to ImmunoGen or designee.  
8.15.2. Dose Expansion Cohort #1, Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer  
Patients must meet the minimum requirement of FOLR1 positivity by [CONTACT_4658] (≥25% of tumor 
staining at ≥2+ intensity)  prior to enrollment.  IHC may be performed on archival tissue to 
determine eligibility.  If archival tissue is not available, then a fresh tumor biopsy must be 
obtained to confirm FOLR1 expression by [CONTACT_194482]. 
8.15.3. Dose Expansion Cohort #2, Advanced/Recurrent Uterine Cancer  
Patients must have documented expression of FOLR1 by [CONTACT_4658] (H score ≥ 100)  prior to 
enrollment.  IHC may be performed on archival tissue to determine eligibility.  If archival tissue 
is not available, then a fresh tumor biopsy must be obtained to confirm FOLR1 expression by [CONTACT_194482].  
8.15.4. Dose Expansion Cohort #3, Relapsed Ovarian Cancer 
Patients must meet the minimum requirement of FOLR1 positivity by [CONTACT_4658] (≥25% of tumor staining at ≥2+ intensity) prior to enrollment.  IHC may be performed on archival tissue to 
determine eligibility.  If archival tissue is not available, then a fresh tumor biopsy must be 
obtained to confirm FOLR1 expression by [CONTACT_194482]. 
If the patient meets all eligibility criteria and enrolls in the study, then a fres h tumor biopsy must 
be obtained prior to their first dose of IMGN853 and at Cycle 2 d ay 8±3 for pharmacodynamic 
analyses ( Section  7.3).  Patients who  relapse after showing clinical benefit will be asked to 
undergo an optional biopsy to help understand the mechanism of resistance to IMGN853.

9.1. Adverse and Serious Adverse Event s 
Treatment -emergent AEs (including SAEs) will be documented on the AE eCRF and monitored 
continuously throughout the study from the time of the first dose of study treatment until 28 days 
after the patient ’s last dose of study drug or until the event has resolved, stabilized or an outcome 
has been reached, whichever comes first.   
If the Investigator considers it necessary to report an AE in a study patient  occurring after the 
end of study, he or she should contact [CONTACT_194484].  Pre -treatment AEs attributed to study procedures, including those 
events which occur prior to the first dose, should also be documented on the AE eCRF.  Any 
other change in medical condition which occurs during the interval between consent and first 
dose will be documented on the medical history eCRF. 
9.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or 
metabolic function as indicated by  [CONTACT_30597], symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered study drug- related.  This includes an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition.  AEs include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the 
onset of the study 
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug interactions  
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications 
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal that the Investigator considers to be clinically important)  
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, and weight  
Note that progressive disease should not be reported as an AE. 
Pre-treatment AEs occurring fro m the time of consent until the time of the first dose of study 
treatment, which are attributed to study procedures, must be reported on the designated AE 
eCRF .  All treatment -emergent  AEs , including AEs attributed to study procedures, occurring 
from the first dose of study treatment until [ADDRESS_230802] results constitute AEs if they induce clinical signs or

in and of itself a Serious Adverse Event, or require therapy , e.g., any hematologic abnormality 
that requires transfusion or cytokine treatment) ; and should be recorded on the AE eCRF unde r 
the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them.  In the event of an out-of- range value, 
the laboratory test should be repeated until it returns to normal or can be explained and the 
patient ’s safety is not at risk .   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substa ntial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropria te medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120006] a clinical adverse event.  The following events would not be considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120007]: 23-hour hold for 
observation, admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120008], respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], outpatient surgery, 
social admission (e.g. , a homeless patient) or admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_194437] (e.g. , elective ore pre -planned surgery, or in- patient administration of 
subsequent chemotherapy, etc.). 
All AEs will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 (effective 14 June 2010).  
If the AE is not listed in the CTCAE version 4.03, it should be graded based on the description given in Table 14 .

9.2. Recording Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, regardless of relationship to study medication, which occurs in a patient  from the time 
of the first dose of study treatment until [ADDRESS_230803] study treatment, should be recorded 
by [CONTACT_194487].  This reporting requirement also includes SAEs that are attributed to a study procedure performed during the screening period (from the time of consent 
until the time of the first dose of study treatment) .  The SAE mus t be completely described on 
the patient ’s CRF, including the judgment of the Investigator as to the relationship of the SAE to 
the study drug.  The Investigator will promptly supply all information identified and requested 
by [CONTACT_1034] (or contract research organization [CRO]) regarding the SAE.  
The Investigator must report the SAE to the ImmunoGen Medical Director or designee on an 
SAE report  form.  This form must be completed and submitted within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s learning of the event to the contact [CONTACT_194488] .  Any follow -up information must also be 
completed on an SAE form and submitted to the same contacts.  
When reporting SAEs,  the foll owing a dditional points should be noted.  
IMGN853 Dated 02 September  2015 
Clinical Study Protocol 0401  
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential   Page 94 of 138 • The underlying diagnosis or syndrome should be reported as the primary SAE term, 
rather than the signs or symptoms (signs and symptoms may be described in the narrative).  
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but rather as an outcome of a specific SAE, 
unless the event preceding the death is unknown.  In these exceptional cases, death 
may be used as an event term .  If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report 
should be provided. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that each Investigator receives a copy of any 
CIOMS/MedWatch report that has been submitted to the appropriate national regulatory agencies as notification of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) .  The Investigator (or Sponsor 
or Sponsor’s representative if so designated) must promptly report all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for review in accordance with national regulations .  IRB/IEC notification of the S[LOCATION_003]R may take t he form of a submission of a copy of the 
CIOMS/ MedWatch  report or other format accepted by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC .  A copy of the CIOMS/ MedWatch  
report and notification to IRB/IEC should be retained in the site’s study files.  
In addition to CIOMS/MedWatch reports, the Sponsor will also notify the Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs of all deaths that occur during the study, irrespective of relationship to study 
medication  through annual updates to the IB. 
Disease progression and/or progression of the disease under study are anticipated occurrences in 
oncology drug development, and as such, are considered expected as per the current investigator’s brochure for the compound.  If a patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_194438]/or from the disease under study during the period of obligation to report serious adverse events, 
disease progression and/or progression of the disease under study with a fatal outcome do not 
need to be reported as serious adverse events.  The applicable protocol CRF page(s) pertaining to death should be appropriately completed however, as disease progression. 
9.2.2. Reporting a Pregnancy  
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria.  The Sponsor must be notified in the event of a 
pregnancy occurring during the course of the study and through 28 days after the patient ’s last 
dose of study drug.  Pregnancy is not to be reported as an AE; the pregnancy reporting form 
should be used to report the pregnancy.  The pregnancy will be followed through delivery or 
final outcome.

In some cases, clinical assessments performed prior to obtaining informed consent may be used 
to qualify the patient  for the study.  These include radiological tumor assessment, physical 
examinations, hematology, serum chemistry results, coagulation studies, urinalysis, or other 
assessments which may be considered part of normal standard of care.  In these cases, repeat 
assessments may not be necessary prior to enrollment, unless individual parameters require further study or confirmation and are clinically appropriate.  
10.2. Cycle [ADDRESS_230807] be performed or initiated as indicated prior to the start of 
treatment to establish the patient ’s baseline condition.  The patient  will remain in the clinical 
research unit/treatment area for at least [ADDRESS_230808]-dose observation period (if the 
initial infusion is well tolerated).  While in the treatment area, patient s will be closely monitored 
for toxicity.  
The following should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 except as noted.  
Note that safety blood tests , and physical examination  do not need to be repeated if normal and

No formal interim analysis is planned for this study .  However, a review of safety data and 
available preliminary PK data will be conducted by [CONTACT_194490] a RP2D for 
IMGN853 has been determined.  Results from this data review could enable selection of dose and dosing schedule for additional studies with IMGN853, before full completion of this study. 
A statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will fully describe the planned analyses for t his trial.  All 
analyses will be performed for any patient that received study drug.   All analyses for efficacy 
will use Cycle 1, Day 1 as the start time.  
11.1. Sample Size  
Ascending doses of IMGN853 are to be evaluated to identify the MTD for both dosing 
schedules .  The actual number of patient s accrued during this phase will be determined largely 
by [CONTACT_194448].  
Following identification of the MTD  for Schedule  A (Q3W) , there was an expansion phase which initially 
accrue d two cohorts at the MTD: (1) Dose Expansion Cohort 1  – 40 patients with platinum resistant EOC . 
(2) Dose Expansion Cohort # 2 - 20 patients with advanced or recurrent uterine cancer .  Once the 
Schedule B MTD (modified weekly) was established, the CRC convened to review safety , PK and efficacy 
results  from the both schedules as well as  preliminary data from the Expansion Cohorts 1 and 2, with 
the Q3W  schedule of administration.  The CRC recommend ed use of Schedule A for all future cohorts . 
Three additional MTD Expansion Cohorts will enroll the following patients:  (3) Dose Expansion 
Cohort 3  – 20 patients w ith relapsed  ovarian  cancer, which is amenable to biopsy (4) Dose Expansion 
Cohort 4 – 20 patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC adenocarcinoma, and (5) 40 patients with 
platinum resistant EOC who will receive daily treatment with corticosteroid -containing eye drops .   
If the true DLT rate at the MTD is 10 -20%, there is an  98.5-99.9% probability of obs erving at 
least one DLT in each 40 patient cohort.  If the true response rate at the MTD is 20%, there is a 99.9% probability of observing at least one response in each 40 patient cohort .

[ADDRESS_230811] a difference of 20% (rate of Blurry vision 
decrease from 50% to 30%) is 68% using one -sided alpha of 20% and Chi -Square test statistics.  
Safety will be evaluated continuously, separately, and in aggregate in the expansion cohorts.  If 
at any time ≥ 33% of patients treated in an expansion cohort experiences a Cycle 1 DLT, further 
enrollment to that cohort will stop and a CRC will be convened.  The CRC will review all 
available safety data and PK data to determine how further dosing should proceed.  If the CRC 
determines that the dose should be revised during the expansion phase for a given expansion cohort, that cohort will enroll additional patients at the revised dose to fulfill the enrollment goal.  
Approximately 209 patients will be enrolled in the study, allowing for dropouts and expansion of dose escalation cohorts as needed .

PK parameters (C max, Tmax, Terminal half -life ( t1/2), volume of distribution at steady state ( Vss), 
clearance (Cl ), AUC 0-24, AUC 0-168, AUC inf) will be derived from plasma concentrations of 
IMGN853, total M9346A antibody and DM4 using the actual sampling times .  Concentration 
data and all PK parameters will be listed per patient and summarized descriptively per dose.  Standard algorithms of the non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis program, WinNonlin software, will be used for these analyses.

the mean (+/ - STD) plasma concentration vs. scheduled time profiles for each dose level, will be 
presented graphically.

11.4. Efficacy 
Objective response rate (OR R) - The best OR will be determined by [CONTACT_194491], PR, SD or relapsed disease/PD. Objective responses for patient s in the dose 
escalation phase will be summarized  by [CONTACT_194492].  Responses will be tabulated separately for expansion cohorts 1-4.  For each 
expansion cohort, the response rate will be calculated as the number of CR or PR divided by [CONTACT_194493] s.  To meet the definition of response- evaluable, patients 
must have undergone radiographic assessment at baseline, received at least one dose of IMGN853, and must have had at least one post- dose tumor assessment.  
Duration of Response (DOR) – DOR , defined as the time from initial response until progressive 
disease,  will be estimated  for all patients who achieve a confirmed objective response (PR or 
CR) using the method of Kaplan- Meier .  Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_194494].  
Progression Free Survival (PFS) – PFS , defined as the time from initiation of study drug until 
progressive disease or death whichever occurs first , will be estimated  using the Kaplan- Meier 
method.  Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_42376].  
Time to Progression (TTP) - TTP defined as the time from initiation of study drug until 
progressive disease, will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier.  Results will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_42376]. 
For DOR, PFS, and TTP calculations, subjects not achieving the endpoint will be censored at the 
time of the last endpoint assessment.  Median response times and associated 95% CIs will be presented  for descriptive summaries .

be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 17.0 or later.  Training will occur at an Investigator meeting or at the site initiation visit or both, and instruction 
manuals (e.g., laboratory manuals and pharmacy manuals) will be provided to aid consistency in 
data collection and reporting across sites. 
All required data will be entered  into the clinical and/ or safety  database in accordance with Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) [ADDRESS_230813] (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) Approval  
Before initiation of the study, the Investigator must provide the Sponsor with a copy of the 
written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, the study ICF and the screening ICF (latter ICF is 
applicable for sites requesting permission to prescreen for FOLR1 positivity prior to performing 
any additional study related tests) .  This approval must refer to the ICF (s) and to the study title, 
study number, and version and date of issue of the study protocol, as given by [CONTACT_194495]. 
Status reports must be submitted to the IRB/IEC at least once per year or as per institutional 
guidelines.  The IRB/IEC must be notified of completion of the study and a final report must be 
provided to the IRB/IEC.  A copy of these reports will be sent to the study clinical monitor or designee.  The Investigators must maintain an accurate and complete record of all submissions 
made to the IRB/IEC, including a list of all reports and documents submitted .  AEs which are 
subject to expedited reporting to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other 
regulatory agencies ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) must be submitted promptly to the IRB/IEC. 
13.3. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The procedures set out in this study protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and Investigators abide by 
[CONTACT_23663] (GCP) as described in the 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 312 and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) GCP Guidelines.  Compliance with these 
regulations and guidelines also constitutes compliance with the ethical principles described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
13.4. Patient  Information and Consent  
Before enrolling in the clinical study, the patient  or the patient ’s legally authorized 
representative(s) must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to him or her.  An ICF that includes information about the study will be prepared and given to the patient, or the patient ’s 
legally authorized representative(s).  This document will contain all FDA and ICH-required 
IMGN853 Dated [ADDRESS_230814] be in a language understandable to the patient  or the patient ’s legally 
authorized representative(s) and must specify who informed the patient  or the patient ’s legally 
authorized representative. 
After reading the informed consent document, the patient  or the patient ’s leg ally authorized 
representative(s) must give consent in writing.  If the patient  or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative(s) is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written ICF and 
information to be supplied must take place in the presence of an impartial witness.  Consent must 
be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by [CONTACT_194496]’s legally authorized representative(s) .  The witness and the person conducting the 
informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the informed consent document.  
It should also be recorded and dated in the source document that consent was given. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent document(s) must be given to the patient  or the patient ’s 
legally authorized representative(s) .  The original signed and dated consent document will be 
retained by [CONTACT_737].  Patient  confidentiality will be maintained as outlined in Section 13.5. 
The Investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required solely for the clinical 
study until valid consent has been obtained. 
A model of the full study ICF will be provided to the sites separately from this protocol.  
A screening ICF may be used to confirm a patient’s consent to analyze archived or fresh tumor 
samples for FOLR1 expression.  If the IHC screening assay is positive for FOLR1, the patient 
will be provided the full study consent and only after signing the full study ICF will additional 
study- specific screening tests be performed .  A model of the screening ICF will be provided to 
the sites separately from this protocol. 
13.5. Patient  Confidentiality  
Patient  names will no t be supplied to the Sponsor.  If the patient  name [CONTACT_136643], it must be redacted before a copy of the document is supplied to the Sponsor.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws.  
Patient blood and tissue samples sent to outside laboratories and/or CROs (e.g. IHC laboratory) 
are identified by [CONTACT_194497].  The patient consent form will state publications resulting from this study  will not refer to patient name [CONTACT_194514].  The patient s will be 
told that representatives of the Sponsor, a designated CRO, the IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all 
personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in 
accordance with local data protection laws .  The Investigator will maintain a personal patient  
identification list ( patient  numbers with the corresponding patient  names) to enable records to be 
identified.  
13.6. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring procedures that comply with current GCP guidelines will be followed.  On- site 
review of the case report forms ( CRFs ) for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source 
documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed.

 APPENDIX E.   RESPONSE DEFINITION (RECIST 1.1)  
(Eisenhauer  2009) 
DEFINITIONS  
Baseline: Baseline is defined as the most recent assessment performed prior to the first dose of 
study treatment.  Basel ine assessments must be performed within the period defined in the 
protocol eligibility criteria.  
Measurable Lesions:  Except for lymph nodes (described below), measurable lesions are defined 
as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥  [ADDRESS_230837] scan ( if CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size of a measurable lesion is twice th e slice thickness).  
• To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node m ust be ≥ [ADDRESS_230838] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and recorded. 
• MRI may be substituted for contrast-enhanced CT for le sions at some anatomical sites, but 
not for lesions in the lungs.  The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 
mm) as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm and no gap.  If MRI is 
performed with thicker slices, the si ze of a measurable lesion at baseline should be twice the 
slice thickness .  In the event there are inter -slice gaps, this also needs to be considered in 
determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline.  
Non-measurable lesion:  all other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10mm are considered non-pathological and are not 
to be recorded or followed.  
• Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at baseline.  
• Target lesions are to be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter ) to represent all involved organs, and to be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  
• It may be the case that on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
• Target lesions will be measured at each assessment (longest axis for non -nodal lesions, 
shortest axis for measurable malignan t nodal lesions). 
IMGN853   Dated  02 September  2015  
Protocol 0401 
 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 131 of 138 
 Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including all non -measurable lesions 
(including pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) and all measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions are to be identified as non- target lesions and recorded at 
baseline.  
• Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
unequivocal progression of each is to be recorded throughout follow-up.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non- pathological and are 
not to be recorded or followed. 
Special Considerations  
Clinical Examination of Lesions: Superficial or visible lesions that cannot be assessed by [CONTACT_194511] e lesions are biopsy -proven 
metastatic lesions and ≥ 10 mm in diameter .  These lesions will be considered non- measurable 
and thus non- target for response assessment.  
Cystic lesions : Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as  
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesion.  
Bone lesions:  Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Lesions with p rior local treatment :  Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an 
area subjected  to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable; however, if 
they meet the following criteria, they may be considered for study:  
• there has been prior documented progression in the lesion by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_230839] or MRI scans performed after the completion of radiation, or  
• histopathological evidence of progression 
Additionally, if such lesions meet the criteria for measurability,  they may be considered target 
lesions. 
Imaging Methods 
The same method of assessment and the same technique used to characterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline should be used during each follow- up assessment .  Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460] (s) being followed 
IMGN853   Dated  02 September  2015  
Protocol 0401 
 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 132 of 138 
 cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461] (referring to biopsy -proven visible 
lesions(s) at the vaginal apex).  
Chest X -ray: Lesions that are identified on chest X-ray must be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_14216].  If there is/are pre -existing chest lesion(s) before the baseline tumor assessment, a chest X -
ray is not necessary to assess those  lesions.  The pre- existing chest lesion(s) must be assessed at 
baseline and  followed by [CONTACT_5291]. 
Conventional CT or MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_230840] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion is twice the slice thickness .  MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g., for body scan) except for lung.  
CA-125: Tumor marker CA125 alone cannot be used to assess response or determine 
progression; however, it will be followed.  CA1 25 measurements should be scheduled to 
approximately coincide with radiological assessment ( every 6 weeks ±1 week ).  Patients whose 
CA125 is above the upper normal limit at baseline will need to have their values normalize to ≤ 
upper normal limit, in addition to complete disappearance of measurable or evaluable disease, in 
order to be considered in complete response. 
Other methods of assessment, PET-CT, ultrasound and FDG-PET should not be used for response assessment in this study. 
Time Point Assessments  
Patients will have tumor measurements performed within 28 days prior to baseline and every 6 weeks  thereafter  (±1 week). 
At baseline, tumors and lymph nodes are classified and documented as target or non- target per 
the definitions provided above.  It is po ssible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item ( e.g., ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
At all post- baseline evaluations, the baseline classification (target, non -target) is to be maintained 
and lesions are to be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time ( e.g., recorded 
in the same order on source documents and CRFs). 
For target lesions, measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters.  
At each assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported .  The baseline sum of the diameters 
(SoD) will be used as reference to further characterize any  objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  The lowest SoD (nadir) since, and including, the baseline value will be used as reference for evaluating progression.  
After baseline, the actual size of the target lesion should be documented, if possible, even if the 
lesions become very small .  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_194445], the lesion has likely disappeared, 0 
mm should be recorded.  If the lesion is present but too small to measure, an indicator of “too small 
to measure” wi ll be provided on the CRF (a default value of 5 mm will be imputed during analysis).

ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 133 of 138 
 Non-target lesions are to be assessed qualitatively (present, resolved, or unequivocal 
progression) and new lesion, if any, are to be documented separately. 
At each evalu ation, a time point response is to be determined for target lesions, non- target 
lesions, new lesions and overall.

 Time Point Response Criteria  
Target Lesion Time Point Response (TPR)  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions.  All pathol ogical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 
mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least 30% decrease in the SoD  of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline SoD  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesion, taken  as reference 
the smallest (nadir) SoD since and including baseline.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.  
Not Applicable (N/A)  No target lesions identified at baseline  
Unable to Evaluate (UE)  One or more target lesions are not imaged and the remainder of the SoD compared with the nadir SoD does not meet the criteria for PD  
If the target lesion for a patient  meet s the criteria for both PR and PD at a given time point, the target 
lesion response is PD.  
If the nadir SoD is 0 ( i.e., the patient  had a prior target lesion CR), the re- appearance of any prior target 
lesions to any  degree constitutes PD.  
Non-Target Lesion TPR 
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level if tumor marker at baseline is above the upper normal limit.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis)   
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
CA125 above the normal limits if CA125 at baseline is above the upper normal limit  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Unequivocal progression of non- target lesions .  Unequivocal 
progression should not normally trump target lesion status .  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
Not Applicable (N/A)  No non- target lesions identified at baseline  
Unable to Evaluate (UE)  One or more non- target lesions are not imaged and the remaining non-
target lesions do  not meet the criteria for PD

Protocol 0401 
 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  Confidential  Page 135 of 138 
 If the target lesion for a patient  meet s the criteria for both PR and PD at a given time point, the target 
lesion response is PD.  
If the nadir SoD is 0 (i.e., the patient  had a prior target lesion CR), the re- appearance of any prior target 
lesions to any  degree constitutes PD.  
 
New Lesion TPR  
Yes Lesion present at follow -up visit either for the very first time or re -appearing 
(i.e., lesion was present at baseline, disappeared at a follow -up visit and re -
appeared later).  
No No new lesions present at follow up

On the basis of the available data and extensive discussions among the cooperative groups within the 
GCIG, it is recommended that the following definition of response be used in ovarian cancer trials so 
that response can be measured by [CONTACT_194512] 125 criteria.  If the response is evaluable by [CONTACT_194513], then the date of response will be the date of the earlier of the two events.  
Definition  of response : 
≥ 50% reduction  in CA 125 levels from baseline  
• the response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days 
• the pretreatment sample must be ≥ 2.0 times the UNL and within 2 weeks prior to 
starting treatment  
• the date of response corresponds to the date when the CA [ADDRESS_230842] reduced by 50%  
To calculate CA 125 responses accurately, the following rules apply:  
1) Intervening samples and the [ADDRESS_230843] be less than or equal to (within an 
assay variability of 10%) the previous sample  
2) Variations within the normal range of CA 125 levels will not interfere with the response definition.  
Timing of CA125 assessments:  
The Gynecologic Cancer Interg roup (GCIG) recommen ds that  CA 125 measurements be taken at specific 
time intervals.  
• The first sample would be collected within 2 weeks before treatment is started  
• Later samples would be collected at intervals of 2 –4 weeks during treatment and at 
intervals of every two or three months during follow-up.  
• For each patient, the same assay method must be used and the assay must be tested in a quality -control scheme .  Patients are not evaluable by [CONTACT_28474] [ADDRESS_230844] received 
mouse antibodies or if there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days.  
This CA 125 response definition has been produced to evaluate relapse therapy .  If assessing therapy 
that includes two treatment modalities for relapse (e.g., surgery and chemotherapy), any CA [ADDRESS_230845]/GOG -NEUROTOXICI TY QUESTIONNAIRE,

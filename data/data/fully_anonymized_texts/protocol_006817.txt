  11.6.[ADDRESS_117127] long -term cognitive or 
physical problems. Finding ways to improve mobility and walking may help improve how 
patients recover from surgery. Only 1 in 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105458] s walk outside their room during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and patients spend 95% of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105459]. However, there are few 
studies to show if this can be successful, and how to best motivate patients to walk. We want to 
evaluate how patients do aft er a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder), to see if those 
receiving social support walk more and have less complications than those who receive the usual 
care. Our central hypothesis is that social incentives and support will increase how patients walk 
after complex surgeries, and will decrease healthcare utilization such as readmissions. This 
project will be a randomized trial comparing standard practice compared to social incentives and 
gamification postoperatively. The primary outcome is the numb er of steps per day, with 
secondary outcomes of postoperative readmissions. This will be the first trial of its kind to test if 
a simple strategy to increase walking in patients with bladder cancer can improve how patients 
do after surgery, and may be scal able for other major surgeries.  
 
2. Overall objectives  
 
The primary objective is to  assess the effectiveness of a social incentive -based gamification 
intervention after radical cystectomy to increase physical activity postoperatively . We will 
explore patients’ physical activity postoperatively at the  time of discharge  and if receiving  the 
social intervention  affects the amount of physical activity . A secondary objective will explore the 
effect of postoperative social incentives on imp roving physical activity at [ADDRESS_117128] -
discharge. We will also explore changes in patient functional decline, cognitive function, 
postoperative delirium, SNF placement, readmission rates, and postoperative complication rates 
graded by [CONTACT_105469] -Dindo classification . 
 
3. Aims  
 
 3.1 Primary outcome  
The primary outcome variable is the change in mean daily step count from the baseline period  
after a radical cystectomy to the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105460] . 
 
 3.2 Secondary outcome  
The secondary outcome variable is the change in mean daily step count from the postoperative 
baseline to 3 months after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
 
3.3 Exploratory outcome  
The exploratory outcome variable is a composite of placement to skilled nursing fa cility, 30 -day 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], postoperative complication rates, cognitive function, postoperative 
delirium rates, and functional decline postoperatively.  
 
4. Background  
Version 2.0_ 24Jul2019  Treatment for bladder cancer is complex and disproportionately affects a vulnerable elderly 
population. The median age at diagnosis for bladder cancer is 73 years,1 and 30 -60% of patients 
experiencing a postoperative complication with up to 30% readmitted within 90 days.2-8 
Preliminary evidence suggests that mobility is a potential lever to improve postoperative 
complications and readmissions.9-11 However, only 1 in 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105461],12,13 and previously ambulatory patients spend 95% of their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105459].14,[ADDRESS_117129] a two -arm randomized, controlled trial during the postoperative period after a 
radical cystectomy for bladder cancer,  comparing a control group that uses a wearable device  to 
track physical activity to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and receives 
a supportive social incentive -based gamification intervention  to adhere to a step goal program. 
Patients will be enrolled after being diagnosed with bladd er cancer and scheduled to undergo a 
radical cystectomy. The median length of stay after a radical cystectomy is 8 days, with 90% 
being discharged within two weeks. Postoperatively, the baseline step count will be averaged by 
[CONTACT_105470]. There will be 
two postoperative phases: Phase I will be while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105462]. Phase 
II will be when the patient is discharged for three months.  
 
 5.[ADDRESS_117130] 30 
participants ( 15 per arm) will provide 8 0% po wer to detect a difference of 5 00 steps in the 
change in mean daily step count from baseline to discharge  between intervention and control, 
using a 2 -sided α of 0.05, assuming  a baseline mean preoperative step count of 4000 steps and 
mean postoperative step count of 1074 steps (SD 955 steps) , and accounting for a 1 0% dropout 
rate.   
 
 5.5 Key inclusion criteria  
1) Age 18 years or older; 2) diagnosis of  bladder cancer undergoing a radical cystectomy  
 
 5.6 Key exclusion criteria  
Version 2.0_ 24Jul2019  1) Inability to provide informed consent; 2) does not have daily access to a smartphone 
compatible with the wearable device and not willing to use a device that we can provide them; 3) 
any other medical conditions that would prohibit par ticipation in a physical activity program  
 
6. Subject recruitment  
6.[ADDRESS_117131] compensation  
Participants will receive  $25 for enrolling and $25 for completing the discharge period, and $[ADDRESS_117132] 
will be told that he/she is free to  discontinue participation in the study  at any time and that the 
investigators also reserve the right to  discontinue  the study for medical or other reaso ns. 
Participants will be provided with the paper consent form for signature [CONTACT_105478]. In the paper copy of the consent, 
details regarding how to contact [CONTACT_105471] a participant wants  to withdraw from the study.  
 
All patients who consent to this study  will be debriefed in the same encounter during which they 
were approached.  
- Clinical research coordinator will describe the study’s use of deception and purpose.  
- Patients will also be informed of reimbursement (total $100)

of patients  that are  diagnosed with bladder cancer  and scheduled for a radical cystectomy . At 
enrollment, the research coordinator will administer two additional screening questions to 
determine eligibility (owns a smart phone a nd able to provide consent ) via the RedCap portal.  If 
the participant successfully passes the screening questions , the patient can be consented to the 
study. The research coordinator  will next present a series of surveys to the patient to be 
completed through the Way to Hea lth portal. These validated instruments include:  the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22336], Karolinska Scale, Activity of Daily Living -Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living Survey, Life Space Activity Survey, Mini -Nutritional Assessment Survey, Edmonton 
Sympto m Assessment Survey, Treatment Burden Questionnaire, Lubbens Social Network Scale, 
Self Rated Health Survey , and Dementia Tool.   
Version 2.0_ 24Jul2019   
After completing the enrollment assessment, the research coordinator will show patients how to 
use the wearable device  which can be worn on wrist (like a watch), carried in any pocket, or 
clipped to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105463].  
 
Upon enrollment after diagnosis  of bladder cancer and scheduled for cystectomy , participants 
will use the watch for one week to ensure that the data is captur ed accurately. After the radical 
cystectomy, there will be a two-day run-in period to estimate postoperative baseline step counts 
for all patients. For all patients with a baseline step count, they will be r andom ly assigned  to 
control or intervention using  block sizes of two . After discharge , all participants will be notified 
to complete post -discharge baseline surveys.  
 
Participants in the control group  will continue to  have data collected passively. Participants in 
the control arm will only receive study communications when it is time for them to complete 
surveys  in the Way to Health  system.  
 
Participant s in the intervention arm will have a postoperative daily  step goal that increases from  
baseline by [ADDRESS_117134] day after 
the postoperative baseline is set (i.e. postoperative day 3) , the participant receives 70 points (10 
points for each day that week). If the participant does not meet their daily step goal, they lose [ADDRESS_117135] 40 points, they will move up a level (levels from lowest to highest: blue, 
bronze, silver, gold, platinum).  If not, the participant will drop a level.  All participants begin at 
the silver  level.  Each week, participants get a fresh set of 70 points. Participants will receive 
daily feedback for the step counts, and weekly feedback for their levels.  Participants in the 
intervention arm will be asked to identify a family member or friend to be their support sponsor. 
A weekly report will be sent to this person with the participant’s performance (points and level).   
 
After dis charge, the goals will be changed from daily step goals to weekly step goal s to increase 
the weekly step counts  by 10% each week to a maximum of 10,[ADDRESS_117136] to Health system (5, 9, and 13 weeks after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]). [ADDRESS_117137] not already done so. Upon completion o f the fin al set of surveys, $ 50 will be processed for 
participants in both arms.  
 
9. Analysis plan  
In our primary analyses, we will use multiple imputation for missing data and use linear mixed 
effects models to compare the change in mean daily step count from base line to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954] (ie postoperative Phase I  time period) , adjusting for baseline step count and time. To 
test of the robustness of our findings we will also evaluate models using col lected data without 
imputation. All hypothesis tests will be two -sided using a two -sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_117138] -
discharge  (Phase  II time period) . 
 
In exploratory  analyses, we will evaluate how differences in postoperative  step counts are 
associated with outcome measures.  We will also conduct a qualitative analysis to evaluate 
participant perceptions of the intervention.

 11.4 Data disclosure  
The following entities, besides the members of the research team, may receive protected health 
information (PHI) for this research study: -Greep hire, the company which processes study -
related payments. Patient addresses and account balances will be stored on their secure 
computers. -Fitbit, Inc., the company that designs and manufactures the wearable devi ces used in 
Version 2.0_ 24Jul2019  the study to track participant physical activity. -Twilio, Inc., the company which processes some 
study -related messages. Twilio will store patients' p hone numbers on their secure computers. -
Qualtrics, Inc., the company which processes most study -related surveys. Qualtrics will house 
de-identified answers to these surveys on their secure servers. -The Office of Human Research 
Protections at the Universi ty of Pennsylvania . -Federal and state agencies (for example, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and/or the Office 
for Human Research Protections), or other domestic or foreign government bodies if required by 
[CONTACT_92771]/or necessary for oversight purposes.  
 
 11.5 Safety monitoring  
At the time of enrollment in  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], all patients will be  given anticipatory guidance on when 
to seek medical attention  (e.g. when to call their nurse or doctor should they feel dizzy, short of 
breath, chest pain, lightheaded, unstable, or otherwise unwell while ambulating) .  In addition, 
participants will be asked to report to the study team any epi[INVESTIGATOR_105466] (the research assistant will check in 
periodically with enrolled patients to ensure devices are working properly and troubleshoot any 
issues encountered by [CONTACT_1962]/caregivers or nursing) .  Patients/caregivers will also be reminded 
that they can  always contact [CONTACT_105475] (contact [CONTACT_105476], which can be accessed at any time by [CONTACT_2299]).  If any concerns of a participant 
event are identified, the study coordinator will reach out to the participant and complete the event 
reporting form. This form will be reviewed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_105467]. Any identified adverse events will be 
reported to the Institutional Review Board. For patients on floors where the mobility protocol is 
in place, mobility goals are revised daily by [CONTACT_105477]. If patient is 
noted to be weaker, the nurse will automatically reduce the mobility goal for the day per the 
mobility protocol (this happens without regard to research protocol).

with the Study C oordinator. All other members of the research team will be able to view only 
participant ID numbers. Additionally, participants will receive guidance from the  research 
coordinator  on when to seek medical attention (call for their nurse or doctor in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and a 
reporting protocol is in place to capture any changes in symptoms with physical activity.

tremendous benefits for society if adopted on a wide scale to help individuals increase physical 
activity during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105468] 2.0_ 24Jul2019  functional decline or nurs ing home placement. It is expected that other people will gain 
knowledge from this study and that participation could help understand how to effectively 
motivate people to become more physically active. Participants may also receive no benefit from 
their p articipation in the study.  
 
  11.6.3 Risk/benefit assessment  
Anticipated risks of this study should be minimal and the risk/benefit ratio is very favorable. To 
minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screen ed through exclusion criteria. Participants that increase physical activity may improve their 
health and reduce their risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated functional decline, falls, nursing home 
placement, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_117144] to be enrolled in the study in order to participate in activities to promote 
healthy mobility and overall patient engagement - all patients (regardless of study status) will 
receive usual care in th ese areas including physical therapy, nursing assistance with ambulation 
as needed, etc. Participation in the study merely entails wearing sensors to quantify mobility and 
answering questions from enrollment and exit surveys. Patients may receive feedback on their 
mobility from healthcare providers (nurses, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], doctors) without agreeing to 
participate in the study and wear mobility sensors.

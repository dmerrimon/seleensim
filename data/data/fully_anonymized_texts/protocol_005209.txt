SRC Version 2 6 December 18 , 201 7 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective   
• To evaluate the image quality of 90Y PET/CT post SIRT images as compared to 99mTc MAA  
SPECT/CT.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objective  
 
• To determine the superior accuracy in both distribution and dosimetry of 90Y PET/CT 
post SIRT imaging compared to 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Preliminary information  
 
Yttrium -90 (90Y) selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT ) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_668311]. The majority of patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma are being treated with glass microspheres (TheraSphere®; Biocompatibles Inc. , 
London, [LOCATION_006] ), while most patients with liver metastasis are being treated with resin 
microspheres (SIR -Spheres®; Sirtex Medical Limited, Lane Cove, Australia). SIRT  leads to 
improvements in progression free and overall survival  (1-4). Complications are either caused 
by [CONTACT_668316], in the lungs (radiation 
pneumonitis) or in the gastrointestinal tract (gastroduodenal ulceration), or by [CONTACT_668317]  (5-7). Reported hepatic toxicity is mostly limited to symptoms 
related to the so -called post -radioembolization syndrome including mild pain, nausea, 
vomiting and fatigue, but may include a more serious clinical syndrome, called 
radioembolization induced liver disease (REI LD), with liver insufficiency characterized by 
[CONTACT_668318], jaundice and ascites. REILD occurs in about 5% of the 
patients. It is difficult to treat and often fatal  (8).  
 
Individualized dose planning should aim for maximum treatment effect while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_668312]. The current dose calculation methods however are based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_668313], without established dose -response 
relationshi ps (9). Resin microsphere activity doses are calculated by [CONTACT_51737] (BSA) 
and fractional liver involvement, while glass microsphere dose calculation is based on a whole 
liver partition model, derived from the medical internal radiation  dosimetry pamphlet No. 17  
(10). Although the latter method is more robust it does not take the radiation absorbed dose 
in the tumors or the normal liver tissue into account.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668314], there are curre ntly no reliable methods to demonstrate and quantify 
distribution of the treatment doses to the target lesion(s).  90Y PET/CT represents a 
technological leap from 90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT by [CONTACT_668319]. However, image acquisition times are long and the 
resulting quality is suboptimal when using currently available PET/CT scanners.  
 
More than a decade ago, multimodality imaging was introduced into clinical routine with the 
development of the PET/CT. Since then, PET/CT has been widely accepted in clinical imaging 
and has emerged as one of the main cancer imaging modalities. With the re cent development 
of combined PET/MRI  systems for clinical use, a promising new PET detector technology 
using silicon photomultiplier tubes has become available . The combination of functional 
information delivered by [CONTACT_668320] [ADDRESS_902651] and digital PET detectors  are fundamental. Digital PET/CT  is 
expected to show advantages over stand ard PET/CT by [CONTACT_668321], higher sensitivity and temporal resolution . However, as of now, only 
assumptions can be made about the future clinical role of digital PET/CT , as data about the 
performance of digital PET/ CT in the cli nical setting are still limited  (11). The first ever GE-
made digital PET/CT scanner worldwide will be installed in the Nuclear Medicine and 
Molecular Imaging Clinic. This novel digital PET/CT may allow for faster and higher quality 
images of the therapy agent distribution when compared to historical publishe d data from 
standard PET/CT.

2.3 Clinicaltrials.gov

2.4 Rationale  
Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a form of radiation therapy used in interventional 
radiology to treat cancer. It is used for selected patients with unresectable cancers, those that 
cannot be treated surgically, especially hepatic cell carcinoma or metastasis to the liver. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668314], there are currently no reliable me thods to demonstrate and quantify 
distribution of the treatment doses to the target lesion(s).  90Y PET/CT represents a 
technological leap from 90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT by [CONTACT_668319]. However, image acqu isition times are long and the 
resulting quality is suboptimal when using currently available PET/CT scanners.  However, the 
first ever GE -made digital PET/CT  scanner worldwide  will be installed in the Nuclear Medicine 
and Molecular Imaging C linic. This nov el digital PET/CT may allow for faster and higher quality 
images of the therapy agent distribution when compared to historical published data from 
standard PET/CT .

done  during their mandatory [ADDRESS_902653] while lying flat (due to closure device) , after their [ADDRESS_902654] period, or the next day after the participant’s SIRT procedure . We will administer 50mL of 
IsoVue [ADDRESS_902655]  additional radiopharmaceutical; instead, we will use the already administered 
90Y from SIRT. This is possible because the digital PET/CT has very sensitive PET detectors . 
A very small amount of radiation ( 5 mSv) will be given by [CONTACT_668323]/CT .

5.1 Modality or Modalities to be used  
 Digital PET/CT  
 
SRC Version 2 9 December 18 , 201 7 5.2 Details of Imaging (i.e. dynamic, static, number of scans, etc.)  
Patients will have 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging as part of the standard SIRT 
planning protocol. These images are acquired  after administration of 4 mCi of 99mTc MAA in 
the Interventional Radiology suite.  The patient will then be given 90Y Spheres (Glass or Resin), 
and after SIRT procedure, will be arrive  to NM for digital PET/CT image acquisition with 
diagnostic contrast  enhanced  CT of the abdomen . We will be administering 50mL of iodinated 
contrast through IV during the CT scan.  Next, PE T images will be acquired in 3D mode using 
a single bed located over the liver, with a t otal acquisition  time of approximately [ADDRESS_902657] iterative algorithm (OSEM, two 
iterative steps, 28 subsets), as well as a regularized reconstruction algorithm provided by [CONTACT_395930]. All images are reformatted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and viewed with 
the soft ware available in the Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinic (MIM Software, 
Cleveland, OH ). 
 
5.3 Details of processing/analysis  
The 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging and the PET/CT scans will be interpreted by 
[CONTACT_668324] . All investigators have  significant clinical 
experience  and will be blinded to the participan t’s medical history and the results of other 
imaging modalities. A consensus read will be obtained for each scan  to assess image quality . 
Each lesion wi ll be tabulated and a comparison of lesion detection and radiation absorbed 
dose by [CONTACT_186358].  
 
Currently , 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT images only simulate 90Y radiopharmaceutical 
biodistribution  within the liver and tumor(s) . Incorporating SurePlan software (MIM) to analyze 
the PET/CT images will determine final dose -volume histogram (DVH) within the liver and 
tumor (s) post 90Y injection . Additionally, 90Y PET/CT and 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT 
biodistribution images can be  compared to evaluate 99mTc MAA simulation accuracy. Results 
of this image comparison could potentially impact clinical decision -making moving forward . 
This information will be reported and shared with the referring physicians involved in the care 
of the p atient.  
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Criteria for Removal from Study  
The Protocol Director may withdraw subjects from the study for one or more of the following 
reasons: failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and/or study staff; 
determination that continuing the participation could be harmful to the subject; the study is 
cancelled or other administrative reasons.

8. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
8.[ADDRESS_902659] additional radiopharmaceutical; instead, we will use the already 
administered 90Y from SIRT. This is possible because the digital PET/CT has very sensitive 
PET detectors. There will be additional radiation from the contrast -enhan ced CT used in the 
research scan. This research study involves exposure to radiation from CT scans that is not 
necessary for participant’s medical care and is for research purposes only. The additional 
amount of radiation exposure is up to about 5.0 mSv, which is approximately equal to 10% 
of the limit that radiation workers (for example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] x -ray technician) are allowed to 
receive in one year. This amount of radiation involves minimal risk and is necessary to 
obtain the research information desired.  
There is a small volume (50 ml) of iodinated contrast to be given during the CT scan. This 
will require the introduction of an intravenous (IV) catheter. As with any IV catheter, there is 
some discomfort associated with introduction of the catheter. There can also be some 
redness and swelling associated with the catheter placement, but these will usually subside 
quickly. With the contrast injection, there is a risk of contrast extravasation (leakage) into the 
skin which can cause swelling an d mild pain. You will be offered a hot or cold compress to 
help mobilize any extravasated contrast, and if very severe, you would be offered the 
appropriate supportive care, which in rare instances includes transfer to the emergency 
room and surgical consu ltation.  
 
If there is any reason for you not to have the iodinated contrast, it will be omitted at 
physician discretion.  
 
 
 
SRC Version [ADDRESS_902660] radiopharmaceutical dose and 
route of administration (i.e., each dose will be double checked for dosimetry and quality by a 
researcher and technologist). Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4 .0.  Both 
Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and 
listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee 
will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpect ed according to the 
Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochures, and related to the 
investigation. For the purposes of this study, the reporting period ends at scan completion. 
There will be no follow -up procedures for this study. Adve rse events will be reported in 
adherence  to Stanford University’s internal Adverse Event SOP.  
 
9. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed an d approved 
by [CONTACT_55790].  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification 
and will be approved by [CONTACT_98900]. The Protocol Dire ctor will disseminate 
the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
 
9.2 Data Management Plan  
 
Electronic CRF’s and patient records will both be stored electronically using OnCore.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_902661] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) wi ll audit study 
related activities to determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the 
protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP).  This may include review of regulatory binders, cas e report forms, eligibility checklists, 
and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events 
and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human 
subjects.  Results of DSMC audits will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate 
regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
  
10. MEASUREMENTS  
 
10.1 Primary outcome measure  
 
We will evaluate the image quality of the lesions detected with the digital PET/CT scanner 
SRC Version [ADDRESS_902662]/CT.  
 
10.2 Measurement Methods  
 
We will use a 5 -point Likert scale to assess image quality.  
 
10.3 Measurement Time Points  
 
Images will be analyzed after completion of scanning and processing. Goal is to complete 
this within one month of acquisition.  
 
10.4 Response Review  
 
The 5-point Likert scale  will be determined by [CONTACT_668326], in a randomized order to avoid bias.  Two physicians 
will review all scans independently . Both scans of a given patient will be analyzed by [CONTACT_668327], then separately by [CONTACT_309860].  
 
10.5 Secondary outcome measure  
 
We will assess  the radiopharmaceutical distribution and dosimetry accuracy of 90Y PET/CT 
by [CONTACT_668328]  (if any) and numerical values calculated by 
[CONTACT_668329] 99mTc MAA SPECT/CT and 90Y PET/CT images.

11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1.  Statistical Design  
 
Single arm prospective study of paired imaging studies.  
 
11.2.  Randomization  
 
This study is to compare the images from two different scans: standard SPECT/CT and digital 
SRC Version 2 13 December 18 , 201 7 PET/CT and patients are scanned with both scanners. No randomization will be done.  
 
 
11.3.  Accrual estimates    
 
We expect accrual of [ADDRESS_902665] University . We plan to enroll 25 participants/year ( 33%) and this is easily 
achievable given our experience with other protocols.  
 
11.4.  Criteria for future studies  
  
 At this time,  there are no future stud ies planned beyond the initial 75 participants.  
 
11.5  Statistical Analysis  
 
Statistical analysis is not required for this study since the comparison is between two 
separate modalities with inherently different properties.

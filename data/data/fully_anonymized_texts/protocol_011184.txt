1) histological  or cytological diagnosis , or  
2) the EASL criteria  (the radiological presence of a liver mass greater than 2 cm, with arterial 
hypervascularity that is seen on two imaging modalities, within a cirrhotic liver, and in the 
presence of an alphafetoprotein (A FP) > 200 ng.mL will be used as an alternative diagnostic 
criterion )

Section 3.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
 Removed the term “unresectable”.  This is incorrect and is in several places throughout the 
protocol (pages 6, 23, 26, 31,    . As correctly desc ribed (page 22, section 2.2.1; page 44, section 
9.1.1 , page 26, Section 5.1 )patients with HCC, who are referred for cTACE may be enrolled. 
Therefore, patients who are being worked up for transplant, listed for transplant, or who may 
undergo resection in the future, but who are currently referred for cTACE, may be enrolled. This 
is clear in on page 44, Section 9.1.1, where we describe that should patient undergo surgery, we 
will obtain tissue to correlate with imaging findings.

[5/8/2017 ] Page 14 of 58 Statistical methods:  
This is a trial evaluating Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780479]. A sample size of 60 
(HCC  (n=30)  and metastatic disease  (n=30) ) will allow for data collection and analysis to assess Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780480] .  
Objective 1: Explore whether Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780481].  
 Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780482] 1 to 100 and (on the 24h non -contrast CT) will be 
also categorized by 4 ordinal levels : ≤25%, >25 -50%, >50 -75%, >75%.  
Percent lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780483] (obtained from non-contrast CT) will be correl ated with RECIST 
response separately using contrast CT, MRI and PET imaging.  The Spearman’s rank correlation 
coefficient will be used with RECIST response categories  (CR, PR, SD, PD) , and Pearson’s  correlation 
coefficient will be used  for the % change  in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions (reference 
is baseline) . The strategy is to assess which of  the imaging modalities correlate most closely with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780484].  
 
Correlation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780485] (on the non-contrast CT) will be correlated with MRI response utilizing the 
EASL and qEASL amendment (necrosis).  
Exact percent of  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780486] (on the  non-contrast CT) will be correlated with apparent diffusion 
coefficient (ADC)  and with volumetic response  using Pearson’s product -moment correlation.  
Objective 2: To assess 6 -month survival following therapy with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780467]. Survival will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_33480] -Meier method  to compare the progression free survival acro ss the 4 ordinal Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780487].

[5/8/2017 ] Page 17 of 58 1. Introduction  
1.1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world and represents more than 
5% of all cancers.  Approximately 500,[ADDRESS_1072889]  cause 
of cancer -related deaths  [1-3].  There are wide geographical variations in the incidence of the disease 
with the highest rates in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_780488].  However, the incidence of HCC is 
increasing in North America and Europe [4]. 
Untreated HCC carries a poor prognosis and is directly related to degree of underlying cirrhosis and 
tumor stage.  Early detection offers the only possibility for cure.  Patient survival is generally not more 
than 6 months in patients with large tumor mass  and advanced cirrhosis.  Patients with small HCCs (< 
5cm diameter) and stable liver function have a better prognosis with 2 -year survival rates of 56% [5]. 
HCC is now responsible for 14,000 deaths annually in the [LOCATION_002].  It is generally accepted that 
surgical resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation  are the only curative treatments for 
patients with early stage HCC.  The shortage of donor livers further diminishes liver transplantation as a 
viable option for many patients.  The majority of HCC patients (approx 85 -90%) are not candidates for 
curative treatments either due to poor liver function or the presence of advanced disease.  These 
patients are treated with palliative treatments.   
Chemotherapeutic agents (eg. doxorubicin) can be infused directly into the systemic circulation but 
patients who rec eive this treatment suffer serious side effects that may be life threatening (eg cardiac 
toxicity), pain, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppresion and alopecia.  For those patients able to receive 
systemic chemotherapy, response rates ranged from 15% to 20% and h ave had virtually no impact on 
survival.  
These factors, combined with local pattern of disease dissemination, have made local interventional 
therapy the cornerstone of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment for unresectable disease and patients 
who are not eli gible for transplant.  
1.2. Hepatic Metastases from Solid Tumors  
There are many solid -organ malignant tumors (colorectal carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic 
endocrine tumors and other, non -colorectal non -neuroendocrine tumors) for which cure is not pos sible 
with current systemic agents.  Many of these tumors are found to have already metastasized to the liver 
at the time of diagnosis or eventually metastasize to the liver despi[INVESTIGATOR_780489]# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page [ADDRESS_1072890] common site of metastases from colorectal carcinoma 
and is a frequent metastatic site for pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET), neuroendocrine tumors (NET) 
and other tumor types.  Overall, the largest risk factor for the development of hepatic metastase s is the 
stage of the primary tumor (colorectal carcinoma) or the size of the primary tumor (NET, PET).  In 
hepatic metastatic disease, the most important prognostic factor is the percent of liver replaced by 
[CONTACT_20150].  If allowed to grow and disseminate with in the liver, metastatic deposits become the dominant, 
and often, the most life -threatening feature of the metastatic disease, either through progressive 
hepatic failure or production of excess endocrine products that produce potentially lethal systemic 
consequences (NET, PET).  
Due to the relative sensitivity of the liver to radiation, external beam radiation has had limited utility in 
treating hepatic metastatic disease.  Modest improvements have been achieved in the treatment of 
metastatic colorectal can cer using new combination regimens of systemic agents; however, most 
patients ultimately fail first -line therapy either based on lack of efficacy or inability to tolerate further 
courses of treatment.  A number of new, non -radiation based liver -directed th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_780490].  These treatments also may produce serious morbidity that adversely impacts 
patient quality of life, and can resu lt in life -threatening complications and adverse events.  
In summary, the status of clinical management of patients with metastatic disease involving the liver has 
experienced modest improvements over the past [ADDRESS_1072891] become the mainstay of therapy of patients with unr esectable HCC. 
These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209590] (alcohol, acetic acid) and thermal (radiofrequency ablation, 
microwave, laser, etc) ablative techniques, as well as intra -arterial chemotherapy treatments.   Intra -
arterial therapi[INVESTIGATOR_780491].   
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 19 of 58 Of those, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely performed procedure for 
patients with unresectable HCC.Transart erial chemoembolization (TACE) involves the periodic injection 
of a chemotherapeutic agent, mixed with an embolic material, into selected branches of the hepatic 
arteries feeding a liver tumor, thus combining chemotherapy administration with intra -tumor is chemia.   
The rational for TACE is that the infusion of drugs such as doxorubicin, mitomycin c and cisplatin 
suspended in an oily medium followed by [CONTACT_780543] g greater delivery of the chemotherapy to the tumor 
and thus causing necrosis of the tumor.  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_209592] -arterial 
administration of the chemotherapeutic agents. The advantage of TACE is that higher concentrations of 
the drug can be delivered to the tumor with decreased systemic exposure compared with systemic 
chemotherapy. TACE has been shown to deliver up to 400 times the intra -hepatic concentration of 
chemotherapy in comparison to intravenous administration depen ding on the chemotherapeutic agent 
[6].  As such, tissue levels of chemotherapy within the tumor were found to be [ADDRESS_1072892] administraton [7-9]. 
TACE achieves partial response in 15 – 55% of patients [10-16] and significantly de lays tumor 
progression and vascular invasion [12, 16].  Recently two studies have reported survival be nefits for 
chemoembolization in selected patients [16, 17].  The best candidates for chemoembolization are those 
with preserved liver function and asymptomatic multinodular tumors without vascular invasion or 
extrahepatic spread.   
Currently, there are no randomized clinical trials demonstrating the superiority of an y one 
chemotherapeutic agent; thus, any of the following agents are currently being used: doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) or 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine ([ADDRESS_1072893]) [5, 10, 11].  Embospheres® is usually 
used as th e embolic material.   
The impact of TACE on survival has been assessed through numerous prospective and retrospective 
studies. Two recently published randomized prospective clinical trials have shown a statistically 
significant survival advantage for TACE compared to symptomatic treatment.  The first trial, which 
utilized cisplatin, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753], and gelatin sponge particles in 80 Asian patients, showed one -, two - and 
three -year survival rates of 57%, 31%, and 26% in treated patients compared to 32%, 11%, and 3 % 
(respectively) in control patients treated with best available supportive care, giving a relative risk of 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 20 of 58 death of 0.49 (CI, 0.29 – 0.81) [18].  A second trial performed in Europe also showed a survival benefit in 
highly selected patients using Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753], doxorubicin, and gel foam [15].  A recent meta -analysis 
confirmed the findings of the two randomized trials published by [CONTACT_780544] a  selected group of patients, namely those 
with good performance status [14].  Based on those and other studies , chemoembolization is currently  
the standard of care for patients with intermediate stage HCC and has been included since 2006 as part 
of the official guidelines for the treatment of patients  with HCC (by [CONTACT_635438] (AASLD) , as well the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) and European 
Association of the Study of the Liver (EASL).  
TACE has also been used with success in secondary unresectable hepati c malignancies.  
1.3.1.  Colorectal Metastases  
The only chance of cure for patients with liver metastases from colon carcinoma is resection. 
Unfortunately, fewer than 30% of patients have resectable disease [19]. Even in optimal resection 
candidates, recurrence is frequent, with a 5 -year survival rate of only 35%. Negative predictors of 
survival include a short interval between diagnosis of the colonic primary tumor and the liver 
metastases, number of metastases,  carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 10 ng/mL, extrahepatic 
disease, and the ability to obtain a negative resection margin [20]. 
The maj ority of patients with hepatic metastases from colon cancer undergo systemic chemotherapy. 
There are a variety of novel chemotherapeutic agents are being used to treat metastatic colorectal 
cancer. Cytotoxic agents such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin, as we ll as the monoclonal antibodies 
cetuximab and bevacizumab, have shown promising results in early trials. Combination therapy with 
bevacizumab in addition to irinotecan, 5 -fluorouracil, and leucovorin has improved survival to a mean of 
20.3 months [21]. Similar survival was identified with addition of oxaliplatin to 5 -fluorouracil and 
leucovorin [22] However, even with these agents, progressive disease, particularly in the liver, occurs at 
a mean of 9 –[ADDRESS_1072894] been reported by [CONTACT_780545]. Patients enrolled in these trials are usually individuals in whom systemic 
and/or intraart erial infusion chemotherapy has failed. Abramson et al [23] devised a spreadsheet model 
to determine cost -effectiveness thresholds for palliative chemoembolization for colorectal metastases. 
A mean survival time of [ADDRESS_1072895]-effective method of treatment. Lang  et al [24] used a 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 21 of 58 combination of superselective segmental and selective lobar injections of a doxorubicin/iodized oil 
emulsion in the treatment of 46 patients. The actuarial survival rates were 68% at 1 year and 37% at 2 
years. In the study of Sanz -Altamira et al [25], [ADDRESS_1072896] 
chemoembolization procedure was 10 months. A number of prognostic factors predictive of longer 
survival were identified. Pati ents with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 
or 1 had a median survival of 24 months, versus 3 months among patients with a performance status of 
2. Patients with extrahepatic disease at the time of initial chemoembolization had a median survival of 3 
months, versus 14 months for those with isolated liver metastases. Among patients with good 
performance status and no extrahepatic disease, the survival rates were 73% at 1 year and 61% at 2 
years after chemoembolization. In the stud y of Tellez et al [26], [ADDRESS_1072897] chemoembolization and 29 months from diagnosis. In a study by [CONTACT_780546] [27], 
51 patients u nderwent chemoembolization with cisplatin, doxorubicin, mitomycin - c, iodized oil, and 
polyvinyl alcohol. Actuarial survival rates from diagnosis with liver metastases were 86%, 55%, and 23% 
at 1, 2, and 3 years, with a median of 24 months. Outcomes in pat ients with isolated liver metastases 
who were treated with chemoembolization by [CONTACT_780547] [28] were similarly encouraging, with a mean 
survival time of [ADDRESS_1072898] -effective method of treatment for patients with good performance status and 
disease isolated to the liver.  
1.3.2.  Ocular Melanoma  
The liver is the initial site of metastatic disease in approximately 50% of patients with ocular melanoma 
[29]. More than 90% of patients with metastatic ocular melanoma will develop liver metastases [30]. 
When liver metastases develop, involvement is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_780492], with median survival 
times of 2 –6 months [29]. A review of a variety of treatment methodologies in 201 patients by [CONTACT_780548] [31] demonstrated longer survival with chemoembolization versus any other treatment method, 
including intraarterial and systemic chemotherapy, leading th e authors to state that patients with 
isolated liver metastases from ocular melanoma should undergo hepatic arterial chemoembolization as 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 22 of 58 a primary therapy. Mavligit et al [32]reported 30 patients treated by [CONTACT_780549]. There was one complete response at follow -up imaging, and 
46%  of patients had a partial response (50% tumor destruction at follow -up imaging). Median survival 
time was 11 months (14 months for patients whose disease responded vs 6 months those who showed 
no response), with an actuarial survival rate of approximately  33% at 1 year.  
1.3.3.  Neuroendocrine Tumors  
Embolization has an established role in the palliation of these hypervascular tumors and typi[INVESTIGATOR_780493] -free intervals in 90% –100% of patients. Two reports that initially evaluated 
chemoembolization of neu roendocrine tumors [33, 34] found a duration of response after 
chemoembolization of nearly 2 years. Brown et al [35] describ ed objective responses in 96% of patients 
treated with hepatic arterial embolization without chemotherapy. Treatment for pain as the primary 
indication had less -durable results (6.2 months) than when embolization was performed for hormonal 
symptoms with or  without the presence of pain (16 –17.5 months). Gupta et al [36] reported outcomes 
in 81 patients treated with embolization alone (n _=50) or chemoembolization ( n =31). The time to 
symptomatic progression after arterial therapy was 19 months and the mean survival time for the 
patient group was 31 months.  
1.3.4.  Sarcoma  
Mavligit et al [37] reported major regression of metastatic leiomyosarcoma in 10 of 14 patients treated 
with cisplatin/ gelatin sponge chemoembolization followed by a 2 -hour vinblastine infusion into the 
hepatic artery, with a median duration of response of 1 year. Disease in 10 of 16 patients treated with 
cisplatin, doxorubicin, mitomyci n-c, iodized oil, and polyvinyl alcohol particles by [CONTACT_780550] [38] showed 
a response, with extensive tumor necrosis on computed tomography in all cases. Three patients became 
candidates for surgical resection after treatment. Because systemic chemo -therapy and radiation 
therapy are ineffective against metastatic sarcomas  in the liver, chemoembolization  appears to be the 
most effective treatment for unresectable disease.  
1.3.5.  Cholangiocarcinoma  
Burger et al [39] reported a median survival of 23 months after chemoembolization in 17 patients with 
unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. Two patients had their disease down -staged enough after 
chemoembolization to become resectable. Historic survival for patients with unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma is  5–[ADDRESS_1072899] limited survival rates of 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 23 of 58 20% –56% at 3 years. Complication rates for this group [39] were in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_780494]. Chemoembolization appears to be a viable treatment option for well -compensated 
patients with unresectable ch olangiocarcinoma.  
1.3.6.  Other Metastases  
Liver metastases from lung, breast, pancreas, stomach, small bowel, kidney, bladder, thymus, ovary, or 
thyroid tumors, as well as those from unknown primary tumors, have been treated with 
chemoembolization [40-42]. The published reports lump together patients with different tumor types, 
making interpretation of the results difficult. Overall, mixed metastatic lesions treated with 
chemoembolization are associated with a 60% –75% objective response rate and median patient survival 
times of 8 –[ADDRESS_1072900] -embolization syndrome in the majority of patients, consisting of 
varying degrees of pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. This is independent of chemotherapeutic drug use, 
reason for embolization (eg, bleeding, tumor), and the organ treated (eg, liver, kidney, spleen, uterus). 
With current medical care (eg, hydration, antiemetic therapy, and pain control), post -embolization 
syndrome is well -tolerated, and 50% of patients can be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780495]. The average length of stay is 1.5 days. Liver function is transiently affected with an 
increase in liver aminotransferase levels. These values usually peak 3 –5 days after therapy and return to 
baseline levels by 10 –14 days after embolization. There is no sustained degradation of liver function in 
properly selected patients who do not meet the well -established exclusion criteria for hepatic artery 
occlusion, even  in the presence of cirrhosis [43]. Because most of the injected drug is retained in the 
liver, systemic toxicity is minimized, with little bone marrow suppression. The cumulative toxicity is far 
more limited than is experienced with systemic chemo -therapy, which requires protracted drug 
exposure for an indefinite period of tim e. Treatment related complications occur in approximately 10% 
of performed procedures, with mortality rate around 2% [44]. 
Serious adverse events occur after approximately 5% of chemoembolization procedures. The most 
common serious adverse events are liver abscess or liver infarction, which occur in approximately 2% of 
cases each. The 30 -day mortality rate is 1% [45-47] [48]. 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 24 of 58 Constitutional Symptoms.  The postembolization syndrome consisting of transient abdo minal pain, ileus, 
fever and malaise affects 60% to 80% of patients receiving TACE.  Prophylactic antibiotics are not 
routinely administered as the fever is a predictor of treatment response.  This fever is a result of tumor 
necrosis initiated by [CONTACT_780551]. 
Gastrointestinal Side Effects and Complications.  Transaminases commonly rise 10 fold.  Patients may 
develop ischemic cholecystitis, hepatic abscess or biliary strictures.  Additionally, a minority of patients 
will develop nausea/vomiting and ascites.  
Endocrine Complications.  Some patients may develop symptomatic hypothyroidism as a result of 
retained iodine load.  
Hematologic Complications.  Some patients may develop a leukemoid reaction.  Bone marrow toxicity is 
uncommon occurring in less than 4% of p atients and includes neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  A 
small cohort of patients has developed gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a result of TACE therapy.

Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780499].  Besides its opacifying properties, it acts as 
both an embolic agent and a carrier of chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor.  
 When injected  into the hepatic artery, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780500] [ADDRESS_1072903] on small tumor vessels [49]. 
 In TACE, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780501] a vehicle to carry and localized chemotherapeutic agents inside a tumor.  
When the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780502] a vessel supplying the tumor, the drug remains 
in high concentrations within the tumor for a prolonge d period [49].  
 Because Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780503] a contrast agent and remains within the tumor, the areas of treated tumor are 
easily identified  using radiographic imaging . 
In TACE procedures for HCC treatment, an emulsion is formed by [CONTACT_780542][INVESTIGATOR_780504] i njected intra -arterially through the hepatic artery to produce avascularity and 
infarction/necrosis of the tumor. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780505].  This techniqu e also allows for targeted 
delivery of the cytostatic drug inside or close to the tumor and a prolonged intra -tumoral residence time 
secondary to the iodized oil, leading to a prolonged local action and reducing systemic effects of the 
cytostatic drug [50, 51].  As a whole, the therapeutic action of chemoembolization results from 
prolonged drug action and infarction [52]. Some authors have shown that tumor cytostatic drug 
HIC# [PHONE_16283] Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd . IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page [ADDRESS_1072904] are several thousand -fold higher than plasma drug concentrations 
[51]. In addition, during the process, the tumor is untouched from direct instrumentation or surgical 
manipulation that potentially may lead to tumor cell dissemination [50]. 
The efficacy of concomitant use of ethiodized oil and TACE procedures has been generally recognized for 
more than [ADDRESS_1072905] which Ethiodol  is considered the agent of choice for this purpose as it is avidly taken up and 
retained for long periods of time by 85% of HCCs [51, 52].  Ethiodol selectively remains not only in larg e 
tumors but also in smaller intrahepatic metastases  [35, 52]. 
 
1.5.2.  Safety/Adverse Events  
Possible side effects of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780506] -procedure and gastrointestinal disord ers 
(nausea, vomiting or diarrh ea). In patients with an iodine deficiency, there is a risk of hyperthyroidism 
(symptoms include weight  loss, accelerated heart rate,  increased intestinal transit rate, anxiety, 
insomnia, etc.).  Additionally, there is a risk of an allergic reaction.  Patients with a history of allergic 
reactions to iodinated products are premedicated prior to a TACE procedu re as per standard of care.

1.6. Rationale

[CONTACT_780556] , cisplatin, mytomycin -c 
within the tumor bed.  There are three established purposes of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780510]:

[5/8/2017 ] Page 27 of 58 (1) the ability to see where the chemotherapy is being delivered during the procedure, (2) to provide an 
embolic effect to the feeding vessel of the tumor, and (3) to provide a vehicle for the chemotherapeutic 
agent.  
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_140566] 25 years of clinical experience with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780511], the role of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780512] , especially its potential use as an imaging biomarker of tumor response .

be cons idered as a valid  imaging biomarker of successful tumor treatment.  This hypothesis  will be tested 
by [CONTACT_780557] (DCE -MRI, PET -CT, and CT) before and at multiple time

2.1. Objective s 
2.1.1.  Primary Objective  
 To determine whether Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780517] a valid  imaging biomarker of successful drug 
delivery to liver tumors and of tumor response to therapy.  
2.1.2.  Secondary Objective  
 To estimate  6-month survival following therapy with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780467].  
 
2.2. Endpoints  
2.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
 RECIST /EASL /qEASL  response, separately using contrast CT, MRI and PET, as an indicator of 
success of tumor response to therapy  
o RECIST /EASL /qEASL  response  will be based on  the percentage  change from baseline  of 
the diameter of the specific target lesion identified at basel ine (RECIST)/ the percentage  
change in the viable tumor area of the specific target lesion identified at baseline (EASL ).  
The response scale is 0 -100% for decrease/ (opposite sign) 0 -100% for increase.  
RECIST/EASL /qEASL  response  categories (CR, PR, SD, PD) , will be based on the percentage change 
from baseline  of the diameter of the specific target  lesion identified at baseline (RECIST)/the 
percentage change in the viable tumor area /volume  of the specific target  lesion identified at 
baseline (EASL /qEASL ). The analytic  strategy is to measure the association between baseline 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780518].    Separate 
analyses may be performed for each measurement time point for the  respective  imaging 
modal ities.

[5/8/2017 ] Page 39 of 58 6. Adverse Event  Collection  and Reporting Requirements  
6.1. Definitions  
6.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical o ccurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory 
finding, for e xample), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product  (refer to ICH E6 GCP Guidance 
– section 1.2) . 
6.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
A Serious AE (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  produces any of the following 
outcomes (refer to ICH E6 GCP Guidance – section 1.50) : 
 Results in death ; 
 Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the even t; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe) ; 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE  
below for exceptions) ; 
 Results in persistent or significa nt disability/incapacity ; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital anomalies/birth defects must 
also be reported on the Pregnancy Supplemental Form) ; 
 Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be imme diately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed  in the definition above.). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
 
J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 40 of 58 NOTE:  
The followin g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure ; 
 Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy) ; 
 Medical/surgical admission fo r purpose other than remedying ill health state and was planned 
prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases ; 
 Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires n o medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care -
giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative).  
6.1.3.  Non -serious A dverse Event  
A non -serious adverse event is any adverse events  not classified as serious  (as described  in previous 
section) . 
6.2. Adverse Event C oding  
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1072919] access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0.  
 Attribution of the AE:  
o Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
o Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
o Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
o Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
o Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
6.3. Adverse Event Capture and Reporting  
6.3.1.  Routine Adverse Event Capture and Reporting  
The collection of all AE information begins at initiation of investigational product and continues during 
the clinical study until  [ADDRESS_1072920] TACE on study.  
Because Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780521] 20 years, 
targeted data collection is appropriate.  
Adverse event data that will be collected  and reported : 
J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 41 of 58  All serious adverse events, deaths, and events that lead to s tudy discontinuation  
 Unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
 Grade [ADDRESS_1072921] vital organs (heart, liver)  
 Data for all subject withdrawals  
 
Adverse events should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or repo rted as SAEs if they become 
serious. Follow -up is also required for AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of investigational 
product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. Subjects with AEs at study 
completion should receive  post -treatment follow -up as appropriate.  
All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate AE page of the Case Report Form 
(CRF).  
6.3.2.  Serious Adverse E vent Capture and Reporting  
ALL serious adverse events, regardless of causality must  be reported to the following entities:  
o IND Sponsor  
o IRB (per the IRB’s reporting requirements)  
o FDA (if PI [INVESTIGATOR_780522]/IDE)

event. Each telephone call or fax transmission should be directed to the FDA department that is  
responsible for the review of the IND.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  15 Calendar -Day Written IND Safety Report to FDA  
The Sponsor -Investigator is required to notify the FDA, and all participating investigators (as applicable), 
in a written IND Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected adverse event considered by [CONTACT_1034] -
Investigator to be possibly related to the use o f Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780523] [ADDRESS_1072925] learning of the 
event.  
A serious, unexpected adverse event deemed possibly related to the use of an investigational study drug 
is any adverse drug experience of which the specificity or severity is not consisten t with the current 
investigator brochure, the general investigational plan, or elsewhere in the current application, as 
amended, and results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death (report first as a 7 -day telephone/fax report);  
 life-threatening adverse d rug experience (report first as a 7 -day telephone/fax report);  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 or is an important medical even t that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780524] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with 
[ADDRESS_1072926] learning of the 
event. The FDA prefers these reports be documented on a MedWatch 3500A Form, but alternative 
formats are acceptable (e.g., summary letter).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Follow -up Reports  to FDA  
All follow -up information concerning IND Safety Reports should be submitted to the FDA as soon as 
possible  (and no later than [ADDRESS_1072927] for more information) .

[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory T est Abnormalities  
All laboratory test values captured as part of the study should be recorded on the appropriate 
laborator y test results pages of the CRF. In addition, the following laboratory abnormalities should also 
be captured on the non -serious AE CRF page or SAE paper CRF page as appropriate:  
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE ; 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780525] ; 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentional ingestion of any dose of a product that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an 
SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
Sexually active women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective m ethod of birth control 
during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized.  
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation and the potential risk factors fo r an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign 
an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
All WOCBP MUST have a negative serum pregnancy test [ADDRESS_1072928] they 
may be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
preg nant or may have been pregnant at the time of the investigational product exposure, the 
investigational product will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner. Exceptions to the 
investigational product discontinuation may be considered for life -threatening conditions only after 
consultation with the sponsor or as otherwise specified in this protocol. The investigator must 
immediately notify the sponsor of this event, record the pregnancy on the SAE form. Initial information

the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome must be reported. Infants should be followed 
for a minimum of 8 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other S afety Considerations  
Any significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x -rays, 
and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_990], 
should also be recorded  on the appropriate non -serious AE or SAE page of the CRF.

patients will be evaluated approximately 1, 3, and 6 m onths (Days 30, 90, and 180)  following the last 
TACE (after the operator determines that a  lesion has been fully treated).  Response will be assessed in 
two different ways: (1) the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) criteria  and (2)  
Euro pean Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria for assessment of response to loco -
regional therapy [2]. 
 
PET-CT scan of Lesions  
Response to PET -CT will be assessed for measurable disease by [CONTACT_780560].  A baseline 
PET-CT will be performed before treatment begins.  For the purposes of this  study, patients will be 
evaluated approximately [ADDRESS_1072931] TACE (after the operator determines that a lesion 
has been fully treated), then 12 weeks after that ( Days 90 and 180 ).  Response will be assessed in per 
lesion (see below).  
 
CT sc an of Lesions  
Response to contrast enhanced CT will be assessed for measurable disease by [CONTACT_780559].  A CT will be performed before treatment begins.  For the purposes of this study, patients will be 
evaluated approximately [ADDRESS_1072932] TACE (after the operator determines that a lesion 
has been fully treated), then 8 weeks after that, and finally 12 weeks after that (Days 30, 90 and 180).  
Response will be assessed in per lesion (see below).  
 
7.2. Guidelines for Evaluation of Meas urable Disease  
MRI Response Criteria: Evaluation of Lesions (RECIST  Criteria)  
 Complete Response – Complete disappearance of all target lesions.  
J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page 46 of 58  Partial Response – At least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target 
lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD.  
 Stable Disease – All other cases.  
 Progressive Disease – At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target lesions, 
taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
 
MRI Response Criteria: Evaluation of Lesions (EASL Criteria)  
 Complete Response – Complete disappearance of all viable tumoral  area and no new 
lesions.  No new lesions may evolve during a 4 week period after initial documentation of 
response.  
 Partial Response – Greater than 50% reduction in viable tumoral area of all measurable 
lesions via uptake of contrast.  
 Stable Disease – All other cases.  
 Progressive Disease – Greater than or equal to 25% increase in tumoral area of one or more 
measurable lesions or the appearance of new lesions.

9.1. Statistical Considerations  
9.1.1.  Analysis Sets  
 Safety analysis set: all enrolled patients who complet ed at least 1 TACE 
procedure  
 Full analysis set: all enrolled patients  
 Per Protocol analysis set: all enrolled patients who complete the study and have 
no protocol deviations  
 Modified Intent -to-Treat analysis set: all enrolled patients who complete all of 
their required pre-TACE , Day 0, and Day [ADDRESS_1072933] -Day 1 imaging exam.  
9.1.2 . General Statistical Methods  
 Type I error = 0.05 and will be 2 -sided; 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
 Summary statistics : For continuous measure s, descriptive statistics  will include the 
mean, standard deviation, min, median, max. For categorical measures, counts and 
proportions will be presented.  
 missing values : No imputation for missing val ues will be performed. ,  
 There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons  in any of the planned analyses. .  
 Diagnostic analyses will be conducted to assess if non -parametric statistical methods 
should be used in lieu of the parametric methods.  
Addition al analyses may be performed , as appropriate , by [CONTACT_780562].  
9.2. Sample Size Justification  
A sample size of 60 (HCC  (n=30)  and metastatic disease  (n=30) ) will allow for data collection and analysis 
to assess Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780530]. This sample size is based on feasibility and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_584699]. Operating characteristics were analyzed  using PASS software  (56)  to estimate the 
effect size that can be detected with this sample size.  A sample size of 60 achieves 80% power t o detect 
a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 35 with a two -sided significant level of 0.05. The sample size of 30 
will allow for detecting a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.49 in each subgroup. Similarly, for 
Spearman correlation, the minimum detec table correlations are 0.36 and 0.51 respectively , assuming a 
bivariate normal distribution .

variable on a scale of 0 -100, in addition to being categorized into  4 ordinal levels : ≤25%, >25 -50%, 
>50-75%, >75%.  
 
Percent lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780483] (obtained from 24h non -contrast CT , scored from 0 -100) will be 
correlated with percent RECIST response , separately using contrast C T, MRI and PET imaging , and 
reported separately for each time point .  The Pearson product -moment correlation will be used to 
measure the strength of the association , and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
 
Exact percent of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780486] (on  the non-contrast CT , scored from 0 -100) will be correlated 
with percent necrosis as reported on pathologic examination  (if the patient goes on to hepatic 
surgical resection  or transplantation ; the percent necrosis of the lesion on a scale of 0 -100) using 
Pearson’s product -moment correlation ,  and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.   
 
Percent lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780483] (obtained from 24h non -contrast CT, scored from 0 -100) 
will be correlated with percent EASL response, separately using contra st CT, MRI and PET imaging, 
and reported separately for each time point.  The Pearson’s product -moment correlation will be 
used to measure the strength of the association, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
 Exact percent of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780531] n (on the non-contrast CT , scored from 0 -100) will be 
correlated with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) [53, 54] and with volumetic response 
[54, 55]using Pearson’s product -moment correlation.  and 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated. Two correlations will be measured  
 The percent tumor ADC (scored from 0 -100) as demonstrated on contrast MRI will be 
correlated with percent lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780486].  
 The percent tumor volumetric response (scored from 0 -100) as demonstrated on 
contrast MRI will be correlated with percent lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780532].

J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page [ADDRESS_1072935] be conducted at a minimum of 
every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  The Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitroing Committee (DSMC) auditing schedule includes a 100% review of the first 2 subjects, 
with a subsequent review schedule to be determined after but will include submission of safety dat at a 
minimum of every 6 mo nths.  In addition, a detailed monitoring plan will be established with the Yale 
Center for Clinical Investigation to assure comprehensive protection of the rights and safety of all 
subjects and the quality and integrity of the data.  During the review pro cess, the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_780536], require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. The principal investigator, the IRB or Yale Cancer 
Center DSMC  have the authority to s top or suspend the study or require modifications.  
Given the now established safety and validity of the current Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753] -TACE procedure in our prior work, 
and experience with the combined co -administration of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_780537], we do not view the proposed 
studies as high risk.  Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, 
the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur 
since it is not possible to predict with certa inty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, a plan for monitoring the data and 
reporting on the safety of the study has been detailed in above sections.   Monitoring will be performed 
in coordination with YCCI.  
 
10.2. Records to be Kept  
10.2.1.  Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
As used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) refers to either a paper form or an electronic 
data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and 
should be completed for each included subject.  
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and 
reporting of all clinical, safety, laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms. 
All CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_093] t o verify that the data contained on the CRFs is accurate. Any 
J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page [ADDRESS_1072936] be dated, initialed and explained (if 
necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
Usually, source documents are the hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's subject medical chart. In these instances 
the data collected on the CRFs must match the data in the corresponding charts. A CRF, or part of the 
CRF, may also serve as a source document.  
10.2.2.  Record R etention  
To enable inspections and/or audits from regulatory authorities and the trial Sponsor, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (i.e. information to link 
records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed  consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], 
serious adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls 
reports). The records s hould be retained by [CONTACT_780564]’s policies, FDA’s 
regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator is unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the require d period 
(e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor should be prospectively notified. The study records must be 
transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another investigator, another institution, or 
to the Sponsor. The investigator mus t obtain the trial Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of 
any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
 
11. Ethics  
11.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study p rotocol, protocol 
amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitment 
advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB. All IRB correspondence should be retained in the 
Investigator File.  
11.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study w ill be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, adopted by [CONTACT_780565] (1996). In addition, the study will be conducted in accord ance with the protocol, the 
J12115 Study Protocol; Schlachter, Todd  IND # 116,739  
[5/8/2017 ] Page [ADDRESS_1072937], or his/her legall y acceptable representative, is 
fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed 
consent from each subje ct or the subject's legally acceptable representative before any study -specific 
activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent form.

1.1 Purpose:  
The overarching goal of this study is to advance research on family -based 
prevention of negative child outcomes for reintegrating Operation 
Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom personnel by [CONTACT_894785] a parenting program, After Dep loyment, Adaptive 
Parenting Tools/ADAPT. The ADAPT program is based upon the Parent Management Training -Oregon Model/PMTO, but adapted for military 
deployed families. We will examine which of three delivery formats of ADAPT is most effective at reducing yo uth risk behaviors associated with 
negative childhood outcomes by [CONTACT_894786], child, and parent adjustment.  There is a clear intent to benefit all subjects in this study 
(except surveyed teachers), including children.   
We will conduct a three -group, two -site randomized trial to test the 
comparative effectiveness of ADAPT delivery approaches. The study will 
randomly allocate 360 NGR families to one of three conditions: (i) group-based web -enhanced ADAPT; (ii) individualized web- facilitated ADAPT; 
or (iii) self -directed web ADAPT.  
Thus, specific aims are as follows:  
1. Conduct a three -group, two- site randomized trial to test the comparative 
effectiveness of ADAPT delivery approaches  
a. Families will complete a pre -intervention baseline assessment an d 
post-intervention follow -up assessments at 6, 12-  and [ADDRESS_1253830] the generalizability of ADAPT effectiveness across three delivery 
approaches using intent to treat (ITT) analyses  
a. Test the value -added impact of group- based delivery relative to 
facilitated and self -directed web approaches  
b. Comparative effectiveness will be tested by [CONTACT_312424] a non -
equivalence hypothesis for group based and individualized facilitated relative to self -directed web only  
We hypothesize that (1) individualized web- facilitated parenting 
intervention will be equally effective as the group -based web -enhanced 
intervention, and (2) both individualized and group- based ADAPT will be 
more effective than a self -directed web -condition. Effective internet 
delivery methods wil l facilitate development of new approaches to engage 
military families separated by [CONTACT_894787], isolated by [CONTACT_5871], and in need of strategies to deal with deployment and 
reintegration stressors, directly addressing limitations and barriers to 
access to evidence based prevention programs.

 Page 7 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 Analysis of Aim 1: ADAPT comparative effectiveness hypotheses will be 
tested using standard normal theory Analysis of Variance and multiple 
regression techniques in structural equation modeling (SEM) with a focus 
on growth curve analyses for follow up data. We will specify analyses to 
test Hypothesis 1: NGR families in both the ADAPT group -based 
condition and the ADAPT web- facilitated condition will show greater pre -
post improvements in observed parenting, and parent, child, and couple 
functioning relative to the self -directed web condition; and Hypothesis 2: 
ADAPT group -based condition will be equally effective as the 
individualized ADAPT web- facilitated condition.  
Analyses for Hypothesis [ADDRESS_1253831] Analysis of Variance and structural equation modeling 
(SEM) growth curve analyses for the long -term follow up. For the 
immediate pre -post analyses we will conduct a 3 group by 2 repeated 
measures Analysis of Variance for parenting, child, and couple 
functioning constructs focusing on the comparison of change across the Group Based, Individualized Facilitated, and Self -directed ADAPT 
conditions. The study randomly allocates 360 NGR families across the 
three conditions (n = 120 per group). For the 6 -month assessment, we 
estimate a projected 5% attrition rate and over the 24- month follow up we 
expect roughly 15% attrition. In two prior PMTO randomized trials with intensive multiple -method family assessments, family retention was 88% 
and 86%, respectively, at 30- month follow -ups [2, 12]. In both of those 
studies, there were no differential rates of attrition between intervention 
and controls, there was less than 5% attrition by [CONTACT_135409] [ADDRESS_1253832] assessment, an d less than 15% attrition by [CONTACT_941] 24 month 
assessment. Using an alpha level of .05 and considering 5% attrition over 
the first [ADDRESS_1253833] 
SD = 1, and between groups SD = .71; the study is powered .[ADDRESS_1253834] (ES = .12), small time effect (ES = .15), and small group effect (ES = .21) for given 
parenting, child, couple or parent constructs.  
Follow Up Analyses. For the intent to treat (ITT) analyses of lon g term 
follow up, we will specify latent growth models (LGM) recommended for 
long term effectiveness designs involving maximum likelihood SEM. 
LGMs have become more standard because they more reliably assess 
change. Growth models combine individual and group levels of analysis, 
taking into account mean growth and individual variation. Fixed effects 
(e.g., random assignment to ADAPT, parent and child gender) and time -
varying random effects may be estimated using chronometric time 
weights. A model specifying an initial status latent variable (assessing 
variance in BL differences) and a linear slope latent variable (estimating 
individual differences in change over time), would be specified using 
factor weights of 1, 1, 1, 1, for the respective repeated measures , and 
factor weights of 0, 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1253835] step in LGM is to

 Page 8 of 38  Revis ed: May [ADDRESS_1253836] that the Group Based effec t (β1 > 0) and the Web Facilitated ( β2 
> 0) will show greater 2- year improvements relative to Self -Directed. For 
the LGM in Figure 2 we estimated power using Mplus Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 replications. An advantage of this approach is the ability  to incorporate specific patterns of expected attrition over time. For 
the figure in Figure 3, contrasts for Group Based and Web Facilitated were fixed at a mean of .33 and variance of .22 representing the random allocation across groups. The latent initia l status intercept and latent 
growth factors were specified reflecting a commonly observed ratio of 5:1 
for the variance components (Initial Status ѱ 2 = .5 and SD = .70; and 
Linear Growth ѱ2 = .1, SD = .31). The effect size (ES) is then the ratio of 
group contrast mean differences in the latent growth factor divided by [CONTACT_894788]. A sample size of 306 (cumulative attrition of 15% over 2 
years, specified as .05, .10 and .15 over time) obtained power of .[ADDRESS_1253837] small effects (ES=.10 ) for β [ADDRESS_1253838] whether ( β1 = β2) for the paths shown in Figure 
2. First, using the same model specification shown in Figure 2, we will 
further specify equality constraints in the LGM model to directly compare the relative magnitude of β [ADDRESS_1253839] (i.e., a test of equivalence) for the intent to treat growth 
slope factor means and variances for the respective parenting, child, couple, and parent adjustment constructs; hypothesizing no differences between the Group Base d and Web Facilitated conditions. We used the 
non-inferiority module in the Power Analysis and Sample Size program 
for the equivalence test of means using two one -sided tests for two groups 
of 102 (Group Based and Web Facilitated). The study is powered .82 using a .05 one -sided alpha when the reference mean = 1 and the 
comparison mean = 1, and the range of difference still results in the 
conclusion of equal means when the comparison group is plus or minus a 
quarter of a standard deviation of the reference m ean (± .25 SDs). Finally, 
we will also examine dosage, participation, and variation in fidelity as potential moderators of group intervention effects.

 Page 9 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
Combat deployment and related challenges are family stressors, associated 
with more negative parent -child interactions, ineffective and coercive 
parenting practices and lower levels of parenting satisfaction (e.g. Glenn et al.,2002; Jordan et al., 1992; Sa mper, Taft, King, & King, 2004). 
Disrupted parenting practices are well -known predictors of risk for child 
adjustment difficulties that are precursors to youth substance use, including behavior problems, school failure, deviant peer association, and depres sion (Patterson & Fisher, 2002; Sanders, Cann, & Markie -Dadds, 
2003). These child adjustment problems can contribute to continuing parental stress, increasing parental distress, and further disrupting 
parenting (DeGarmo & Forgatch, 2004).   
2.2 Preliminary Data:  
With funding from NIH, the first adaptation of PMTO for military families was 
initiated by [CONTACT_120852], and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial/RCT of [ADDRESS_1253840] and Reserve/NGR families with preliminary effectiveness.  Known as After Deployment, Adaptive Parenting Tools/ADAPT, the program is a 14 -week group -
based parenting intervention with an online supplement. ADAPT addresses issues specific to deployment and combat stressors, enhances ecological validity by [CONTACT_894789], and addresses psychological and environmental barriers to accessing services. In addition to PMTO skills, ADAPT adds a mindfulness and emotion coaching component based on the hypothesis that the immediate reactivity and suppression of emotions 
learned on the battlefield may spi[INVESTIGATOR_894769], leading to dys -regulated emotional interactions that increase family coercion. Preliminary 
data show improved parenting practices, mindfulness, parenting efficacy, and couple adjustment for ADAPT compared with controls (Gewirtz, 2013). The After Deployment, Adaptive Parenting Tools/ADAPT study is the only military parenting study of school -aged children to date  with preliminary evidence from an 
RCT. We propose to address existing gaps in access to services by [CONTACT_894790]- person, online, and telehealth. 
2.3 Existing Literature : 
PMTO is a well -established empi[INVESTIGATOR_894770] (SIL, Patterson, 
Chamberlain & Reid, 1982).  Similar to family stress and stress amplification 
models (e.g., E lder Jr, Van Nguyen, & Caspi, 1985), SIL posits that parenting 
mediates the effects of family stressors on child adjustment. That is, deployment 
and related stressors would be expected to impair social interactional patterns, leading to increases in coerci on, decrements in positive parenting, and increased 
risk for child maladjustment.  PMTO interventions have demonstrated efficacy

 Page 10 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 and effectiveness, showing benefits for children including reductions in behavior 
problems that are precursors to substance use , actual substance use, and 
internalizing problems, as well as increases in social competence and school 
adjustment (for a comprehensive overview see Forgatch & Patterson, in press). 
Moreover, recent findings indicate that strengthening parenting practices  
contributes to improved outcomes for parents themselves (Patterson, Forgatch, & 
DeGarmo, 2010). 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:  
This study is a three -group, two- site, randomized controlled effectiveness trial 
with baseline  and three follow -up assessment points. 
ADAPT Intervention Delivery Conditions. Prior grant funding has enabled the 
development of two modes of ADAPT delivery: group- based (with web 
enhancement) and web -only (self -directed). Group- based ADAPT includes 14 
face-to-face parent group sessions with two facilitators plus access to the ADAPT 
web enhancement (7 mini -modules that consolidate skills learned in group). Web-
only ADAPT provides additional web materials for a total of 10 modules covering all the topi[INVESTIGATOR_894771]. The web products run on a dedicated site hosted through IRIS’ online service, using standard web platforms that can be accessed via computers, tablets, or smartphones. Each module contains the following: (a) Video -driven lessons, (b) Intera ctive assessments, (c) Interactive mastery 
exercises, (d) and Printable Resources. Activities in each module take [ADDRESS_1253841]/wrong way lessons, and interactive learning exercises (e.g., quizzes). In the facilitator -enhanced condition we propose to augment the web- only ADAPT by 
[CONTACT_894791] (i.e. Google Hangout, enabling an ADAPT facilitator to guide families through the program in weekly video call meetings).  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): NA  
4.0 Study Intervention (s)/Interaction (s) 
4.1 Description:  
Group- based ADAPT. Groups will meet weekly (excluding holidays; we 
conservatively estimate 3 sessions/month) for 120 minutes, at a time convenient to participants (usually early evening). Dinner and childcare are provided, and each family is receives $10 per session to cover transportation costs. (c) Group content. Groups cover core ADAPT/PMTO topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: 1.Program introduction; identifying strengths in military families; reintegration -related stressors. 2. 
Promoting cooperation through use of effective parental directions. 3. Parents as effective teachers: teaching strategies using contingent positive encouragement. 4-5. Observing emotions and regulating emotions: recognizing and regulating

 Page 11 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 emotions, specific emotions, differentiating  between parents’ and children’s 
emotions; regulating emotions; strategies to cope with deployment-  and combat -
related stressors (e.g., PTSD, injury, separation stressors, renegotiation of family 
roles). 6. Setting limits and 7. Following through: establis hing family rules and 
strategies for use of negative sanctions that are consistent, contingent, mild, and non-corporal. 8. Communicating with children: active listening skills; family 
meetings, and responding to children’s anxiety; emotion coaching.  9. Fa mily 
Problem Solving: strategies to anticipate and address stressors, problem family situations, and plan positive family activities. 10. Managing conflict: builds upon 
sessions 4, 5, 8, and 9 to manage family and other relationship conflicts; 11. 
Monitori ng children’s activities: keepi[INVESTIGATOR_894772]; tracking children’s whereabouts, peers, transportation. 12. Promoting school success; incorporates material from sessions 2, 3, 8, 9, and 11 with focus on positive involvement in academic development at home and at school; 13. Building skills: reinforces and integrates skills from earlier sessions with emphasis on emotional regulation, emotion coaching, decreasing coercive interactions and emphasizing positi ve parenting practices.14. 
Balancing work and play focuses on couple and family relationships and supports 
participants in developi[INVESTIGATOR_894773]. Sessions begin with a 5 -10 minute 
mindfulness practice; attention to deployment issues are addressed in each  
session. Home practice assignments reinforce skills learned in the group. Participants have access to the ADAPT website to reinforce and consolidate skills 
learned in group. Facilitators will offer referrals for other services as needed (e.g., 
PTSD) to VA and other mental health providers.  
ADAPT Self Directed Web. In the self -directed web -only ADAPT condition, 
participants have access to the full ADAPT website (10 modules, online discussion forum) but do not have access to a ‘live’ in- person facilitator. 
Participants are directed to the first ADAPT session, and as each session is 
completed (all materials in a session opened by [CONTACT_570696]) families 
receive a personalized congratulations email and thank you gift card with directions to continue to the next module. Participants may see the entire program 
on the ADAPT dashboard; they are encouraged to proceed in the specified order. 
Each online session consists of a skills video (demonstrating a specific skill), a 
practice video (modeling how parents pr actice skills with child(ren), 
downloadable summaries of key skills, fillable PDF forms with home practice 
assignments, a knowledge quiz, and downloadable mindfulness exercises that can 
be played directly from the ADAPT site as well as from smartphones, ta blets, and 
computers.  
ADAPT individualized web- facilitated.  This condition comprises access to the 
full ADAPT web program as described above, with augmentation of individual 
facilitator web support (i.e. the facilitator connects via Google Hangout). 
Facilitators meet with families at a mutually convenient time weekly (10 -14 
weeks, approximately 3 sessions per month). Sessions cover the same topi[INVESTIGATOR_894774], but the material is tailored for families and sessions are shorter (1 hr vs 2 hrs)  to reflect the pace of teaching skills to individual families

 Page 12 of 38  Revis ed: May [ADDRESS_1253842] for each individual session 
and as a reference for home practice assignments. For example, in session 2, 
‘Giving Effective Directions’, the facilitator introduces the family to effective and ineffective directions via role play (as in ADAPT groups), refers the family to the 
online skill video, and provides live (Hangout) role play practice with parents. 
The facilitator explains and shows parents the online home practice assignment. 
Facilitators will offer referrals for other services (e.g. individual therapy for 
PTSD) to VA and other community mental health providers, as needed.  
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design:  
This study is a three -group, randomized control effectiveness trial with baseline 
and three follow -up assessment points.  
5.2 Study Procedures:  
1. Eligible participants will complete a brief contact [CONTACT_33655], followed by [CONTACT_894792], benefits and the possibility of being randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: group- based ADAPT (G), web -only/self -directed ADAPT (W), or 
individualized web- facilitated ADAPT (F).  In reintegrating families with two at-
home partic ipating parents/caregivers, each will complete a separate informed 
consent. 
2. Consenting participants will be provided a contact [CONTACT_894793] [INVESTIGATOR_894775]. Families requesting a telephone screening will be asked for ver bal consent for the team to maintain contact [CONTACT_894794]. Informed consent may also be completed at the in- home assessment.  
3. Participants who submit informed consents will automatically be directed to log in to the BL assessment by [CONTACT_894795] a password. Participants who lose their password can automatically retrieve it from the system. Upon logging in, participants will be given the onl ine portion of the BL 
assessment. The BL online assessment includes self -report measures to be 
completed by [CONTACT_625516]. The assessment package takes approximately 45 minutes to complete; upon completion each participant is 
compe nsated $25 (per assessment completed; up to two per family). A [ADDRESS_1253843] staff are scheduled. 
Families who do not complete the online assessment can complete the assessment by [CONTACT_894796] h ome visit.  In order to increase the T1 completion rate, 
families may be offered a $[ADDRESS_1253844] been used to schedule the baseline a ssessment.  
 4. In-home assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_625517] -trained graduate 
research assistants with experience conducting home assessments using similar measures [3]. Assessors will schedule home visits to complete child assent and 
PROTOCO L TITLE:  Comparing Web, Group, and Telehealth Formats of a Military

VERSION DATE: May 4, 2018  
 Page 13 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 assessments with the target 5 -12 year old child, and complete parent -child 
observational tasks, and adult measures (approximately 100 minutes total). 
Families who prefer assessment outside the home may go to the local UMN or UM project office.  
 Note: Child care is of fered to families for the siblings that are not participating in 
the research. In the event that child care staff are not available we will offer families a $[ADDRESS_1253845] stipend to provide their own child care during the in -home 
assessment.  
 
5. Teachers will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (at each time point) via secure, encrypted email, 
with an explanation of the study, and a copy of the parent’s release of 
information. They will be directed to the study website to complete questionnaires. Teachers not responding will rec eive materials by [CONTACT_2319], with 
follow -up calls.  Teachers who do not want their compensation may choose to give 
the gift card back to ADAPT or to MCEC.  
 6. Following BL assessment, participants are electronically given random 
assignment to the G, W, or F stud y conditions, with 120 families assigned to each 
condition. The group condition will be run in three cohorts, with 2 groups of up to 
10 families in each cohort of 20 families (up to 60 families in each of the two sites 
– i.e. 120 total, considerably more t han we estimate will participate). In both 
online conditions, families may participate as they enter the study. However, given the necessity of running groups in cohorts and the need for equivalence in 
analysis, we will also assign individuals in the web c onditions to a cohort. 
 
7. Participants in the Group (G) condition will be assigned to a 14- week ADAPT 
facilitator -led group. Groups will be organized as follows: (a) Orientation. The 
group facilitator will provide a telephone orientation to the program to: 1) provide 
program information, 2) address any potential barriers to participation, and/or concerns about group attendance, 3) provide information about features and limits 
to confidentiality within intervention groups, and 4) direct attention to the 
ADAPT website and the consent for intervention form. The facilitator will explain 
information will be confidential except when harm to self or others is expressed, or child maltreatment reporting is mandated. Facilitators will describe the 14 
week ADAPT group and the web -enhancement component, will encourage group 
participation of both parents/ caregivers in the home in 2- caregiver families, and 
will troubleshoot barriers to group participation. (b) Logistics and locations.  
Sessions will begin as soon as the group is full. Five to ten families (up to 20 
individuals) will participate in each group. Two groups will be offered in each 
cohort. Groups will be facilitated by [CONTACT_894797], all of whom 
have previously delivered successful ADAPT or PMTO g roups for mothers and 
fathers with high retention and satisfaction. We are currently training a cohort of VA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and Michigan community mental health professionals in ADAPT, and these individuals will join our current ADAPT facilitator team of 14 
individuals based in MN. The 14 week ADAPT group interventions will take

 Page 14 of 38  Revis ed: May [ADDRESS_1253846] selected community locations (e.g., 
schools, libraries) rathe r than VA or Armories to reduce concerns about the 
stigma of services, to normalize the ADAPT groups as health promotion, and to 
ensure proximity to homes.  
 
8. Participants assigned to the web -only (W)/self- directed condition will be 
instructed to log in to the ADAPT website. The website will offer a short (10 
minute) introduction to the program, as well as an informed consent form to 
participate. Then, participants will be given access to the ADAPT dashboard 
(program content list) and instructions on goin g through the components.  
 9. Participants in the facilitator -enhanced (F) condition, will be have an ADAPT 
facilitator who will provide a telephone orientation to the program. Orientation calls will 1) provide program information, 2) address any potentia l barriers to 
participation, 3) provide information about features and limits to confidentiality, and 4) direct attention to the ADAPT website and the consent for intervention form. During this call, the facilitator will show parents how to log in to the 
ADAPT website. The website will offer a short (10 minute) introduction to the 
program, and an informed consent form to participate in the program that parents 
complete and submit online. The facilitator will inform participants that 
information is confident ial except when harm to self or others is expressed, or 
child maltreatment reporting is mandated. Facilitators will describe the 14 week ADAPT program and the website, encourage participation of both 
parents/caregivers in the home in 2- caregiver families. Throughout the [ADDRESS_1253847] BL (after all conditions are completed), all participants will 
be contact[CONTACT_894798] T2 assessments on the study

Sources of Materials  
• Research material obtained from human subjects will consist of data collected 
specifically for this study.  
The data will include: 
1. Web -based questionnair es filled out by [CONTACT_50634]  
2. Observational coding data based on videotaped parent -child interaction 
tasks completed by [CONTACT_50634]  
3. Short questionnaire packets filled out by [CONTACT_894800]  
4. Short surveys and web conference calls completed by [CONTACT_894801].  
5. Audio and video tape of parent’s response to KidVid (video of parenting 
tasks)  
Measures and Assessments:  
There are 4 assessments: Time 1 - baseline (BL, prior to start of the intervention), 
Time [ADDRESS_1253850] BL (post -intervention, given 4- 5 month intervention at 3 
sessions/month, allowing for holidays, etc), Time 3-  [ADDRESS_1253851] 
year, (BL, 6, and 12 months) to gauge intervention effects i mmediately at posttest 
(i.e., T2) and at T3, which is when parenting and teacher report outcomes 
indicated change in prior studies. All measures (i.e., child, parent, and teacher 
report, and direct observations) will be gathered annually (T1, T3, T4), ensu ring 
that teachers are different at each assessment.  At T2, only parent report data will 
be gathered, online, (no in- home assessment) to minimize participant burden in 
Year 1, and because in prior studies observed parenting and teacher report 
outcomes indicated change at [ADDRESS_1253852]. Child self -report measures will be gathered (and 
were standardized with) children over age 8. Measures are summarized below:  
Parenting practices: (i) Observations. Parent(s) and child participate in a Family 
Interaction Task (FIT) comprising five separate tasks lasting a total of [ADDRESS_1253853] successfully used the FIT in our current ADAPT and prior 
PMTO studies with less than 5% refusals. Coder ratings yiel d reliable and valid 
measures of parenting practices with short - and long -term predictive validity for 
child and parent outcomes. Tasks include planning a family activity, two, [ADDRESS_1253854] issues; three 
game/t eaching tasks, discussion of an emotional deployment cycle issue from 
Deployment Issues Checklist; and a monitoring task. Families are debriefed to 
address any concerns or questions.  
Parent -child interactions are scored using validated Coder Impressions. The 
ratings yield three primary constructs: positive parenting (family problem- solving,

discipline/non- contingent parenting) and emotion socialization. Scale scores yield 
reliable Cronbach alphas (ranging from .74 -.92) and interrater reliabilities in the 
70% range [12- 13]. (ii) Self -report. Alabama Parenting Questionnaire. The APQ 
is a widely measure of parenting practices, with three subscales: Positive 
Parenting, Inconsistent Discipline and Poor Supervision. The 9- item scale has 
been validated in military and community samples, and has validity in distinguishing parents of children with and without behavior disorders.   
Child adjustment and substance use. Child adjustment wil l be assessed with the 
Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children (BASC -2; teacher, parent, and child 
self-report, a system assessing broad domains of externalizing problems, 
internalizing problems, and adaptive skills. Items are rated on a 4 -point scale. 
Gender-specific normative scores are provided in the form of T -scores. Parents 
use the parent version of the BASC2 (BASC2- PRS; (alphas = .80- .87); teachers 
use the Teacher Report Form (BASC2 -TRS; alphas = .85- .89). Child intentions 
and use of substances will  be assessed using self -report for children in 5th grade 
and up, given sensitivity of questions, and given data suggesting that some children begin experimenting with substances at this age: in a study of 2300 
students, 16.1% of 5th graders, and 29.4% of 6th graders reported ever having 
used alcohol. Tobacco use will be assessed with 6 items reflecting tobacco use 
behavior (ever taken a puff, smoked a whole cigarette, current smoking, α =.84) 
and intentions to smoke; α =.78 [17]. Alcohol Use Intentions and Be havior Scale. 
This [ADDRESS_1253855] year, month, week, heavy 
drinking (5+ drinks in past 2 weeks), ever having been drunk, and intentions to drink if offered by a friend, in the next month, in high school and as an adult (scale range 9 -49; α =.82). The combined scale and two subscales (Alcohol Use 
Behavior and Alcohol Use Intentions) have adequate internal consistency and 
test-retest reliability. Child distress will be measured using the Children’s 
Depression Inventory [19], a 27- item symptom- oriented summative index (e.g., "I 
am sad," "nobody loves me") that has been repeatedly shown to correlate highly with similar measures of depression and to distinguish between clinical and non-
clinical samples. Since the CDI is designed to b e sensitive to change over time, 
test-retest reliability varies between .38 and .87 depending on the sample and the 
time interval being used. PTSD Reaction Index is a 20- item child interview 
assessing posttraumatic stress reactions; the child is asked to e ndorse how 
frequently each reaction occurs on a four -point scale. Scores are strongly 
associated with diagnostic measures of PTSD. Child peer adjustment will be 
measured using a 16 -item scale assessing loneliness and dissatisfaction with peer 
relations. It ems include "I have nobody to talk to," "I don't have any friends," and 
"It's hard to get other kids to like me." The Describing Friends is a measure of 
deviant peer association  – a summative index of five items scored true of false. 
Items are child repor ts of friends’ deviant behavior (e.g., my friends get into 
fights, clown around, get into trouble, do not like schoolwork, find schoolwork 
too hard). Childhood exposure to stressful and traumatic events will be collected using the Children Lifetime Events questionnaire previously and successfully 
used in the original ADAPT study. These questions will be collected at T4 only.

developed by [CONTACT_265012] a reliable screen fo r excessive 
drinking, validated in over two decades with multinational samples and deemed effective for early identification in military populations. Cut- off scores of 8 show 
adequate sensitivity; scores between 9 -10 are suggested for heavy drinking 
popula tions (e.g., veterans). Parent mindfulness is assessed using the Five Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire/FFMQ, a 39 -item questionnaire with five subscales 
(observing, acting with awareness, non- judging, and non- reactivity). Questions 
are on a 5 -point Likert s cale; α  = .72- .92. Difficulties in Emotion 
Regulation/DERS is a 36 -item questionnaire assessing six domains of adult 
emotion dys -regulation: non- acceptance, avoidance, difficulties in impulse 
control, lack of emotional clarity, and awareness. Items are on a 5 -point Likert 
scale ( α = .94). Working memory: Operational Span (OSPAN) requires 
individuals to remember an unrelated sequence of 3- 7 letters while solving 
arithmetic problems; total OSPAN working memory is the sum letters recalled in correct sequence. Data with military personnel show change following intervention. 
Parenting stress and support: Parenting Stress Index -Short Form  (36 items, 
alphas>.90), assesses extent to which parents feel burdened by [CONTACT_894803], and 
satisfaction with their relationship  with their child. Receipt of Help (5 items), 
developed for the National Survey of Families and Households, assesses the 
numbers of persons available for practical help (e.g., baby[CONTACT_35061], transportation); 
one or less indicates very low support.  
Participa nt satisfaction with intervention uses two 10- item measures: (i) Group 
satisfaction questionnaire completed at the end of each session. A principal 
components factor analysis of the 10 parent ratings of satisfaction (e.g., info provided was helpful, leader  seemed to understand me, enjoyed group) obtained a 
single factor solution for intervention group (eigenvalue = 5.60 explaining 56% of the variance) ( α = .91). (ii) An online user satisfaction measure will be completed 
at the end of each online module to a ssess 1) stimulation, 2) comprehension, 3) 
acceptability, 4) ownership, 5) persuasiveness, and 6) support.

ethnic identity for parents/children; employment, income, date(s) and numbers of 
deployment. Deployments will be assessed from three questions to obtain information about the extent of respondents’ deployment history.  Combat 
exposure will be measured with the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory 
(DRRI), an ecologically valid instrument for assessing risk and resilience factors 
among military personnel participating in recent and current deployments. Extent and nature of combat injury (5 items) will be assessed using an adapted assessment from the National Veterans Readju stment Study designed for

and the possibility of being randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: group- based ADAPT (G), web -only/self -directed ADAPT (W), or 
individualized web- facilitated ADAPT (F).  In reintegrating families with two at-
home participating parents/caregivers, each wil l complete a separate informed 
consent. 
Consenting participants will be provided a contact [CONTACT_894793] [INVESTIGATOR_894775]. Families requesting a telephone screening will 
be asked for verbal consent for the team to maintain co ntact through reminder 
emails and phone calls as needed to complete informed consent and BL online 
assessments. Informed consent may also be completed at the in- home assessment.  
Participants who submit informed consents will automatically be directed to lo g 
in to the BL assessment by [CONTACT_894795] a password.  
Attrition and Enhancing retention:  We expect attrition to be 5 -20%, based on 
current study data, and have calculated power accordingly.  
 
Assessors in all conditions will use retention tools successful in this and other 
stressed populations: 1) Families give contact [CONTACT_841652] 3 
friends/family members. 2) Parents receive pre- stamped cards with study address 
and receive $20 for providing their new address. 3)  We provide study updates in 
newsletters, and bi -yearly mailings. We will use evidence -based strategies for 
enhancing retention. To encourage assessment completion we will compensate 
participants. To enhance participation in group (G) activities, we will hold two drawings at each session: group start for timeliness, group end for home practice completers, for small prizes (e.g. chocolate; journals; stress balls). In W and F 
conditions, participants will receive small online gift cards for participation and 
online completion ($10 per module completed). We will hold groups at 
convenient times for families (e.g, early evening hours), include meals for participants, and onsite childcare. Transportation stipends and free parking will be 
provided. If increasing re cruitment numbers become a challenge, w e will offer a

12.5 Payment:  
Subjects will be compensated utilizing  Target (or similar) gift cards for 
assessment activities as follows: 
Effectiveness trial participants (N=360 families) will be paid $50 for in- home 
assessments at baseline and 12 months, and  $[ADDRESS_1253872] -baseline; 
children will be provided a small gift valued at $5. Each adult completing an 
online assessment (at baseline, 6, 12, 24 months), up t o 2 adults per family, will 
be compensated $25 per assessment.  2 parent families who complete all surveys 
and in- home assessments can make up to $400 and 1 parent families can make up 
to $300. 
Families randomly assigned to the face -to-face group intervent ion (N= 120 
families) will be compensated $10 for each group session attended to offset travel 
costs, as well as an additional $[ADDRESS_1253873] two online 
assignments per module (14 maximum). Small prizes will be distributed at each 
group ses sion for attendance and homework completion. Full participation would 
entail 14 sessions and result in a $210 incentive per family.  
Families randomly assigned to the online -facilitated intervention (N= 120 
families) will be compensated $5 per one -hour sess ion with a facilitator, as well 
as an additional $[ADDRESS_1253874] two online assignments per module (140 maximum). Full participation would entail 140 sessions and result in 
a $1400 incentive per family.  
Families randomly assigned to the onli ne-only intervention (N= 120 families) will 
be compensated $[ADDRESS_1253875] two online assignments 
per module (140 maximum). Full participation would entail 140 sessions for each 
parent and result in a $[ADDRESS_1253876] the potential to be compensated up to $610, and single parent families have the potential to be compensated up to $510. 
Teachers will be compensated $15 for completing yearly assessments (at baseline, 
12, and 24 months)  
Compensation w ill be provided along the way as subjects complete each in- home 
assessment and online surveys, and each week as they complete either the in-
person groups or the online modules.

13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Participants will be involuntarily withdrawn from the study in the event of their 
death or the target child or in the case of a parent’s loss of custody of the target child.  
13.[ADDRESS_1253877] awal Procedures:  
If a participant voluntarily withdraws from the study there is no further data 
collection and data collected prior to their withdraw date will not be analyzed.  
13.3 Termination Procedures:  
Data that is already collected from p articipants who  are withdrawn  without their 
consent (as described in 13.1), will still be used unless they explicitly request that 
we do not.  
14.0 Risks to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Participation in this research involves minimal risk, defined in the Federal guidelines as “the probability and magnitude of harm anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.” (Federal Register, 1991, 45CFR 46.102(i). Procedures are in place to minimize risk of violation of confidentiality, as indicated below. If the study child or participating caregiver discloses information regarding child abuse or threat to self or others, prof essionals are mandated to report the information to appropriate 
authorities; this information will be clearly stated verbally and on the consent forms. It is not likely that participants will experience physical, social or legal risks due to enrollment in the study because state mandated procedures exist to protect them. There are no financial risks to participants.  Procedures are in place for providing suitable informed consent, clearly describing the assessment activities, emphasizing the voluntary natur e of the study, and communicating the 
purpose and use of the data collected. These procedures are intended to minimize participant’s misunderstanding of or dissatisfaction with the research.  
For informed consent, all letters/online instructions will clearl y state that 
participation in this study is voluntary, that the participant’s relationship with their employer, the NG, and the University of Minnesota will not be adversely affected regardless of whether or not they decide to participate. It will be clear ly stated in 
written form and verbally expressed in person that participants may withdraw from the study at any point without any consequences to themselves or these relationships. The consent process will clearly indicate that all information 
gathered fro m participants will be kept confidential and de -identified for all

study.  
 Teachers:  
• At each assessment point, wor k designated contact [CONTACT_894807]. Teachers will be contact[CONTACT_432747], encrypted email, with an explanation of the study, 
and a copy of the parent’s release of infor mation. They will be directed to the 
study website to complete online informed consent and study questionnaires. 
Teachers not responding will receive materials by [CONTACT_894808] -up calls.  
 Effectiveness Trial Family Participants:  • We will create and d istribute recruitment flyers to our partners (MN NG, MI 
NG), providing a study website URL and phone number. We will recruit families 
in close collaboration with the MN, MI, ND, and WI NG, by: (a) postings on the 
NG websites, (b) flyers and pamphlets at ar mories and announcements via email, 
(c) attending NG family support groups, family readiness academies, and Yellow 
Ribbon family reintegration training.  
 • To manage study participation and administer online measures, we use a secure 
web site (Qualtrics, separate from the training site) that maintains extremely 
stringent levels of encryption and data storage while also providing flexible 
design options, and sophisticated data management and collection features. The 
website guides parents to a brief explana tion of the project, and a description of 
project confidentiality and its limits. This website will be accessible to project 
staff so that they can track participant progress and provide support when needed. Given the focus on technology use to enhance out reach and access, as well as 
minimize researcher intervention, participant screening and informed consent 
(adult only) will take place online, unless participants specifically request this 
process to be accomplished by [CONTACT_648].  
 
• Interested participants will be directed to an anonymous online screening 
instrument. This screen determines eligibility based on the inclusion criteria

change or be adversely affected regardless of whether or not they choose to 
participate in the study.   
 
• The voluntary nature of participation and the ability to withdraw from the 
project at any time without penalty will be emphasized. In reintegrating families 
with two at- home participating parents/caregivers, each will complete a separate 
informed consent. 
 
• Consenting adult family participants will be provided a contact [CONTACT_625494] [INVESTIGATOR_625464]. Families who request a 
telephone screening (e.g., families whose internet is not accessible at the time of 
the call) will be asked for verbal consent for the research team to maintain contact [CONTACT_894810] r eminder emails and phone calls as needed to complete informed 
consent and baseline (BL) online assessments. Where informed consent is not completed prior to the home visit, it may be completed at the beginning of the in -
home assessment.  
 
• Child Participan ts: The informed consent process for child participation will be 
conducted during the in- home assessment process.  The study, procedures, and 
tasks of the study will be explained to both the parent and the child.  Both child assent and parental consent for ms will be presented to the family and explained.  
The research staff conducting the informed consent process will ask each child to explain the study process in their own words to assure that they understand what 
is being asked of them and what they will be asked to do (e.g. answer questions, 
play a game with their parents, be willing to be video -taped while playing the 
game).  Research staff will ask both the parent and child, separately and directly, 
if they have any questions or concerns about the study .  It will be stated very 
directly to the child that no one will be angry or upset with them if they decide not to participate in the study and that they can change their mind or ask more questions at any time during the study.  Once the research staff has  been able to 
ascertain that both the child and the parent understand the procedures of the study 
and what the child will be asked to do, written signatures will be requested from 
the parent and child on both the Child Assent form and the Parental Consent form.  
 
Families will be provided with a copy of all consent forms they have signed. 
The following consent forms will be obtained from participants:  
 a. Adult consent for participation in the clinical study (all family adults screened for participation in the clinical study)  
b. Parental consent for child’s participation in baseline and follow -up assessments 
(all parents of children in the study)  
c. Chi ld Assent Form for participation in baseline and follow -up assessments (all 
children in study)  
d. Adult Consent to release observational assessment video data (all families)  
e. Teacher consent to participate in study ( teachers of targeted child only)

risks to privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data, and assess their likely 
effectiveness.  
 • Potential risk #1 (discomfort with assessment procedures) and #2 (discomf ort in 
disclosing sensitive information: Safeguards. Participants may choose not to answer questions or not to participate in particular assessment components. Participants have the right to withdraw from this program at any time. All 
research staff receiv es training in building rapport with participants and skillful 
interviewing in order to minimize discomfort and embarrassment. Each study 
participant receives a verbal and written description of the study. If a staff 
member determines that a participant’s reading skills are limited, all materials will 
be presented verbally and questionnaires will be administered as an interview. Informed consent is received from the legal guardian(s) of all children participating in the study and children will be asked to a ssent through a Child 
Assent form. Participants are advised of their right to withdraw from the project at any time. Experienced research staff members are available at all points of the 
study process to answer questions and to make the data collection as easy as 
possible for families.  
 
• Potential risk #3 (violation of confidentiality in accordance with mandatory 
reporting requirements): Safeguards. To prevent violation of confidentiality, 
reporting requirements are limited to the mandatory nature of these  requirements. 
Participants are informed verbally and in the consent document that professional 
staff are required by [CONTACT_894811], physical injury to any child caused by [CONTACT_894812], or any case where the professional suspects a child is 
being neglected. The consent document also states that staff will inform parents or guardians if, in the judgment of professional staff, their child (under age 18) is in imminent danger of attempting to kill him or herself.  
 
• Potential risk #4 (violation of confidentiality): Safeguards. Extensive procedures 
are in place to prevent confidentiality violation and errors resulting from data processing. We will complete and  submit an application for a Certificate of 
Confidentiality to provide further protection of our study participants and our data. Participants are assigned a coded identification number that is used on all 
data collection measures. Identifying information necessary for participant 
contact, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers are kept in locked 
filing cabinets or in our secure participant database. Access to the online database 
is restricted to those with valid usernames and passwords and limited  to those 
staff members whose jobs require use of this information for contact[CONTACT_280245]. Individuals using this database receive unique and identifiable 
usernames and passwords. Relational database passwords must be changed on a regular basis. All s taff members are required to close password -protected 
applications or lock their workstations when they are away from their desks.

15.1 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception: NA  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
16.1 Potential Benefits:  
Families will benefit from receiving prevention services from well -trained and 
well-supported group facilitators. Families will have increased possibility of 
experiencing significant improvements in their child’s adjustment as well as delay and prevention of substance use and abuse.  Families will be compensated for their participation in assessments.  The web -enhancement will give families 
access to an online training platform which allows already overburdened parents to balance the demands of work and family with their commitment to improving their par enting skills and fostering optimal development for their children.  
Additionally, participating in a parenting program designed specifically for the families of reintegrating military personnel will reduce the psychological barriers to help- seeking for th is high -risk population.  In light of the considerable personal 
and public costs associated with compromised parenting, the potential benefits of participating in this study greatly exceed the potential risks.  
17.0 Data Management  
17.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
Descripti ve analyses will be computed to determine the usability and 
acceptability of the delivery formats. We will examine family demographics, included age and gender of parent(s) and child(ren), as well as family structure. We will also compute descriptive analy ses on the 
recruitment data, including the number and percentage of families expressing interest in the study, time to recruit families, the percentage of families screened who meet inclusion criteria. We will also examine retention data including weekly a ttendance, participants completing home 
practice assignments, as well as their reasons for absences or drop out.  
Complex long -term follow up analyses will also be computed. We will 
employ standard normal theory pre -post Analysis of Variance and 
PROTOCO L TITLE:  Comparing Web, Group, and Telehealth Formats of a Military

VERSION DATE: May 4, 2018  
 Page 30 of 38  Revis ed: May 4 , 2018 structural  equation modeling (SEM) growth curve analyses. For the 
immediate prepost analyses we will conduct a 3 group by 2 repeated 
measures Analysis of Variance for parenting, child, and couple functioning constructs focusing on the comparison of change across the  
Group Based, Individualized Facilitated, and Self -directed ADAPT 
conditions. 
For the intent to treat (ITT) analyses of long term follow up, we will specify latent 
growth models (LGM) recommended for long term effectiveness designs [110] involving maximum likelihood SEM. Fixed effects (e.g., random assignment to 
ADAPT, parent and child gender) and time  varying random effects may be 
estimated using chronometric time weights. A model specifying an initial status 
latent variable (assessing variance in BL differences) and a linear slope latent 
variable (estimating individual differences in change over time), would be specified using factor weights of 1, 1, 1, 1, for the respective repeated measures, and factor weights of 0, 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1253881] characterizes patterns of growth. We can also specify an additional nonlinear quadratic factor, a higher order polynomial function to capture any nonlinearity. Accelerated or decelerated change would be specified 
with loadings fixed at 0, 1, 4, and 16. A sequential set of models tests the latent 
variances and model fit across a random intercept, linear growth, and quadratic 
model to determine the optimal growth pattern [113].  
17.2 Power Analysis:  
sing an alpha level of  .05 and considering 5% attrition over the first [ADDRESS_1253882] SD = 1, and between groups

(ES = .21) for given parenting, child, couple or parent constructs.  
17.3 Data Integrity:  
Site coordinators and the project manager will oversee assessment technicians and conduct quality control checks regularly throughout the data collection process. If 
needed, additional training will be provided to assessment technicians. Video 
recordings of family interaction tasks will be monitored by [CONTACT_894813]. Survey data 
will be cross -checked and cleaned shortly after in -home assessments are 
conducted to ensure data were collected accurately as well as resolve any 
discrepancies in key study variables (e.g., deployment status, marital status, 
gender, etc).  
18.0 Confidentiality  
18.1 Data Security:  
Participants are assigned a coded identification number that is used on all data collection measures. This includes a family id (e.g. individual #1 in family #1 is 0001- 1). Identifying information necessary for participant contact, such as names,

 Page 31 of 38  Revis ed: May [ADDRESS_1253884], and participants’ study ID will be the only unique  pi[INVESTIGATOR_625466]. Video files of observational assessment tasks will be 
stored in a separate storage area online. Only study IDs will be used to link videos 
to questionnaire data. These files will all be pass word protected and accessible to 
only a limited number of project personnel. In order to protect participant data 
during internet based research, the project will use Qualtrics, a sophisticated 
online data management system that maintains extremely stringe nt levels of 
encryption and data storage. Qualtrics is specifically designed to meet and exceed 
industry standards for Internet security as well as Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) standards for the 
protection of  research participants. For participants, secure servers with registered 
site certificates provided by [CONTACT_894814]. To ensure an even greater level of security and confidentiality, Qualtric s also requires that participants are authenticated to 
gain access to the data entry forms. Participants will receive an email with the 
survey name [CONTACT_625522] a query string parameter in the URL, which is encrypted 
by [CONTACT_583339]. As users move through the data entry forms, the responses are encrypted 
while in -transit between the browser and Qualtrics's server using SSL (Secure 
Sockets Layer) and 40, 56, or 128- bit Public Key Encryption. All data collection 
is performed using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with 128- bit secure key 
encryption whenever possible. Data will be stored on the Qualtrics server and will 
be downloaded to U of MN and de -identified data to U of O for analysis. 
Qualtrics servers are stored in a locked, well -ventilated room in locked server 
cabinet/racks and are protected by [CONTACT_625508]. Questionnaires will be designed 
so that individuals cannot be identified on the basis of their data alone, and as 
noted above, all identifying information will be stored in a separate database from 
the data f iles. All subject identification data will be destroyed at the end of the 
project. The collected materials will be used only for research purposes; 
participants’ records with identifying information will not be released to anyone 
without participants’ writ ten permission.

human research subjects. The session(s) included an overview of the history of 
human subjects’ protection, an overview of the Belmont Report, a review of IRB 
policies and procedures, and a discussion of the regulatory requirements regarding 
informed conse nt. The University of Minnesota has a mandatory IRB curriculum 
for all Principal Investigators, which [CONTACT_625525] and all other project 
investigators and staff have completed. IRIS Media has developed a self -directed 
training program for its employees that includes the videotape entitled “Protecting Human Subjects,” and utilizes the web- based training program from the Office of 
Human Research Protections. In addition, all project staff received adequate training in the responsible conduct of research involving human subjects through participation and completion of the CITI Human Subjects Research Educational Model course (delivered by [CONTACT_18121]).  
All data entered into the computerized database will be identifiable by [CONTACT_619265]. All research sta ff sign confidentiality agreements. No one 
except the research staff will have access to records identifying subjects' names at 
any time. The information gathered will be used only for scientific, educational, 
or instructional purposes. Finally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l apply for a Certificate of 
Confidentiality to further protect privacy of each participant and avoid compelled 
“involuntary disclosure” (e.g., subpoenas) of identifying information about a 
research subject.  
It should be noted that we are not allowed to as k substance use questions to 
Active Duty participants and will encode the online survey with logic if -then 
routing that will eliminate those questions from the battery of assessment for 
active duty participants.   
The link between identifiers and code will  be maintained for 10 years following 
the end of data collection.  
 Data will be kept for ten years following the end of data collection in order to 
allow sufficient time for analysis of videotaped observations, which are coded 
using microsocial/second -by-second techniques, and are very time -consuming to 
code. Following this, videotaped data will be destroyed.  
 
All data will be stored in digital form on secure University of Minnesota servers.  
Access to files is password protected.  Most data will be stored electronically, but 
some situations may require the use of paper forms

During the analysis of the data, all identifying information with the exception of 
the subject identification number is removed from the data. No information about 
the identities of study participants will be published or presented at conferences.  
 
Breakin g of confidentiality:  There is the risk that we may learn that a child has 
been abused, neglected, or endangered and need to report it to child protective 
services. Thus, we will fully inform parents of the limits of confidentiality, both 
verbally and in w riting. Given that the intervention we will be offering teaches 
non-abusive parenting strategies, we believe that the potential benefits in this area 
outweigh the risks. Project staff will be properly trained to identify signs of 
potential child abuse, neglect, or child endangerment, and will report any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_894781]. Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_894782], neglect, or endangerment will be reported to child protective services in accordance with Minnesota law, and the parents will be told of the report. In 
addition, those who present an imminent threat of harm to themselves or others 
will be reported to the proper authorities. Project staff will also be properly 
trained in responding to parents who are experiencing significant life difficulties 
and require additional professional assistance. The statement of informed consent 
will include the following statement: “It is possible that you may experience 
serious life difficulties that are beyond the ability of the ADAPT program to help 
you with. This program is not a substitute for professional help for serious 
difficulties you might be having. If you feel you are having an emergency 
situation, please seek outside professional help. If you are experiencing serious 
difficulties, please le t us know [project staff email and phone provided] and we 
will work with you to find resources in your community that can help you.” Staff 
will be equipped with specific guidelines and a referral list for referring parents to specialized treatment for PTSD , substance abuse, depression, domestic violence, 
other mental illness, and similar problems beyond the scope of ADAPT. 
Procedures to prevent the violation of confidentiality in accordance with reporting 
requirements are limited by [CONTACT_151140]. Subjects are informed in the consent document that staff must report to authorities 1) 
physical injury to any child caused by [CONTACT_455806], as required by 
[CONTACT_894815]; and 2) information from a study participant wh ich leads staff 
to believe a person is in imminent danger of physical harm. Staff will inform parents or guardians if, in the judgment of the professional staff, their child (under 18) is in imminent danger of trying to kill him/herself.

Assessmen ts are conducted either online or, if in person, in subjects' homes, to 
ensure convenience for participants.  We have conducted in- home assessments in 
prior studies without problems. Military populations may be especially resistant to 
coming to a university or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_625467], which is 
why program activities (for in -person groups) will be held in community locations 
convenient to participants (i.e. libraries, community centers). As participants are recruited we will determine optimum group locations. For example, given the prevalence of ARNG families in Stillwater, we anticipate tha t one location will be 
a library or community center in Stillwater. In each location we will rent a private room with no capacity for those outside to overhear or see what is being said. The 
University of Minnesota project office in the Department of Famil y Social 
Science will be used as a default location for assessments in the event that any

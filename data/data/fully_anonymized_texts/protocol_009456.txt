Amendment #1 30 July 2019 Changes are being made in Amendment 1 du e to the 
pharmacological activity of 2 of the  major circulating metabolites of PF-04965842. In order to take into account the effects of renal impairment on the pharmaconetics of the PF-04965842 as well as its active metabolites, the active moiety exposure will be determined as outlined in the protocol Amendment 1. Accordingly, the decision criterion for Part 2 of the study will be based on ratio of active moiety AUC values in severe renal impairment vs. normal renal function groups in Part 1. In Part 2, the study will enroll only subjects with moderate renal impairment, and the effects in mild renal impairment, if expected based on results in moderate group, will be estimated based on modeling of results from all the subjects in the study.

Page 9PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Background :PF-04965842 isa janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor that is currently bein g 
developed for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Key cytokines implicated in the 
pathophy siology  of AD including interleukin (IL)-4, IL -5, IL -13, IL -22, IL -31, and interferon 
(IFN)-, require JAK1 for signal transduction, suggesting that selective JAK1 inhibitors, that 
modulate the activity  of these cy tokines, represent a compelling approach to the treatment of
inflammatory skin diseases such as AD .3  PF-04965842 is being developed as an oral 
treatment f or patients with moderate to severe AD based on its mechanism of action, and the 
clinical results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.  The clinical development program 
for PF -04965842 includes 5 completed clinical studies: three ( 3)Phase 1 studies in healthy  
subjects (B7451001, B7451004, and B7451008), one ( 1)Phase 2 study  in subjects with 
psoriasis (B7451005) and 1 Phase 2 study in subjects with AD (B7451006) .  A total of 
[ADDRESS_1063081] 1 dose of PF 04965842 (n=61 in Study  B7451001; 
n=12 in study  B7451004; n=6 in study  B7451008; n=45 in study  B745 1005; n=211 in Study  
B7451006).   PF-04965842 is generall y safe and well tolerated.
Study Rationale : The primary purpose of this non -randomized, single -dose, open -label 
study  is to characterize the effect of renal impairment on the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of PF -04965842 following administration of a single 200 mg oral dose.  The major clearance 
mechanism of PF -04965842 is oxidative metabolism mediated primarily  by [CONTACT_9058]
P2C19 ( CYP2C19 )and CYP2C9.  The renal clearance of PF -04965842 is low 
(<4%) indicating that the renal pathway  play s a minimal role in PF -04965842 excretion.
Recent European Medicines Agency  (EMA) guideline suggests that renal impairment studies 
be conducted in patients with decreased renal function for nearly  all small molecules, even if 
the drug or its active metabolite is not primarily  eliminated by  [CONTACT_10521] s.6Furthermore, 
evidence suggests that the PKof drugs that are not only  excreted b y the kidney can be 
affected b y renal impairment through inhibition of pathways of hepatic and gut drug 
metabolism and transport .7  In response, the revised Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Draft Guidance on renal impairment studies recommends that a PKstudy  be conducted in 
subjects with renal impairment when the drug is likely  to be used in patient s with impaired 
renal function .7PF-[ADDRESS_1063082] of renal impairment on the plasma PK of 
PF-0496 5842.  Findings from this study will be used to develop dosing recommendations so 
that dose and /ordosing interval may be adjusted appropriatel y in the presence of renal 
disease.
This study  is a phase 1 non -randomized, open -label, single -dose, parallel -group study  of 
PF-04965842 in subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects with out renal impairment 
(Part 1) and in subjects with moderate renal impairment (Part 2), matched for age, bod y 
weight and, to the extent possible, for gender.  The study  will follow a staged approach as 
renal excretion is minor (<4 %) for PF -04965842.  Theref ore, it is proposed that effect of 
renal impairment on PKof PF -04965842 and its active metabolites PF-06471658 and 
PF-04965842 
B7451021Protocol Amendment #1, [ADDRESS_1063083] dose 
being evaluated in the Phase 3 AD program. This dose selection al so takes into account 
safety considerations for subjects with severe renal impairment  in whom an increase in 
plasma concentration of PF-04965842 may be observed.  In study B7451001, single oral 
doses of PF-04965842 as high as 800 mg, and repeated doses as hig h as 400 mg once daily 
(QD) and 200 mg twice daily (BID) (up to 10 days) have been found t o be safe and well 
tolerated.  Thus, based on the safety data of PF-04965842 and p rior clinical experience, with 
the single oral dose of 200 mg, exposure increases up to 4-fold ( to 800 mg single dose) if 
observed, are not likely to pose any safety risks.

Study Design: This is a Phase [ADDRESS_1063084] of severe renal impairm ent on the plasma 
pharmacokinetics of PF-04965842 after a single 200 mg oral dose.   Subjects will be selected 
and categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Part 1: A total of approximately16 subjects will be enrolled in Part 1;  approximately 
8 subjects with severe renal impairment (Cohort 2) and approxima tely 8 with normal renal 
function (Cohort).  The [ADDRESS_1063085]’s age 
is within ±10 years and weight is within ±15 kg of the mean of t he pooled impaired groups.
Part 2: Based on whether the decision criterion to proceed to Part [ADDRESS_1063086] 10 hours, subjects will  be administered a single oral 
200 mg dose of PF-04965842 with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces)  of ambient temperature 
water in the morning on Day 1.  No food will be allowed for at least [ADDRESS_1063087]-dose on Day 4.  The eGFR value obtained on Day -1 will 
be used for PK analysis.  Subjects will be confined to the unit  during the study until 
completion of PK sampling and safety assessments (as specified in the Schedule of 
Activities ) on the morning of Day 4.  Physical examinations, single supin e 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory tests will be 
conducted and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout t he study to assess safety.  
Subjects will have a follow-up contact [CONTACT_773988].CCI

1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
PF-04965842 isaJAK1 inhibitor that is currently being developed for the treatment of AD. 
The JAK family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2), is a group of 
cytoplasmic t yrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Ty pe 1 
and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, proliferation, survival and 
function.  Cy tokine receptors demonstrate restricted association with JAKs such that different 
recept ors or receptor classes preferentiall y utilize a given JAK dimer or trimer combination 
to transduce their signal.  JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate -common cy tokine signaling 
and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit the signals of additional cy tokines import ant in 
inflammation and immune resp onses including IL -4, -5, -6, -13, -21, -31, IFN-, and IFN -.  
JAK2 homodimers are critical for the signaling of hematopoietic cy tokines and hormones 
including ery thropoietin (EPO), IL -3, granulocy te-macrophage colon y-stimulating factor 
(GM -CSF) and prolactin. IL-12 and IL -23 are dependent on TYK2 and JAK2 for 
transmitting their signals. 
Following cy tokine activation, receptor -associated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn 
phosphory late specific sites on the receptor in tracellular domain.  Phosphory lation of specific 
sites on the intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently  be phosphory lated 
by [CONTACT_74061].1Phosphory lated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to the 
nucleus where they  bind to specific sites on the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) and regulate 
gene transcription .2
Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology  of ADincluding IL-4, IL-5, IL-13,IL-22,
IL-31, and IFN -, require JAK1 for signal transduction, suggesting that selective JAK1 
inhibitors, that modulate the activity  of these cy tokines, represent a compelling approach to 
the treatment of inflammatory  skin diseases such as AD.3

1.2.2. Rationale for Development of PF-04965842
PF-04965842 is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with moderate to severe 
AD based on its mecha nism of action, and the clinical results obtained in Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 studies.  The clinical development program for PF -04965842 includes healthy  
subjects , subjects with psoriasis and subjects with AD. 
Additional information for this compound may  be fo und in the single reference safet y 
document (SRSD) , which for this study  is the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).A summary of 
the components relevant to this study  are presented below.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Summ ary of Safety Data from Completed Clinical Studies
Based on the clinical experience with PF -04965842 and its mechanism of action, the 
potential risks of treatment with JAK inhibitors include: (1) viral reactivation ; (2) serious 
infection and opportunistic infections (3) malignancy  and l ymphoproliferative disorders; 
(4)decreased l ymphocy te counts; (5) decreased neutrophil counts ; (6) decreased platelets;
and (7)alterations in the lipid profile.
In the completed Phase [ADDRESS_1063103] reported treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs )
were mild or moderate in severit y. In stud y B7451001, during the singl e-ascending dose 
phase, one ( 1)subject in the placebo group had maximum fridericia corrected QT interval
(QTcF) of 450 to <[ADDRESS_1063104] in the PF -04965842 800 mg treatment group had 
maximum QTcF interval increase from baseline of 30 to <60 msec .  In the 
multiple -ascending dose phase, three ( 3)subjects (1 each in the placebo, PF -04965842 30 mg 
QD, and 100 mg QD treatment groups) had maximum QTcF interval of 450 to <480 msec ,
and 2 subjects in the PF -04965842 200 mg BID treatment group had maximu m QTcF 
interval increase from baseline of 30 to <60 msec .There were no clinically  significant 
changes in ECG findings in the B7451004 and B7451008 studies .
In the completed Phase 2 study  in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis (B7451005), t he 
most frequently  reported AEs across the PF -04965842 treatment groups (200 mg BID, 
200mg QD, and 400 mg QD) were nausea, followed by  [CONTACT_12704].  Other commonly  
reported AEs include dneutropenia and neutrophil counts decreased, thrombocy topen ia and 
platelet count decreased .  One (1) of the subjects in the 200 mg QD group with an AE 
categorized as infections and infestations was reported as having VIIth nerve paral ysis 
(Bell’s palsy ) and later developed herpes zoster (shingles). The incidence sof normal and 
abnorm al ECG recordings were similar across all treatment groups at each time point. None 
of the abnormal ECG recordings were determined to be clinically  significant by  [CONTACT_1275].
Inthe completed 12 -week Phase 2b study  (B7451006) in subjects with AD, AE sand serious 
AEs ( SAEs )were numerically higher in subjects receiving PF-04965842 ( 10, 30, 100, and 
200 mg QD) compared to placebo, but did not appear to increase with dose.  The most 
common AEs were in the infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneo us tissue disorders 
andgastrointestinal disorders system organ class ( SOC ), and the majority of the AEs were
mild. The most commonly  reported TEAE across all the treatment groups were dermatitis 
atopic (38 events), and viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_489567] (33 events).  The most 
frequentl y reported treatment -related TEAE was nausea.   There were 2 cases of non-serious 
herpes zoster, one (1)inthe 10 mg group (not treatment- related), and 1 in the 30 mg group 
(treatment -related).  There were 2 subjects (doses of ≥100 mg QD ) with treatment related 
SAEs reported, the SAEs were eczema herpeticum and pneumonia.  One (1)subject

[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of PF -04965842 Pharmacokinetics , Metabolism and In Vitro 
Enzymology
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Single and Multiple Dose Pharmacokinetics
PF-04965842 was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_773976]/suspension doses of 3 mg 
to 200 mg with median time to maximum concen tration ( Tmax) observed less than 1 hour
(ranging from 0.55 to 0.77 hours) , and more slowly  at the higher doses with median T maxof 
1.5 and 4.0 hours for the 400 mg and 800 mg doses, respectivel y (study B7451001) .  
Following attainment of maximum concentra tion ( Cmax), the disposition of PF -04965842 
generall y showed a monophasic decline at the lower doses of 3 to 30 mg (mean terminal 
half-life[t½] of 1.9 to 2.5 hours) while a biphasic decline was observed at dose s of 100 to 
800mg with a mean t ½of 3.6 to 4.9 hours. Plasma PF -04965842 C maxappeared to increase
proportionally  across the entire dose range from 3 mg to 800 mg, while increases in AUC inf
were greater than proportion al at doses of 400 and 800 mg. For the 2- fold doses increases 
between 200 to 400 mg and between 400 to 800mg, the mean AUC infvalues in Western 
subjects in this study  appeared to increase approximately  3.5- and 2.7- fold, respectivel y. 
On Day 10 of multiple -dose administration, PF -04965842 was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_773977] 1 hour or less (ranging from 0.50- 1.05 hours) across the entire range of doses, 
from a total dail y dose of 30mg (30mg QD) up to 400 mg ( 200mg BID or 400mg QD).  
Following attainment of C max, the disposition of PF- [ADDRESS_1063106] dose and a mean terminal t ½of about 2.8 to 5.0hours.  Plasma C maxand area under 
the concentration time curve from time 0 to time tau ( AUC tau)both appea red to show a trend 
towards greater than proportional increases with increasi ng daily  dose.  Geometric mean 
values for the observed accumulation ratio (R ac),that compares AUC taufor multiple -dose 
administration to AUC taufor single -dose administration, ranged from 1.3 to 1.5 for QD 
dosing and 1.3 to 2.3 for BID d osing.  Similar ratios for C maxcomparison (Rac, Cmax) ranged 
from 1.1 to 1.3 for QD dosing and from 1.3 to 2.8 for BID dosing.  T heseresults showed that 
drug concentration accumulation after repe ated oralQD or BID administration is less than 
about 1.5 -and 2.3- fold, respectivel y;at doses up to 200 mg QD , the accumulation was 
minimal and generall y consistent with the prediction from t½.

Page 21At a single 800-mg dose, the geometric mean C maxwas similar in Western and Japanese 
subjects. However, geometric mean AUC infwas 26% higher in Western subjects than that 
observed in Japanese subjects.  Geometric mean C maxand AUC taufollowing multiple-dose 
administration of 200 mg BID were 17% and 56% higher, respective ly, in the Western 
subjects than in Japanese subjects.

This study is a phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, p arallel-group study of 
PF-04965842 in subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects without renal impairment

Statistical Criteria to proceed to Part 2: After statistical evaluation of results from Part 1 (see 
Section 9.3.3 ), Part 2 will be conducted if the upper bound (UB) of the 90% CIfor the acti ve 
moiety AUC infgeometric mean ratio (GMR) fo r the severe renal impairment group 
(compared to the normal group as control) is 3.0.  If variability is unexpectedly  higher than 
assumed, eg, if the UB of the GM R is substantially  higher than 3 with a point e stimate of the 
GMR close to 2 , the data will be further evaluated to determine whether to proceed to Part 2.
If the above mentioned criterion is not met, the study will stop after Part 1.
The UB of 3.0 for the AUC GMR 90% CI  corresponds to an estimated ef fect size of 2.0 for

Page 29the health y group is wi thin ±15kg of the mean body  weight of the subjects with renal 
impairment and mean age is within ±10 years of the mean age of the subjects with renal 
impairment. In general, care should be taken when recruiting the healthy  subjects such that
the entire gr oup is as closely  matched in age and body  weight to the impairment subjects as 
possible .  An attempt will be made to maintain a similar male/female ratio and racial 
make -upbetween cohorts.
Part 2 : Healthy  subjects will not be enrolled in this part. Heal thy subjects from Part 1 will
be used as the control group for the moderate impairment subjects . Statistical considerations 
to account for an y differences in demographics are detailed in Section 9.3.3 .
Calculation of eGFR :
The following equation from the MDRD study will be used to calculate eGFR (Scr, std denotes 
serum creatinine measured with a standardiz ed assay  for serum creatinine):
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × (S cr, std)-1.154 × (Age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if 
African American)
Note that the value of eGFR, which is directl y obtained from the lab or calculated using th e
equation above, is generally  normalized toan average bod y size of 1.73 m2for diagnosis, 
prognosis and trea tment of renal disease .  In terms of clearance of renall y filtrated drugs 
(including secreted drugs), renal elimination capacity  is related to absolute glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR )in mL/min. To use the MDRD -derived, body  surface area 
(BSA )-adjusted value of eGFR to obtain absolute GFR (mL/min) for renal disease 
classification or subject assignment into different renal disease groups, this value should be 
multiplied by  [CONTACT_31031]’s BSA (ie,measured BSA/1.73 m2).The BSA of an 
individual c an be calculated by  [CONTACT_773995]:
BSA = ( Weight0.425x Height0.725) x 0.007184
In summary , GFR in mL/min calculated as below will be used for renal impairment group

eGFR (mL/min /1.73m2) = 175 × (Scr, std)-1.154 × (Age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) 
×(1.212 if African American) where S cr, std denotes serum creatinine measured 
with a standardized assay .
Step 2: Convert the MDRD -derived, BSA -adjusted eGFR obtained above to absolute 
GFR (mL/min) for eligibility  assessment using the following equation: 
eGFR (mL/min) = eGFR (mL /min/1.73m2) ×subject’s BSA where BSA is 
calculated as BSA = (Weight0.425x Height0.725) x 0.007184.

All fertile female subjects of childbearing potential who are, in the opi [INVESTIGATOR_1070], sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use 
a highl y effective method of contraception consistently  and correctl y for the duration of the 
active treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1063144] and his 
or her partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and will 
confirm that the subjec t has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of 
the need to use highl y effective contraception consistently  and correctly  and document the 
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063145]’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjects need to affirm their 
consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  I n addition, 
the investigator or designee wi ll instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected

Male condom or female condom used WITH a separate spermicide product (ie, foam, gel, 
film, cream, or suppository ) is not considered as a highl y effective method of contraception .
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of ri sk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, IP is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being 
tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).
For this st udy, the IPis PF-04965842, provided as 100 mg tablets.
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular subject or affect the order in which subjects are enrolled.
The investigator will assign subject identification numbers sequentiall y to the subjects as 
they are screened for the study .  All subjects enrolled will receive the same study  treatment. 
5.2.Subject Compliance
IPwill be administered under the supervision of investigator site personnel.  The oral cavity  
of each subject will be examined following dosing to ensure the IP was taken.
5.3.Investigational Product Supplies
5.3.1. Dosage Form and Packaging
PF-04965842 100 mgtablets will be supplied to the CRU by  [CONTACT_177263] 100 mg tablets in high 
density  polyethylene (HDPE) bottles.  PF -[ADDRESS_1063147]/caregiver b y qualified staff.  
Dispensing is defined as the prov ision of I P, concomitant treatments, and accompan ying 
information by  [CONTACT_22806](s) to a healthcare provider, subject, or caregiver in 
accordance with this protocol.  L ocal health authority  regulations or investigator site 
guidelines may  use alternative terms for these activities. 
PF-049658 42 tablets will be prepared at the CRU in the individual dosing containers by  
2operators, one ( 1)of whom is an appropriatel y qualified and experienced member of the 
study  staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy  
assistant/technician, or pharmacist).  The tablets will be provided in unit dose containers and 
labeled in accordance with [COMPANY_007] regulations and the clinical site’s labeling requirements. 
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063148] 10 hours, subjects will receive a single oral 200 mg 
dose of PF -04965842 at approximately  0800 hours ( ±2hours).  Investigator site personnel 
will administer IPto subjects with ambient temperature water of approximately  240mL.  
Subjects will swallow the IP whole, and will not manipulate or chew the IP prior to 
swallowing.
In order to standardize the conditions on PKsampling day s, all subjects will be required to 
refrain from l ying down (except when required for ECG measurements), eating, and drinking 
beverages other than water during the first [ADDRESS_1063149] be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated ,and/or room -temperature produc ts).  This should 
be captured from th e time of IP receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available .  The intent is to ensure that the minimum an d maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the min imum/max imum
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they aremaintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product -label storage conditi ons should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling , as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions t aken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007] . 
Once an excursion is identif ied, the I Pmust be quarantined and not used until [COMPANY_007] provides 
permission to use the I P.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the 
use of the IP after the temperature excursion. Use of the IP prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.

other disposition of the IP supplies.  All I Ps (PF -04965842 oral tablets) will be accounted for 
using a drug accountability  form/record.
5.6.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or des ignee will provide guidance on the destruction o f unused I P (eg, at the 
site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must 
ensure that the materials are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  [CONTACT_4618] ,and all 
destruction must be adequately documented.
5.7.Concomitant Treatment (s)
Subjects will abstain from all concomitant treatments, except for the treatment of AEs, as 
descri bed in the Exclusion Criteria section (Section 4.2) of this protocol.  Limited use of 
nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety  or the overall results 
of the s tudy may  be permitted on a case -by-case basis following approval by  [CONTACT_456].
All concomitant treatments taken during the study  must be recorded with indication, daily  
dose, and start and stop dates of administration.  All subjects will be questioned a bout

6.1. Proposed Chronology of Procedures
For the procedures described below, where multiple procedures a re scheduled at the same 
timepoint(s) relative to dosing, the following chronology of ev ents should be adhered to , 
where possible :
•12-lead ECG : obtain prior to vital signs assessment, blood samples, and pr ior to 
dosing (refer to Section 7.1.5 ).
•Vital Signs (BP and pulse rate) : obtain after 12-lead ECG collection but prior to 
obtaining blood samples and prior to dosing (refer to Section 7.1.4 ).
•Ifan intravenous catheter is placed for serial blood sample colle ctions, ECGs and 
vital signs (BP and pulse rate) assessments should be either collected prior to the 
insertion of the catheter orsufficient rest period after catheter insertion introduced to 
minimized impact of catheter placement on these assessments. 
•Fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory tests : after assessment of 12-lead ECG 
and vital signs but prior to start of meal (and dosing, when applicable) - refer to
Section 7.1.1 .
•Serial blood samples for plasma  PK (refer to Section 7.2 ): follow as close 
as practically possible to the nominal time. 
•Other pre-dose procedures : should be obtained/performed as close as possible to the 
scheduled time, but may be obtained before or after blood speci men collection.
•If the post-dose blood collection nominal time coincides with t he nominal time of a 
meal, these blood samples should be collected prior to start of the meal.
6.2. Screening
Subjects will be screened within [ADDRESS_1063153] selection criteria for the study.  The investi gator (or an appropriate delegate 
at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from eac h subject in accordance with 
the procedures described in the Section 12.3 .  If the time between screening and dosing 
exceeds 28 days as a result of unexpected delays (eg, delayed dr ug shipment), then subjects 
do not require rescreening if the Day -[ADDRESS_1063154] ructed on the information in

Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own re quest, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also
Section 8.1.3 ) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to com ply with the 
protocol-required schedule of study visits or procedures at a g iven investigator site.  The 
early termination visit applies only to subjects who are random ized and then are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effor t should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  The investigator or site staff should attempt to cont act the subject twice.  After 
[ADDRESS_1063156]’s 
medical record.  In any circumstance, every effort should be ma de to document subject 
outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about th e reason for withdrawal, 
request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicabl e, and follow up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs.
It may be appropriate for the subject to return to the clinic fo r final safety assessments to be 
scheduled as early as practically feasible following the decisi on to withdraw from  the study.  
Subjects should be questioned regarding their reason for withdra wal.  At the 
early-withdrawal visit, every effort must be made to complete t he following assessments:
•Limited physical examination;
•Supi[INVESTIGATOR_110250];
•Single 12-lead ECG measurement;

Page 45Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/earl y termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the subject’s safet y was preserved.
If the subject withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.

Withdrawal of consent : 
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  and 
must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures.  The only  
exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact 
[CONTACT_310799].   
Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to with draw consent from 
future follow -up, whenever possible.   The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from 
further receipt of IPor also from study  procedures and/or posttreatment study  follow -up, and 
entered on the appropriate case report form ( CRF )page.   In the event that vital status 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available information 
should be used to determine vital status on ly as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
Lost to f ollow -up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084].   All 
attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.   If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of 
death.  If the investigator’s use of a third- party repres entative to assist in the follow-up 
portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator 
may use a sponsor -retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the 
subject’s contact [CONTACT_110284] -up portion of the study .  The site staff and representative will consult publicly  
available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated

Page 507.1.3. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations may  be conducted by  a ph ysician, trained ph ysician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation.  A full ph ysical examination 
will include head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, ly mph nodes, 
and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological sy stems.  The limited or abbreviated 
physical examination will be focused on general appearance, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_31000] s ystems, and subject -reported s ymptoms.
For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be 
placed on a stable, flat surface. Subjects must remove shoes, bulky  layers of clothing, and 
jackets s othat only  light clothing remains.  They  must also remove the contents of their 
pockets and remain still during measurement of weight. 
7.1.4. Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
BP and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of 
thisprotocol.  Addi tional collection times, or changes to collection times, of BP, and pulse 
ratewill be permitted, as necessary , to ensure appropriate collection of safety  data.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_31001]’s arm supported at the level of the heart , and 
recorded to the nearest mm Hgafter approximately  5minutes of rest .  The same arm 
(preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study. Subjects should be 
instructed not to speak during measurements.
The same properl y sized and calibrated BP cuff will be used to measure BP each time.  The 
use of an automated device for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable; however, when 
done manuall y, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 
30seconds.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, BP 
and pulse rate should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection.
7.1.5. Electrocardiogram 
12-lead E CGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activi tiessection of 
thisprotocol .
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
Refer toSection 6.1for proposed chronology  of procedures for nominal time points when 
12-lead ECG assessments coincide with other procedures.
To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigator site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements.  If the QTc interva l is increased by  45msec from 
the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is 500msec for any  scheduled ECG, then 
2additional ECGs will be collected, approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart, to confirm the 
original measurement.  If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs remains above 
the threshold value ( ie, is 45msec from the baseline , or is 500msec), then a single ECG 
must be repeated at least hourly  until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.
PF-04965842 
B7451021Protocol Amendment #1, 30 July 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 51If QTc values remain ≥500 msec (or ≥45 msec from the baseline) for greater than 4 hours (or 
sooner, at the discretion of the investigator), or QTc intervals get progressively longer, the 
subject should undergo continuous ECG monitoring.  A cardiologi st should be consulted if 
QTc intervals do not return to less than 500 msec (or to <45 msec  above the baseline) after 
8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the invest igator).
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to  rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is import ant that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG record ings.  If a machine-read QTc 
value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may no t be necessary if a 
qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the  QTc values are in the 
acceptable range.
7.2. Pharmacokinetics
7.2.1. Plasma for Analysis of PF-04965842 and Metabolites, PF-[ZIP_CODE] 658, PF-07055087 
and 
During all study periods, blood samples (10 mL) to provide appro ximately 5 mL of plasma
for PK analysis will be collected into appropriately labeled tub es containing dipotassium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K 2EDTA) at times specified in the Schedule of Activities
section of the protocol. 
The actual times may change, but the number of samples will rema in the same.  All efforts 
will be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing.  
However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, w ithin 6 minutes of a 
60-minute sample) from dosing will not be captured as a protoco l deviation, as long as the 
exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source docu ment and data collection tool 
(eg, CRF[/DCT]).
Samples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in  compliance with [COMPANY_007] 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Details regarding the collection, processing, aliquoting, stora ge and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_773982].  The shipment addresses and  assay lab contact

The PK samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in th e instructions provided to 
the investigator site to maintain sample integrity. Any deviation s from the PK sample 
handling procedure (eg, sample collection and processing steps, interim storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_15889]), including any actions taken, must be documented an d reported to the sponsor.
On a case-by-case basis, the sponsor may make a determination as  to whether sample 
integrity has been compromised.  Any deviation from the specifi ed sample handling 
procedure resulting in compromised sample integrity will be consid ered a protocol deviation.

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types  of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2) non-serious AEs; and (3) exposure to the IP under study durin g pregnancy or 
breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness
SAE All All
Non-serious AE All None
Exposure to the IP under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), 
except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment grou p or suspected causal 
relationship to the IP(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs.CCI
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063164] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information.  
This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously  
forwarded reports.  In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately  
aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours 
after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see Section 8.2.3 ).  In addition, the investigator may be requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain 
specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.   This information is more detailed 
than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the event in 
sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality .  Any information relevant to the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety .  Any  pertinent additiona l information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; 
additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to be sent to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE info rmation is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subject will be qu estioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also Section 6.5)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdraw al due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.

Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063165] SAE Repo rt Form, in acco rdance with 
Section 8.1above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving IP ), through and including a minimum of 
28calendar day safter t he last administratio n of the I P.
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are repo rted to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the

8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the in vestigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the IPcaused or contributed to an AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not 
know whether or not the IP caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to I P” 
for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality  assessment is 
“unknown but not rel ated” to I P, this should be clearly  documented on study records.

AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study  subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/w orsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdra wal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;

Page 58Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the fol lowing 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence o f any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life function s);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be imme diately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.

Page 59Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773983] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care uni t (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neuro logical floor to a TB 
unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily  constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, 
the event leading to the emergency  room vi sit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development o f a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .

Protocol Amendment #1, 30July 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 60Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual functio n.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as seriou s unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators”, wh ile those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors”.  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are “susceptible ”to 
progressive and ser ious liver injury, commonly  referred t o as drug induced liver injury  
(DILI ).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible”.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede t otal bilirubin (TBili )elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical even ts, even before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063167]’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subseque ntly present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available.
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN ( whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor .
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1063168] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/o r protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormal ities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or OTC medications) , recreational drug, 
supplement (herbal) use and co nsumption, family  history , sexual history , travel history , 
history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or 
allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  
tract) may  be warranted. 
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063169]/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potentia l DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test (LFT)abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.2. Exposure to the Investigational Pr oduct During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposur e to the I Punder study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and occupational exposure 
are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnan cy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an EDP occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure ) to the I P; or the femal e 
becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being expose d to the 
IP;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and h as been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure ) to the 
IPprior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s 
pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s part ner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the IP , the investigator must report this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the 
CTSAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has 
occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using 
the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred 
and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include 
the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to termi nation of 
pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notif y [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
PF-04965842 
B7451021
Protocol Amendment #1, 30July 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 63integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination sh ould be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal dea th]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1063170] 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposur e to the IP. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposu re, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Fo rm to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE R eport Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwi se) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

9.1.Sample Size Determination
Renal impairment subjects will be enrolled based on their eGFR (MDRD) on Day  -1.
In Part 1, eight (8) subjects will be enrolled into each of the tw o renal function groups (severe 
impairment and normal) to ensure 6 completers.  If Part 2 is conducted, up to eight 
(8)subjects will be enrolled in the moderate renal impairment groups to ensure 6 completers.
This is an estimation study. The sample size is based on recommendation from the FDA

consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized sta ff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases the source do cuments are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602] ’schart.  I n these cases, 
data collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF ,and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source d ocuments, 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, acco rding to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The
investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are 
retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for a ny reason to continue to retain study  records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another in stitution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1063180] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

Protocol Amendment #1, 30July [ADDRESS_1063181]/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file .  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approval s should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study

persona l data, w hen study  data arecompi[INVESTIGATOR_168024], s ubject names will be removed and will be replaced by a single, specific numerical 
code ,based on a numbering s ystem defined by [CONTACT_4618] .All other identifiable data transferred 
to [COMPANY_007] or other authorized parties will be identified by  [CONTACT_20007], subject- specific code.  
The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the 
study ,linking each subject’ snumerical code to his or h eractual identity .  In case of data 
transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of subject s’
personal data consistent with the CSA and applicable privacy  laws .

The investigator must ensure that each study  subject is fully  informed about the nature and 
objectives of the stud y, the sharing of data relating to the stud y and possible risks associated 
with participation , including the risks associated with the processing of the subject’s personal 
data.  The investigator further must ensure that each study  subject is fully  informed about his 
or her right to access and correct his or her personal data and to withdraw consent for the 
processing of his or her personal data . 
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any  study -specific activity  is pe rformed.  The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.
At the end of the st udy, the I Pin this study  will notbe provided to the subjects who 
participated. 
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP

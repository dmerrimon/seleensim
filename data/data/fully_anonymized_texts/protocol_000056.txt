SYNOPSIS  
Title:  
A Randomized, Open -Label, Multiple Dose, Bioavailability Study of DFD -03 
(Tazarotene Lotion, 0.1%) Dosed Twice Daily Compared to Once Daily Tazorac® 
(tazarotene) Cream, 0.1% in Patients with M oderate Acne Vulgaris

  8-2-337, Road No. 3  
  Banjara Hills  
 Hyderabad – 500034, Telangana, India  
Study Center s:  2 site s Number of Subjects:  Approximately 62  
Study Period:  21 days  Clinical Phase: Phase 2  
Objectives : 
The primary objective is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of tazarotene and 
tazarotenic acid after twice- daily  application of DFD -03 Lotion (Test product) versus  once -daily 
application of Tazorac Cream (Reference product)  for 21 days in  subjects  with mode rate acne 
vulgaris.  
The secondary objectives are  
a) Assessment of disease severity at baseline and at the pharmacokinetic ( PK) sampling days  for 
each treatment.   
b) To determine the safety and tolerability of each treatment .  
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, multiple -dose, laboratory -blinded, open- label, [ADDRESS_139615], 
stratified by [CONTACT_654]  (Adult subjects:  17 years or older ; Pediatric subjects : [ADDRESS_139616]) with approximately even distribution between males - and females  in each age -strata . The study 
will be conducted in two parts, Part A and Part B  in a sequential manner . Based on full PK 
profiles generated for adult subjects in Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric population has been established  in Part B.   
Part B (age 9 years to 16 years 11 months  for DFD -03 Lotion arm and age 12 years to 16 years 
11 months for Tazorac Cream arm ) will enroll up to [ADDRESS_139617], shoulders and upper 
back region, not exceeding 15% of the body surface area. Th e Test product will be applied twice 
daily , 12 hours apart  (morning and evening ; 42 consecutive doses) and the Reference product 
will be applied once daily in the evening ( 21 consecutive doses).  
Subjects  will visit the  clinical site daily prior to each dose application. Subjects will be confined 
at the clinic prior to the evening dose on Day  1, allowing sufficient time for all pre -dosing 
assessments to be performed,  until after that dose, from Day 14 evening  to Day 15 evening, and 
from  Day 2 1 evening to Day  22 evening for dose application and/or PK sampling. The subjects 
will leave the clinic after completion of clinical activities. O n Days [ADDRESS_139618] (s) missing either two consecutive dosing days (two doses for reference and four for test product) between day 1 and 8 or missing two non- consecutive dosing days between Day 2 and 
Day 11 will be assessed for steady -state estimation at Day 21.  Subjects missing dosing between 
Days 12 and 14 and between D ays 19 and 21 will not be considered for steady -state estimation  
or PK  and statistical analysis.  
For all dosing days (except confinement days), subjects will come to the clinical site ± 1 hour of  
each dose application (e. g., around 7:00 pm and 7:00 am) for twice -daily application of Test 
product and (e.g. around 7:00 pm ) for once daily application of Refe rence p roduct . Subjects will 
leave the clinical site  after completion of the scheduled activities. On Day 1, subjects will report 
to the clinical site prior to the first (evening) dose  and on D ay [ADDRESS_139619]  (morning dose on Day 22) will not be rinsed off .  
Based on the full PK profile of T est and R eference treatment s in Part A, the sparse sampling 
schedule for p ediatric subjects in Pa rt B has been  decided  (Table 3) .  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 62 subjects  across 2 study sites will be enrolled .

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The absorption and disposition parameters will be determined using a noncompartmental  
approach , trapezoidal rule will be used to estimate the area under the curve. The PK  parameters 
of interest for this study will be : 
Day 14 and Day 21:  Tmax(ss) , Cmax(ss) , AUC 0-12(ss), AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin(ss). 
For Part B of study, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum of  
[ADDRESS_139630]) on D ay 14 and D ay 21 will be used for calculation of PK 
parameters : Cmax(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Disease severity: Disease severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]’s Global Assessment 
(IGA) score. Inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion count (%  change from baseline for 
both parameters) will also be done.  
Safety:  
Safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), the investigator’s assessment of 
application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and 
itching), clinical safety laboratory evaluations (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and physical examination including vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).  
Statistics:  
Statistical analysis of all PK parameters will be based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. 
Two-sided 90% confidence intervals of the rati o of geometric least squares (LS) means will be 
presented  from the natural log (ln) -transformed PK parameters (C
max(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss)) for 
Test vs Reference on Day 14 and Day 21.  
Achievement  of steady  state will be performed by [CONTACT_3148], using log -transformed C min(ss)  (at 
Days 12, 13 and  14 and Days  19, 20 and 21)  in a mixed effect model  through repeated -measure 
ANOVA or through other appropriate statistical method.  
Disease severity will be assessed between baseline and sampling days by [CONTACT_54959] t -test or other 
appropriate statistical test and will be presented by [CONTACT_3148].  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for safety parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Tazarotene, an acetylenic retinoid, is a prodrug that unde rgoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatment of acne and psoriasis. Several 
synthetic retinoids have been de veloped for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112929].  
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, a s well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial 
fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and benign facial lentigines.  
[CONTACT_23015]’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formulation containing 
0.1%  tazarotene for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930]. This new product is intended to be 
used as a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by [CONTACT_2931] a generous amount of product to moistened affected skin, rubbing until foamy, and then rinsing with water a fter 
1 minute.  
Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodular cystic lesions) and non- inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) 
(Shalita,  2004). The four primary factors contributing to acne are a bnormal follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_124212], hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112932], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112933], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112934], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112935], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112936], 
oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775] (including tazarotene), and phototherapy.  
Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, and many studies have been conducted  on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information, 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
Tazarotene is characterized by [CONTACT_4760] a Category X drug, indicating that it may or can cause fetal harm when admi nistered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who 
are or may become pregnant ( Menter, 2000 ). At least [ADDRESS_139643] become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the birth of healthy babies, although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases.  
The purpose  of this study is to compare the bioavailability of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid 
after twice -daily application of DFD -03 Lotion with that after onc e-daily application of Tazorac 
Cream, with products applied for 21 days .

3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of tazarotene 
and tazarotenic acid after twice- daily application of DFD -03 Lotion (Test product) versus  once -
daily application of Tazorac Cream (Reference product) for 21 days in Patients  with moderate 
acne vulgaris.  
The secondary objectives are  
a) Assessment of disease severity at baseline and at the pharmacokinetic ( PK) sampling days for 
each treatment.  
b) To determine the safety and tolerability of each  treatment.   
 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139649], 
stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adult subjects :17 years or older ; pediatric  subjects : [ADDRESS_139650])  
with approximately even distribution between males and females  in each age stratum . The study 
will be conducted in two parts, Part A and Part B in a sequential manner. Based on full PK 
profiles generated for adult subjects in Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric subjects has been  established in Part B.  Part B (age 9 years to 16 years 11 months  for DFD -03 
and 12 years to 16 years 11 months for Reference ) will enroll up to [ADDRESS_139651], shoulders and upper 
back region, not exceeding 15% o f the body surface area. The Test product will be applied twice 
daily, 12 hours apart (morning and evening; 42 consecutive doses) , and the Reference product 
will be applied once daily in the evening (21 consecutive doses).  
Subjects will visit the clinical site daily prior to each dose application. Subjects will be confined at the clinic on Day [ADDRESS_139652] (s)  missing either two consecutive dosing days (two doses for reference and four for test 
product) between day 1 and 8 or missing two non- consecutive dosing days between Day 2 and 
Day 11 will be assessed for steady -state estimation at Day 21 . Subjects missing  dosing between 
Days 12 and 14 and between Days  19 and 21 will not be considered for steady -state estimation 
or PK and statistical analysis.

Page 25 of 57 
For all dosing days (except confinement days), subjects will come to the clinical site ± 1 hour of  
each dose application (e. g., around 7:00 pm  and 7 :00 am ) for twice -daily application of Test 
product and (e.g. around 7:00 pm ) for once -daily application of Reference p roduct. Subjects will 
leave the clinical site  after completion of the scheduled activities. On D ay 14 and Day 21 , 
subjects will report to the clinic al site   before scheduled dosing , allowing sufficient time for all 
pre-dosing a ssessments to be performed . 
Blood samples for PK estimation will be collected (within time window ± 15 minutes) at 
scheduled interval s over a period of [ADDRESS_139653] (morning dose on D ay 22) will not be 
rinsed off.  
Plasma  samples for analysis of t azarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma concentrations  will be 
collected on the schedule described in Table 2. The PK parameters of interest will be T max(ss) , 
Cmax(s s), AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
For Part B of study, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum of  
[ADDRESS_139654] , Table 3) on Day 14 and D ay 21 will be used for calculation of 
PK parameters: C max(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Disease severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_124217] -inflammatory lesion 
count (% change from baseline for lesion counts) at Day 15 and Day 21/Day22.  
Safet y assessments will include adverse events (AE s), the i nvestigator’s assessment of 
application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and 
itching), clinical safety laboratory evaluations (chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis ), and 
physical examination including vi tal signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).  
 
[ADDRESS_139655] (or legal guardi an) must be willing to authorize use and disclosure of protected 
health information collected for the study.  
3. Male or female at  least 9 years of age for the DFD -03 (Test) group and at least 12 years 
of age for the Tazorac Cream  (Reference)  group.  
4. Female sub jects must be having their menstrual period at Baseline  (Day [ADDRESS_139656]), except for subjects using hormonal contraceptives that preclude menstrual periods, if the subject is premenarcheal, is postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to

and comply with the study procedures by [CONTACT_112965], as 
applicable. The consent form and “ Information and assent ” form must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_124220], as applicable. A copy of the consent form (and “ Information and 
assent ” form, as applicable) must be given to the subject and/or legal guardian, and the date of 
the consent process and who conducted the consent process must be documented in the source documents. 
7.2 Screening  
An initial Screening visit should be scheduled to occur approximately 19 days ( Day - 21 to 
Day -1) prior to the Baseline visit ( Day 1 ). The subject number, date of visit, date of consent, 
reason for screen failure, and study status  (screen failure)  will be captured in the  CRF  for every 
screen failure subject.  Medical history and acne history should be collected for the prior 1 -year 
period and concomitant medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and procedures collected for the prior 6- month 
period. Only ongoing medical conditions and ongoing concomitant medications should be entered on the CRF. Acne history will be collected and recorded in the CRF.  
A history of tobacco, alcohol and drug use should  be reviewed and collected.  Presence of 
alcoholism ( i.e. alcohol in excess of 14 glasses/units per week, with one unit = 150 ml of win e 
or 360 ml of beer o r 45 ml of 45% alcohol ) and a history of drug abuse within [ADDRESS_139678] who received information about the study, including signing an 
informed consent and possibly performing some study -related procedures , but was not 
randomized and/or did not use  study product. 
7.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age (computed from date of birth and Day 1 date), race, ethnicity , and sex. B aseline characteristics include IGA and lesion counts of the face.  
7.4 Acne Evaluation  
7.4.1 Lesion Counts of the Face  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the face  (above the 
mandibular line), including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at Screening/Baseline to determine study eligibility . Non-inflammatory  lesions of acne are the 
open (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. C losed comedones may be more difficult 
to detect visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation within the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139679] surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. 
Nodules ar e typi[INVESTIGATOR_112942]/or painful. Additionally, they are deep-
seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated erythema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure accurate counts.  The investigator will perform lesion count at Screening and the baseline visit 
(Day1) and at PK sampling day s at Day 15 (prior to evening dose  application) , Day 21 (post last 
evening dose application for Reference treatment) and Day 22 (post last morning dose 
application  for Test treatment) .  
Disease severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_78442], inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion count (% 
change from baseline for lesion count) at Day 15 and Day 21/Day22.  
7.4.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of the Face  
The IGA will be performed by t he investigator, with best attempts made to assign the same 
evaluator for a subject throughout the study to obtain consistency in grading scores. The IGA will be performed  at Screening and the  baseline visit ( Day1) and at PK sampling days at Day 15 
(prior to evening dose appli cation), Day 21 (post last evening dose application for Reference 
treatment) and Day 22 (post last morning dose application for Test treatment) . 
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall acne severity. I GA is an ordinal scale with five  severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic description to minimize inter -observer variability  (Table 5) . The grades on the scale have been sufficiently 
defined to appropriately and unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The 
investigator will perform IGA scoring at Screening and the  baseline visit ( Day 1) .To be 
enrolled, subjects  had to have an IGA score of 3 at Baseline (Day 1). Disease severity will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_737]’s Global Assessment (IGA) score at baseline and PK sampling days.

7.5 Pharmacokinetic  Assessments 
On the schedule shown in Table 2 and Table 3, blood sample s (6 mL) for Part A (adult subjects) 
and 4 m L for Part B  (pediatric  subjects ) will be collected in s odium f luoride and potassium 
oxalate ( NaFKO)  anticoagulant for analysis of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma 
concentrations. If vital sign measurements  and PK blood samples are scheduled a t the same 
time, the PK blood samples are to be collected before blood pressure and heart rate are recorded.  
At each specified time, 2  aliquots of plasma  will be prepared and stored until the part of the 
study is comple ted and will then be sent to designated analytical laboratory (Algorithme ) for 
analysis.  
The PK assessment for P art A has been  conducted prior to P art B. Based on the full PK profile 
of Test and R eference treatment s in Part A, the sparse sampling schedule for pediatric subjects  
in Pa rt B has been  decided.  
The procedure s for blood sample collection, plasma separation, storage and sample shipment to 
each clinical site will be described in a sample processing instruction supplied by  [CONTACT_124221] . 
Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma concentrations will be determined at a designated 
laboratory from the blinded samples using a validated bioanalytical method.  
7.6 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments include visual inspection of the skin (erythema, sc aling  [peeling] ) prior to 
dose application, assessment of application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, 
peeling, stinging, burning, and itching)  after dose application , clinical safety laboratory 
evaluation s (chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis), and physical examination s including vital 
signs (blood pressure and pulse rate). A 12- lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit , 
Baseline visit (Day 1) and Day 21. F or females of  childbearing potential  serum  pregnancy tests 
will be conducted at the Screening Visit and urine pregnancy test s will be conduc ted at Day 1, 
Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 . Adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_124222], by [CONTACT_112970] , and by [CONTACT_4171] (see Section 8 for details about 
AEs).  Adverse events, whether believed by [CONTACT_124223], 
will be recorded on the CRF . 
Before each dose application, the investigator or designated trained site s taff will visually 
inspect the skin and grade erythema and scaling using the scales  shown in Table 6 and  Table 7, 
respectively .   
After each dose application,  the investiga tor or designated trained site staff  will assess 
application site reactions  by [CONTACT_124224]- lesional 
erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as shown below ( Table 6 , Table 7, Table 8 ) 
and recorded on the CRF . Assessments will be recorded separately for the face and (if 
applicable) neck, chest and /or back  (including shoulders) . The investigator or designated trained 
site staff will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table 9) , burning ( Table 10), or itching  
(Table 11) has occurred on the face  (neck, ches t and/or  back  (including shoulders) , if applicable  
since the previous drug application. D ay [ADDRESS_139681] and/or back (including shoulders)  using the same scales below  and should

Version 3.[ADDRESS_139707] common frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical trials w ith tazarotene 
cream 0.1% for the treatment of acne were desquamation, dry skin, erythem a, and burning 
sensation , occurring in 10% to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1%  to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non- lesional erythema , and peeling and report  as an AE  subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit if worse than at Baseline. An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product . An AE  can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an existing sign, symptom , or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.   Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reported on the medical history CRF  and should not be reported as an AE 
except for AEs  observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the 
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be re ported as AEs. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs . The disease or condition being studied or expected progression, 
signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied such as worsening of acne should not be r eported as an AE  unless it is more severe than expected , results in discontinuation from 
the study or requires alternat ive therapy . 
All serious adverse events  (SAEs), all study product -related events , and all AEs leading to study 
product  discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is determined or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted ( not recovered  is not an acceptable 
outcome  for acute conditions ). For other AEs, the status at the last visit can be entered i nto the 
CRF .

2. Start  date 
3. Stop date or date of death , ongoing , or unknown  
4. Severity of the event (see S ection  8.3.1 Severity for details)  
5. Study product  use continued or not  
6. Outcome of the event ( recovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolv ed with sequelae, not 
recovered/not resolved, unknown, fatal )

[Causality ] for details)  
8. Indication of whether the event is serious (se e Section  8.3.3 Seriousness for details)  
9. Actions taken including treatment with concomitant medication  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs  and laboratory abnormalities  (except at the Screening and Da y -1 visits and pre -dose 
on Day 1)  should be reported as AEs if they are out of range and considered to be clin ically 
significant, as per the i nvestigator’s judgment. If an abnormal laboratory value is associated 
with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE, and the 
associated abnormal laboratory result should be considered additional information. 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to assess the severity of each AE . Descriptions of  severity 
are as follows:  
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
 
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
 
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_139710]  (Causality)  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between th e study product  and the 
AE. The degree of “ relatedness” of the AE  to the study product  should be described using the 
following categories:  
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known. Or, the event is most probably produced by [CONTACT_11259] ’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 46 of 57 
3. Probably Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the stu dy product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
 
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately 
following study  product administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112945], or there is a 
positive r eaction at the application site.  
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE  occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatenin g (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death,  are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.[ADDRESS_139711] be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  to

8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. The investigator 
should report the event to the s ponsor immediately (s ee contact [CONTACT_112975]) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_112976] 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report  Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.

include all pertinent study -related information , including original signed/dated informed 
consent/  Information and assent forms. Source documents for this study include all w ritten 
records of study data. All study data must have a paper source document , including investigator 
assessments.   
9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A subject Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons for screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for al l subjects who are consented. The log should also include screening date, 
subject number , and date of enrollment , which is when ICF is signed, where applicable.   
9.[ADDRESS_139716] be legib le and complete. 
CRFs for this study will be maintained in a study binder and data recorded on 2- part NCR 
paper. One copy will be kept by [CONTACT_124226] c ollected by [CONTACT_119645]. All forms should be complete d using a blac k ballpoint pen. Errors should be 
lined out, but not obliterated, and the correction inserted, initialed, and dated by [CONTACT_51015]. Further data corrections will be performed on special “data correction forms” (DCFs) that will be provided to the investigator in case  of erroneous or unclear data. The 
investigator will make the correction on the DCF  and sign the DCF. The original will be sent to 
Symbio and a copy retained with the CRFs. 
A CRF must be completed and signed by [CONTACT_124227], including 
those discontinued from the study  for any reason. The reason for discontinuation must be noted 
on a subject’s study termination form. CRFs must be kept current to reflect the subject’s status at each phase d uring the study . Subjects 
are not to be identified on CRFs by [CONTACT_2300]; appropriately coded identification and the subject’s 
initials must be used. The investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’  names and 
addresses  
A Data Management  Plan, which describes the prog ramming of database structure, will be 
prepared.  
9.[ADDRESS_139717]; or, if the application is not f iled or is not approved, 
until [ADDRESS_139718] 1 year of previous experience i n monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar with the etiology and signs and symptoms of acne and the treatment options tha t are 
currently available.   
Before study initiation, the investigator and site personnel will receive protocol training from the sponsor’s representatives to ensure collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data. This training will take p lace either at a web -based Investig ator Meeting or individually 
on-site. 
During the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and ensure  that 
the study is being conducted according to the protocol and GCP. Any review of the subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. The investigator will ensure that the monitor or other compliance auditor is given access to all study -related documents and has adequate time and space to conduct the 
monitoring visit including availability of the investigator and site personnel to discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed  to ensure accurate transfer of data to electronic media.  
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance representative may conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5% to 10% of the investigator sites.  
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be perf ormed using SAS
® unless otherwise stated. Two- sided 
hypothesis testing will be conducted for all inferential analyses using a significance level of 0.05. Efficacy analyses performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered 
primary. Efficacy analyses performed using the per -protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (all subjects  who receive 
study product  and provide any post -baseline safety information ). Study popul ations are defined 
in Section  11.2. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses  and outlier testing , will be 
provided as a separate document prior to database lock and unblinding of the stud y treatments.  
11.[ADDRESS_139719] -
baseline safety informatio n will be included in the safety population. No imputation will be 
made for missing safety data.  
11.2.2 Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  Population  
Samples from all subjects who provide evaluable data will be assayed; these subjects will be 
included in the PK  and statistical analysis. In order to be considered evaluable, a subject must 
have PK samples collected on both Day [ADDRESS_139720] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_21705] s afety and P K populations.  
11.4 Pharmacokinetic  Analyses   
Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  plasma concentrations produced by [CONTACT_124228] . Below limit 
of quantitation concentrations ( coded BLQ)  will be treated as zero for all statistical analyses. 
The PK  parameters will be derived from the plasma concentrations versus  time profiles . All 
reported sampling time d eviations following application  for test and Reference will be taken 
into consideration for evaluation of PK parameters. 
In the case where concentrations of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  cannot  be determined due to 
bioanalytical or clinical reasons, thes e values will be set to missing for the PK and statistical 
analysis.  
In the case where less than 3 consecutive measurable concentrations of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  are observed, the area under the curve ( AUC ) parameters will not be estimated 
for th at specific study period.  
The following PK parameters  will be calculated for tazarotene and tazarotenic acid on Day  14 
and Day  21 using a noncompartmental approach. T he linear t rapezoidal rule will be used to 
estimate the AUC .  
C
max(ss): Maximum o bserved m aximum plasma concentration  during a dosing interval at 
steady state  
AUC 0-12(ss) Area under the concentration –time curve from time zero  to [ADDRESS_139721] -dose, at 
steady state  
AUC 0-24(ss) Area under the concentration –time curve from time zero  to [ADDRESS_139722] -dose, at 
steady state  
Tmax(ss) Time to reach observed maximum plasma concentration , at steady state  
Cmin(ss)  Minimum observed plasma c oncentration during a  dosing interval  at steady state  
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139723] for this study will be : 
Day 14 and Day 21:  Tmax(ss) , Cmax(ss) , AUC 0-12(ss), AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin(ss),  
For Part B, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum [ADDRESS_139724]) on D ay 14 and Day 21 will be used for calculation of PK parameters: C max(ss) , 
AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Descriptive statistics  will be calculated for plasma concentrations  at each individual time point 
and for all PK  parameters.  The individual plasma concentration/time profiles will be presented 
using the actual sampling times where as the mean plasma concentration/time profiles will be 
presented using the theoretical sampling times . Concentration/time profiles will be presented on 
linear and semi -log scales.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be generated using validated PK  software (e.g. Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® Version 6.3 or higher and Phoenix® ConnectTM version 1.3.1 or higher ). 
A statistical plan will prepared . Statistical analysis of all PK parameters will be based on a 
parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Two -sided 90% confidence intervals of the 
ratio of geometric least squares (LS) means will be presented  from the natural  log (ln) -
transformed PK parameters (C max(ss) , AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin (ss)) for Treatment  1 vs Treatment  2.  
Achievement  of steady  state will be performed by [CONTACT_3148], using log -transformed C min(ss) (at 
Days 12, 13 and  14 and 19 , 20 and 21)  in a mixed effect mo del through repeated -measure 
ANOVA or through other appropriate statistical methods .  
Disease severity will be assessed between baseline and sampling days by [CONTACT_54959] t -test or any 
other appropriate statistical test and will be presented by [CONTACT_3148].  
Descri ptive statistics will be presented for safety parameters.

summarized by [CONTACT_112983], frequency count and percentage  
for each visit . A similar summary will be provided excluding subjects with signs or symptoms 
present at Baseline.  
11.5.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs  with an onset on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490], the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC), preferred 
term (PT), severity, relationship to study product , and seriousness. When summarizing TEAEs

APPENDIX 1: DECLARAT ION OF HELSINKI (201 3) 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_139729] WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly , Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
 
A. PREAMBLE   
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as  a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with c onsideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.   
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best  interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients, 
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of d iseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and  quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the e nvironment.  
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139730], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139731] submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research su bjects and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
 
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
25. Participation by [CONTACT_112987]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post- study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific informat ion needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the p otential subject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be 
given the option of being inf ormed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_11274].  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the ph ysician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the  group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed co nsent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected.  
 
 
 
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_139732] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to with draw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek inf ormed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of  a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, t he use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determ ine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not

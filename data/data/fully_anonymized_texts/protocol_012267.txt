6 1. STUDY TITLE 
Open Label Study to Evaluate the Safety of Copaxone® and to Monitor the Neurologic Course of 
Disease in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated with Copaxone® 
2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Background  
Copaxone® injection is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow, sterile, nonpryrogenic solution for 
subcutaneous injection. Each 1.0 mL of solution contains 20 or 40 mg of glatiramer acetate and 
40 mg mannitol, USP.  Glatiramer acetate is the generic name [CONTACT_905666]®. It is composed of a mixture of acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides 
prepared from four naturally occurring amino acids L- glutamic acid, L -alanine, L -tyrosine, and 
L-lysine.  
Copaxone® (glatirame r acetate for injection,  formerly known as Copolymer 1 [ COP -1]), was 
approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) on [ADDRESS_1270974] non-interferon agent demonstrated to reduce the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).  
Glatiramer acetate was designed to treat MS specifically by [CONTACT_905619].  
Mechanism of action studies support the hypothesis that binding of glatiramer acetate to the 
MHC II groove may lead to 2 effects that positively moderate the pathogenesis of experimental 
allergic autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and MS: 1) glatiramer acetate induces specific suppressor T cells, and 2) glatiramer acetate inhibits specific effector T cells.  Glatiramer acetate 
is believed to initiate its immunomodulatory effects at the site of subcutaneous injection, with subsequent systemic distribution of these locally activated T cells.  
The evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Copaxone
® is based primarily on 2 adequate 
and well controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518]  (Bronstein et al 1987; Johnson et al 1995). These trials were 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term, fixed dose studies. In both studies, the objective was to assess the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic efficacy of 20  mg Copaxone
® self-
administered subcutaneously daily in patients with relapsing- remitting MS.  Both studies were 
designed to last [ADDRESS_1270975] trial was exten ded up to 35 
months. 
In these previous studies of Copaxone® in MS patients, no clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities were associated with Copaxone® therapy during nearly [ADDRESS_1270976] commonly observed adverse experiences associated  with the use of Copaxone® in the 
largest pi[INVESTIGATOR_905600].  The most common of these local 
reactions were pain, erythema, and inflammation.  The majority of injection site reactions were 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
7 reported as mild, and although common in patients treated with Copaxone®, were also observed 
in patients treated with placebo.  
Some patients, including those assigned to placebo, reported symptoms consistent with the 
transient, self -limited, systemic reaction that may immediately fo llow subcutaneous injection, as 
originally described by [CONTACT_905620]. This reaction was characterized by [CONTACT_905621] (flushing) or chest tightness with palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], anxiety, and/or dyspnea (shortness of breath). These symptoms generally appeared withi n minutes of injection and lasted up to [ADDRESS_1270977] pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], the component adverse experiences of these reactions were cited as the cause for discontinuation of 3% of those patients receiving Copaxone
® and 1% of those receiving 
placebo . Most patients who had this reaction reported 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The maximum number of 
reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_905601] 7 over a course of approximately 845 injections (<0.5%). 
The [ADDRESS_1270978] to the patient selection criteria, resulting in similar 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics between treatment groups across both studies.  
The population included in these studies reflected the characteristics of patients with relapsing-remitting MS.  
In both trials, Copaxone
® significantl y reduced relapse rate.  In the largest trial, Copaxone®-
treated patients exhibited a statistically and clinically significant reduction in number of relapses over a period of 24 months. Copaxone
®-treated patients with baseline Kurtzke Expanded 
Disability S tatus Scale (EDSS) scores of 0 to 6 showed a 29% reduction in the number of 
relapses compared with placebo -treated patients.  Copaxone®-treated patients with baseline EDSS 
scores of 0 to 2 showed a 33% reduction in relapses compared with placebo- treated pat ients.  The 
reduction in relapse rate after up to 35 months of treatment was even greater.  
After up to 35 months of treatment, Copaxone® treatment resulted in a statistically and clinically 
significant increase in the proportion of relapse- free patients.  While 33.6% of Copaxone®-treated 
patients remained relapse free, only 24.6% of placebo-treated patients did so. 
In studies with Copaxone®, there has been no evidence that antibodies are produced which 
neutralize the activity of Copaxone®. 
As of [ADDRESS_1270979] been exposed to glatiramer 
acetate, administered subcutaneously as part of the clinical development program, reflecting total 
of about 19,951 patient -years. The majority are relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  (RRMS) 
patients using the marketed formulation of Copaxone® 20 mg/m L on a daily basis. 
An open-label, randomized, multi- center, parallel -arm study (MS -GA-303; GLACIER) was 
conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of Copaxone 40 mg/mL three times weekly ( TIW ) 
compared to 20 mg/mL daily subcutaneous injections in subjects with RRMS. A statistically 
significant (p<0.0006) reduction in the primary endpoint, injection related  adverse event rate, in 
the Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW group compared to the Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily  group was 
revealed.  Treatment with Copaxone at dosages of 20 mg/mL daily  and Copaxone 40 mg/mL 
TIW was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with RRMS who had been treated 
continuously with Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily  for a minimum of  6 months prior to screening, 
followed by 4 months of randomized treatment with Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily  or Copaxone 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
8 40 mg/mL TIW (Core Phase), then followed by 4 months of treatment where patients were 
offered to continue on with the Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW regimen (Extension Phase). 
2.2. Rationale  
Current treatment regimens for relapsing -remitting MS patients include physical and 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and pharmaceutical intervention to alleviate the dysfunctions of the 
disease (e.g., spasticity, weakness, ataxi a, etc.), the frequency of relapses, and to slow the 
accumulation of physical disability.  
Acute relapses of neurologic impairment may be symptomatically treated with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). There is no evidence, however, to indicate that either of 
these agents alter the long -term course of MS.   
Betaseron
® (interferon beta-1b) is a general immunomodulator approved by [CONTACT_905622] -remitting MS to reduce the frequency of 
relapses.  However, many patients have difficulty tolerating this therapy, which may limit its 
utility.  Also, 38% of Betaseron-treated patients developed neutralizing antibodies over time, that 
were associated with reduced efficacy  (IFNB MS Study Group 1995). 
Avonex® (Interferon beta -1a) is approved by [CONTACT_905623].  During a clinical study, 24% of Avonex -treated patients 
were found to have serum neutralizing activity at one or more time point. The significance of the 
appearance of serum neutralizing activity is unknown ( Avonex Package Insert ). 
Tysabri® (natalizumab), a monoclonal antibody, was approved November 2004 by [CONTACT_905624] r elapsing forms of MS. Tysabri® is given by [CONTACT_905625] a 
doctor’s office or medical center.  Tysabri® was withdrawn February 2005 following 2 cases of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in clinical trials and resumed marketing July 2006 following implementation of a restricted distribution program ( Tysabri Package Insert ). 
Rebif
® (interferon beta- 1a) is approved by [CONTACT_905626].  It is made up of the same amino acids as the interferon beta found in the human 
body. Rebif® is given three times a week subcutaneously  (Rebif Package Insert ). 
Novantrone® (mitoxantrone) is an anthracenedione anti -neoplastic agent. Novantrone® was 
approved by [CONTACT_905627], progressive- relapsing MS and 
worsening relapsing- remitting MS.  Novantrone® is given by [CONTACT_28776] 3 months for 
24 months ( Novantrone Package Insert ). 
Oral disease modifying treatments for relapsing -remitting MS  include fingolimod (Gilenya®), 
teriflunomide (Aubagio®), and dimethyl fum arate (Tecfidera®); these are approved, in the US 
and will soon be approved in Europe. 
Because of the potential loss of efficacy over time with interferon therapy, and the need to 
collect additional long -term safety data for Copaxone®, continuing evaluation of Copaxone® was 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
9 introduced in Amendment 11. In addition, an imaging sub- study was initiated in a previous 
Amendment (Amendment 10) to  provide additional prospective nonconventional magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI ) data for Copaxone®. 
A further amendment (Amendment 12) was  added to the protocol to offer patients the Copaxone 
[ADDRESS_1270980] been taking Copaxone 20 mg daily and are switched to Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW. Overall, the study will continue to provide information regarding the safety of Copaxone administration for both the [ADDRESS_1270981] been on daily 
injections of Copaxone for an extended period of time.  
This amendment (Amendment 13) will extend the study duration for an additional 2 years (until 
month 288). The longer duration of the study will help to better understand the long term safety 
of Copaxone, as the study includes a unique cohort of patients that have been followed continuously. Additionally, the longer duration will help to g ain insight into the disease 
processes and activity in patients with 30+ years of disease. Finally, the extension will help understand the safety and efficacy of Co paxone 40 mg/mL TIW in comparison  to Copaxone 
[ADDRESS_1270982] switched from a cross sectional and longitudinal perspective.

10 3. OBJECTIVES 
This study will continue to provide information regarding the safety of administration of 
Copaxone® to a large number of patients.  It will also provide information regarding the safety of 
Copaxone® administered for up to 26 years, or until the sponsor terminates the study, on 
approximately 60 patients who participated in the original double-blind study. 
The objectives of this study are: 
• To assess the long -term safety of Copaxone® in relapsing- remitting MS patients by 
[CONTACT_905628] 
− Clinical pathology (blood and urine) 
− Adverse reactions  
• To evaluate the long -term neurologic course of the disease in the patients receiving 
Copaxone® by [CONTACT_905629]: 
− Functional system evaluation   
− Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status score 
− Ambulation Index  (AI)  
• To evaluate the neurologic course of the disease in these patients by [CONTACT_905630].  
• To evaluate the imaging course of the disease in these patients receiving Cop axone® 
by [CONTACT_905631] 24 years of continuous Copaxone® 
therapy  and comparing it to a previous scan obtained following 20 and 22 years of 
continuous Copaxone® therapy as well as  to the neurologic course  of the disease 
following 24 years of continuous therapy.

11 4. STUDY DESIGN AND DUR ATION 
This open label study will evaluate the safety of Copaxone® and its effect on the neurologic 
course o f patients with relapsing -remitting MS  (Poser et al 1983). Copaxone® injection, a clear, 
colorless to slightly yellow, sterile, non -pyrogenic solution for subcutaneous injection will be 
given to patients to take either daily  (20 mg dose) or TIW (40 mg dose). It is supplied as a 
single -use pre- filled syringe.  Each 1.[ADDRESS_1270983] been met (see  Section  6), treatment will 
continue for that patient. Patients will b e evaluated every 3 months for safety and every 6 months 
for changes in neurological status.  
Under Amendment 12, patients had  the o pportunity to continue participat ion in the optional  MRI 
substudy, where an MRI examination was  completed at the  next schedul ed treatment visit for 
Amendment 12 (following the 22 year scan) at month 252, the scheduled termination visit 
(month 264) or during an unscheduled visit after 24  years of continuous Copaxone® therapy .  
The 9 university hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905602] s which participated in the Double-Blind 
Study (Protocol 01-9001) are anticipated to collaborate in the conduct of the study extension.

after each scheduled Coordinator Telephone visit and directly to the patient during the scheduled 
annual site visit.  Starting with visits after July 2007 , patients will return unused syringes to the 
study site annually during the site visit where they will be accounted for; unused vs. used 
syringes will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. The sponsor will handle the 
destruction of unused syringes. 
All re maining study drug should be collected and stored by [CONTACT_905633]. 
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270984] be kept at 2oC to 8oC (ie, in a refrigerator).  
5.5. Distribution Site  
Fisher Clinical Services (Allentown, PA) will serve as the US distribution center and will 
maintain a 3-month supply of study materials to ensure continuous dosing at all investigative sites. Additional information on supplies is contained in Section  9.3. 
5.6. Injection Techniques   
In November 2001, the Copaxone autoject 2® for glass syringe self -injection device was 
approved by [CONTACT_905634] y available commercially for use with the Copaxone® 
pre-filled syringe.  Patients in the study may continue to use the manual subcutaneous injection 
technique or may use the autoject 2® for glass syringe. For patients who elect to try the autoject 2® 
for glas s syringe , an autoject 2® for glass syringe , along with directions on how to use it 
(Appendix G ), will be provided and its use demonstrated by a member of the study staff. Patients 
may start or discontinue use of the autoject 2® for glass syringe at any time.   
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270985] previously met all  the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible for the study 
extension. 
• Patients must have participated (been randomized) in the Copaxone Double-Blind 
placebo controlled study (Protocol 01-9001). 
• Gender:  Patients may be male or female.  Women of childbearing potential must 
practice an acceptable method of birth control. 
• Patients must be psychologically and physically stable to participate in the trial as judged by [CONTACT_093].  
Additionally: 
• Patients must have completed the scheduled termination visit for Amendment 12 (month 264).  
• Patients must sign an approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to continuing in 
the study extension or at the first visit in the extension (month  264 which corresponds 
to the termination visit of Amendment 12).  
6.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Any of the following conditions will exclude the patient from entering the study:  
• Pregnancy or lactation.  
• Medical or psychiatric conditions t hat affect the patient’s ability to give informed 
consent or complete the study. 
• Inability to self -administer subcutaneous medication or lack of another responsible 
individual to administer the study preparation daily (for Copaxone® 20 mg), or at 
minimum, 3 times a week  (for Copaxone® 40 mg). 
• Use of approved MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_905603], experimental MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
previous immunosuppressive therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine). 
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270986] been completed to continue in the study 
extension. For  the purposes of this amendment, the termination visit of Amendment 12 
(month 264) , will act as the screening visit for this amendment.  Patients who have completed the 
termination visit and discontinued from the study under the Amendment 12 protocol may still continue in the extension study under Amendment 13; for these patients, the screening visit for Amendment 13 will be a separate visit to the termination visit of Amendment 12.  
The study extens ion will involve 1 investigator visit ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) annually supplemented by 
3 nurse coordinator telephone visits ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  This schedule will maintain contact [CONTACT_905635] a quarterly basis, approximately every 90 days. The study extension period will 
end with the termination visit ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  7.1.5) following 26 years of 
continuous Copaxone
® therapy.  
In addition to MRIs perfor med at month 240, the optional MRI sub- study will involve 2 MRI s 
for active study patients at the annual investigator visit (month 252) or at an unscheduled visit 
around the time of the investigator visits and at the final investigator visit for Amendment 12/screening visit for Amendment 13 (month 264). 
The optional immunological sub- study will involve 2 blood samples, 1 taken during the 
screening visit  for Amendment 12, and 1 at the next treatment visit at month 252. There will be 
no additional immunological assessments under Amendment 13. 
7.1.1. Screening Visit  for Amendment 13 (Month  264)

An unscheduled visit can occur at any time during the study. The date of and reason for the visit 
and any data generated must be documented. Unscheduled visit forms should be placed in chronological order within the Case Report Form binder. 
The patient should be seen and evaluated by [CONTACT_5984]. Unscheduled visits due to relapse 
will be indicated on the case report forms. The patients will be instructed to telephone their site 
immediately should any symptoms suggesting a relapse appear. The neurologist may evaluate 
the patients within 7 days of being informed if more information is required to confirm relapse information. Relapses will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. A completed neurologic 
assessment will be perform ed including Functional Status Evaluation ( Appendix D ) and Kurtzke 
EDSS ( Appendix C ) by [CONTACT_22971]. A decision will be made as to whether the change is 
considered a relapse as defined in  Appendix B . Follow -up visits to monitor the course of the 
relapse will be made at the investigator’s discretion in addition to assessment at the next month ly 
visit.

patient.  
• Loss of patient to follow-up. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Gross noncompliance (i.e., use of less than 50% of prescribed doses in the preceding 3-month period). 
7.3. Concomitant Therapy  
• Symptomatic agents such as anti- cholinergic and spasmolytic drugs are permitted at 
clinicall y appropriate doses. 
• Short- term treatment with corticosteroids will be allowed during acute relapses.  
• Medications not allowed during this trial include:  
− Other investigational drugs. 
− Other approved MS drugs 
− Interferons.  
− Immunomodulator, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive drugs (i.e., 
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.) 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
20 − Long term (>30 days) corticosteroids; overall dose of more than 2,000 mg oral 
prednisone; overall dose of more than 1,000 mg IV methylprednisolone per day for more than 7 days per treatment, with or without an appropriate tapering dose of an oral prednisone. 
• All concomitant medications must be listed in the Case Report Form.  
7.4. Assessment  of Safety  
Special attention will be given to detecting known adverse effects of Copaxone®. In th e previous 
studies of Copaxone® in MS patients, no systemic laboratory abnormalities were observed during 
[ADDRESS_1270989] 
of urinalysis, hematological evaluations, and a br oad screen of blood chemistries (see 
Section  7.7). 
Available data suggest that local reactions at the injection site have been reported more commonly in Copaxone
®-treated than in placebo -treated patients.  Sorenes s, itching, swelling, 
and redness were all reported.  None of these reactions was persistent.  The descriptions of such 
reactions will be recorded in the Case Report Form by [CONTACT_202755]. Appropriate observation will be continued until the patients return to baseline status. 
In previous clinical studies, both Copaxone
® and placebo -treated patients have occasionally 
experienced brief epi[INVESTIGATOR_287751], sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], a feeling of tightness in the chest, 
difficulty in breathing, and associa ted anxiety.  The site should be contact[CONTACT_905638].  A complete description of the event 
should be placed in the Case Report Form.  
The Medical Monitor can be consulted regarding suggested management of the above-mentioned 
adverse experiences.  
Other adverse experiences have been reported during ongoing clinical trials with Copaxone®. A 
full accounting of adverse experiences is included in the package i nsert.  
Any patient withdrawn from the study  for drug -related side effects will be requested to continue 
to be observed by [CONTACT_905639]’s condition returns to the pre-reaction baseline.  
7.5. Adverse Events  
7.5.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. 
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed 
consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event. 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
21 An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this  study, or 
significan t worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present before study entry and do not worsen during this  study will not be considered adverse 
events.  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to co ncomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions  
• drug interactions 
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of this  
study 
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered by 
[CONTACT_11150] (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events.)  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905604] a particular patient.  
7.5.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature [CONTACT_905667].  
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed to the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or judged 
relationship to the study drug. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be 
completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  The 
investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the study has 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the treatment of that patient has ended 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
22 should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the 
procedures described in see Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events by [CONTACT_23501] -ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe”. All reported or observed signs and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnos is on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the 
serious adverse event form.  
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF. 
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug and study procedures, and the severity and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by [CONTACT_093], must be recorded as described below. 
7.5.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:  
Mild:   No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:   Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.5.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug  
The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
23 Term  Definition  Clarificati on 
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  This category applies to adverse events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the ti me they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug.  
• It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-administered.  
Reasonable possibility  
(related)  This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with the study drug administration cannot be ruled out with certainty.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of the study drug, yet a drug relationship clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the study drug.  
7.5.5. Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23455], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
24 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28367], unless there was worsening of the 
preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905605] a relapse will not be considered a serious adverse event unless it is a worsening of the condition beyond expec ted 
disease progression.  
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be  life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
• Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any 
suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an 
important me dical event . 
All occurrences of possible drug- induced liver injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as al l 
of the below, must be reported by [CONTACT_16971] a serious adverse event: 
• alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation of >3x the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• total bilirubin elevation of >2x ULN  
• absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) 
An adverse event that does not meet any of the crit eria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information (RSI) by [CONTACT_16972], severity, out come, or frequency is 
considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the US prescribing information. 
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance will determine the expectedness for 
all serious adverse events.  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
25 [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Se rious Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
that occur during the study period (including the protocol-defined follow-up period, described in 
Section  7.5.2), regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be 
reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported within [ADDRESS_1270990] be reported to the Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., Local Safety Officer . 
Send by [CONTACT_905640] (LSO). The 
email address will be provided in the serious adverse event report form. In the event of difficulty transmitting the form, conta ct the sponsor’s study personnel for further instruction  
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the treatment of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the LSO . The LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance. 
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely: 
• study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug 
(no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information may include the following:  
• age and sex of patient  
• date of first dose of study drug 
• date and amount of last administered dose of study drug 
• action taken 
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
26 • explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and 
treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data 
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known  
• for an adverse event resulting in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug) 
− autopsy findings (if available) 
The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in a ccordance with 
national and local regulations. 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_127643], study procedures, and to underlying disease. 
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/Extensible Markup 
Language (XML) file to the LSO/CRO for submission to the competent authorities, IEC/IRBs, 
and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy form (see Section  7.6). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the study drug or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of Copaxone and the appropriate competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate).  
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate), other measures may be required, including: 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
27 • altering existing research by [CONTACT_23504] 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• altering the process of informed consent by [CONTACT_28450]  
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as 
related to Copaxone 
7.5.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting  
No protocol-defined adverse events for expedited reporting were identified for this study. 
7.5.7. Overdose of Study Drug  
Any dose of study drug (whether the investigational product, reference treatment, or placebo), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 
7.5.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case- by-case basis. To ensure pa tient safety, after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has  been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_23505]. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. 
7.6. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies of women participating in the study and female partners of men participating in the study, if applicable that occur during the study, or within [ADDRESS_1270991] provide the LSO with the 
pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue treatment . All patients 
(or female partners of men participating in the study) who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous or voluntary termination). If the 
pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including 
details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy 
during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after 
withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropr iate. 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
28 If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. 
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an el ective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event. 
7.7. Medication Error and Special Situations  
Any administration of medication that is not in accordance with the study protocol  should be 
report ed on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the 
protocol or as a deviation, in the patients source documents, regardless of whether an adverse 
event occurs as a result. All instances of incorrect medication administration should be 
categorized on the CRF as “Non- Compliance to investigational medicinal product (IMP)”.  
Types of medication errors and special situations: 
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. 
2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. 
3. Misuse: Situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
5. Off-label use: Situations where a medicinal product is intentionally used for a medical 
purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
6. Occupational exposure: Exposure to a medicinal product, as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation. 
7.8. Laboratory Procedures  
Blood samples and urine specimens must be obtained at the appropriate visits. Non -fasting 
samples may be obtained.  Any laboratory samples which are outside the normal range must be 
assigned one of the following codes: 
NS – Not Clinically Significant: A clinically meaningless departure from the normal range.  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
29 LE – Laboratory Error:  Due to a poor sample, instrument error, etc. (the value is not valid). 
PA – Patient Abnormality:  Although the value is outside the normal range, the value is normal 
for that particular patient.  
CS – Clinically Significant: A clinically meaningful departure from the normal ra nge or  a 
clinically meaningful change in the parameter.  All clinically significant values during the study 
are adverse events and must be entered on the “Clinically Significant Lab Values” page of the 
Case Report Form.

For patients who consent to the optional immunological analysis, blood samples will be collected 
at the Amendment  12 screening visit (month 240) and the investigator visit (month 252). There 
will be no additional immunological assessments under Amendment 13. Samples will be analyzed as follows:  

Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270992] reporting and analysis procedures will be employed to present the safety profile of 
Copaxone® and its effect on the neurologic course of the disease.  
8.1. Adverse Events  
The total number and percent of patients reporting adverse events, across and by [CONTACT_905641], will be tabulated for all patients treated.  The number of patients treated will 
serve as the denominator for incidence rate computation. Adverse events will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_905642].  Detailed data displays, 
narrative summaries, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_905606].  
8.2. Laboratory Tests  
Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will 
be displayed for the baseline value, the last value obtained during treatment, and the change from baseline to last observed value. Frequenc y distributions will be presented, by [CONTACT_348244], depi[INVESTIGATOR_905607] “clinically significant” changes from baseline in laboratory values, defined by [CONTACT_905643].  Scatterplots of each continuous- type lab 
test w ill be provided illustrating the graphical relationship between the baseline and endpoint 
values obtained for each patient by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270993] give his/her written consent prior to entering the study. This consent will be 
witnessed and dated and retained by [CONTACT_138984]. A copy of the 
consent will be given to the subject. 
If the Experimental Subject’s Bill of Rights is applicable, this form must also be prepared and 
signed by [CONTACT_905644]. A copy of the Bill of 
Rights must be given to the subject. Some states (e.g., Calif ornia, Oregon, Massachusett s) have 
additional requirements for the informed consent process; these must be adhered to as well if the clinical site is located in one of these states.  
A copy of the proposed consent form must be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), together with the protocol, for approval. A copy of the IRB-approved consent form must be 
submitted to the study monitor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator. Each 
subject’s signed informed consent form ( ICF) must be kept on file by [CONTACT_905645].  
9.2. Institutional Review  
Any changes to the protocol, as well as a change of investigator, must also be approved by [CONTACT_1201], and documentation of this approval provided to the study monitor. Reco rds of the IRB 
review and approval of all documents pertaining to this study must be kept on file by [CONTACT_905646]. Serious 
adverse events must also be reported to the IRB. See Se ction  [IP_ADDRESS] for these requirements.  
Periodic status reports must be submitted to the IRB at least yearly, as well as notification of 
completion of the study, and a final report within three months of study completion or 
termination.  A copy of these reports must be sent to T eva Branded Pharmaceutical  Products 
R&D , Inc.  
The investigator must maintain an accurate and complete record of all submissions made to the IRB, including a list of all reports and documents submitted.  A copy of all site correspondence 
with the IRB should be sent to the study monitor at T eva Branded Pharmaceutical  Products 
R&D , Inc or designee. 
9.3. Drug Accountability 
Each shipment of drug supplies to a center will contain an investigational drug invoice to assist the study staff in maintaining current and accurate inventory records covering receipt, dispensing, and the return of study drug supplies. The invoice will identify for each shipment the lot number and the quantity of study drug and supplies contained in the shipment. 
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1270994] sign the “Shipment 
Receipt” form verifying the quantities received and retain this form in the study binder.  The drug 
supply will be packaged and shipped to the centers in appropriate containers. If upon arrival at 
the investigational site the drug supply appears to be damaged, T eva Branded Pharmaceutical  
Products R&D, Inc. must be contact[CONTACT_905647]. 
Drug suppli es must be kept in a secure, limited access storage area under the recommended 
storage conditions (see Section  5.4).  Only authorized personnel will have access to the drug. 
During the course of the study, the following information must be noted for accurate accountability: the identification code of the subject to whom drug is dispensed, the date(s), and the quantity of drug returned by [CONTACT_423]. Subjects should return all unused pre- filled syringes 
to the study center and the return noted in the ledger. These will be inventoried for patient compliance and drug accountability. These inventory records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_905648]. 
When unused pre- filled syringes are to be returned, the investigator or the nurse coordinator will 
record the returns on the Medication Dispensing CRF verifying the amount of unused pre- filled 
syringes returned by [CONTACT_552166]. In the event that unused pre- filled syringes are not 
returned by a subject for whatever reason, this must be explained and whatever attempts to have 
the syringes returned need to be documented.  
Returned study supplies should not remain in the investigator’s possession.  
One copy of all inventory record sheets and the return statement will be retained by [CONTACT_905649]/her files; the inventory sheets will be included in the return shipment of drug supplies. 
Upon completion of the study, all unused pre- filled syringes  and the drug accountability 
information must be returned to the sponsor, T eva Branded Pharmaceutical  Products R&D , Inc. 
or sponsor’s designee. Teva Branded Pharmaceutical  Products R&D, Inc. or designee will handle 
the destruction of unused syringes. 
9.4. Clinical Produ ct Complaints  
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies or clinical device  supplies used in a clinical 
research study sponsored by [CONTACT_16956]. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited to: 
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center  
with mor e or less than the designated number of units inside) 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
35 • incorrect packaging , or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each investigational cent er will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by [CONTACT_905650] c omplaint form provided by [CONTACT_600398] 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. 
For complaints  involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant  sample s (eg, the remainder of the patient’s dru g supply) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
9.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the product c omplaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain the 
following information, as available: 
• investigational center  number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300] 
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable  
• product name [CONTACT_17009]- label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label 
studies 
• product available for return Yes/No 
• product was taken or used according to protocol Y es/No  
• description or nature of complaint 
• associated serious adverse event Yes/No  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No 
• date and name [CONTACT_905668] 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
36 Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if  not all the required information 
can be obtained  immediately. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor 
will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.  
9.4.2. Handling of Study Drug at the Investigational Center 
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/ or analysis. If this is necessa ry, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the study drug. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all study drug, the sponsor will 
provide the information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 
problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient. 
9.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for record ing and reporting ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
9.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, 
and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the 
complaint has been investigated by [CONTACT_16998], if necessary, a n event  
closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all 
investigationa l centers using the product. 
9.5. Case Report Forms  
Case Report Forms (CRF) for individual subjects will be provided by T eva Branded

44 APPENDIX B.  DEFINITION OF RELAPS E 
The following: "relapse," "exacerbation," "attack," and "bout" are equivalent terms. The term 
"relapse" will be used throughout this protocol. A relapse is defined as the appear ance of one or 
more new neurologic abnormalities or the reappear ance of one or more previously observed 
neurolog ic abnormalities.  This change in clinical state must last at least 48 hours and be 
immediately preceded by a relatively stable or improving neurologic state in the 30 days before 
deterioration. An event is counted as a relapse only when the patient's symptoms are accompanied by [CONTACT_905654] 0.5 on the EDSS ( Appendix C ) or one grade in the score for two or more of 
the seven functional systems (F S) (Appendix D ) of Kurtzke or two grades in the score for one of 
the FS as compared to the previous evaluation. The patient must not be undergoing an acute metabolic change such as fever or other medical abnormality, and a change in bowel/bladder or 
in cognitive function must not be entirely responsible for the changes in EDSS or FS scores.

51 APPENDIX F. ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENT & ADVERSE 
LABORATORY REPORTING  
The t reatin g neurologist should review available information regarding toxicity, adverse clinical 
events, and adverse laboratories associated with the administration of Copaxone®. 
An adverse clinical event  is any adverse change in clinical status which occurs after the patient 
has been enrolled in the study regardless of relationship to the study drug. An adverse laboratory  
is any clinically significant laboratory parameter regardless of relationship to the study drug.  
Clinically significant laboratory parameters are either clinically meaningful departures from the 
normal of the parameter, or clinically meaningful changes in the parameter that are not expected 
as part of a disease process that existed in the patient prior to entry in the study. Every adverse 
clinical e vent and adverse laboratory must be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms. 
All adverse clinical events and adverse laboratories must be evaluated for the following: 
Is it serious?  
What is its severity?  
Is it due to the study drug? 
A serious adverse clinical or laboratory adverse event is one that is fatal or life -threatening, 
permanently disabling, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in congenital anomaly, 
cancer, or drug overdose. ALL serious adverse clinical events or serious adverse laboratories, whether related to the study drug or not, must be reported IMMEDIATELY 
to the Teva Clinical department  by [CONTACT_60839] , and within [ADDRESS_1271002]. 
Any patient experiencing a serious clinical or laboratory adverse event should be immediately notified to the study sponsor, and a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory 
determination should be performed at that time. Reports relative to the patient’s subsequent status must be submitted to th e Project CRA until the adverse event has subsided or until advised 
otherwise.  
The intensity or severity of an adverse clinical or laboratory event is c haracterized as mild, 
moderate, or severe.  
MILD  events are usually transient, require no special treatment, and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
MODERATE  events usually introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  

Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
52 SEVERE  events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and tradi tionally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
The relationship to study drug in causing or contributing to the adverse clinical or laboratory 
event is characterized by [CONTACT_905657] “Due to study drug?”  
The relationship to the study treatment is characterized as follows (N ote: If applicable, more than 
one serious criterion for an individual SAE may be chosen):   
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  
 This category applies to adverse events which, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events, which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the test drug.  
• it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• it does not follow a known pattern of response to the 
test drug.  
• it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is 
re-administered.  
Reasonable possibility  
(related)  
 This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the test d rug administration cannot be 
ruled out with certainty nor felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• it follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.  
• it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.  
• it disap pears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness 
clearly exists.  
• it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.  
 
If the Treating Neurologist classifies the association of the adverse clinical or laboratory event as 
No Reasonable Possibility ( Not Related ), he or she must also provide the rationale for the 
classification as:  
a. Concurrent illness, 
b. Progression/expression of disease state, and/or  
c. Concurrent medication reaction.

54 Step 1:  Depth adjustment  
Check with your physician to determine your correct 
needle depth adjustment, which must be made before 
the “a utoject2® for glass syri nge” is loaded or used.  
1. To set the depth of the needle penetration to 6mm 
(suggested for typi[INVESTIGATOR_905614]), first 
verify that the Cap Remover is fully attached to the 
Depth Adjuster (FIG 1). Screw the Depth Adjuster 
into the Syringe  Housing, using the Cap Remover 
(FIG 2)  until scale mark 6 is level with the end of the 
Syringe Housing (FIG 3). The lower the number shown on the Depth Adjuster, the shallower your penetration depth will be. 
2. If your physician re commends a different injection 
depth, screw the Depth Adjuster further in for 
increased penetration depth, unscrew the Depth 
Adjuster further out for decreased penetration depth. 
 
 
  
 
Step 2:  Loading and using your “auto ject2

Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
4 1. RATIONALE  
The purpose of this amendment is to add an additional 2 years to the study duration, to allow 
collection of additional long term safety data for Copaxone, and to help understand the safety 
and efficacy of 40 mg Copaxone three times weekly (TIW) compared  to [ADDRESS_1271012] switched , from a cross sectional and longitudinal perspective. 
The termination visit for Amendment 1 2 will serve as the screening visit for Amendment 1 3 
(month 264).  
A scheduled treatment visit will occur 12 months after the screening/initiation visit for 
Amendment 13 (month 276). The tests/procedures/neurological visits will be the same as per 
Amendment 12, with the exception of the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and 
immunological procedures. 
Nurse Coordinator telephone visits will occur as per Amendment 1 2 between the screening visit, 
scheduled treatment visits, and the termination visit.  
The termination visit will be 24 months following the screening visit for Amendment 13 
(month 288).  The tests/procedures/neurological examinations will be the same as Amendment [ADDRESS_1271013] of tests for the immunological analyses (as previously 
described in an administrative l etter), although no additional immunological testing will be 
performed under Amendment 13. 
New sections on overdose of study drug and clinical product complaints have been added, in 
accordance with the most current Teva protocol requirements. 
2. FORMAT OF CHA NGES 
The corrections in bold  and strikethrough refer to the section in the [ADDRESS_1271014] also been implemented in the 
schedule of activities and evaluations (Appendix A).  
2.1. Section  2.1. Background  
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
As of [ADDRESS_1271015] been exposed to glatiramer acetate, administered subcutaneously as part of the clinical development 
program, reflecting total of about 19,951 patient-years. The majority are relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients using the marketed formulation of Copaxone
® 20 mg/mL on a daily basis. 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
5 An open-label, randomized, multi- center, parallel -arm study (MS -GA-303; GLACIER) 
was conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of Copaxone 40 mg/mL three times 
weekly ( TIW ; compared to 20 mg/mL daily subcutaneous  injections in subjects with 
RRMS. A statistically significant (p<0.0006) reduction in the primary endpoint, injection 
related adverse event rate, in the Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW group compared to the 
Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily group was revealed. Treatment with Copaxone at dosages of 20 
mg/mL daily and Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW was generally safe and well tolerated in 
patients with RR MS who had been treated continuously with Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily 
for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening, followed by 4 months of randomized 
treatment with Copaxone 20 mg/mL daily or Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW (Core Phase), then 
followed by 4 months of tr eatment where patients were offered to continue on with the 
Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW regimen (Extension Phase). 
2.2. Section  2.2. Rationale  
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
Because of the potential loss of efficacy over time with interferon ther apy, and the need to 
collect additional long -term safety data for Copaxone®, continuing evaluation of Copaxone® was 
introduced in Amendment 11. In addition, an imaging sub-study was initiated in a previous Amendment (Amendment 10) that will be continued and to  provide additional prospective 
nonconventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data for Copaxone®. 
A further amendment (Amendment 12) has been  was added to the protocol to offer patients the 
Copaxone 40 mg three times weekly ( TIW ) formulation while c ollecting safety and tolerability 
data that will be compared clinically, immunologically, and by [CONTACT_905659] [ADDRESS_1271016] 
been taking Copaxone 20 mg daily and are switched to Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW. Overall, the study will continue to provide information regarding the safety of Copaxone administration for 
both the [ADDRESS_1271017] been on daily injections of Copaxone for an extended period of time. 
This amendment (Amendment  13) will extend the study duration for an additional 2  years 
(until month  288). The longer duration of the study will help to better understand the long 
term safety of Copaxone, as the study includes a unique cohort of patients that have been 
followed continuously. Additionally, the longer duration will help to gain insigh t into the 
disease processes and activity in patients with 30+ years of disease. Finally, the extension will help understand the safety and efficacy of Copaxone 40 mg/mL TIW in comparison to Copaxone [ADDRESS_1271018] switched from a cross sectional and longitudinal perspective.  
2.3. Section  3. OBJECTIVES  
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
6 It will also provide information regarding the safety of Copaxone® administered for up to 24 
26 years, or until the sponsor terminates the study, on approximately 70 60  patients who 
participated in the original double-blind study. 
2.4. Section  4. STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION  
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
Patients will be offered the opportunity to continue in this trial for an addi tional [ADDRESS_1271019]  had the opportunity to continue 
participation in the optional MRI substudy, where an MRI examination will be  was completed at 
the next scheduled treatment visit for Amendment 12 (following the 22 year scan) at month 252, 
the scheduled termination visit (month  264) or during an unscheduled visit after 24 years of 
continuous Copaxone® therapy.  
2.5. Section  6.1. Inclusi on Criteria 
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
Additionally: 
• Patients must have completed the scheduled termination visit for Amendment 11 12 
(month 240 264).  
• Patients must sign an approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to continuing in 
the study extension or at the first visit in the extension (month  240 264 which 
corresponds to the termination visit of Amendment 11 12).  
• For participation in the optional MRI sub-study, patients must sign an approved ICF 
prior to any MRI procedures taki ng place.  
• For participation in the optional immunological sub study, patients must sign an 
approved ICF prior to any blood being taken.  
2.6. Section 7.1. Schedule of Activities and Evaluations  
Change to read (changes in bold and strikethrough):  
Screening visi ts through month [ADDRESS_1271020] been completed to continue in the study 
extension. For the purposes of this amendment, the termination visit of Amendment 11 12 
(month 240 264), will act as the screening visit for this amendment. Patients who have 
completed the termination visit and discontinued from the study under the Amendment 11 12 
protocol may still continue in the extension study under Amendment 12 13 ; for these patients, 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
7 the screening visit for Amendment 12 13 will be a separate visit to the termination visit of 
Amendment 11 12.  
The study extension will involve 1 investigator visit (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) annually supplemented by 
3 nurse coordinator telephone visits (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). This schedule will maintain contact [CONTACT_905635] a quarterly basis, approximately every 90 days. The study extension period will 
end with the termination visit (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  7.1.5) following 24 26 years of 
continuous Copaxone® therapy.  
In addition to MRIs perfor med at month 240, the optional MRI sub- study will involve 2 MRIs 
for active study patients at the annual investigator visit (month 252) or at an unscheduled visit around the time of the investigator visits and at the final investigator visit for Amendment  12/screening visit for Amendment  13 (month 264). 
The optional immunological sub- study will involve 2  blood samples, 1 taken during the 
screening visit for Amendment 12, and 1 at the next treatment visit at month 252. There will be no additional immunological assessments under Amendment  13. 
2.7. Sectio n 7.1.1. Screening Visit for Amendment 12 13 (Month 240 264)

7.4.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
9 According to FDA guidelines, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any undesirable 
event experienced by a patient that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or 
precaution whether or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_093]. A serious adverse event is 
defined as an event that is:  
• Fatal or life threatening (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient was at immediate 
risk of death from the adverse event);  
• Permanent, persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Requires or prolongs in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191] (except for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905615]);  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
• Important medical events requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent an 
outcome listed above; 
An unexpected adverse reaction is defined as any undesirable event experienced by [CONTACT_905660]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting 
Any serious adverse event occurring during this study must be reported immediately (within 24 
hours) to the Teva Clinical Department at Teva Pharmac euticals, Inc., by [CONTACT_905661]. The SAE reporting requirements are outlined in Section 9.5. Any 
serious adverse event occurring after completion of the study must be reported if the investigator 
becomes aware of it.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Follow Up 
Patients who have a SAE should be followed clinically until all parameters (including 
laboratory) have either returned to normal or are otherwise explained. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Minor Adverse Event 
Any adverse event that does not meet the defin ition of a SAE is considered by [CONTACT_594448] a 
minor adverse event. These events should be recorded by [CONTACT_1755]/or nurse 
coordinator on the “Adverse Experience” page in the Case Report Form. All events should be 
entered whether or not the even t is considered study drug related.  
2.15. Section 7.5. Adverse Events  
(New section , including subsections as presented below) 
7.5.1. Definition of an Adverse Event 
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1271022], regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the 
informed consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course 
of this  study, or significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the 
worsening of a pre- existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic 
conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse events.  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre -existing conditions 
• drug interactions  
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of this study  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or are considered by [CONTACT_11150] (Note: Abnormal laborator y test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering 
the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events.)  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905616] a particular patient.  
7.5.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that ti me 
period from signature [CONTACT_905667].  
Amended Protocol 01-[ADDRESS_1271023] be reported immediately (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The investigator does not need to actively monitor pat ients for adverse 
events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the 
treatment of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described i n see Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events by [CONTACT_117907] “Have you had any unusual 
symptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe”. All reported or 
observed signs and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded 
whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any 
test findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the serious adverse event form.  
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at  suitable intervals until 
resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF.  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug and study procedures, and the severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by [CONTACT_093], must be recorded as described below.  
7.5.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:  
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities 
.5.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
12 The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No 
reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly 
due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the 
following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug.  
• It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state , environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the study 
drug is re -administered.  
Reasonable 
possibility  
(relat ed) This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the study drug administration cannot be ruled out with certainty.  The relationship of an adverse event may be 
consi dered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the 
following apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environmen tal or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the study drug, yet 
a drug 
relationship clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.  
 
7.5.5. Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in a ny of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
• a life threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
13 • inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which means 
that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23455], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event  
Hospit alizations scheduled before the patient signed the informed consent form 
will not be considered serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905617] s steroid treatment of a relapse will not be 
considered a serious adverse event unless it is a worsening of the condition beyond expected disease progression.  
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• an important  medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug d ependency or drug abuse. 
Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product 
is considered an important medical event.  
All occurrences of possible drug induced liver injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as all of the belo w, must be reported by [CONTACT_16971] a serious adverse 
event:

An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information (RSI) by [CONTACT_16972], severity, outcome, or frequency is 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
14 considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the US prescribing 
inform ation. 
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, all serious adverse events (as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) that occur during the study period (including the protocol defined follow up period, 
described in Section 7.5.2), regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_1271024] be reported to the Teva Branded Pharmaceutical 
Products R&D, Inc., Local Safety Officer . Send by [CONTACT_905640] (LSO). The email address will be provided in the serious adverse event report form. In the event of difficulty transmitting the form, contact [CONTACT_456]’s study personnel for further instruction  
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once this 
study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the treatment of that 
patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of 
them.  
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the LSO . The LSO will forward the report to the spons or’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance. 
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely:  
• study number  
• investigator and investigational center identification 
• patient number  
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event  
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study 
drug (no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information may include the following: 
• age and sex of patient 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
15 • date of first dose of st udy drug  
• date and amount of last administered dose of study drug  
• action taken 
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness 
• concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and 
regimens) and treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data 
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known  
• for an  adverse event resulting in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug)  
− autopsy findings (if available) 
The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_905662], study procedures, and to underlying disease.  
Additional information (follow up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
form/Extensibl e Markup Language (XML) file to the LSO/CRO for submission to the 
competent authorities, IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to regulations. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a 
pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.6). 
Amended Protocol 01-9004 Following Amendment No. 13 Summary of Changes  
16 [IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Res ponsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the study drug or study 
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of Copaxone and the appropria te competent authorities (and 
IEC/IRB, as appropriate). 
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other measures may be required, including:  
• altering existing research by [CONTACT_23504] 
• discontinuing or suspending the study  
• altering the process of informed consent by [CONTACT_905663]

All pregnancies ( pregnancies of women participating in the study and partne rs of men 
participating in the study ) that occur during the study, or within [ADDRESS_1271025] provide the Teva Clinical 
Department with the pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that 
for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  7.4.1).  
Any patient becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. All patients (or partners) 
who become pregnant will be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age),  details of 
birth, and presence or ab sence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and 
newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy will be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.  
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report only on the 
pregnancy form.  
All pregnancies of women participating in the study and female partners of men 
participating in the study, if applicable that occur during the study, or within [ADDRESS_1271026] provide the LSO with the pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as  that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue treatment. All 
patients (or female partners of men participating in the study) who become  pregnant will 
be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 
weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of 
pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal f rom the study will be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.

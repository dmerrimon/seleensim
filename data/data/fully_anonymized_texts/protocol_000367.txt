 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  
 
A. Purpose  
 
1. To determine  if ventral surgery is more cost -effective compared to dorsal (fusion or 
 laminoplasty ) surgery . 
2. To determine the relative  cost-effective ness between anterior cervical discectomy and 
 fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical fusion (PCF), and cervical laminopl asty. 
 
A. Background  
 
This study aims to compare the cost of care of anterior versus  posterior surgical approaches 
for the management of Cervical Spond olytic Myelopathy ( CSM ).  Due to th e significant gap in 
today’s  literature , we aim to conduct a post  hoc analysis of data from the randomized trial 
“Cervical  Spondylotic Myelopathy Surgical Trial ” (www.ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; LCID#  2013 -085) to determine  the cost effectiveness of various procedures 
as related to the management of CSM.  Specifically, we aim to compare 1) the cost 
effectiveness of ventral surgery versus dorsal ( fusion or laminoplasty ) surgery; and 2) to 
determine the relative cost -effectiveness between anterior cervic al discectomy with fusion 
(ACDF), posterior cervical fusion (PCF), and cervical laminoplasty.  
 
The aforementioned study that the proposed analysis is based on was  conducted in 
collaboration between multiple academic institutions in North America . The resulting clinical 
and patient -reported outcomes from the  CSM -S RCT suggested similar effectiveness  in both 
anterior and posterior surgical approaches.  Of note, the st udy showed that cervical 
laminoplasty, a relatively low instrumentation -related cost procedure, was effective in 
managing CSM. The findings of the proposed analysis will offer further consideration on 
patient financial burdens as related to CSM management to better improve  related clinical 
decision -making for both patients and their providers.  
 
 
B. Specific Location of Study  
 
This is a post  hoc analysis of data from a multicenter randomized clinical trial entitled “Cervical 
Spondylotic  Myelopathy Surgical Trial ” (www.ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , 
which took place in eleven institutions across North America . Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_663290] . 
 
C. Duration of Project  
 
Statistical  analysis and manuscript writing is expected to be completed within a [ADDRESS_895512] hoc anal ysis will be conducted on the following data that were collected during the 
trial (LCID# 2013 -085) The study flow schema is outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_895513] hoc study wil l utilize the health resource information,  well-known quantitative 
scales to measure functional outcomes  (SF-36, Oswestry Neck, mJOA, and EuroQol -
5D taken at pre -op, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 
years ), costs related and inc idence of re -operations and complications at 30 days and 
1 year after surgery  to compare the costs related to each procedure : comparing the 
cost effectiveness of ventral surgery versus dorsal (fusion or laminoplasty) surgery 
and comparing the relative cost -effectiveness between anterior cervical discectomy 
with fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical fusion (PCF), and cervical laminoplasty.  Quality 
of life measures (I.e. SF -36 as one overall score per timepoint ) will be utilized to  
determine patient satisfaction with the procedure of choice and subsequently  create a 
comprehensive snapshot for clinical decision making . Utilization of  quality -of-life 
scales will help relate success of the procedure as deemed  by [CONTACT_663291].  
2. Health resource utilization information was collected using patient diaries along with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_663281] [ADDRESS_895514]  will be estimated for each patient from a societal perspe ctive and will 
include the following components : 
I.  Index Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663282] – performed on all patients :  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41251]: Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960] (Total  HC) will be used to estimate costs 
using hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -specific and year -specific Medicare cost -to-charge ratios (CCR). 
The costs will be adjusted for inflation to the latest year of the study (2018) without 
a 3% discount. – Assumptions : cost -to-charge ratios for  all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663283]. Data will be complete for all patients from all sites.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663284] (i.e., radiology, pharmacy, 
physiotherapy , and occupational therapy) will be converted to costs using hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
specific and year -specific CCRs.  This will allow the identification of the major 
drivers of the difference in cost between the surgical strategies. A crosswalk 
between the revenue center  and the cost center will have to be created. – 
Assumptions : Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663285]. All patients will have charges segmented in this manner. No 
major differences in how total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663286].  
• For professional services (identified with either HCPCS code or CPT -4 codes) 
provided to patients during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], costs will be calculated using 
national reimbursement amounts from the appropriate Medic are fee schedules for 
the respective year.  – Assumptions : Detailed line -item services of all HCPCS 
codes and CPT -4 codes (including any necessary billing modifiers) will be provided 
for all professional services. Data will be complete for all patients from  all sites.  
 
   
 
   
 II. One-year All -Cause Cost – performed on patients from sites capturing 1 year 
utilization :  
• One-year all -cause costs will be calculated for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663287].  – Assumptions : The same underlying 
assumptions described above.  
 
III. Time to Return to Work – performed on all patient s reporting employment :  
• We will assume that the work halted for patients on the procedure date).  
• For patients to whom this outcome applies, we will compare differen t cohorts using 
return to work as a time -to-event outcome.  
o Lost wages will be estimated using the median weekly earnings in the US 
as reported by [CONTACT_589128].   
▪ Patients providing no employment information will be assumed to 
have zero lost wages.  
▪ Job-specific wages will not be estimated.  
 
IV. Index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663288] -year all -cause costs will be combined with costs 
due to loss of productivity (indirect costs) to estimate total costs for each patient from 
a societal perspective.

Study Protocol  
 
Background:  
 
Colonoscopic  polypectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the [LOCATION_002] . (1)  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_547616], there is a remarkable absence of data 
regarding which polypectomy techniques most effectively remove polyps and minimize complications.  As 
a result, polypectomy practice is based on the observational experience of experts and is how it is taught 
by [CONTACT_547642].  It is not surprising therefore, that polypectomy 
practice  is not consistent across the U.S., particularly for polyps in the 4- 6 mm range, with 19% of 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547617], 21% using hot forceps, 31% using a hot snare, 15% using a cold snare, 
and the remainder using a combination of these techniques. ( 2) For polyp s [ADDRESS_716638], 
there is much less variation in polypectomy technique, with 80% of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547618] a hot snare. (2)  
 The effectiveness of colonoscopy in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) depends on polypectomy 
(3, 4); most polyps removed during colonoscopy are < 1 cm in size.  Because of their greater prevalence 
relative to larger polyps, polyps < [ADDRESS_716639] -polypectomy bleeding 
(even though the absolute risk is higher with larger polyp s) (5).  Perhaps more concerning, several 
studies of surveillance colonoscopy have reported finding CRC within a few years of a complete 
colonoscopy . (6, 7)  Nearly 30% of these cancers have occurred in colonic segments where prior 
polypectomy was performe d, suggesting that incomplete removal may be responsible for the recurrence 
of neoplasia; in more than half of these cases, the initial polyp removed was 1 cm or less in size. ( 7) 
Unfortunately, these studies are limited because the precise location of the polypectomy site relative to 
the subsequent cancer is uncertain.   
  
As mentioned previously, there is a remarkable absence of data on polypectomy techniques with which to 
guide endoscopic practice; indeed, there are no randomized trials of polypectomy techniques published 
as full manuscripts.  There is one abstract comparing hot snare, cold snare, and hot forceps in the removal of [ADDRESS_716640] more frequent residual tissue with hot  biopsy forceps ( 8).  Given the prevalence of the 4- 6 mm polyp, the 
variation in polypectomy technique among endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and the concern about interval cancers at polypectomy sites, there is a clear and significant need to determine which technique(s) ar e most 
appropriate for clinical practice in terms of having the lowest risk for recurrent neoplasia and for major 
adverse effects (major bleeding, perforation).  
 
The goal of this line of research is to determine the superior method for polypectomy (cold b iopsy 
forceps, cold snare, or hot snare) in the removal of adenomatous colonic polyps that are 4- [ADDRESS_716641] 700 persons per group (at least  2100 persons total ).  (A trial powered 
to compare complication rates would require a sample size that is an order of magnitude greater than this 
and is beyond the feasibility and scope of both pi[INVESTIGATOR_547619].) Further, patients would need to 
undergo [ADDRESS_716642] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_547620]:  
1. the feasibility of conducting a definitive, single -institution, multi -site clinical trial comparing the 
three modalities for removing adenomatous colonic polyps 4- 6 mm.  The processes that will be 
assessed are patient enrollment, recruitment, exclusion,  and determination of final eligibility for 
the trial.  
2. the numbers of patients at each site (IU Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Wishard Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) who would be 
candidates for the larger, definitive study (This information will help estimate the time line and 
resources required for the definitive study).  
3. the proportions of recruited patients that fall into the 3-  and 5 -year surveillance groups (or other  
surveillance interval, along with the reason(s) for the interval).   
 
Hypotheses:  
1. A single -institution, three -site clinical trial is feasible: patients can be recruited and enrolled as 
potential subjects; final eligibility based on endoscopic and histological findings can be 
established within a week of enrollment.  
2. We can identify the number of patients at each site who would be eligible for participation in a 
larger, more definitive study, from all patients undergoing colonoscopy. We can establish refusal 
and exclusion rates. (Knowing both rates is necessary for planning the larger study.)  
3. The proportion of recruited patients in the 5- year surveillance group is approximately 80% of all 
persons with neoplasia; the remaining 20% comprise the 3- year s urveillance group.  
 
Study design: Randomized trial  
 
Study setting : Indiana University Medical Center - specifically, the endoscopy units at Indiana University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Wishard Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547621] – Springmill.  
 
Eligibility criteria :  Persons undergoing screening, surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy who are found 
to have 1 or more adenomatous colon polyps 4- 6 mm in size with Paris morphology of types I or IIa in 
well-defined segments of the colon.  
 
Pre-randomization exclusion cr iteria : Patients with any of the following will be excluded:  
 
1. Inability to provide informed consent  
2. Requirement for long -term anticoagulation or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (plavix)  
3. Known INR ≥ 1.5  
4. Less than satisfactory colon preparation  quality  
5. Inability to intubate the cecum  or reach the surgical anastomosis in case of cecectomy  
6. Age greater than  75 
7. Inpatient status (acute lower GI bleeding, etc.)  
8. Comorbidity that precludes the need for surveillance  
9. Pregnancy  
10. Already included in the protocol  
11. Pre- solid organ transplantation  
 
Operational steps to the study : 
 
1. Prior to beginning patient recruitment, all participating endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], study investigators, and research 
assistant (RA) will meet to review the protocol and to establish familiarity with the Paris morphology.  
 
2. Potentially eligible patients will be told i nitially about the study by [CONTACT_547643] -
procedure area during the process of pre- colonoscopy  preparation.  Patients will learn about the 
purpose and design of the study and will be told that the physician endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547622] y 
in more detail after obtaining informed consent for the colonoscopy, and will then ask patients if they 
would like to participate.  
 
3. After obtaining informed consent for the colonoscopy itself , the physician endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547623].  The informed consent form for the study will be 
signed by [CONTACT_547644].  
 4. Colonoscopy will be performed in standard fashion. The endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547624] (such behavior is / ought to be 
the standard of care).  (3) During withdrawal of the colonoscope, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547625]: a) polyp location (segment of the colon t he 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547626]; distance in centimeters from the anal verge); b) polyp 
size (as measured with open biopsy forceps  or the end of a closed snare ); c) polyp morphology  (flat, 
sessile, or pedunculated).  As soon as the endoscopic criteria for study inclusion are met (one colonic 
sessile polyp 4- 6 mm in maximal diameter  with Paris morphology type I or IIa), patients will be 
randomized to one of the three polypectomy techniques using a system of consecutively numbered, 
opaque envelope s from a box located centrally within each endoscopy unit.  
 
5. Once the patient  has been assigned to a specific polypectomy technique, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547627].  All size - and morphologically -eligibl e 
polyps removed as part of the trial in an individual patient will be removed using the same assigned 
technique. For cold biopsy polypectomy, we will use standard- sized radial jaw [ADDRESS_716643] forceps passage to completion of polypectomy or to determination that the polyp is not retrievable 
(i.e., was lost).  For cold and hot snare polypectomy, we will use small snares, and will record the 
number of times the snare is used to remove polyp tissue. The time to perform cold or hot snare 
polypectomy will be recorded as the time from initial passage of the snare to polyp retrieval in the 
scope or determination that the polyp is not retrievable. For hot snare polypectomy, the type and 
intensity  of current will be recorded as well. The time required for polyp removal will be measures by 
[CONTACT_547645] a stopwatch.  
 6. Upon completion of the biopsies from the polypectomy site, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547628] t o [ADDRESS_716644] left of the polypectomy site.  For polyps of different sizes and /or 
Paris morphologies, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547629].  
Polypectomy sites for these other si ze and morphology polyps will not be marked with SPOT .  
 8. Patients will be discharged in the usual fashion. They will eventually receive their pathology  results as 
well as endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547630].  
 9. For polyps removed as part of the tri al, polyp histology will be determined by a single, dedicated 
pathologist.  (For the other, non- trial polyps, the scheduled pathologist will interpret these specimens.)  
Patients whose study polyp(s) biopsy (ies) shows a non- neoplastic polyp (s) will be excluded post -hoc 
from the protocol; however, the numbers and clinical characteristics of these patients will be tracked. 
Based on the endoscopic and histological findings, all patients with at least one neoplastic polyp will be generally recommended to have a surveillance colonoscopy as follows:  
 
a. For 1 -2 tubular adenomas  (TA), 5-10 years  
b. For 3 or more TAs, 3 years  
c. For a TA >= 1 cm, a polyp with villous histology, or one with high- grade dysplasia, 3 years  
d. For a large sessile polyp removed pi[INVESTIGATOR_411181], 3- 6 months  
 10. The dedicated RA will maintain a database of all information, which is to include:  
a. Patient demographics – per ProV ation report  
b. Procedure indication – per ProVation report  
c. Prep quality – per ProVation report  
d. Procedure findings, per ProVation report. For all polyps, the following variables will be included:  
i. Location, size, morphology, and type of polyp(s)  
ii. Method used for polyp removal  
iii. Path results for each polyp (from the electronic medical record [EMR] ) 
e. For the study polyp(s), the following variables will be recorded:  
i. Location, size, morphology, and type of polyp  
ii. Method used for polyp removal – cold forceps, hot/cold snare 
iii. Amount of time required for polyp removal and retrieval  
iv. For hot -snared polyps, the type and intensity  of current used  
v. Amount of SPOT  injected  
f. Path results – both overall and for the study polyp(s)  
g. Recommendation for surveillance exam interval  
 
11. Participating patients’ charts will be labeled to indicate that they are participating in a surveillance 
study to alert endoscopy personnel who encounter them in endoscopic follow -up.  
 
12. On a weekly basis, the RA will review all colonoscopy reports from all three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547631]: a) are included in the trial (with final determination to be made after polyp histology is 
established), and; b) were eligible for the trial based on endoscopic and histological findings, but who 
either refused to participate , were not approached, or met at least one pre -randomization exclusion 
criterion. Post -randomization exclusions , which will be tracked by [CONTACT_21118], will be based on 
endoscopic findings as described in the procedure report and polyp histology as described in the 
pathology report  or EMR .  
 
13. On a weekly basis, the RA also will review the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s’ recommendations for surveillance for 
those patients who are enrolled into the trial cohort, and will record the suggested / recommended 
surveillance interval, along with reason(s) for deviation from the Multi-Society Task Force guidelines 
for surveillance ( 9).  
 
 
Projected numbers:  
 
A total of 5,[ADDRESS_716645] 
of these procedures would be ineligible for the study. Of the remaining 3,600, about 20% (720) would qualify for initial study inclusion (based on polyp size and morphology). Considering histological findings 
to determine final study inclusion, about 75% (540) would qualify.  Our goal was to recruit 6 patients per 
week to the study over a roughly 35 week period, for a total sample size of 210, o r 70 persons in each 
group.   We discovered that it has taken much longer to recruit the initial 210 study participants.  In 
addition, given our high number of patients who fail to show for their scheduled appointments, we decided 
to increase the number of study participants to 270, or 90 in each group, to increase the likelihood of 
meeting the desired number of follow up patients.    
 Future Directions:  
 During the conduct of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will begin preparing a grant application to the NIH for the definitive trial and expect to submit it for the first submission cycle following completion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_547632].  We expect the pi[INVESTIGATOR_547633].  The definitive trial will 
include at least the three campus hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (IU and Wishard), and may include, if necessary, Methodist 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547634].  
 
 
Conflict of Inte rest: Drs. Fatima, Rex, and the IU Gastroenterology Faculty have no conflicts of interest 
with the proposed research.

Statistical Analysis Plan : 
 
For the larger, definitive trial, the primary outcome of interest will be the detection of neoplasia at the 
study polypectomy site.  A secondary outcome of interest is detection of neoplasia at any site.  However, 
neither of these outcomes applies to this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Analysis of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958] w ill consist primarily 
of descriptive information, including the number of eligible patients (based on the absence of any pre -
randomization exclusion criteria and the presence of at least one adenomatous polyp that satisfies size 
and morphological criteria) ; and the number of initially randomized patients who were excluded post -
randomization because of non- adenomatous polyps).  Knowing t hese numbers is essential  to planning 
the timeline and personnel needs for the definitive trial. Secondarily, we will compare: 1) the baseline 
features of patients and polyps in each group (cold biopsy polypectomy, cold snare polypectomy, hot 
snare polypectomy) ; 2) time required for polypectomy , and;  3) patients included versus those eligible who 
were not included in the trial.   
 
     
INDIANA UNIVERSITY INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT FOR  
 
A PI[INVESTIGATOR_547635] 4 -6 MM COLONIC 
POLYPS  
 
 
Your doctor has scheduled you for a colonoscopy today. You are being asked to participate in a research 
study, the purpose of which is to compare the different techniques of polyp removal.  People coming in 
for outpatient colonoscopy, who pass our inclusion/exclusion criteria are asked to participate in the study. 
You were selected as a possible subject because you fulfill the eligibility criteria. We ask that you read 
this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.  
 
The st udy is being conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hala Fatima, [CONTACT_547653], [CONTACT_547654], [CONTACT_547655] and [CONTACT_547656].  It is funded by [CONTACT_547647].  
 
STUDY PURPOSE  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare three different techniques of polyp removal. A polyp is a warty 
growth in the lining of the colon that can turn into cancer and therefore has to be removed. The three 
techniques being compared are cold forceps, cold snare and hot snare. All of these techniques are used 
universally for polyp removal and are well tested; this study is designed to compare the three to determine 
which one is the most efficient and effective for removal of polyps 4 -6 mm in diameter.  
 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
 
If you agree to participate, you will be one of 270 subjects who will be participating in this research 
locally. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_547636] a larger study.  
 PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:  
 
If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things:  
 
You will have a colonoscopy performed in standard fashion. During withdrawal of the colonoscope, the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547637]. A polyp 
is a warty growth in the lining of your colon that can turn into cancer and therefore  has to be removed 
when found on colonoscopy. Your final eligibility for the study will be determined by [CONTACT_66923][INVESTIGATOR_459277] a 
polyp is found that fulfills the endoscopic criteria for study inclusion (one medium -sized polyp 4-6 mm in 
maximal diameter).  You  will then be randomly selected for one of the three polyp removal techniques 
using a system of consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes from a box located in the endoscopy unit. 
The three techniques are cold forcep s, cold snare and hot snare polypectomy. Cold forcep s polypectomy 
is performed using cold biopsy forceps that are placed through the biopsy channel of the scope. Cold snare polypectomy is done using a snare that passes down the biopsy channel of the scope. A snare is a wire loop device designed t o slip over a polyp and, upon closure, result in transection of the polyp stalk. 
Hot snare polypectomy is performed using the same device but also utilizes thermal energy to cauterize as it cuts the polyp.  For cold and hot snare polypectomy, we will use s mall snares, and will record the 
number of times the snare is used to remove polyp tissue. The time to perform cold or hot snare 
polypectomy will be recorded as the time from initial passage.  The endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547638].  All eligible polyps removed as part of the study will be 
removed using the same assigned technique. All the techniques of polyp removal resection are standard of 
care in patients undergoing clinical colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Upon completion of polyp resection, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547639] a dye to tattoo the polypectomy site. Although this is not standard of care in the removal of small polyps, dye injection is a well -tested technique which is used commonly in clinical practice to mark 
large polypectomy sites and colonic tumor location. You will be discharged in the usual fashion after 
recovery.  
 After examination of the polyp tissue removed from your colon by [CONTACT_10063], you will receive the results. You will also receive recommendations fro m the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547640] a repeat 
colonoscopy for follow -up of polyps. At the time of your surveillance follow -up colonoscopy, the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_547641].  
 
RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
  
The risks of colonoscopy include:  
1. Reaction to the sedative medication that is given to you to make you comfortable  
2. Bleeding from the lining of the colon if a polyp (a warty growth that can turn into cancer) is 
removed  
3. Perforation, which means making a hole in the colon.  A perforation is generally the most serious 
of complications because it would require surgery to fix it.  The chance of a perforation is less 
than [ADDRESS_716646] procedure precautions will be taken when using electrocautery.  
Electrocautery is the process of burning or destroying polyp tissue by [CONTACT_2363] a small probe with an electric 
current running through it. The polyp is grasped with a loop or snare and is then cut using current through 
the snare. This current helps cut the polyp while preventing it from bleeding. Furthermore, instructions 
will be given to avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219213]-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs for e.g. ibuprofen if cautery is 
used.  
 
There is also a risk of possible loss of confidentiality. This will be minimized by: 
1. Storing records in a locked facility.  
2. De-identifying data by [CONTACT_547648].  
3. Not mentioning the subject by [CONTACT_547649], report or publication.  
4. Protecting the database will with a password and will only allowing access to the study 
investigators and the research assistant.  
All these measures will ensure complete subject confidentiality.  
 
BENEF ITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
 
You will not get any benefit yourself from participating in this study.  However, the potential 
benefits derived from this study would be realized by [CONTACT_547650]. The results of this study will pave the way to conduct a definitive randomized clinical trial. This in 
turn will provide better  understanding of the effectiveness of the various polyp resection techniques for 
polyps in the size range of 4-6 mm.  Determining the superior method of polyp removal is key to effective 
and complete removal of precancerous polyps and hence will play a ma jor role in prevention of colorectal 
cancer.  
 
ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
 
The alternative to participating is to just have your colonoscopy and polyp removal in a standard fashion, without participating in the study.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential.  We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.  Your personal information may be disclosed if required by [CONTACT_2371].  Your identity will be 
held in confidence in reports in which the study may be published and in databases in which results may 
be stored.

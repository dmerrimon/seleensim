Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681869] common cancer in men representing approximately 30% of 
all cancers diagnosed in men. When confined to the prostate gland the disease is curable with 
local therapy. However approximately 50% of men fail local therapy and develop incurable 
metastatic disease. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the mainstay of treatment, not 
only for advanced disease but also in the adjuvant and in certain neoadjuvant settings. ADT 
lowers circulating testosterone levels, induces a remission in 80 to 90% of patients with advanced 
disease, and results in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months, at which time a 
castration resistant phenotype usually emerges. This accounts for the median overall survival of 
23 to 37 months from the initiation of androgen deprivation.  
1.2.   Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Growth Despi[INVESTIGATOR_525368], or by [CONTACT_360676].  Current 
approaches to ADT utilize luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists.  These act 
by [CONTACT_525397][INVESTIGATOR_525369] (LH) 
secretion, and hence a fall in testicular production of testosterone. Although ADT is clinically 
effective in the majority of patients, the adrenal cortex remains active and produces multiple 
androgens including dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_21907] (DHEAS) 
and androstenedione. While not as potent as testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, these 
androgens nonetheless can function as weak agonists for the wild type AR and can stimulate 
mutant AR resulting in cell growth. Similarly, these androgens may be peripherally converted to 
dihydrotestosterone, a potent stimulator for AR, by [CONTACT_98804] 5a reductase1,2.  
Studies have shown that adrenal androgens represent an important alternative source of 
stimulation in a significant proportion of prostate cancer patients. As much as 10% of baseline 
circulating testosterone remains in castrate men, due to the peripheral conversion of adrenal 
steroids to testosterone3. Increased levels of androgen receptor have been documented in CRPC 
cells and confer resistance to antiandrogens in prostate cancer xenograft models4. This 
amplification is hypothesized to result in amplified signal output from circulating low levels of 
adrenal androgens and suggests a role for agents that target the adrenal androgen synthesis 
pathway. 
At the same time androgen production by [CONTACT_525398]. CRPC cells express higher levels 
of enzymes responsible for androgen synthesis, and androgen levels are higher in metastatic 
CRPC biopsies than in circulation5. Using agents that target both this intracrine androgen 
production as well as systemic androgen production therefore have the potential to slow CRPC 
growth.  
1.3. Adrenal Androgens in Prostate Cancer  
Prior studies have shown that suppression of adrenal androgen synthesis can slow the growth of 
CRPC. Ketoconazole is an orally available azole antifungal agent that inhibits the side chain 
cleavage enzyme responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, a necessary 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681870] and 
antiandrogen therapy6.  Approximately 30% of patients enrolled on CALGB 9583, a randomized 
phase III trial of antiandrogen withdrawal (AAWD) alone versus high-dose 
ketoconazole/hydrocortisone experienced a 50% or greater PSA decline. A statistically significant 
(p=0.0001) increase in DHEAS and androstenedione was noted at the time of progression on 
ketoconazole suggesting that, over time, this drug loses its ability to inhibit adrenal androgen 
synthesis.  
Another limitation of ketoconazole, however, is the fact that it is an unselective inhibitor of 
CYP450 enzymes. It inhibits cholesterol side chain cleavage and 11 -hydroxylation7 as well as 
CYP17 activities. The result of this lack of specificity is an almost universal requirement for 
corticosteroid replacement in patients leading to increased cost, potential for morbidity and 
difficulty with compliance. Abiraterone Acetate was developed specifically to address this need. 
1.3.1. The Adrenal Steroid Synthesis Pathway 
The adrenal steroid synthesis pathway is shown below in Figure 1. The enzyme complexes 
inhibited by [CONTACT_525399], are shown. Ketoconazole‟s principal 
mechanism of action is blockade of the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme as well as 
11-beta hydroxylase, as shown, whereas Abiraterone Acetate inhibits the CYP 17A1 complex
of enzymes, with dual c17 lyase and 17, 20 hydroxylase activity. As the figure demonstrates,
the end result of inhibition is a reduction of adrenal androgen production.

Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 7 of 68 1.4.   Abiraterone Acetate  (JNJ212082 ). 
Abiraterone Acetate (JNJ212082, previously known as CB7630) is the 3-acetate and a prodrug of 
JNJ-589485 (previously known as CB7598) suitable for oral administration.  Abiraterone Acetate 
[JNJ- 589485 , 17-(3-pyridyl) androsta-5,16-dien- 3β-ol] was developed as a highly specific 
steroidal inhibitor of CYP17 (17a-hydroxylase/C 17,20-lyase), with two important enzymatic 
activities in the synthesis of testosterone, based on the observation that nonsteroidal 3-pyridyl 
esters had improved selectivity for inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase/C 17,20- lyase.8 JNJ- 589485  is a
potent inhibitor with an apparent inhibition constant of 0.5 nM.  
The chemical nomenclature of JNJ212082 is 3β-acetoxy- 17-(3-pyridyl) androsta-5,16-diene; its 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C 26H33NO 2.  It has a molecular weight of 391.55.  Once absorbed after oral 
administration, JNJ212082 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_267341], JNJ-589485 ( Figure 2).   JNJ-
589485 was the predominant, if not the only form of Abiraterone Acetate detected in blood both in 
preclinical studies and in previously conducted clinical studies.  
Abiraterone Acetate (1000 mg) is FDA approved for use with prednisone for metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer following docetaxel .  It is used in patients whose disease has 
not gotten better with other chemotherapy or hormone therapy.   
1.5. Rationale For Using Abiraterone Acetate in Prostate Cancer 
The major limitation of therapy with ketoconazole is the development of resistance to the therapy 
over time, the high rate of intolerability due to gastrointestinal toxicities, and the multiple drug 
interactions that limit its use in patients with comorbidities. In addition, therapy with ketoconazole 
requires the administration of [ADDRESS_681871] significant drug-drug interactions, it represents a significant 
advance in the management of androgen independent prostate cancer and a desirable 
alternative to ketoconazole.

1.6. Clinical Data with Abiraterone Acetate . 
To determine if inhibition of 17-alpha-hydroxylase/C 17,[ADDRESS_681872] series of phase 1 studies a total of 26 patients were 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 8 of 68 treated with doses ranging from 10 to 800 mg/d. Overall, the results of these studies showed that 
JNJ212082 was safe and well tolerated.  At 500 and 800 mg/d either as single dose or as 
consecutive daily doses, significant decreases in circulating testosterone were observed.  The 
effects of JNJ212082 on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels were also investigated 
especially in patients receiving 12-day continuous dosing at 500 and 800 mg/d.  There were no 
clear clinical signs of mineralocorticoid excess or glucocorticoid insufficiency.  In this multiple-
dose study, basal levels of cortisol were within normal limits, but short Synacthen tests with 
standard doses of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on Day [ADDRESS_681873].  However, the peak 
responses that were below the 500 nmol/L (18 µg/dL) normal threshold were observed only in 
five of the six patients (two at 500 and three at 800 mg/d dose levels).  The clinical relevance of 
abnormal ACTH stimulation test in patients receiving JNJ212082 is unknown.  Results from these 
Phase 1 studies were published in the British Journal of Cancer9. 
A second Phase 1/2 was then performed in which a total of 21 patients were treated with in a 
dose escalation fashion ranging from 250 to 2000 mg/d10.  A total of 3 patients were treated at the 
maximum dose of 2,000 mg/d and no treatment related grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in 
any patient. Two patients at the 2,000 mg/d dose experienced Grade 1-2 hypertension, two 
experienced Grade 1-2 hyperkalemia, and one experienced Grade 1-2 peripheral edema.  
Because a plateau of endocrine effects was seen at 750 mg/d, the 1000 mg/d dose was chosen 
as the recommended phase 2 dose. An expansion to a phase II study was then performed at the 
1,000 mg/d dose in an additional 33 men. A PSA decline of ≥ 50% was observed in 28 (67%) of 
42 Phase I/II patients treated at 1,000 mg/d. Radiographic partial responses by [CONTACT_525400] 9 (37.5%) of 24 phase II patients with measurable disease. Importantly, the addition 
of dexamethasone at disease progression reversed resistance in 33% of patients regardless of 
prior treatment with dexamethasone. 
Abiraterone Acetate was evaluated in a subsequent Phase I study in men with chemotherapy 
naïve CRPC11. A total of 33 men were enrolled, including 19 (58%) who had received prior 
ketoconazole. Fasted or fed cohorts were treated with Abiraterone Acetate doses of 250, 500, 
750, or 1,000 mg daily and single-dose pharmacokinetic analyses were performed before 
continuous daily dosing. Confirmed ≥ 50% PSA declines at week 12 were seen in 18 (55%) of 33 
patients, including nine (47%) of 19 patients with prior ketoconazole therapy and nine (64%) of 14 
patients without prior ketoconazole therapy. Substantial declines in circulating androgens and 
increases in mineralocorticoids were seen with all doses. No dose-limiting toxicities were 
observed. Hypertension (grade 3, 12%) and hypokalemia (grade 3, 6%; grade 4, 3%) were the 
most frequent serious toxicities and responded to medical management. On the basis of 
evidence of clinical responses across several doses, maximization of the intended endocrinologic 
effects, and the favorable safety, dose escalation was ceased at 1,000 mg daily. 
A series of phase II study then evaluated Abiraterone Acetate in men with CRPC. In one study 33 
patients received Abiraterone Acetate 1,000 mg daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in 
continuous 28-day cycles12. Prednisone was added to mitigate mineralocorticoid excess which 
resulted in the hypokalemia and hypertension observed in the Phase I studies. A ≥50% PSA 
decline at week 12 was confirmed in 22/33 (67%) patients. PSA declines of ≥50% were seen in 
26/33 (79%) patients. PSA declines of any magnitude at 12 weeks were observed in 85% of 
patients. Undetectable PSA levels (≤0.1 ng/mL) occurred in two patients. Median time on therapy 
and time to PSA progression were 63 weeks and 16.3 months, respectively. Adverse events 
were typi[INVESTIGATOR_37333] 1/2 and consistent with prior published Abiraterone Acetate reports.  
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 9 of 68 A second phase II study of 58 men with progressive metastatic CRPC who experienced 
treatment failure with docetaxel -based chemotherapy received Abiraterone A cetate  1,000 mg 
daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily13. Twenty-seven (47%) patients had received prio r 
ketoconazole. A ≥50% decline in PSA was confirmed in 22 (36%) patients, including 14 (45%) of 
31 ketoconazole-naïve and seven (26%) of 27 ketoconazole-pretreated patients. Partial 
responses were seen in four (18%) of [ADDRESS_681874]-evaluable target lesions. 
Improved ECOG PS was seen in 28% of patients. Median time to PSA progression was 169 days 
(95% CI, 82 to 200 days). The majority of adverse events were grade [ADDRESS_681875] phase II study evaluated Abiraterone Acetate in 42 patients who previously received 
docetaxel. PSA declines of ≥ 30%, ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% were seen in 68% (32 of 47), 51% (24 of 
47), and 15% (seven of 47) of patients, respectively. Partial responses (by [CONTACT_393]) were 
reported in eight (27%) of 30 patients with measurable disease. Median time to PSA progression 
was 169 days (95% CI, 113 to 281 days). The median number of weeks on study was 24, and 12 
(25.5%) of 47 patients remained on study ≥ 48 weeks. 
Abiraterone Acetate was subsequently evaluated in COU- AA-301, a multicentered randomized, 
double-blind placebo controlled Phase 3 study14. In total 1195 men with CRPC who had 
previously received docetaxel were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to received prednis one 
5mg twice daily plus either 1000 mg of Abiraterone Acetate (797 patients) or placebo (398 
patients). The primary end point was overall survival. After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, 
overall survival was longer in the Abiraterone Acetate–prednisone group than in the placebo–
prednisone group (14.8 months vs. 10.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 
0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). Data were unblinded at the interim analysis, since these results exceeded 
the preplanned criteria for study termination. All secondary end points, including time to PSA 
progression (10.2 vs. 6.6 months; P<0.001), progression-free survival (5.6 months vs. 3.6 
months; P<0.001), and PSA response rate (29% vs. 6%, P<0.001), favored the treatment group.  
On the basis of this study, in April 28th, [ADDRESS_681876] 
majority of patients having received the 1,000 mg/d dose. Overall the most common adverse 
events (≥5%, all grades) observed in clinical studies were joint swelling or discomfort, 
hypokalemia, edema, muscle discomfort, hot flush, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, cough, 
hypertension, arrhythmia, urinary frequency, nocturia, dyspepsia, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348]. In that phase III study common adverse events in both groups were back pain (30% in 
the Abiraterone Acetate group and 33% in the placebo group), nausea (30% and 32%, 
respectively), constipation (26% and 31%), bone pain (25% and 28%), and arthralgia (27% and 
23%). Most of these events were grade [ADDRESS_681877] infection was more frequent in the 
Abiraterone Acetate group (12%, vs. 7% in the placebo group; P=0.02); these infections were 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 10 of 68 also primarily grade 1 or 2 events. Adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation occurred 
with similar frequency in the Abiraterone Acetate and placebo groups (19% and 23%, 
respectively; P=0.09). The incidence of adverse events leading to dose modification or 
interruption was also similar in the two groups. Adverse events associated with elevated 
mineralocorticoid levels due to CYP17 blockade (fluid retention and edema, hypokalemia, and 
hypertension) were observed in the phase I and II studies and were treated with aldosterone 
antagonists, potassium supplementation, and concurrent administration of corticosteroids (see 
section 1.9). In the phase III study the incidence of fluid retention and edema was higher in the 
Abiraterone Acetate group (31%, vs. 22% in the placebo group; P=0.04). Grade [ADDRESS_681878] of these events. Hypokalemia also occurred in a higher proportion of 
patients in the Abiraterone Acetate group (17%, vs. 8% in the placebo group; P<0.001).  
In the phase III study cardiac events (primarily grade 1 or 2) occurred at a higher rate in the 
Abiraterone Acetate group than in the placebo group (13% vs. 11%, P=0.14), but the difference 
was not significant. The most frequently reported cardiac events were tachycardia (3% in th e 
Abiraterone Acetate group and 2% in the placebo group, P=0.22) and atrial fibrillation (2% and 
1%, respectively; P=0.29). All tachycardia events were grade 1 or 2; atrial fibrillation events were 
grade 3 or lower. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_525370], there was no significant increase in fatal cardiac events 
in the Abiraterone Acetate group (1.1%, vs. 1.3% in the placebo group). One death associated 
with arrythmia and one patient with sudden death were observed on the Abiraterone Acetate arm, 
while none were observed on the placebo arm.  
In the phase III study a grade [ADDRESS_681879] 
12 weeks of treatment. Overall, however, abnormalities in liver-function tests occurred at a similar 
frequency in the Abiraterone Acetate and placebo groups, including changes of any grade in 
liver-function tests (10% and 8%, respectively), grade 3 or 4 changes in liver-function tests (3.5% 
and 3.0%), grade 3 or 4 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase levels (1.4% and 1.6%), grade 
3 or 4 elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels (1.0% and 1.1%), and grade 4 elevations in 
aminotransferase levels (0.3% and 0.5%). Across all studies elevations hepatotoxicity was 
observed in 2.3% of patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_55230] [ADDRESS_681880]/ALT returned to normal upon drug discontinuation. 
Overall in the Phase III study grade 3-4 events were rare; compared to placebo-treated patients, 
patients on the Phase III studied treated with Abiraterone Acetate were more likely to experience 
Grade 3-4 hypertension (1.3% vs. 0.3%), edema (1.9% vs. 0.8%), urinary tract infection (2.1% vs. 
0.5%), cardiac failure (1.9% vs. 0.3%), elevated AST (2.1% vs 1.5%), hypokalemia (5.3% vs 1%), 
hypophosphatemia (7.2% vs 5.8%) and elevated ALT (1.4% vs 0.8%). No individual grade 4 
adverse events occurred in 2% or more of patients in either treatment group. 
In the Phase III study a total of 11% of patients in the Abiraterone Acetate group and 13% of 
patients in the placebo group died within [ADDRESS_681881] dose of study medication, primarily 
as a result of disease progression. A lower proportion of patients in the Abiraterone Acetate 
group than in the placebo group had an adverse event that resulted in death (12% vs. 15%). 
1.8. Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Blood specimens from phase 1 studies were analyzed for JNJ -589485 .  Th e pharmacokinetic 
parameters all show considerable variability between patients and are presented in Table 1.  The 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 11 of 68 mean T max was 2.70 hours (+  Std Dev 2.71) with a mean elimination half-life of 27.6 hours (+  Std 
Dev 20.17). A range of up to 10-fold in AUC was seen for a given dose. The level of interpatient 
variability made analysis of dose- dependent pharmacokinetic relationships difficult.  Further 
investigation is required in clinical trials. Adrenal metabolite analysis showed inhibition of CPY17 
even at low doses of Abiraterone Acetate and a compensatory increase of corticosterone was 
apparent at all dose levels tested. 
When administered with food that had high-fat content, drug exposure was signiﬁcantly increased 
(by 4.4-fold) compared with fasting administration (P=0.049; Fig 3D). The variability between fed 
patients was comparable to that observed between fasted patients.  There was no signiﬁcant 
increase in Cmax, but absorption was signiﬁcantly extended after food. Based on these results 
and for consistency in absorption, in all subsequent studies of Abiraterone Acetate patients have 
been instructed to take orally at least 2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal any time up to 
10 
pm every day. 
The maximum dose of abiraterone acetate used in pharmacokinetic studies is 2,000 mg/d. Up to 
2.5 fold variations in AUC were observed at 750 mg/d and 2,000 mg/d cohorts. Figure 3 
demonstrates that despi[INVESTIGATOR_525371].   The terminal half life of the 1000mg dose 
of abiraterone acetate is 14.4 hours.

1.9. Concurrent Prednisone 
Reduced cortisol levels induced by [CONTACT_525401]17A1 lead to a compensatory ACTH surge 
and thereby [CONTACT_525402], hypokalemia, and fluid retention observed in the Phase 1 
and 2 studies.  These side-effects were readily managed with potassium supplementation, 
eplerenone (selective mineralocorticoid antagonist), antihypertensive agents, and low dose 
corticosteroids.  Grade 1-[ADDRESS_681882], pretreatment androgen levels are associated with the likelihood of response to 
Abiraterone Acetate15, suggesting that CRPC tumors rely on androgen signaling for growth and 
survival.  Second, molecular analysis of CRPC tumors has shown that enzymes regulating 
androgen synthesis are upregulated compared to benign tissue, and that intratumoral androgen 
levels are elevated16, suggesting that suppressing both systemic and local androgen production 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681883], circulating 
androgen levels are known to rise at the time of clinical progression on ketoconazole, an agent 
similar to Abiraterone Acetate, suggesting that increases in androgen signaling may lead to 
progression of disease.17 Fourth, the addition of dexamethasone at the time of disease 
progression on Abiraterone Acetate has been shown to induce second responses10, suggesting 
possibly that manipulation of the hormonal milieu even at the time of disease progression on 
Abiraterone Acetate has the potential to reverse Abiraterone Acetate resistance.  Lastly, while a 
pharmacodynamic study of Abiraterone Acetate in men with CRPC did not show consistent rises 
in circulating androgen levels and the time of disease progression18, intratumor androgen levels 
were not assayed and therefore androgen levels within CRPC tumors at the time of progression 
on Abiraterone Acetate are unknown. Similarly, the small total number of patients (n=14) and the 
[ADDRESS_681884] that an increased dose of Abiraterone Acetate can result in a 
higher exposure of CRPC to drug. 
Elevated dose therapy is given at disease progression as opposed the outset of therapy for a 
number of reasons: 
Standard dose Abiraterone Acetate appears to be an effective therapy for the vast
majority of men with CRPC not yet treated with chemotherapy, with close to 80%
response rate and a median time to progression of 11.[ADDRESS_681885] dose „run-in‟
period.
Dose increase at the time of resistance to standard dose therapy will allow for better
characterization of the biology of Abiraterone Acetate resistance both by [CONTACT_525403], and characterization of hormone and PSA
responses to increased dose.
While safe and well tolerated at all dosing levels in phase [ADDRESS_681886] some subjects at risk of
unnecessary toxicity.
As the terminal half-life of the 1000mg daily dose is 14.4 hours, a dose of 1000mg BID
(q12 hours)  is chosen, as this dose is likely to result in consistently higher abiraterone
levels. 4 x 250mg tablets BID is also expected to be easier to take than 8 x 250mg tablets
at once.

Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 15 of 68 1.12. Rationale for using PSA response as the primary endpoint 
PSA response defined as a ≥30% PSA decline from baseline after [ADDRESS_681887] to interobserver bias. Moreover, while objective measures (bone scan, 
CT scan) have been used to define disease progression in Phase III clinical studies of 
Abiraterone Acetate, it is likely that treatment resistance develops long before disease 
progression is radiographically apparent, and in the majority of cases resistance is heralded by a 
rise in the PSA. Similarly, it is expected that most clinicians will use PSA response to make 
decisions about when to stop treating patients with Abiraterone Acetate. Lastly, PSA response 
endpoints, as described in this study, have been recently endorsed as suggested outcome 
measures by [CONTACT_131806]20. Therefore PSA response will 
be used in this study as an endpoint. 
1.13. Rationale for this study  
Determination of the mechanisms of resistance to standard-dose Abiraterone Acetate is 
important in this patient population. Observational data suggests that increased androgen levels 
may allow CRPC to grow despi[INVESTIGATOR_525372]. This study will aid in the 
understanding of resistance to Abiraterone Acetate, and simultaneously test whether resistance 
may be overcome via an increased dose. The study will also allow for a pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic understanding of resistance and may aid in allowing clinicians to risk-stratify 
patients for appropriately dosed therapy. 
This is an investigator initiated study. Janssen Services will be supporting the study by [CONTACT_525404]. 
1.14. Mechanisms of Resistance 
1.14.1. Circulating Tumor Cell and Metastatic Biopsy, and Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Resistance to Abiraterone Acetate is hypothesized to be due to a failure over time of 
abiraterone to inhibit androgen synthesis leading to a rise in intratumoral androgen levels 
and progression of disease. Mechanisms of increased synthesis include amplification of 
CYP17A1 and other genes in the androgen synthesis pathway, changes in CYP17A1 
gene methylation leading to increased expression, or point mutations impairing the ability 
of Abiraterone Acetate to bind to its CYP17A1 substrate. Other mechanisms include AR 
amplification, over-expression, or loss of negative regulators of AR.  
In order to discover the genetic events associated with treatment resistance, genomic 
analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastatic CRPC biopsies are techniques 
which offer the ability to analyze in real-time genomic changes in pathways associated 
with resistance. Quantitative CTC counting has demonstrated promise as a biomarker 
of response in men with CRPC treated with abiraterone and with chemotherapy, and 
qualitative analysis of CTCs offers the potential to interrogate genomic changes 
occurring in the androgen synthesis pathway in men treated with abiraterone .  
Because CTC analysis is exploratory, biopsy of metastatic tissue offers a similar 
potential to evaluate changes in methylation as well as in the expression of CYP17A1 
and other androgen synthesis genes, the androgen receptor (AR) and coregulators, 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681888] 35 biopsy procedures is 74%. Thus, for the 
proposed trial, a similar if not improved success rate is anticipated. Microarray 
analysis of biopsies, in combination with exploratory CTC analysis, therefore has the 
potential to generate a wealth of data and allow for the discovery of both hypothesized 
and novel mechanisms of resistance to Abiraterone. 
1.14.2. Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Signaling mediated by [CONTACT_525405] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_525373], but also 
critical in the progression of disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_525374].  The CYP17A1 
gene is located on chromosome 10q24.3 and encodes the cytochrome P450c17a, 
which is responsible for 17 –alpha-hydroxylase and 17-20 lyase enzymatic activity, 
key steps in the development of androgens ( See Fig 1 ).  Several benign conditions 
associated with androgen excess including male pattern baldness and polycystic 
ovaries in women have been associated with a variant allele of CYP17A1, A2. The 
CYP17A1 A2 allele polymorphism results from a single base pair substitution (-
34T>G) located in the 5‟ untranslated region upstream of the initiation site. The net 
effect of this polymorphism is the creation of an additional Sp-1 type promoter site, 
which is hypothesized to result in increased transcription of the CYP17A1 gene 
leading to higher androgen levels.  The A2 allele is present in approximately 56% of 
the Caucasian population, and 13-15% are homozygous for the A2 allele21.  
A series of studies have associated polymorphisms of CYP17A1 with risk of prostate 
cancer incidence and mortality. Stanford and colleagues, in a population-based study 
of incident prostate cancer, demonstrated that men with a family history of prostate 
cancer who are homozygous for the A2 allele of CYP17A1 have a 19-fold increased 
risk of prostate cancer22. Subsequently, Hamada and colleagues demonstrated that 
the presence of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the CYP17A1 gene is 
associated with survival in patients with CRPC regardless of the therapy given. In this 
analysis, the median survival from the time of diagnosis in patients with the variant 
allele (n=126) was 8.9 years versus 6.7 years in the patients with the A1 (reference) 
allele (P=0.04).[ADDRESS_681889] as a 
drug target. Interestingly, the two studies diverge somewhat in their conclusions 
suggesting that the onset of the disease may be increased  by [CONTACT_525406] (potentially due to tumor promotion by [CONTACT_525407]) yet in patients 
with prostate cancer the SNP may be protective (due to the effectiveness of androgen 
deprivation therapy compared to other approaches). Regardless, these studies did not 
incorporate specific CYP17A1 inhibitors and did not report differences in androgen 
levels.  
Analysis of germline CYP17A1 polymorphisms may therefore aid both in the 
understanding of primary resistance to adrenal androgen targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525375], as well as in the understanding of mechanisms of treatment

To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of therapy with increased-dose Abiraterone
Acetate .
To determine the time to PSA progression and progression free survival (PFS) for
patients treated with increased dose Abiraterone Acetate.
To measure the pharmacokinetics of Abiraterone Acetate at the initiation of standard
dose therapy, at the time of initial disease progression, after the initiation of increased-
dose Abiraterone Acetate, and at the time of disease progression on increased-dose
therapy.
Relationship of circulating androgen levels to increased dose Abiraterone Acetate and
PSA decline.
2.3. Exploratory Objectives  
To evaluate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms within enzymes
inhibited by [CONTACT_525408]-dose and elevated-dose
therapy.
To evaluate whether resistance to Abiraterone Acetate is mediated by [CONTACT_525409], by [CONTACT_525410] (AR) expression signature
[CONTACT_525449].
To evaluate whether resistance to Abirater one Acetate is mediated by [CONTACT_525411], by [CONTACT_525412]17A1 and androgen synthesis
methylation status in metastatic biopsies and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) taken at
the initiation of standard dose therapy and at the time of initial progression.
3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Design 
This is a phase II multicenter trial of Abiraterone Acetate in patients with progressive prostate 
cancer despi[INVESTIGATOR_525376] a particular focus on the pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic events occurring at the time of apparent drug 
resistance. All eligible patients will have baseline (prior to taking the first dose of Abiraterone 
Acetate 1000mg/daily) measures of routine clinical variables along with measurements of 
baseline and treatment related changes in testosterone, androgen, and endocrine levels, 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_525377], and collection of circulating tumor cells. All patients will be requested to consent for 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681891] month, and then every three months thereafter, 
Abiraterone Acetate, testosterone, and androgen levels will be followed. Subjects whose disease 
is not sensitive to Abiraterone Acetate and do not achie ve any PSA decline at 12 weeks will be 
taken off study. At the time of progression (defined by [CONTACT_525413] 2 (PCWG) criteria as a 25% increase in PSA above the nadir and an 
increase in the absolute value PSA of at least 2ng/dl or back to baseline confirmed at least [ADDRESS_681892]) for subjects who achieved any initial PSA decline (referred to as Progressive 
Disease (PD) #1), subjects will begin taking Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg po BID (q12 
hours) . Patients will continue to take prednisone 5mg BID and will continue taking the 
combination of elevated-dose abiraterone and prednisone for at least [ADDRESS_681893] point at which evaluation for PD#2 will be made. If PD#2 occurs at 12 weeks or at any point 
thereafter subjects will be withdrawn from the study.   While 1000 mg po BID is not the FDA 
recommended dose, it is the dose to be investigated in this study.  
3.2. Rationale for Selection of this Patient Population 
Patients with progressive prostate cancer despi[INVESTIGATOR_525378]. There are few effective 
options for this population; these include, among others, ketoconazole, diethylstilbestrol, and 
antiandrogens. None of these options are curative, and only ~20-30% of men will have any 
significant clinical response to agents. Most men who experience PSA progression after a trial of 
these agents will require treatment with chemotherapy, which notably brings risks of 
myelosuppression, neurologic toxicity, and impairments in quality of life.  
Abiraterone Acetate with corticosteroid replacement has been shown to be clinically effective in 
multiple phase II studies in men with chemotherapy-naïve CRPC, with PSA progression free 
survival ranging from 24-[ADDRESS_681894] not received 
chemotherapy. This patient population therefore has the potential to derive benefit from treatment 
with Abiraterone Acetate .  
Increasing the dose of Abiraterone Acetate at the time of disease progression is expected to 
“rescue” a proportion of men failing standard dose Abiraterone Acetate therapy, and thus will 
spare these patients the toxicities that come with most chemotherapeutic regimens.  
Only patients with metastatic progressive castration resistant disease (as evidenced by [CONTACT_525414] 2 criteria20) for bony disease will be included in this 
study to render the population uniform. It will also potentially allow for a higher yield in terms of 
tumor biopsy and CTC collection.

prednisone tapered off.  Patients continuing Abiraterone Acetate/prednisone off-study OR those 
planning to receive subsequent chemotherapy do not need to taper prednisone.  Patients coming 
off study at this point will have off study labs, CTCs, and optional metastatic biopsy (see Section 
5.1.3 ). 
In patients in whom a decline in PSA of any magnitude is achieved by [CONTACT_5875] 12, Abiraterone 
Acetate and prednisone therapy will continue until progressive disease (PD#1) defined is 
documented. Progressive disease is defined by [CONTACT_525419] (as defined in Appendix 
B) OR by [CONTACT_525420]2 criteria (as defined in Appendix C) – requiring a 25% increase in PSA above
the nadir and an increase in the absolute-value PSA levels back to baseline or by 2ng/ml,
confirmed at least 2 weeks afterwards, or by [CONTACT_43877]2 bone scan criteria.  At time of progression
(referred to as PD #1), Androstenedione, DHEA and DHEAS and Abiraterone Acetate levels will
be measured and prednisone will be continued.  Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg by [CONTACT_351327]
(q12 hours) will be initiated after Abiraterone and hormone levels are measured.  ACTH, PSA,
and an electrolyte and liver function panel (“serum chemistries”) will be measured. They will be
measured again [ADDRESS_681919] point at which 
criteria for progressive disease #2 (as defined by [CONTACT_43877] 2 and/or RECIST criteria) may be 
determined. This includes patients who do not achieve any PSA decline in response to  
increased-dose therapy. Once PCWG2 criteria for progressive disease is met the patients will 
come off study. This will be considered PD#2 .  
DURATION OF TREATMENT 
Patients will continue on therapy until any one of the following events occurs: 
oNo evidence of any PSA decline at evaluation #1, after 12 weeks of treatment
oProgressive disease #2, determined after 12 weeks of increased-dose therapy.
oAny unacceptable treatment-related toxicity

Dose reductions in response to toxicity are detailed in Section 5.7  
4.2 Prednisone 
Prednisone is an analogue of cortisol is believed to be the principal hormone secreted by [CONTACT_525421]. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (prednisone and cortisone) have  salt-retaining 
properties and are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. They have 
potent anti-inflammatory effects and modify the body‟s immune response to adverse stimuli.  
Availability  - Prednisone is commercially available in 5mg tablets. 
Administration  - Prednisone is administered orally with food at 5mg every morning and 5mg at 
bedtime. 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 25 of 68 Storage  - Prednisone should be stored in well-closed containers at a temperature less than 
400C, preferable 15- 300C. 
Toxicities  - Prednisone may cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, especially sodium 
retention and potassium loss; muscle weakness; peptic ulcer; impaired wound healing; thin 
fragile skin; petechiae and ecchymoses; psychic disturbances; manifestation of latent diabetes 
mellitus; hypertension; cataracts; weight gain; and nausea. 
Precautions  - Patients who have been on prednisone for longer than [ADDRESS_681920] the 
drug gradually tapered rather than abruptly stopped. If the patient is subjected to unusual 
physiologic stress, increased dosage before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. 
It is recommended that hydrocortisone (an analogue of prednisone) 100mg administered 
intravenously every 8 hours be utilized until the physiologic stress has ended, at which point the 
normal replacement dosage of prednisone (see above) is resumed. 
4.3 Abiraterone Acetate 
Abiraterone Acetate 250-mg tablets are oval, white to off-white and contain Abiraterone Acetate 
and compendial (USP/NF/EP) grade lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, 
croscarmellose sodium, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon 
dioxide, and purified water, in descending order of concentration (the water is removed during 
tabletting).  
Availability  – Abiraterone Acetate will be supplied by [CONTACT_525422] 250mg tablets. 
Administration  – Patients will be instructed to take 4 tablets (1000mg) orally (PO) once or twice 
daily (BID). No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone 
acetate is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken. 
Storage  –Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 
86°F) 
Toxicities  - Abiraterone Acetate may cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, edema, 
hypertension, liver function abnormalities, muscle discomfort, back pain, hot flushes, diarrhea, 
urinary tract infections, cough, arrythmia, urinary frequency, nocturia, dyspepsia, and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
Precautions  - Mineralocorticoid excess: Use Abiraterone Acetate with caution in patients with a 
history of cardiovascular disease. The safety of Abiraterone Acetate in patients with LVEF < 50% 
or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is not established. Control hypertension and correct 
hypokalemia before treatment. Monitor blood pressure, serum potassium and symptoms of fluid 
retention is recommended at least monthly. Adrenocortical insufficiency: Monitor for symptoms 
and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated 
before, during and after stressful situations. (5.2)  Hepatotoxicity: Increases in liver enzymes 
have led to drug interruption, dose modification and/or discontinuation. Monitor liver function and 
modify, interrupt, or discontinue Abiraterone Acetate dosing as recommended. Food Effect: 
Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach. Exposure (area under the curve) of 
Abiraterone Acetate increases when Abiraterone Acetate is taken with meals.  
Drug Interactions  – Based on in vitro data, Abiraterone Acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a 
dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, 
Version date: 02-17- 2014 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 26 of 68 decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during 
Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase 
the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency.  In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co- administration 
of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of abiraterone. 
Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 
Abiraterone Acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. In a 
CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 
substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with 
abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of 
abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., 
thioridazine).   If alternative treatments cannot be used, exercise caution and consider a 
dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. 
In vitro, Abiraterone Acetate inhibits CYP2C8. There are no clinical data on the use of 
Abiraterone Acetate with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8. However, patients should be 
monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to the CYP2C8 substrate if used concomitantly with 
abiraterone acetate. 
Pregnancy  - Abiraterone Acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Men who are sexually active with a pregnant women must use a condom during and for 
one week after treatment with Abiraterone Acetate. If their sexual partner may become pregnant, 
a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for one week after treatment 
with Abiraterone Acetate. Pregnant women or women who may be pregnant should not handle 
abiraterone acetate.  
Handling Abiraterone Acetate Tablets  - This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child if 
taken by [CONTACT_525423]. It should not be taken by [CONTACT_525424]-feeding. 
Women who are pregnant or who may be pregnant should wear gloves if they need to touch 
abiraterone acetate tablets. Study staff and caregivers should be notified of this information, to 
ensure the appropriate precautions are taken.

Patients with bone-only disease at baseline are unlikely to develop new soft tissue disease if 
responding by [CONTACT_525425]/pelvis with CT or MRI until  the time of disease progression #1 (PD#1). If soft-tissue 
disease is found then these patients will undergo q3cycle bone scan and CT or MRI of the 
abdomen and pelvis. If no soft-tissue disease is found at PD#[ADDRESS_681927] or MRI until PD#2.  
Patients with soft tissue-only disease at baseline are unlikely to develop new bony lesions if 
responding by [CONTACT_525426] #1 (PD#1). If bony disease is found then these 
patients will undergo q3cycle bone scan and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. If no bony 
disease is found at PD#[ADDRESS_681928] another bone scan until PD#2. 
If new soft-tissue or bone disease is discovered on a radiologic exam performed for non-study 
reasons then patients should be evaluated with the appropriate (bone scan or CT or MRI of 
the abdomen and pelvis) q3cycle imaging of the lesion. Repeat imaging does not need to 
occur if the last scan was within 8 weeks; if this is the case the next scan should occur at the 
next regularly scheduled assessment (ie if a scan done to confirm PD#1 is obtained during 
cycle 6, the next scan should be at cycle 10) 
5.1.3 Study procedures at the time of progression (PD#1)

5.7 DOSE MODIFICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY 
5.7.1 Adverse Event (AE) Description and Grade : The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_681941] access to a copy of 
the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site. (See Appendix A)   
5.7.2 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers  
Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, 
rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during ZYTIGA treatment. Although there are no 
clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers, 
because of the potential for an interaction, if a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-
administered, increase the ZYTIGA dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-
administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the 
dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer 
is discontinued. See appendix E 
5.7.3 Management of Non-Mineralocorticoid Based Side Effects : 
Management of specific toxicities attributed to Abiraterone Acetate and prednisone are 
discussed in Section 4.2, 4.3.  
If Grade 1-[ADDRESS_681942] or add medications to 
mitigate the toxicity. When resolved to Grade 1 or less resume as follows:  
If subject was taking 1000 mg at the time of a Grade 3/4 toxicity then study drug may be
restarted at full dose.
If subject was taking 1000 mg BID at the time of a Grade 3/4 toxicity, when study drug
is resumed it will be at 750 mg BID (a 25% dose reduction). There will be no dose
reescalation for these patients.
If the same Grade 3-[ADDRESS_681943] or 
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 36 of 68 add medications to mitigate the toxicity. When resolved to Grade 1 or less proceed as 
follows:  
If subject was taking 1000 mg at the time of a recurrent Grade 3/4 toxicity that is
considered clinically relevant then permanently discontinue study treatment. No dose
reduction below 1000mg will be permitted as patients intolerant of a 1000 mg dose will
be intolerant of a 1000 mg BID dose as well.
If subject was taking 750 mg BID at the time of recurrent Grade 3/4 toxicity that is
considered clinically relevant, then permanently discontinue study treatment. No dose
reduction below 750 mg BID will be permitted for these patients.
If Abiraterone Acetate is held for toxicity, missed days of therapy are not made up.  When 
Abiraterone Acetate is held temporarily prednisone should be continued.  
When Abiraterone Acetate is permanently discontinued prednisone can be continued or 
tapered off at the treating physician‟s discretion.  
Patients who require >4 weeks to recover from grade 3/4 toxicity (initial or recurrent) will not 
be allowed to restart study drug at any dose.  
5.7.4 Hypokalemia  
At the initial observation of Grade 1 or 2 hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mM but >3.0 
mM), oral potassium supplement will be initiated.  Abiraterone Acetate may be continued at 
current dose.  The dose of potassium supplement for patients with Grade [ADDRESS_681944] be carefully titrated to maintain serum potassium at >3.5 mM but <5.0 
mM. Any patient with low potassium while on study or a history of hypokalemia from a pre-
existing or concurrent medical condition will undergo weekly or more  frequent laboratory 
electrolyte evaluation. The investigator should consider maintaining the patient‟s potassium 
level at ≥ 4.0 mM in these patients. 
If any patient experiences Grade 3 hypokalemia (serum potassium levels <3.0 mM –but 
>2.5 mM) or Grade 4 hypokalemia (life-threatening hypokalemia with potassium levels <2.5
mM) study treatment will be withheld, and the patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525384]. Reinitiati ng study treatment after
normalization of potassium levels must be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1034]-
Investigator. Potassium levels should be monitored weekly or more frequently if clinically
indicated until the end of treatment.
.
Hypokalemia  
Grade 1 (< 3.5 mM – 3.0 mM)  Maintain dose level.  Initiate oral potassium supplement. The dose 
of potassium must be carefully titrated to maintain serum K+ at > 3.5 
mM but < 5.[ADDRESS_681945] weekly (or more) laboratory electrolyte 
evaluations.  Consider maintaining K+ at > 4.0 mM.

5.7.5 Hypertension  
Grade 1-2 or Grade 3 not considered clinically relevant : Management per treating 
physician. No study treatment dose reduction.  
Grade 3-4: If clinically relevant hold study treatment. Adjust or add medications to mitigate 
the hypertension and/or consider the specific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, 
Eplerenone (Inspra). When hypertension resolves to Grade [ADDRESS_681946] or add medications to mitigate the toxicity. 
When resolved to Grade 1 or less, proceed as follows resume study treatment as follows: 
oIf subject was taking [ADDRESS_681947] was taking 1000 mg BID at the time then when study drug is  resumed it will
be at 750 mg BID (a 25% dose reduction). There will be no dose reescalation for these
patients.
If Grade 3-[ADDRESS_681948] or add medications to mitigate the edema and/or consider the 
specific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, Eplerenone (Inspra). When edema resolves to 
Grade 1 or less, resume study treatment at full dose. Potassium levels should be followe d 
closely

to 2.5X ULN; increase in total bilirubin from ULN to 1.5X ULN): The frequency of liver 
function test monitoring should be increased, if the Investigator judges that the laboratory 
abnormalities are potentially related to study medication. No study treatment dose 
reduction is required. 
If Grade [ADDRESS_681950], ALT or bilirubin occur (e.g. increase in AST or ALT to >2.5-5X 
ULN; increase in total bilirubin from >1.5-3X ULN): The frequency of liver function test 
monitoring should be increased to at least once a week, if the Investigator judges that the 
laboratory abnormalities are potentially related to study medication. No study treatment 
dose reduction is required. 
If Grade [ADDRESS_681951], ALT, or bilirubin occur:  
For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with Abiraterone acetate with the 
following parameters: ALT and/or AST greater than 5X ULN or total bilirubin greater than

For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a 
minimum of every two weeks for three cycles and every cycle thereafter. 
If study treatment resumption is considered for subjects who have experienced Grade [ADDRESS_681952], ALT, or bilirubin, and the Sponsor Investigator agrees, patients will be treated 
as follows:  
If subject was taking 1000 mg at the time then permanently discontinue study
treatment. No dose reduction below 1000mg will be permitted as patients intolerant of a
1000 mg dose will be intolerant of a 1000 mg BID dose as well.
If subject was taking 1000 mg BID at the time then when study drug is  resumed it will
be at 750 mg BID (a 25% dose reduction). There will be no dose reescalation for these
patients.

permanently discontinue study treatment and all other concomitant medications that are 
potentially hepatotoxic. Frequent laboratory evaluations (at least once weekly) should be

The safety of Abiraterone Acetate re-treatment of patients who develop Grade [ADDRESS_681955] or ALT (greater than or equal to 20X ULN ) or bilirubin (greater than or equal to 10X 
ULN) is unknown.  Patients must therefore discontinue study treatment and any potentially 
hepatotoxic medications immediately and will not be re-challenged with Abiraterone 
Acetate. The Sponsor Investigator should be contact[CONTACT_525429]

5.7.9 Management of Symptoms Related to Adrenocortical Insufficiency  
Adrenocortical insufficiency has been reported in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Abiraterone Acetate in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids 
and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Patients should be monitored for symptoms and 
signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone 
or  experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be 
masked by [CONTACT_525430]. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated 
before, during and after stressful situations. A requirement of >10mg of prednisone (or 
corticosteroid equivalent) per day to treat adrenal insufficiency lasting longer than 2 weeks 
will result in discontinuation of study treatment.  
5.7.10 Management of Vasomotor Symptoms Related to Castration  
Treatment with androgens, estrogens and progestin to control hot flushes is not allowed. 
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are permitted for the management of hot 
flashes

Grade 3/4 events attributable to study therapy occur with a frequency of <20%. If at any time 
Gr3-4 events attributable to study therapy are observed at >20% frequency at the 2,000mg 
dose among all treated patients, then accrual will be stopped and the dose of Abiraterone 
Acetate reevaluated. See section 14 for data safety monitoring and adverse event reporting. 
5.9 ANCILLARY TREATMENT/SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES 
Concurrent supportive care is not restricted, including the use of narcotics for pain control and 
antiemetics for control of nausea, with the exception of the use of corticosteroids to treat 
nausea or acute adrenal insufficiency. Concurrent use of systemic corticosteroids for other 
reasons is prohibited.

therapy will be considered exploratory.  
6.2 Adrenal androgen levels  
Adrenal androgen levels (Androstenedione, DHEAS, DHEA and Testosterone) will be collected 
at baseline, cycle 2 day 1 and every 2 cycles thereafter, as well as at the time of PD#1 (while 
patient is still on therapy with Abiraterone Acetate). Analysis of these levels in this patient 
population is considered exploratory.  
6.3 Abiraterone Acetate Pharmacokinetics  
Abiraterone Acetate levels will be measured at the following four (4) times: at first visit after 
beginning low dose therapy (cycle 2 day 1), at the time of initial clinical progression, at first 
office visit after beginning dose increased therapy, and at the time of second clinical 
progression. The relationship between these values with the decline in PSA and disease 
progression will be evaluated.

7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
7.1 Study Design 
This is a single arm, non-randomized, open–label multicenter phase II study of standard-dose 
Abiraterone Acetate (1000 mg/d) followed by [CONTACT_60643]-dose Abiraterone Acetate (1000 
mg/BID) at the time of disease progression in patients with chemotherapy naïve, castration-
resistant metastatic prostate cancer.  
7.[ADDRESS_681960] dose Abiraterone Acetate will 
respond to dose increased Abiraterone Acetate will be tested. Using Simon‟s [ADDRESS_681961] of a 20% (null) vs. 40% (alternative) proportion of patients achieving a 
≥ 30% PSA decline from baseline just prior to starting elevated-dose abiraterone after [ADDRESS_681962] assumes a directional level of 
significance of 0.05 and power of 0.80. Based on the finding that approximately 85% of patients 
will achieve some PSA decline to standard-dose abiraterone in this population in Phase II and 
Phase III studies, [ADDRESS_681963] 18 patients taking elevated-dose abiraterone 
achieve a ≥ 30% PSA decline, accrual will continue to the second stage and additional patients 
will be entered in order to enroll a total of 33 patients at the 1000mg BID level.  It is not 
necessary to stop accrual until stage 1 has been completed as these patients are Abiraterone 
Acetate naïve and are expected to respond to this therapy for a number of months prior to 
progression.  If less than 5 out of the initial 18 patients achieve a ≥30% PSA decline then 
accrual will be stopped. If at least 11 of the total 33 patients at the 1000mg BID dose on study 
achieve a ≥ 30% PSA decline, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.  The probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525387] 0.[ADDRESS_681964]-dose Abiraterone Acetate, then had 
disease progression (Appendix C) and then achieved a ≥30% PSA decline after 12 weeks from 
the start of elevated-dose therapy. The proportion achieving a ≥30% PSA decline among those 
treated with elevated dose therapy among all patients entered on study along with 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated to summarize the treatment effect. In addition to 
observing a ≥30% PSA decline, the proportion of patients treated with elevated-dose therapy 
achieving any PSA decline, maximum decline in PSA, and duration of initial and second 
response will be determined.  The analysis of the primary objective will follow the decision rules 
for accrual to test the primary study objective.  
7.4 Secondary Objectives 
7.4.1 Methods for analysis 
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681965] limit method will be used 
to estimate the probability of PSA progression and PFS. Durations will be measured from the 
start of increased dose Abiraterone Acetate until PSA failure and progression or death due to 
any cause, respectively, as defined in Appendix C.  Point estimates from these analyses with 
95% confidence intervals will be presented to summarize the results.   
7.4.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Abiraterone Acetate levels will be measured at the following four (4) times: at first visit after 
beginning low dose therapy, at the time of initial clinical progression, at the first office visit after 
beginning dose increased therapy, and at the time of second clinical progression. For standard 
and increased dose Abiraterone Acetate the difference in means in baseline Abiraterone 
Acetate levels will be compared using a paired t test or to compare the distributions the 
nonparametric Wilcoxon matched pairs test will be performed for patients achieving any decline 
in PSA after [ADDRESS_681966] and elevated-
dose study therapy. Measurements will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes 
off study for disease progression before week 12. Pearson‟s correlation coefficients will be 
calculated to summarize the relationships among the 4 hormones at baseline and for the 
change from baseline at 12 weeks as well as between the baseline value and change at 12 
weeks for each hormone.   
The distribution of the baseline testosterone, DHEA, DHEA-S and androstenedione levels and 
the change in hormone level at 12 weeks will be compared between patients experiencing a 
PSA decline > 30% and patients without such a PSA decline using a two group t statistic. 
Similarly, exploratory analysis using the t statistic will compare baseline and change from 
baseline at 12 weeks in hormone levels between each of the individual genotypes (A1A1, 
A1A2, A2A2) on the CYP 17 gene being evaluated versus the other two genotypes pooled 
together. Cox‟s proportional hazards model will be applied to explore the effect of the baseline 
level for each hormone on time to initial and second progression, as defined by [CONTACT_525420]- [ADDRESS_681967] ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals. 
7.5 Exploratory Objectives 
7.5.1 Genotype analysis 
The association of the presence of variant genotypes of CYP17 A1 and a PSA decline  > 30% to 
standard dose therapy will be determined as a secondary outcome measure of this analysis.  
PSA decline of >30% to elevated-dose therapy will also be explored here. It is estimated that 
approximately 40% of patients will respond to increased-dose Abiraterone Acetate therapy 
(based on the alternative hypothesis defined in th is clinical trial) and there are three potential 
genotypes for CYP17 (A1A1, A1A2, A2A2). Additionally, the duration of initial response to 
therapy is of interest.  
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 43 of 68 The proportion of patients for each of the 3 genotypes of CYP 17 achieving a PSA decline 
>30% to initial and to dose escalated Abiraterone Acetate therapy will be measured in this
analysis. For each patient the genetic profile will be defined according to the combinations of
reference type and variant genotypes. Proportions will summarize the distribution of the
individual 3 genotypes. Estimates of prevalence of genotypes in a prostate cancer population,
as in the general population, are shown below.
a) Common homozygote (Reference) - A1A1 (estimate 43%)
b) Variant homozygote  - A2A2 (estimate 14%)
c) Heterozygote-   A1A2 (estimate 43%)
To evaluate the association between declines in PSA (<30% vs > 30%) and the genotypes, the 
association between each of the 3 individual genotypes vs. the others combined (e.g. presence 
of A1 allele vs none: A2A2 vs. A1A1+ A1A2) and PSA decline to Abiraterone Acetate therapy 
will each be tested using Fisher‟s exact test with a conservative level of significance of 0.05/3 = 
0.[ADDRESS_681968] 30% in a genotype subset, then a similar percent of the patients with 
an individual genotype and of the remaining pooled patients would be expected to respond to 
therapy. 
Exploratory multivariate models, logistic regression for PSA decline coded as a binary variable 
and Cox‟s proportional hazards model for time to progression, will be developed to analyze the 
combined effects of baseline hormone levels, change in hormone levels after 12 weeks of 
Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg daily and the presence of a genetic variant in the 3 genotypes on 
the CYP 17 gene. Each hormone will be evaluated separately due to the total planned sample 
size of 33. It is recognized that the sample size is small which will limit the number of variables 
that can be included in a model. The convention is to include 1 variable for every 10 evaluable 
patients. This will allow for evaluating up to 3 predictors in each model (baseline hormone level, 
change in hormone level at week 12 and 1 genotype).  A forward stepwise approach will be 
used (probability to enter set at 0.05 and the probability to remove set at 0.10) and univariate 
results will determine which variables will be included as potential independent predictors of 
outcome. Additional terms indicating an interaction between variables will be analyzed based 
upon the results. Because these are exploratory analyses the results will be used to develop 
future research. Cross-validation methods will be incorporated applied into to the multivariate 
analysis to control evaluate for overfitting of the model for overfitting.

Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 44 of 68 sections using an Arcturus Veritas Microdissection system and RNA isolated per a 
standardized protocol using the Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit (Stratagene, Agilent, Santa 
Clara, CA). RNA will be quantified, assessed for quality, amplified, labeled, hybridized to U133 
Plus 2.0 arrays for analysis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and then analyzed using Affymetrix 
software. Standardized metrics will be used to assess RNA quality and only samples meeting 
quality standards will be used. Tumors will be assigned a probability of AR activity ranging from 
0 (absent) to 1 (present). Tumors will then be assigned an outcome variable of AR-active or 
AR-inactive using a conservative cutoff of >0.[ADDRESS_681970] for paired data. In addition, when the probability outcome is coded 
as a binary outcome and is dichotomized at the median at each time point, the agreement or 
change in AR activity will be analyzed using McNemar‟s chi square test of agreement for paired 
binary data.  
7.5.3 Metastatic Biopsy and CTC analysis 
Circulating tumor cells will be isolated for genetic analysis using the Vitatex VitaCap assay. 
Cells will be isolated from peripheral whole blood according to a published protocol for isolation 
of prostate cancer CTCs using this platform.25 Based on experience with this methodology it is 
expected that >90% of patients will have detectable CTCs, that yields will range from 150-750 
CTCs/ml, and that using a 40ml draw, adequate DNA suitable for downstream genomic 
analyses will be isolated from >70% of patients. Optional CTCs isolated using Veridex 
CellSearch and Epic Biosciences will be assayed in an exploratory fashion as well for 
enumeration purposes, to provide a control for the Vitatex analyses, and to explore the 
relationship of disease progresson with the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic AR, presence 
of PTEN deletion, and expression of mesenchymal markers . Because Veridex CTCs are fixed 
using a preservative, no downstream genomic analyses will be performed on the Veridex 
CTCs. CTCs may also be sent to Xcell Biosciences for CTC culture in order to expand the 
population of cells available for genomic analysis and biologic characterization. All cultured 
CTCs and biomaterials will be returned to UCSF.  
The methylation status of specific promoter and intragenic CpG sites in CYP17A1 and in a 
predefined set of [ADDRESS_681971] in the Paris and Febbo labs at UCSF. Methylation will be assessed using an Illumina 
platform and will be expressed as a continuous variable as the β ratio of signal from a 
methylated probe relative to the sum of methylated and unmethylated probes at an individual 
site and as a binary categorical variable with presence defined using a conservative β ratio of 
>0.8. Descriptive statistics for continuous and binary variables will be calculated to summarize
the methylation state as well as the change from baseline post Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg
daily therapy for each gene from biopsy and CTC specimens . For binary outcomes this will
include the proportion of patients with methylation pre and/or post treatment for the 4
combinations and the proportion of patients with an increase in the number of methylation sites
in the gene body following treatment, each with 95% confidence intervals. For each gene
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681972] deviations and 
95% confidence intervals. A paired t statistic or the Wilcoxon matched pairs test will be used to 
test for a difference from pre to post-treatment in mean values or distributions, respectively. No 
adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made for these initial analyses of the relationship 
between methylation with ABI resistance. To summarize the results multivariable clustering 
analyses will be performed including genes identified to reflect change after ABI therapy in the 
univariate methods just described with at least a probability value < 0.10. Hierarchical clustering 
may be used to explore relationships among the genes.  
8 CRITERIA FOR PSA RESPONSE/PROGRESSION 
8.[ADDRESS_681973]-dose Abiraterone Acetate. Response to Abiraterone Acetate will be closely monitored 
to avoid over accrual.  
a)PSA Response : For patients receiving standard-dose therapy this is defined as a PSA
decline of any magnitude from baseline confirmed by a second measurement at least 2
weeks later. The reference for these declines should be a PSA measured within 2 weeks
prior to starting therapy. For patients receiving elevated-dose therapy PSA response is
defined as a ≥30% PSA decline from baseline after 12 weeks of elevated-dose therapy
b)PSA Progression: If any PSA decline from baseline has been achieved, PSA progression
occurs when the PSA has increased to at least 25% above the nadir and the increase in
the absolute-value PSA level is at least 2 ng/mL, or back to baseline, whichever is lower,
on at least [ADDRESS_681974] 25% and the
increase in the absolute-value PSA level is at least 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks of therapy.
c)PSA Response Duration: For patients receiving standard-dose therapy the PSA response
duration commences on the date of the decline of any magnitude in PSA from baseline.
The response duration ends when the PSA value first increases by [CONTACT_2669] 25% above the
nadir, provided that the increase in the absolute-value PSA level is at least 2 ng/mL or back
to baseline, whichever is lower. For patients receiving elevated-dose therapy the PSA
response duration commences on the date of a ≥30% PSA from baseline. The response
duration ends when the PSA value first increases by [CONTACT_2669] 25% above the nadir, provided
that the increase in the absolute-value PSA level is at least 2 ng/mL or back to baseline,
whichever is lower.
d)Progressive Disease: Defined by [CONTACT_525431] 2 new bone lesions on bone scan (note that for
the first assessment only a confirmatory scan performed 6 or more weeks later is required
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 46 of 68 that shows a minimum of 2 or more new lesions)  OR a new requirement for radiation 
therapy thought to be due to prostate cancer. 
e)Time to PSA Progression: The start of the time to PSA progression is the day treatment is
initiated. The end date is the first of the measurements determining progressive disease.
f) Criteria for Definition of Progression #2 . The criteria for defining progression #2 are the
same as for the definition of progression #1 however the PSA value at the time of progression
#1 will be the baseline for progression #2.
a.Example: Patient begins study with a PSA of 100, which declines to 40 ng/mL at
week 12, PD #1 will occur when PSA reaches 50 ng/mL or higher. Following dose-
increased Abiraterone Acetate therapy a “second PSA response” will be defined as
a decline below 35ng/ml and PD #[ADDRESS_681975] criteria using 50
ng/mL as the baseline.
RECIST Criteria (Please see Appendix B) 
[ADDRESS_681976] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An adverse event  (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any 
use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_681977]  
Events that Janssen Services is actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified signal, 
including mineralocorticoid excess, cardiac adverse reactions, and liver toxicities. 
9.1.3   Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset 
of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. 
9.1.4    Suspected adverse reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 47 of 68 9.1.5  Unexpected 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or package insert(s) or, is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are considered 
unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the investigator 
brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial would be 
anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally not be listed 
as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure. 
Some adverse events are listed in the investigator brochure as occurring with the same class of 
drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have 
not been observed with the drug under investigation. Such events would be considered 
unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. For example, 
although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some patients exposed to drugs in the ACE 
inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the investigator brochure as a class effect, 
the first case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be considered 
unexpected for reporting purposes.  
9.1.6  Serious 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
1.Death
2.A life-threatening adverse event
3.Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
4.A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life function
5.A congenital anomaly/birth defect
6.A suspected transmission of infectious agent by [CONTACT_525432], be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
9.1.7   Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of

9.1.8   J&J Medicinal Product 
The specific J&J drug under study and any other J&J medicinal product. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_681979] Quality Complaint (PQC) 
Any discrete concern that questions the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, efficacy or intended 
performance of a drug product.   A complaint may allege an injury or malfunction associated with the use of 
the drug pr
oduct. It may also involve the design, literature, packaging, advertising, availability, physical 
appearance or promotion of the drug product. 
9.1.10 Special Reporting Situations 
When a report contains a J&J product, an identifiable patient, and identifiable reporter, the 
following events represent Special Reporting Situations: 
 overdose of a J&J medicinal product
 pregnancy exposure (maternal and paternal)
 exposure to a medicinal product from breastfeeding
suspected abuse/misuse of a medicinal J&J product
inadvertent or accidental exposure to a medicinal J&J product
oany failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a J&J medicinal
product
ounexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen Services medicinal
product
omedication error involving a J&J product (with or without patient exposure to the
medicinal J&J product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
oSuspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.
9.[ADDRESS_681980] has completed participation in the study as follows: 
A Serious Adverse event or Special Reporting Situations must be reported if it occurs during a 
subject‟s participation in the Study (whether receiving Study Product or not) and within [ADDRESS_681981] completes 
his/her participation in the Study must be followed until any of the following occurs: 
the event resolves or stabilizes;
the event returns to baseline condition or value (if a baseline value is available);
the event can be attributed to agents(s) other than the Study Product, or to factors unrelated to Study
conduct.
In general, the Principal Investigat or must immediately report to J ANSSEN SERVICES  any serious 
adverse event and Special Reporting Situations, whether or not considered drug related. Study 
endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between 
the drug and the event (e.g., death as a result of anaphylactic reaction or fatal hepatic necrosis).

regulatory reporting requirements. 
9.3 Recording of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Special Reporting Situations  
All adverse events will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF‟s Clinical Trial Management System, 
whether or not the event is believed to be associated with use of the study drug.  Data about these 
events and their severity will be recorded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) (V4.0), when applicable, on the appropriate case report forms (CRFs).  The 
Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug, and this information will be entered into OnCore using the classification 
system listed below:

Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page 50 of 68 9.5  Adverse Events Monitoring 
All adverse events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be associated with 
the use of the study drug, will be entered into OnCore®, as noted above. 
The Investigator will assess all adverse events and determine reportability requirements to the Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), UCSF‟s Committee on Human Research (CHR), and, 
when the study is conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), to the Food and 
Drug Administration.   
All adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed by [CONTACT_525433] a monthly basis.  
The Site Committee will review and discuss at each monthly meeting the selected toxicity, the toxicity 
grade, and the attribution of relationship of the adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s). 
In addition, all adverse events and suspected adverse reactions considered “serious,” entered into 
OnCore® will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_525434] (6) weeks.   
9.6  Expedited Reporting 
Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within [ADDRESS_681984] administration 
of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study drug(s) or to a study 
procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair (or qualified alternate) 
within [ADDRESS_681985] may be by [CONTACT_14223] e-mail. 
Reporting to UCSF’s Committee on Human Research (CHR) 
The Investigator must report events meeting the CHR definition of “Unanticipated Problem” (UP) within 
10 working days of his/her awareness of the event.  Guidance on Adverse Event Reporting to the CHR 
is available online at the UCSF Human Research Protection Program  website.  
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
The Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction 
meets the criteria for expedited reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32).   
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all three 
definitions:  
Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in 9.1.4)
Unexpected (as defined in 9.1.5)
Serious (as defined in 9.1.6)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report. 
The timeframe for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days  after the 
Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).  
Version date: 01-22-14 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate Page [ADDRESS_681986] be reported to FDA no  later 
than 7 calendar days after the Investigator‟s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report  must be 
submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the information is 
available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).  
The investigator (or designee) should prepare Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch)  detailing the event, and 
contact [CONTACT_525435].    
For additional information and guidance on IND Safety Reports, please refer to FDA‟s Guidance 
document Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs .  It is the Sponsor-Investigator‟s responsibility to 
meet regulatory requirements for expedited reporting. 
Reporting to Janssen Services

support for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial.  The UCSF Coordinating 
Center will also coordinate, at minimum, quarterly conference calls with  the participating sites o r 
more frequently as needed to discuss risk assessment.  The following issues will be discussed as 
appropriate: 
Enrollment information
Adverse Events (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events and
new safety information)
Protocol Violations
Other issues affecting the conduct of the study
Adverse events reporting to the DSMC will include reports from both the UCSF Coordinating Center, 
as well as the participating sites.  The DSMC will be responsible for monitoring and query data entered 
in OnCore for the 20% of subjects it reviews at the UCSF Coordinating Center and the participating 
sites.  The data (i.e. copi[INVESTIGATOR_14168]) from the participating sites will be faxed over to the 
UCSF Coordinating Center prior to the monitoring visits in order for the DSMC to monitor the 
participating site‟s compliance with the protocol, patient safety, and to verify data entry. 
Adverse Event Review and Monitoring 
All adverse events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be associated with 
the use of the study drug, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF‟s Clinical Trial Management System.  
All adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly basis at the UCSF Site 
Committee meetings.  All clinically significant adverse events must be reported to the UCSF 
Coordinating Center by [CONTACT_14244] 10 business days of becoming aware of the event 
or during the next scheduled quarterly conference call, whichever is sooner.  The UCSF Site 
Committee will review and discuss the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of 
relationship of the adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s) from the UCSF 
Coordinating Center  and the participating sites.  
In addition, all suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” must be entered in OnCore® and

Appendix B RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA in SOLID TUMORS 
(RECIST) 
Eligibility 
 Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objectiv e 
tumor response is the primary endpoint.  
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease 
is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
Measurable lesions  - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter 20 mm using conventional techniques or [ADDRESS_682004] scan. 
Non-measurable lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_682005] scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
[CONTACT_15218]; and. 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Methods of Measurement  
 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_682006], abdomen and pelvis. 
Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 
 Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US 
might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed 
by [CONTACT_12148]. 
 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully 
and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high 
level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such 
techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized 
 
 
Version date: 01-22-14  Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate  Page 62 of 68 
 centers. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained. 
 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., after 
treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor 
types such as germ cell tumors). 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesio ns 
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and 
their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_525446]. 
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions  and should also 
be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
Evaluation of target lesions 
* Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
* Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the L D of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
* Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started  
 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response  (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level  
* Incomplete Response/ Stable 
Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
* Progres sive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions (1)

Phase 2:  Abiraterone Acetate  Page [ADDRESS_682007] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria

 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. 
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment .  
 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion 
be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status. 
Confirmation 
 The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response rate 
observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when 
reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. 
 To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_682008] once after study 
entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

cytotoxic drug  
 Monitor PSA by [CONTACT_525447] a minimum of 12 weeks 
unless other evidence of progression  
 Ignore early rises (prior to 12 weeks) in determining PSA response  
 For control/relieve/eliminate end points:  
 Record the percent change from baseline (rise or  fall) at 12 weeks, and separately, the 
maximal change (rise or fall) at any time using a waterfall plot  
 Progression:  
 Decline from baseline : record time from start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% 
and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks 
later (i.e., a confirmed rising trend)  
 The requirement of an increase of 5 ng/mL is decreased to 2 ng/mL, and the requirement for 
a 50% increase is reduced to 25%  
 Recording the duration of PSA decline of little value  
 No decline from baseline:  
 PSA progression ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks  
Soft-tissue 
lesions  For control/relieve/eliminate end points:  
 Use RECIST with caveats  
     Only report changes in lymph nodes that were ≥ [ADDRESS_682010] changes using waterfall plot  
 For delay/prevent end points:  
 Use RECIST criteria for pr ogression, with additional requirement that progression at first 
assessment be confirmed by a second scan 6 or more weeks later  
 Note that for some treatments, a lesion may increase in size before it decreases  
Bone  For control/relieve eliminate end point s: 
 Record outcome as new lesions or no new lesions  
 First scheduled reassessment:  
 No new lesions: continue therapy  
 New lesions: perform a confirmatory scan 6 or more weeks later  
 Confirmatory scan:  
 No new lesions: continue therapy  
 Additional ne w lesions: progression  
 Subsequent scheduled reassessments:  
 No new lesions: continue

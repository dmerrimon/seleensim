 1 Protocol Summary  
1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  Randomized Crossover Study to Compare Effectiveness of a Device Providing 
Pressure Drops During Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (TPAP) to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
Protocol Name/Number: Thera PAP Equivalence  
Sponsor:  SleepRes, PLLC  
Rationale : TheraPAP is a prototype device (with full documented electrical and isolation safety) 
being developed by [CONTACT_465716] (OSA) that can deliver 
either standard CPAP at a set pressure or what is called TPAP1. TPAP is a pressure control 
algorithm that lowers the pressure from the set pressure at the beginning of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465694].  The present 
study, TheraPAP Equivalence , is a crossover study designed to examine the  efficacy and safety of 
TPAP vs. CPAP  alone  in the treatment of OSA . 
Overall Design : 
The Thera PAP Equivalence  Study is a randomized, controlled,  crossover study  in pa rticipants  
with OSA . A split-night  polysomnogra m (PSG) will be conducted on CPAP and TPAP 
(approximately 3.5 hr. each treatment arm) in previously diagnosed OSA patients , to test the 
effect iveness  of TPAP vs. CPAP . The sequence of p eriods for each participant are assigned in 
random order.  Therapeutic CPAP  level will be defined based on each individual’s  pressure levels 
from their currently used APAP device deemed to  eliminate breathing obstructions for at least 
90/95% of the sleep period  (P90/P95) + 1 cmH 2O. P90/P95 will be defined based on the previous 
2 months of adherent APAP usage (defined as averaging > 5 h ours/night).  On TPAP , the pressure 
drop during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465695], as outlined in table 1, based on 
the set pressure level , with larger drops occurring when the set pressure is higher.  However, the 
pressure never goes below [ADDRESS_597147] been assigned.   
TPAP Pressure Drop values will be set according to  the following table  for (P90/P95) + 1 
cmH 2O.

will be the set patient pressure for CPAP and TPAP during the study.   To determine the  Adjusted 
P90/P95 Value  to get the  correct Pressure Drops 1 & 2 settings : 
• If the participant’s machine -recorded P90/P95 is at a whole number , like 8.0 , or a half pressure , 
like 8.5, add 1.0 cmH 2O to get the Adjusted P90/P95  Value.   
• If the participant’s  machine -recorded  P90/95 is between  a whole number and a half number, 
round to the next half or whole number, then, add 1.0 cmH 2O to get the Adjusted P90/95 Value.   
• Find the Adjusted P90/[ADDRESS_597149] of TPAP on overall, non -rapid eye movement (NREM), 
REM, supi[INVESTIGATOR_465696], as well as sleep efficiency , sleep onset latency, sleep stage 
distribution, arousal index,  total leak,  and unintentional mask leaks vs. CPAP.  
Number of Participant s: 
A total of 52 participants will be  enrolled.  
Study Duration : 
The overall study  duration for each participant  will be  up to two weeks including recruitment 
screening and one night in the lab.

prior studies , the administration of higher inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465698] (CPAP), which remains low. In our 
recent investigation, we demonstrated that the addition of a resistor to the CPAP ci rcuit to reduce 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465699] . The present study, TheraPAP Equivalence , is a 
Crossover  study designed to examine whether  TPAP  is equivalent to CPAP  in the treatment of 
OSA.  
2.[ADDRESS_597152] common  of the more serious sleep disorders and affects 
approximately 20 million people in the  [LOCATION_002] ( US), with approximately 13% of men and 
6% of women affected  (1). OSA is characterized  by [CONTACT_203781] ‘obstruction’ of the 
pharyngeal airway during sleep, manifesting  as repetitive epi[INVESTIGATOR_465700] (i.e., shallow 
breathing) or apnea (i.e., paused  breathing).  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_465701], arousal from sleep,  sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and/or 
neuropsychological  impairment.  
Long -term, OSA is associated with increased mortality and a number of  adverse cardiovascular , 
neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functioning consequences  (2-11). 
2.2.[ADDRESS_597153] . However, 
long-term adherence to therapy remains a challenge for many patients  (12, 13) . Common 
complaints include inconvenience, lack of perceived benefit, discomfort related to improper 
fitting of the interface, and difficulty expi[INVESTIGATOR_465702]  (14, 15) .  
As many patients cannot use CPAP because they find it intolerable, this represents  a significant 
health concern, as OSA is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes  and increased 
mortality. Strategies to improve tolerance of CPAP, and subsequently adherence, are needed . 
 
 2.2.3 Biological  Rationale  
TPAP is an innovative device /algorithm  designed to deliver a lower inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465703].  The drop in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465704] . Previous 
research has shown that reducing inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465705]  a resistor  in the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465706], despi[INVESTIGATOR_465707] a 
similar residual apnea -hypopnea index (AHI). However, the resistor could only provide a fixed 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_465708]. TPAP addresses this limitation by 
[CONTACT_465718][INVESTIGATOR_465709], offering a 
potentially more personalized and adaptive therapeutic approach .

4 Study Design  
4.1 Overall  Design  
The Thera PAP Equivalence S tudy is a randomized, controlled,  crossover study in pa rticipants  
with OSA.  Pre-screening is conducted to establish potential eligibility with a previous  sleep 
study showing an AHI>10 events/h our, and a minimum of two months of adherent CPAP usage 
(defined as averaging > 5 h ours/night). Eligible participants will undergo a  split-night , in-
laboratory polysomnogram ( PSG) on CPAP and TPAP (3.5 hours for  each treatment arm). The 
sequence of periods for each participant will be assigned in random order , although all 
participants will start on CPAP until asleep to blind them to the therapy  arm. Therapeutic CPAP 
level  will be defined based on each individual’s  pressure P95/P90 + [ADDRESS_597154]  treatment vs. control comparison here, we will assume that CPAP is safe and 
that any abnormal value recorded in the next morning  compared to the evening before the polysomnography is due 
to treatment with TPAP.   Endpoints

(SCMT)  to all of its patients inquiring about their interest in participating in the study. The email 
will provide interested patients with a link to an online form that they complete by [CONTACT_465720]. After they submit the form, they will be contact[CONTACT_465721], who will discuss the stu dy with them.  Participants selected for eligibility will have a 
previous history of OSA of a severity consistent with enrollment criteria , have enough CPAP 
usage in the previous two months , and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria .   
 
4.2.2 Evening before the sleep study  
Upon arrival at the clinic , the participant  will be asked to sign an informed consent .  
The following activities will also occur : 
• Document d emographics and medical history , including medications . 
• Review previous two-month  sleep data from the participant’s CPAP.   
• Height, weight, vital signs will be measure d once.  
• Pre-sleep questionnaire (which includes recent sleep history for the last 2 -3 nights, 
medications, caffeinated beverages,  and alcohol  consumption ) 
• Randomization  
4.2.3 In-laboratory overnight PSG  
The PSG will be  conducted  with a split -night design, i.e., approximately 3.5 h ours on CPAP and 
3.5 h ours on TPAP, in random order . The switch between CPAP and TPAP will be operated 
through the interface screen on the TPAP device. During testing, no expi[INVESTIGATOR_465712]. All patients will 
be asked to bring in the mask they normally use at night so that it can be used in the study , and 
the patients will be tested using two 1.8 m lengths of 22 mm tubing to prevent cross 
contamination . A commercial humidifier will be used to provide humidification since 
humidification is not supplied with the TheraPAP prototype.   
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Risk -benefit analysis  
The procedures involved in the overnight study are similar to clinical routinary activities 
performed in the laboratory weekly, and therefore the study risk is minimal, with the only risks 
being related to the following:  
• Due to the monitoring equipment used in the lab and the different pressure delivery with 
TPAP, the participant  may sleep poorly and be fatigued the following day.  
• If TPAP does not optimally treat the sleep apnea, the patient may have more 
apneas/hypopneas during the study than occur on CPAP at home. However, a single night 
of sub -optimally treated sleep apnea poses no real medical risk.  
Regarding benefits to the participants : 
• During the CPAP portion of the study, the lab personnel will be able to evaluate whether 
the participant’s current treatment at home is adequate. If increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_465713] , the settings on the participant’s CPAP 
can be adjusted at home or other corrections could be recommended.  Also, since the 
participants will be monitored as during a normal sleep study , evidence of other sleep 
disorders or heart disease could be identified and then addressed.  
• The results of the study could yield future benefit to the participants in terms of wider 
treatment alternatives for their OSA.    
4.2.4 Morning after the sleep study  
The following activities will occur:  
• Vital signs will be measured once.  
• Post-sleep questionnaire .  
• Overall quantification and recording of any adverse event or serious adverse events 
related to the overnight procedures.

[ADDRESS_597161] details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or recor d reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
6.1 Overnight study  
• Methods : Standard overnight PSG recording,  and data interpretation will be performed in 
accordance with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring manual. 
Participant s will be instrumented with standard PSG electrodes  and their usual at -home 
CPAP mask . This setup includes  a finger pulse oximeter, chest and abdominal bands, EKG 
electrodes, a snore sensor on the neck, and anterior tibialis EMG electrodes. A manometer 
will be added between the end of the tube and the mask connecting tube to measure the 
participant’s pressure directly, and i ts analog output will feed into the PSG device . The 
patient flow signal will be extracted from the flowmeter embedded in TheraPAP  device  
filtering off the leak flow from total flow (output). This TheraPAP flowmeter data will be 
directed to the DC input on the polysomnogram, generating a real -time signal. This signal 
can be viewed in the control room.  A panoramic of the setup in the patient room is shown in 
figure 2.
 
Figure 1. Continuous positive airway pressure (PAP)/TheraPAP circuit. TPAP, TheraPAP  
device . PSG, polysomnography.  
Patients will report to the laboratory approximately two hours prior to their usual bedtime. 
Patients will be instructed not to drink alcohol  or caffeinated beverages  on the night of the 

 
 study. Time of lights out will be established according to the participant ’s approximate 
habitual bedtime.  The participants will be given at least seven  hours of time  in bed 
(undergoing either CPAP or TPAP) .  
• Participants should be actively encouraged to spend at least 1/[ADDRESS_597162] 1/3 of the night in the lateral position on each night of study.  
• Scoring: PSG studies will be scored for purposes of study endpoints by a register ed PSG 
technician , blinded to treatment assignment . 
6.2 Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.  
Safety assessments will include measurement of vital signs, monitoring and recording of AEs, 
SAEs, and recording of study or treatment discontinuations. Effects on OSA and sleep 
parameters (e.g., sleep time and sleep stages) will also be monitored by [CONTACT_63175] . 
 
6.2.1 Vital Signs  
Assessment of vital signs (seated blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) 
will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA.  
Vital signs will be measured in a seated position after [ADDRESS_597163] and will include 
temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Measurements will 
be made only once.   
6.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in   
 
 Appendix  . 
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] .  
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study device  or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue the study . 
6.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE 
Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from randomization until the end of the study at the 
timepoints specified in the SoA.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the S ponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in   
 
 Appendix  . The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of 
it being available.  
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y 
related to the study or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor . 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in   
 
 Appendix  . 
6.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrence.  
6.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
Ongoing AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution or stability as determined by [CONTACT_3786].  
6.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE s 
Prompt notification (within 24 hours, see   
 
 Appendix  ) by [CONTACT_465724] a study treatment  
under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment  under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to

 Appendix  2: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether  
considered related to the device  product.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment . 
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal safety assessments ( e.g., vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the Investigator (i .e., not related to progression of underlying 
disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition includes  either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment  administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of a concomitant 
medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses 
should be  reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of effic acy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an 
AE or SAE.  
 
 
 Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_465731]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening  
The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or  
outpatient  setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, t he AE 
should be considered serious.  
Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
 
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situations  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228057] t he 
participant or may require medical or surgical treatment  to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious.  
Recording and Follow -up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the  Investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related 
to the event.  
The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_465714].  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_465715].  
The I nvestigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
 
 Assessment of Intensity  
The I nvestigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort,  and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
The I nvestigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment  and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
The I nvestigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
The I nvestigator will also consult the Instruction for Use, in his/her assessment.  
For each AE/SAE, the I nvestigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations in whi ch an SAE has occurred,  and the I nvestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor . However, it is very important 
that the I nvestigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor . 
The I nvestigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
The I nvestigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_465732]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation 
with other health care professionals.  
If a participant dies during participation in the study , the I nvestigator will provide the 
Sponsor  with a copy of any post -mortem findings including histopathology . 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
The I nvestigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within [ADDRESS_597170] report any SAEs to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  
The Investigator and the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designated agent) will review each SAE 
report and the Sponsor/ CRO will evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of 
the event to study treatment . In addition, the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designated agent) will 
evaluate the expectedness according to the reference document s. Based on the 
Investigator and Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a decision will be made concerning 
the need for further action.  
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE , report to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_597171] be 
reported only if they are considered (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) causally -related to study 
treatment.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
Any AE that is serious, associated with the use of the study treatment , and unexpected 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) has additional reporting requirements, as described below.  
If the S[LOCATION_003]R is fatal or life -threatening, associated with study treatment , and 
unexpected, regulatory authorities and IRB will be notified within 7 calendar days after 
the Sponsor learns of the event. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy report, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450]) information should be reported within an additional 8 days (15 days 
total).  
If the S[LOCATION_003]R is not fatal or life -threatening but is otherwise serious, associated with 
study treatment , and unexpected, regulatory authorities and IRBs will be notified within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor learns of the event .

(CSE) Anesthetic Technique on the Success of Trial of Labor after Cesarean (TOLAC): 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_659350]:  To compare the effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_659351]. This will be a prospective clinical study randomizing 60 eligible 
women into either an epi[INVESTIGATOR_659352]. The effects of the specifi c regional 
anesthetic on patient's individual labor efforts will then be closely monitored. Written 
informed consent shall be obtained to enroll the patients in either group. Pain scores 
and electronic medical record information will be used with non -ident ifiable coding to 
determine the resulting outcomes.  
Background:   
Though it has been said, "once a cesarean, always a cesarean," the current medical 
stance has changed and now encourages VBAC in a select population of patients. 
VBAC has several advantages  over a repeat cesarean including decreased recovery 
period, decreased risk of infection, avoidance of major abdominal surgery, and lessened 
blood loss (1). Predictors for success of VBAC include previous spontaneous vaginal 
birth, singleton pregnancy, and  previous low transverse scar for C -section delivery (1). 
TOLAC is a reasonable option for select pregnant women and is associated with a 74% 
likelihood of VBAC (3). Risk factors for failure of VBAC include labor dystocia, advanced 
maternal age, maternal o besity, fetal macrosomia, GA>40 weeks, short inter pregnancy 
interval, and preeclampsia (1).  
While success of VBAC is associated with fewer complications, failure of VBAC may be 
associated with increased complications (1). A major concern for VBAC is the possibility 
for uterine rupture, which may result in hysterectomy and intrapartum fetal 
hypoxia/death. According to the ACOG guidelines, effective regional analgesia should 
not be expected to mask the signs and symptoms of uterine rupture, particularly 
because the most common sign of rupture is fetal heart tracing abnormalities. Adequate 
pain relief achieved with either CSE or epi[INVESTIGATOR_659353]. The decision to proceed with TOLAC should occur only after appropriate 
discussion of the risks and benefits has occurred between the patient and her 
obstetrician and as long as no other contraindications exist. The final decision should be 
left up to the patient. There is no reliable way to predict risk of uterine rupture, but it  may 
be associated with classical and low vertical uterine scars, induction of labor, and 
increased number of prior cesarean deliveries and risk may be decreased by [CONTACT_659376] (3). Other aspects of VBAC versus repeat cesarean pertaining to the fetus 
to consider include respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], mother -infant contact, and initiation of 
breastfeeding, which may be delayed in cesarean deliveries (3).   
There is very little research concerning the effects of CSEs and epi[INVESTIGATOR_659354]. There have been multiple studies comparing CSE and epi[INVESTIGATOR_659355], but none have been done specifically on patients 
undergoing TOLAC. There is only one study comparing CSEs and epi[INVESTIGATOR_659356] 80 patients undergoing total knee replacement (8). According to the ASA 
practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia "nonrandomized comparative studies 
suggest that epi[INVESTIGATOR_659357] a trial of labor for previous cesarean 
delivery patients without adversely affecting the incidence of vaginal delivery. 
Randomized comparison of epi[INVESTIGATOR_659358]." They agree that neuraxial techniques improve t he likelihood of vaginal delivery 
for patients attempting VBAC and suggest neuraxial catheter be placed in event of 
operative delivery (9). Because no study to date has compared CSEs and epi[INVESTIGATOR_659359], we would like to further investigate this arena.  
Inclusion criteria:  (all patients meeting ACOG guidelines for TOLAC) ASA ll 
Patients [ADDRESS_889374] one previous elective cesarean 
delivery, <40 weeks gestational age (GA), vertex singleton pregnancy with use of 
continuous fetal monitoring.   
Exclusion criteria:  Patients undergoing TOLAC but refusing regional anesthetic 
or with contraindication for regional anesthesia, less than 18 years of age, BMI 
>40 or with associated comorbidities such as gestatio nal diabetes, preeclampsia, 
abnormal placentation, etc.  
Specific outcomes to be looked at include:  
Primary outcome:  
 Success of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)  
Secondary outcomes:  
 Success of analgesia/ maternal satisfaction (self - rated pain score of 1-[ADDRESS_889375]-delivery)  
 If requiring a repeat C -section or instrumental delivery the success of 
regional anesthesia for the procedure. (self - rated pain score of 1 -10 and 
necessity to use additional IV pain medication or conversion to general/ 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_224639])  
 Immediate side effects: fetal bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, 
hypotension requiring vasopressor s 
 Late side effects i.e. post dural puncture headache  
Methods:  
When the  patient on the obstetric service requests an epi[INVESTIGATOR_659360], a 
consult is immediately placed to the Anesthesia service. Patients who request neuraxial 
anesthesia for labor analgesia will then be screened for the study. Written informed 
conse nt shall be obtained from the patient prior to enrollment in this prospective 
randomized clinical study. The regional anesthetics will be placed by [CONTACT_659377] B. Johnson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a well -established partner of the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Medical School at Houston and a facility capable of performing an 
emergent C -section if necessary. Patients shall be randomized via computer generated 
randomization sequence and assigned a separate study number different from their 
medical record number. The study code and MRN will be saved on a linking log on a 
password protected drive. Standard ASA monitors will be applied to all patients 
including NIBP, pulse oximetry and fetal heart monitors. Patients will be bolused with 1 
liter of LR prior to  the procedure via intravenous catheters. In the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590677], 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_659361] a sterile fashion using a 17g Tuohy needle to locate the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_659362] -of-resistance to saline at the lumbar vertebral level. 3 ml of 1.5% 
lidocaine with  5ug/ml of epi[INVESTIGATOR_659363]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_659364] 5ml 
of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_659365] 5 ml of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_659366]. In 
the CSE arm, th e epi[INVESTIGATOR_659367] a 17g Tuohy needle and 
dural puncture performed with 25g Pencan needle via needle -through -needle technique. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_659368] 2ml 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_659369]. An epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] c atheter will then be placed and test dose performed with 3 ml of 
1.5% lidocaine with 5ug/ml of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Maintenance dose will be via an epi[INVESTIGATOR_659370] 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_142245] a rate of 12 ml/hr. Self -determined numeric pain scores 
will be obtained pri or to and after placement of the regional anesthetic and after delivery 
by [CONTACT_75462]. Analgesia will be considered successful if the numerical pain score 
value is 3 or less.  
 
Data collection will be performed via pain scores obtained prior to and following 
placement of the regional anesthetic and establishment of analgesia, along with data on 
maternal satisfaction. Electronic medical records will also be used to gather the 
resulting outcomes.

Data Analysis Plan:  
Power Analysis  
Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in success of VBAC between epi[INVESTIGATOR_659371]. Our alternative hypothesis is that CSE will 
result in more succe ssful VBAC than will epi[INVESTIGATOR_71543].The success rate of VBAC is around 
74%.   Based on the literature, we expect the success rate with CSE to increase by 20 -
25%; therefore, given our sample size of 60, we will have 80% power to detect a 
difference between the tw o groups.  
Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome, success for VBAC, will be assessed using χ2 or the Fisher Exact 
test, in case of cell sizes < 5, to determine if the difference in success rates between the 
two analgesia groups, CSE and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], is statistically significant.  Logistic regression 
analysis will be used to adjust for potential confounders and other factors associated 
success or fail ure of VBAC.  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
The secondary outcome, success of analgesia, as measured by [CONTACT_659379] a scale 
of 1 to 10, will be assessed using ANOVA.  Difference in mean pain score between the 
two groups will be determined in a model with the contin uous/count variable pain score 
as the dependent variable and analgesia group as the independent variable.   
Categorical outcomes, including success of regional anesthesia for patients requiring C -
section or instrumental delivery, immediate side effects, an d late side effects will be 
evaluated using χ2 or the Fisher Exact test.

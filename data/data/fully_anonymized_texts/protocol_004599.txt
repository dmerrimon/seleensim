Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2IV. SYNOPSIS
Title of Study A Phase 4, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel Group, 
Multi -Center Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Mirabegron in Older Adult Subjects with Overactive Bladder (OAB)
Planned Study 
PeriodFrom 3Q2014 to 4Q2016
Study O bjective (s) Primary Objective:
To assess the efficacy of mirabegron versus placebo (PBO) in the treatment 
of older adult subjects with OAB .
Secondary Objective:
To assess the safety and tolerability of mirabegron versus placebo (PBO) in 
the treatment of older adult subjects with OAB.  
Planned T otal 
Number of S tudy 
Centers and 
LocationApproximately 125 centers
North America (possibly to include South America, Eu rope, Australia, and/or 
Asia Pacific)
Design and 
MethodologyThis is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, 
multi -center study.
After Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 2 -week placebo run -in 
period (Visit 2) prior to being randomized into the 12- week double -blind 
treatment period (Visit 3).  Subjects will be asked to complete a 3 -day 
training micturition diary during the placebo run -in period (Visit 2).  If 
subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the placebo run-in period, 
subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (Mirabegron or PBO) 
for 12 weeks of treatment.  Three days before Visits 4 (Week 4), 5 (Week 8), 
and 6 (Week 12), the subject will complete a [ADDRESS_1180547] -void residual volume (PVR) will be assessed at 
Screening (Visit 1) and at Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6). Total study 
participation is approximately [ADDRESS_1180548] enrollment will be monitored for the percent of 
subjects ≥ 75 years of age. If the proportion of subjects ≥ 75 years of age is 
<30%, measures may be taken to enhance enrollment of sufficient number of 
subjects ≥ 75 years of age to ensure that the percentage of subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1180549] 30%.
Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to 
either mirabegron or placebo (PBO).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654]     
<75 years and ≥[ADDRESS_1180550] matched to the 
mirabegron 25 mg tablet and may also increase to 50 mg PBO af ter 4 or 
8weeks. Once a patient has increased dose, they will remain on that dose for

The co -primary endpoints for this study are change from baseline to end of 
treatment in the mean number of micturitions per [ADDRESS_1180566] atistical analysis will not group the data.  
The categories are shown below together with the percentages occurring for 
placebo and mirabegron 50mg as found in older adult subjects (≥65 years of 
age) from North American sites in studies 178- CL-047 and 178- CL-074.
Table 1 - Categories for Change from Baseline in Mean Number of 
Incontinence Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 Hours, for North America, ≥65 years
Mean Change

Based on Table 1, the probability that a subject on mirabegron will respond 
better than a subject on placebo is 56.3% (nQuery 7.0). Based on a Wilcoxon 
(Mann -Whitney) rank- sum test that P(X<Y) = 0.5 (continuous outcome), 
340incontinent subjects per treatment group will yield 82% power with a 
2-sided test at a signif icance level of 0.05.

50mg compared to PBO in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours in 
North American subjects who were 65 years or older. A sample size of 
340subjects per trea tment group will yield 97% power to detect a reduction

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2day’ are independent the overall power would therefore be 80%.
The historical data show at least 15% of the randomized subjects will drop 
out during the double -blind perio d. Consequently an additional 60 subjects 
per treatment group need be enrolled. This brings the total required 
incontinent subjects per treatment group to 400. 
Based on the historical data a 20% failure rate is predicted due to lack of 
incontinence and an other 10% failure due to a combination of drop out and 
placebo response during the placebo run-in period. Therefore ,a 30% screen 
failure rate is expected. 
In order to randomize 800 subjects with incontinence ,it is expected that 
1,150 subjects will need to be screened.
Efficacy:  
All analyses will be performed comparing two treatment groups: Mirabegron 
(regardless of dose) versus PBO.
Analysis on Co -Primary Endpoints
The primary analysis set for efficacy analyses will be the Full Analysis Set –
Incontine nce (FAS -I) which comprises randomized subjects who took at 
least one dose of randomized study drug, have a micturition measurement at 
baseline, have at least one incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_849024], and have at least 
one post -baseline micturition measuremen t(measurement includes 
micturition and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]).  
Change from baseline to end of treatment in mean number of micturitions per 
24 hours will be analyzed using a stratified Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) model. The response variable will be the mean change in 
number of micturitions epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours from baseline to the end of 
treatment with treatment group and gender as fixed factors and baseline mean 
number of micturitions epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours as the covariate in the model. 
Age group (<75 years, ≥75 years) will be included as the stratification factor. 
As part of the ANCOVA results, LS mea ns and two- sided 95% CIs for mean 
changes from baseline within each treatment group will be provided. 
Differences in LS means between mirabegron and placebo will be derived 
together with 95% CIs and p-values.
In order to test for statistical differences in Change from baseline to end of 
treatment in mean number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours between 
mirabegron and placebo, a stratified rank Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) will be used. The response variable is the standardized ranks of 
change from baseline to end of treatment value in mean number of 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours. Treatment group and gender will be 
added as fixed factors in the model while the standardized ranks of mean 
number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours at baseline will be included as 
a covariate. Age group (<75 years, ≥75 years) will be included as the 
stratification factor.
Responder analyses will be performed using a logistic regression model 
including the same factors as the ANCOVA model. Odds ratios that compare 
treatment effect between mirabegron and placebo will be reported with 95% 
CIs.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Analysis on Secondary Endpoints
The c hange from baseline to e nd of treatment for other secondary endpoints 
(excluding mean voided volume [ MVV ]) will be analyzed using a similar 
ANCOVA model as described above for mean number of micturitions per 
24hours.  The change from baseline to end of tr eatment in MVV will be 
analyzed using the Stratified Rank ANCOVA and ANCOVA model as 
described above for mean number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
Safety:  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SAF) defined 
as all subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blind medication.
Number and percentage of treatment -emergent adverse events reported 
during the double -blind period will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, seriousness, severity, and relationship to treatment, overall 
and by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Statistical differences in change from baseline to end of treatment in 
cognitive assessment will be tested using a paired sample Wilcoxon test.
Changes from baseline for PVR and laboratory assessments (biochemistry 
and hem atology) will be summarized in tables by [CONTACT_6982].
Vital sign data will be analyzed separately based on the 3 -day diary and the 
site assessment at each clinic visit. Change from baseline in vital sign 
variables will be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as described for 
the analysis of change from baseline in mean number of micturitions per 
24hours. No p -values will be a calculated.
ECGs will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), the placebo run -in period 
(Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and 
Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 21 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a frequent condition affecting older adults.  It is estimated that 
more than half the elderly  population experience voiding dy sfunction, which may  be 
attributed to idiopathic, neurologic, or cognitive impairment [Nassau et al, 2014].   The 
frequency  and urgency  associated with OAB are often highl y debilitating.  I n addition, 
OAB -related urinary  incontinence (UUI, MUI) has been associated with other deleterious 
health related outcomes in community  dwelling seniors, including falls and fractures, urinary  
tract infections, skin infections, depression, and chronic constipation [Wagg et a l, 2014;
Wagg et al, 2013 ; Kashyup et al, 2014].   Antimuscarinic anticholinergics in 
immediate -release and sustained-release formulations have been demonstrated to be 
efficacious in controlling urgency  and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_849026].  However, t heir 
anticholinergic properties have been shown in several studies to be especially  concerning for 
the older adult patients. As a result of the combination of age- related changes in blood -brain 
barrier permeability  and comorbidity -related chang es in cerebr ovascular status, impaired 
cognitive function has been associated with increasing anticholinergic drug burden
[Boustani et al, 2008; Cai et al, 2013 ;Fox et al, 2011].
Older patients are known to experience more AEs than y ounger patients and the AEs they  
experience with oral antimuscarinic treatment may  be more pronounced [Wagg et al, 2010 ;
Allman et al, 2006] .  Of particular concern are the potentially  adverse effects of 
antimuscarinic medications caused b y age -related changes in central cholinergic transm itter 
systems [Kay  et al, 2005]. Indeed, immediate and extended -release formulations of 
oxybutynin have been associated with cognitive impairment in older people who are 
cognitivel y intact although trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434] ,as well as other newer antimuscarinics, have 
been reported to have no adverse effects on cognition in the cognitivel y-intact o lder adult 
patients and those with mild cognitive impairment [Wagg et al, 2013; Boustani et al, 2008;
Cai et al, 2013 ; Fox et al, 2011 ; American Geriatrics Society , 201 2; Kay  et al, 2006; 
Holick 2008]. 
For example, a recent 12 -week, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial was conducted to 
assess the efficacy  and safety  of fesoterodine in 794 patients aged 65 y ears and older with 
OAB s ymptoms for 3 months or longer [Wagg et al, 2013].   The trial also included patient 
reported outcome assessments [including OAB-q, Treatment Benefit Scale (TBS) , PPBC, 
Urgency  Perception Scale (UPS), and OAB -s]and a Mini -Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) at baseline and 12 weeks.  Although res ults of this study  showed a statistically  
significant improvement over placebo in urgency  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], no change in MMSE score was 
reported [Wagg et al, 2013].  There are very  few data on the effects of the newer 
antimuscarinic medications using more sensitiv e measures of cognitive function (see for 
example Kay  et al, 2006), and no data regarding their effects in combination with other 
anticholinergic medications.  Therefore, the American Geriatric sSociet y has cited oral 
antimuscarinics as “potentially  inappropriate medications and classes to avoid in older 
adults” [American Geriatrics Society  2012].   
Sponsor APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1180570] common and bothersome side effects with antimuscarinics, 
often a reason for discontinuation, were similar between placebo and mirabegron 50 mg 
[Herschorn et al, 2013]. 
There exists an unmet need within the community dwelling sen ior population for 
non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that can simultaneously demonstrate 
control of OAB s ymptoms and positively  impact direct and indirect measures of Activities of 
Daily  Living (ADL), such as life -space assessment, while at the same time not adding to the 
risk of cognitive impairment.   Life-space measures used within community  dwelling older 
adult patients suggest that life- space can assess mobility -enhancing interventions as well as 
the effect of biomedical, psy chological, socioeconomic, environmental, and social support 
factors on mobility  [Allman et al, 2006; Abe et al, 2009 ; Shimada et al, 2010 ;Stewart et al,
2009]. Multiple studies have demonstrated both beneficial and neutral effects on social 
engagement with suc cessf ul treatment of urinary  incontinence among civilian and Veteran’s 
Administration long term care older adult populations [Moga et al, 2013 ;Ouslander et al, 
1982].
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849027] a significant number of older patients.  I n the three 
large, placebo -controlled, randomized, 12- week phase 3 trials with mirabegron , 36–39% of 
patients were ≥65 yearsof age and 7 –12% were ≥75 yearsof age. In a pre- specif ied 
subanaly sis of these studies based on patient age, mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg once -daily

for the older adult population. In an anal ysis to evaluate the magnitude of PRO improvement 
stratified by  [CONTACT_849050] 3 clinical trials, statistically  
significant improvements were observed in patie nts ≥65 years of age for treatment

While the mechanism of action of mirabegron does not suggest an effect on the brai n, 
specific studies of cognitive function have not been conducted. When studied in animal 
models (rat, monkey ), mirabegron was extensively distributed in organs and other tissues 
after oral and IV administration
,except the brain [Astellas. Data on file. 2012]. The same 
characteristics of tissue distribution are expected in humans ;however, no human studies have 
been conducted to determine if mirabegron penetrates the blood brain barrier [Astellas. Data 
on file. 2012].  The effect of mirabegron on cogniti ve function was also not assessed in the 
three large phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518]. However, there were no adverse events reported of memory  
impairment or cognitive disorder in the mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg treatment groups 
(n=586 and 1,889, respectively ).  Al though no cognitive function assessment tools were 
utilized during these studies , the lack of an
y adverse events reported in the cognitive function 
domain supports the safety  profile for mirabegron in older adult patients with OAB [Adapted 
from Astellas.  Myrbetriq. I ntegrated Summary  of Safety  (ISS) Final. Data on File].
There is evidence that vitamin D play s a role in the pathophy siology  of OAB. Calcium is 
involved in bladder function through its role in detrusor smooth muscle contraction.  In a 
study  of women with OAB, a deficiency  in dietary vitamin D was found to lead to a higher 
incidence of OAB s ymptoms [Dallosso et al, 2004]. Another study  found that treatment of 
women with a vitamin D analog improved s ymptom sof OAB [Digesu et al, 2012]. Although 
the elderl y are at high risk of having vitamin D deficiency , there are currently  no data 
evaluating the vitamin D status of patients with OAB related to efficacy  on OAB oral therapy
[Holick 2008].  
In conclusion, this will be the first mirabegron OAB study to specifically  evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of mirabegron in an older population of patients with OAB.  This study 
will also be the first to explore the effect of mirabegron on cognitive function in older adult 
patients.  Oral antimuscarinic agents h ave historically  been the preferred treatment option for 
OAB; however, these agents can be suboptimal in their effect and lead to burdensome 
adverse events, as seen in previous studies in older patients.  This study  is designed to 
demonstrate the reduction in frequency  of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_849029] (> 65 years) and support that mirabegron is a suitable option for the treatment of OAB 
in older patients with multiple comorbidities, not adversel y affecting cognitive function in 
patients with impaired mental status, and increasing qualit y of life.

After oral administration of mirabegron in healthy volunteers, peak mirabegron plasma 
concentrations were attained between 3 to 5 hours.  The absolute bioavailability  increases 
from 29% at a dose of mirabegron 25 mg to 45% at a dose of mirabegron 150 mg under

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2mirabegron and its metabolites following multiple oral doses in older adult subjects 
(≥65years) were similar to those in y ounger subjects (18 to 45 y ears).  The C maxand AUC tau
of mirabegron were approximately  40 – 60% higher in females than in males.  The mean 
terminal t 1/2 is comparable in both sexes.  Evaluation of special populations in the phase 1 
studies demonstrated that volunteers with severe renal impairment (CRCL  15 to 29 mL /min 
or eGFR 15 to 29 mL /min per 1.73m2) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class B) 
had an approximately  2-fold increase in exposure to mirabegron relative to normal healthy  
volunteers.
The in vitro oxidative metabolism of mirabeg ron in human liver microsomes is primarily  
mediated b y cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, but a possible role for CYP2D6 could not be 
excluded.  I n vitro CYP inhibition studies suggest that mirabegron is a moderate and 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.
1.2.3 Summary of C linical Data with Mirabegron
The clinical development program consists of 43 completed clinical studies to date over 
approximately  10 y ears and is comprised of 10,552 subjects (1,812 volunteers and 
9,878 patients) includin g patients with OAB, t ype [ADDRESS_1180575]

13phase 2 and 3 studies (10 in patients with OAB, 1 in patients with L UTS/BOO and 2 in 
patients wit h type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been conducted globall y.
Mirabegron has been studied across the dose range of [ADDRESS_1180576] commonly  reported adverse reactions (> 2% and > placebo)

2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DE SIGN AND VARIABLES
2.1 Study Objectives
The primary  objective is to assess the efficacy  of mirabegron versus placebo (PBO) in the 
treatment of older adult subjects with OAB.
The secondary  objective is to assess the safet y and tolerability of mirabegron versus placebo 
(PBO) in the treatment of older adult subjects with OAB .
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, multi- center stud y.
After Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 2-week placebo run -in period (Visit 2) 
prior to being randomized into the 12- week double -blind treatment period (Visit 3).  Subjects 
will be asked to complete a 3 -day training micturition diary  during the placebo run -inperiod
(Visit 2) .  If subjects meet all entry  criteria at the end of the placebo run -in period, subjects 
will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (Mirabegron or PBO) for 12 weeks of 
treatment.  Three day s before V isits 4 (W eek 4), 5 (W eek 8), and 6 (W eek 12 ), the subject 
will complete a 3- day micturition diary  using the ePRO device .  Post-void residual volume 
(PVR) will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1) and at Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).  
Total study  participation is approximately  20weeks.
During the study , subject enrollment w ill be monitored for the percent of subjects ≥75 years 
of age. If the proportion of subjects ≥75 years of age is < 30%, measures may  be taken to 
enhance enrollment of subjects ≥ 75 years of age.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to either 
mirabegron or placebo (PBO).  Randomization will be stratified b y age < 75 years and 
≥ [ADDRESS_1180583] 
matched to the mirabegron 25 mg tablet and may  also increase to 50 mg PBO after 4 or 8 
weeks. Once a patient has increased dose, they  will remain on that dose for the remainder of 
the study unless for safety  reasons that require discontinuation of study  drug.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale 
Mirabegron 25mg,which may  be increased to 50 mg based on individual efficacy  and 
tolerability ,is the approved dose i n the treatment of overactive bladder in the [LOCATION_002] and 
Canada [Mirabegron US Package Insert, 2012 and Myrbetriq Canadian Monograph, March 
2013] . The dosing regimen of mirabegron [ADDRESS_1180584] size at Week 4 in the phase 3a program approaches the maximum treatment response for
incontinence and micturition. 
The study  design employs an optional dose increase from 25 mg mirabegron to 50 mg 
mirabegron at either Week 4 (Visit 4) or Week 8 (Visit 5) based on the individual subject 
efficacy , tolerability , and I nvestigator discretion. Once a patient has increased do se, they  will 
remain on that dose for the remainder of the stud y unless for safety  reasons that require 
discontinuation of study  drug.

5.3.1 Patient Diary - Micturition and Incontinence
During the study , subjects w ill be requested to complete a ‘Subject diary ’which will be 
implemented on an electronic handheld device. This diary  will collect data on micturition and 
incontinence. The information from the diaries will be used to evaluate the efficacy  of 
treatment . Therefore, subjects will receive full instructions and training on how to complete 
the diary atVisit 2 (Placebo Run- In) and will be counseled on the importance of completing 
the diaries prior to the next visit. The training diary will be reviewed with the subject b y the 
Investigator or designee to ensure accuracy  and completion.  The diaries and questionnaires 
will be revi ewed during each visit after Visit 2 (Placebo Run- In) by [CONTACT_849057].
Diaries will be completed 3consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 3), Week 4 
(Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).During this activity , the 
subject will not come to the clinic for a visit. Site staff will contact [CONTACT_423] [ADDRESS_1180611] they  need to complete the electronic diary , review

5.3.4 Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale 
The Patient Perception of I ntensit y of Urgency  Scale ( PPI[INVESTIGATOR_28936])is a scale that will be completed 
as part of the micturition diary .
For each micturition and/or incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], subjects will be asked to rate the degree of 
associated urgency  according to the following validated 5 -point categorical scale. The 
categ ories are recommended by  [CONTACT_487415]
[CPMP/EWP/18/01, Final].
0 –No urgency , I felt no need to empty  my bladder, but did so for other reasons.
1 –Mild urgency , I could postpone voiding as long as necessary , without fear of 
wetting m yself.
2 –Moderate urgency , I could postpone voiding for a short while, without fear of 
wetting m yself.
3 –Severe urgency , I could not postpone voiding, but had to rush to the toilet in order 
not to wet my self.
4 –Urge incontinence, I leaked before arriving at the toilet.
5.3.5 OAB Symptoms, Quality of Life, Bladder Health and Treatment Benefit
OAB has significant effects on health -related quality  of life ( QoL)of the afflicted subjects. 
This has been quantified in various e mpi[INVESTIGATOR_2292] [Wall et al, 1993]. QoL is determined b y 
socio- demographic, clinical, psy chological and social factors. This underlines the importance 
of assessing the perceptions of subjects themselves when evaluating the effects of medical or 
pharmacolo gical treatment. This is done in QoL  research, also in the OAB field [Palmtag 
2004]. In this study , the Overactive Bladder- questionnaire (OAB -q), the Patient Perception of 
Bladder Condition (PPBC) , TS-VAS, and University  of Alabama – Birmingham Life Space 
Assessment (UAB- LSA) will be utilized .
[IP_ADDRESS] Overactive Bladder -questionnaire
OAB s ymptoms and QoL in relation to OAB will be assessed by  [CONTACT_849058] ( OAB -q) [Coy ne et al, 2002].  This questionnaire has validated psy chometric 
properties, has been used extensively  in QoL -research in respondents with OAB, and has been 
shown to be responsive in treatment studies [Coy ne et al, 2002].  The OAB -q is a self -reported
questionnaire with 33 items, which contain the dimensions Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Concern, Sleep, Social 
Interaction, and a S ymptom Bother scale with eight sy mptoms [Garely  et al, 2007].

Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Perception of Bladder Condition 
The Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC )is a validated , global assessment tool 
using a 6 -point Likert scale that asks subjects to rate their subjective impress ion of their current 
bladder condition [Coy ne et al, 2006]. The PPBC questionnaire will be assessed at Baseline 
(Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Satisfaction – Visual Analog Scale 
The Treat ment Satisfaction –Visual Analog Scale (TS -VAS) is a visual analog scale that asks 
subjects to rate their satisfaction with the treatment by  [CONTACT_1299] a vertical mark on a line that 
runs from 0 (No, not at all) to 10 (Yes, completel y). The TS -VAS will be as sessed at Baseline 
(Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).
[IP_ADDRESS] University of Alabama,  Birmingham Life Space Assessment 
The Universit y of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB) Study  of Aging Life -Space Assessment 
(LSA) measures mobility in terms of the spatial extent of a person's life.  The purpose of the 
Life-Space Assessment is to determine a person's usual pattern of mobility  during the month 
preceding the assessment.  L ife-space is defined based upon the distance a perso n routinel y 
travels to perform activities over this time frame.  The UAB- LSA includes determining how 
far and how often the person leaves his or her place of residence and the degree of 
independence the person has.
Each level of life -space represents a distance further from the room where one sleeps.
0 = Mobility  limited to the room where one sleeps
1 = Mobility  limited to within one's dwelling
2 = Mobility  limited to the space just proximal to one's personal living space (for 
instance, a porch, patio, or yard just outside the home or hallway  outside of 
an apartment)
3 = Mobility  limited to one's neighborhood
4 = Mobility  limited to one's town
5 = Mobility  outside one's town
The UAB -LSA will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and 
Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 6).

5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AEcan therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investiga tional) product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:

Requires active intervention
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684].
Due to the study  objective(s), design, and variables identified in Section 2of the protocol and 
during the conduct of the study from the time of informed consent until the final study  visit , 
lack of efficacy  with the study  medi cation intended to treat overactive bladder will not be 
submitted to a Health Authority  as an expedited adverse event report.
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either theInvestigator or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
Results in death,
Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at imme diate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death),
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life func tions,
Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect,
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious),
Other medicall y impor tant events.
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849033]. These 
events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, must also usually  be considered 
serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal pr oducts administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
Suspected abuse/m isuse of the medicinal product(s)

5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationship to 
the study drug Criteria for causal rela tionship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and /orin which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by [CONTACT_771225]. Information on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or 
unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).

7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  [CONTACT_29007]. A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis.  In addition,
specifications for tables, listings, and figures willbe produced. The SAP will be finalized 
before database softlock at the latest.  Any deviations from the anal ysis planned in SAP will 
be justified in the C linical Study Report.
Sponsor APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1180634] -baseline visit will be used to derive these variables at these visits.
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit is defined as the last post-baseline visit at the end of the 
double -blind treatment period for which data is available. The EOT visit value for diary  
variables is the average or number of the diary  measurements for Week 12, as applicable.  If 
no Week [ADDRESS_1180635] at α = 0.[ADDRESS_1180636] deviation (SD) or standard 
error (SE), minimum, median, maximum unless specified otherwise . Categorical variables 
will be described using absolute and relative frequency .
7.1 Sample Size
Sample Size Justification: 
The co -primary  endpoints for this study  are change from baseline to end of treatment in the 
mean number of micturitions per [ADDRESS_1180637] the change from baseline to end of treatment in the mean number of 
micturitions per 24 h ours based on the 3 -day micturition diary . The overall power is then 
calculated for the stud y based on these co- primary endpoint s.
The sample size calculation for the change from baseline in the final visit mean number of 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours is based on nonparametric methods since the results from 
previous phase 2 and 3 studies indicated that the assumption of normal ity may  not be valid.  
The results of these studies showed frequent ties for the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_849034] 7 categories. The actual 
primary  statistical anal ysis will not group the d ata.  The categories are shown below together 
with the percentages occurring for placebo and mirabegron 50 mg as found in older adult

≥ 0.33 21.08% 10.16%
Based on the table above, t he probability  that a subject on mirabegron will respond better 
than a subject on placebo is 56.3% (nQuery  7.0). Based on a Wilcoxon (Mann- Whitney ) 
rank-sum test that P(X<Y) = 0.5 (continuous outcome), 340 incontinent subjects per 
treatment group will yield 82% power with a [ADDRESS_1180638] at a significance level of 0.05.
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_849035] a 0.796 mean (SD=2.7) reduction for mirabegron 50 mg compared 
to PBO in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours in North American subjects who 
were 65 years or older. A sample size of 340 subjects pe r treatment group will yield 97% 
power to detect a reduction of .[ADDRESS_1180639] at a significance level of 0.05 assuming a SD of 2.7 (nQuery  7.0).
Assuming ‘Change from baseline in mean number of m icturitions per day ’ and ‘Change from 
baseline in mean number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_914] ’ are independent the overall 
power would therefore be 80%.
The historical data show at least 15% of the randomized subjects will drop out during the 
double -blind period. Consequently  an additional 60 subjects per treatment group need be 
enrolled. This brings the total required incontinent subjects per treatment group to 400. 
Based on the historical data a 20% failure rate is predicted due to lack of incontinence and 
another 10% failure due to a combination of drop out and placebo response during the run in
period. Therefore a 30% screen failure rate is expected. 
In order to randomize 800 subjects with incontinence it is expected that 1,150 subjects will 
need to be screened.

Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and marked abnormalities in hepatic functions must be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertin ent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests. The site must complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate document . Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function 
testing must be followed as described below.
Confirme d moderatel y abnormal LFTs must be repeated 2- [ADDRESS_1180673] is

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the Investigator is expected to:
Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases must be recorded as adverse events on the AE page of e CRF s. 
Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease 
thatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities must be noted. Non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The Investigator must 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function.
Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medication s), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, must be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of theeCRF s.  Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
must be entered on the LA-CRF or an appropriate document .
Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
Based on the subject ’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including:
oacute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)
oultrasound or other imaging to assess bilia ry tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
osubstance abuse testing
Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations
Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or 
acute live r disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from the study . The Investigat ormay determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment must occur if:
ALT or AST > 8X ULN
ALT or AST > 5X ULN for more than 2 weeks
ALT or AST > 3X ULN and (TBL > 2X ULN or IN R> 1.5)
ALT or AST > 3X ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 212.3 Appendix 3: Most Common Serious Adverse Events
The following is a list of serious adverse events that the Sponsor considers to be associated 
with the disease state being studied. The list does NOT change your reporting obligations or 
prevent the need to report an adverse event meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed in 
Section 5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). The purpose of this list is to alert 
you that some events reported as SAEs may  not require expedited reporting to the regulatory  
authorities based on the classification of “common serious adverse events”. You are required 
to follow the requirements detailed in Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
(SAEs).
For IND safety  reporting, single occurrences of the following events may  be excluded from 
expedited reporting to the FDA. If aggregate analysis of these events indicate they  occur 
more frequently  with study  drug, an expedited IND safety report may be submitted to the 
FDA.
Most Common SAEs for Mirabegron:
Serious adverse events reported by  [CONTACT_2669] 2 patients and exceeding active control included 
cerebrovascular accident (0.4%) and osteoarthritis (0.2%). Serum ALT/AST increased from 
baseline b y greater than 10 -fold in 2 patients (0.3%) taking Mirabegron 50 mg, and these 
markers subsequently  returned to baseline while both patients continued Mirabegron. In one 
study , serious adverse events of neoplasm were reported by  0.1%, 1.3%, and 0.5% of patie nts 
treated with Mirabegron [ADDRESS_1180674] cancer, lung neoplasm malignant and prostate cancer.

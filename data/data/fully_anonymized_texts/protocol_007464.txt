4. BACKGROUND  
 
A. Quality of recovery after CRS-HIPEC surgery 
Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(CRS-HIPEC) is an extensive and complicated surgical procedure that has been 
shown to provide long-term survival in select groups of patients with peritoneal 
carcinomatosis.

High requirements of opi[INVESTIGATOR_76197] s ide effects (i.e. ileus, delirium, 
nausea and vomiting and dry mouth) play a significant role in the recovery of a 
significant portion of the patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC.[ADDRESS_82790]

manage postoperative pain during and afte r CRS-HIPEC surgery. A recent study 
from our institution demonstrates that mo re than two-thirds of the patients who 
undergo HIPEC surgery receive TEA.14 This analgesia technique entails the 
placement of a catheter in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_76200] a solution based on the 
combination of local anesthetics (ropi[INVESTIGATOR_76201]) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (fentanyl

Moreover, suboptimal functioning of su ccessfully inserted epi[INVESTIGATOR_76206].21,23 In this clinical 
scenario, intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_76207].  
To complicate the matter, not all patients  who are scheduled for CRS-
HIPEC surgery are candidates to receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].  A large 
retrospective study from our group demonstrated that close to 25% of the patients  
who had HIPEC surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center did not receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_76208]. The most 
common reasons why epi[INVESTIGATOR_76209]-HIPEC are a reduced number of plat elets (thrombocytopenia), anticoagulant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76210]. Both clinical conditions are associated with an increased risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_76211]. A small fraction of patients might also refuse the placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_76212].  
Furthermore, intraoperative coagulation derangements and postoperative 
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies are also the most common reasons why epi[INVESTIGATOR_76213].

While epi[INVESTIGATOR_76215] “gold standard”  for 
postoperative pain management after HIPEC,[ADDRESS_82794] (TAP) Block 
The TAP block is a regional analgesia te chnique that entails the unilateral 
or bilateral administration of a local anesthesia solution (15-20 cc) into the 
transverse abdominus plane . This virtual plane lies above the transverse 
abdominus muscle in the abdominal wall  where spi[INVESTIGATOR_76216]. The 
traditional TAP block is performed in the lateral abdominal wall between iliac crest and costal margin and only provides effective analgesia to the distal or lower half of the abdomen.
[ADDRESS_82795] added a subcostal approach to  provide analgesia to the upper half 
of the abdomen. In a cadaveric study of the four-quadrant TAP block (4QTAP), dermatomes T8-L1 were adequately covered with the solution of local anesthetic.  Therefore, it was originally hypothesized that the 4QTAP block may be more beneficial in major abdominal surgery co mpared to the traditional TAP approach 
alone.
36 In a prospective study of 124 patient s, the surgical incision for abdominal 
surgery was within the dermatomal limits of the 4QTAP in 70% of patients.37 In a 
later study by [CONTACT_76279], the authors demonstrated that 4QTAP with levobupi[INVESTIGATOR_76217].

The 4QTAP block may provide some advantages over epi[INVESTIGATOR_76218].40 In addition, 
4QTAP blocks are not associated with pos toperative urine retention neither the 
risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_76219]. Lastly, the use of 4QTAP blocks can 
reduce the use of resources and personnel because there is no need for frequent monitoring of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_76220].  
With the increased safety of ultrasound guided needle placement and ‘real -
time’ visualization through dynamic scanning, serious complications are rare  
with the 4QTAP block.

lower pain scores when compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473].43 Giving the 
relative large volume of local anesthetics required for adequate TAP block analgesia, systemic toxicities are a potenti al complication. However, staying within 
the reported maximum local anesthetic volumes significantly decreases the risk.

Distribution. After bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76227], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76228].  To some extent, 
local anesthetics are distributed to all body  tissues, with high concentrations found 
in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain.  
The rate and degree of diffusion are governed by: 
1. The degree of plasma protein binding 2. The degree of ionization 
3. The degree of lipid solubility 
Metabolism. Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76229].  Patients 
with hepatic disease, especially those with  severe hepatic disease, may be more 
susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_76230] (PPX) is the (largely ina ctive) major metabolite of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40482]: approximately 5% of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76231].  
Excretion. After bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76227], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76232].  
Various pharmacokinetic parameters can be significantly altered by: 
x The presence of hepatic or renal disease 
x Factors affecting urinary pH

of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76234]. 
Protocol Number 2017-[ADDRESS_82798] asma concentrations were higher in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment th an in the healthy control volunteers.   
Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_4852], these drugs should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic  disease, because of their inability to 
metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_76235].

 E. Rationale for Study. 
 Quality of recovery after surgery is a patient-related outcome that integrates 
postoperative psychosocial and physiologic parameters as perceived by [CONTACT_1962]. 
While TEA is the standard of care in patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC surgery, it 
cannot be offered to a large number of patients, and it is associated with adverse events in those treated with the technique. Therefore, 4Q-TAP block is an attractive and safe analgesic technique to be offered to patients undergoing CRS-
HIPEC surgery. However, it is unknown if a 4Q-TAP block with the use of plain and liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76242]-HIPEC surgery.  4Q-TAP blocks with plain and liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76243], therefore the results of our study could be extrapolated to a larger number of 
patients. Unpublished results from a retrospective analysis of a group (n=15) of 
patients who had CRS-HIPEC surgery with 4Q-TAP blocks with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76244]. Furthermore, we 
observed no major complications related to the technique.   We hypothesize that patients who undergo CRS-HIPEC surgery with 4Q-TAP block will have a non-inferior pos toperative quality of recovery (QoR) 
compared to those treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].

 B. Interventions 
 Patients will be randomized 1:1 on the morning of surgery to one of the 
following 2 interventions: 
 TEAgroup: Patients in this group will be treated as standard of care. An 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76245]. The catheter will be placed between the thoracic vertebral spaces 8 and 12 according to routine care. A bolus or infusion of local anesthetic 
solution with or without the addition opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s will be given before surgical incision 
according to anesthesia provider ’s clinical judgment. If deemed appropriate, a pre-
incision epi[INVESTIGATOR_76246] (300-800 micrograms) may be administered according to  the anesthesia provider ’s clinical judgment. 
4Q-TAP block group: Patients in this group will have an ultrasound guided 
4Q-TAP block. A maximum of [ADDRESS_82801] of care and judgment of the attending anesthesiologists. Before surgery, p.o. celecoxib, tramadol extended release and/or pregabalin will be administered according to clinical judgment. Intraoperative infusions of propofol, dexmedetomidine and ketamine will be 
permitted per standard of care. Intravenous infusion of lidocaine will not be permitted at any time. Intravenous fentanyl, sufentanil or hydromorphone will be administered according to clinical judgment of the attending anesthesiologist. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given per surgical routine care. Medications for 
prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting (dexamethasone 8-10 mg, ondasentron 4-8 
mg and/or aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 80-125 mg) will be given according to the judgment of the attending anesthesiologists.   Upon arrival to the postoperative anesthesia care unit or intensive care unit, postoperative analgesia will consist of  the administration of boluses of 
hydromorphone or fentanyl to achieve a pain score < 4 (on a 0-10 NRS). If needed, patients will receive intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with hydromorphone 
or fentanyl. Once patients can tolerate p.o. medications, they will transition to oral 
Protocol Number 2017-[ADDRESS_82802] of care. 
Foley catheter will be removed 48 hours after surgery if clinically indicated.    D. Data collection and measurements 
 Preoperaive data:  Demographic data to be obtained includes height (cm), 
weight (kg), age (yr), gender, (ASA) physical status, and self-declared ethnicity. Patients will be questioned for social hi story (tobacco) and medical history to 
calculate Charlson comorbidity index sco re. QoR 15 will be obtained before 
surgery. Pain meds (type, dose and frequency)  The following intraoperative data  will be obtained from electronic medical 
records: surgery and anesthesia time, surgery type and extent of resection, 
intraoperative chemotherapy (type and dose), highest temperature, intraoperative 
anesthetic and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. Blood loss, fluid therapy and urinary output will also be collected at the end of surgical procedure. 
The following postoperative data  will be obtained from electronic medical 
records: Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_76247], breakthrough pain medication 
requirements and oxygen requirements in PACU and in nursing floor (first 48 hours postoperatively). QoR score and pain scores will be obtained on postoperative day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10(±1) and 30(±2) days if the patient is still admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Nausea and vomiting, requirement of an tiemetics, pruritus, requirement of 
antihistaminic medications and requirement of naloxone in PACU and first and second postoperative morning after surg ery will be collected. Ambulation time, 
flatus and bowel movements (first time), constipation, length of stay will be 
obtained. Incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_76248] m easured on postoperative day 1 and 2. 
Postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo scale during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]) and perioperative morbidity scores (POMS day 7) will be obtained from medical records and 30 days after surgery. Preoperative a nd postoperative routine laboratory data 
results will also be collected from  electronic medical records.  
Duration of Patient Participation 
Patients that consent to the optional  MDASI questionnaires will participate 
until the POMS data has been completed on postoperative day 30.  
 
 E. Outcomes definitions 
Quality of Recovery will be measured using the QoR-15 scale. The QoR scale is 
a validated scoring system that allows for the quantification of a patient’s early 
postoperative health status.    Pain Intensity at rest and cough will be measure using a VNRS (0 = no pain  - 
10 = worst pain ever). Data will be reported as time-weighted pain scores from discharge from the PACU until 48 hours after the end of surgery.

 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_76249] 48 hours after the end of surgery. 
 Length of stay will be calculated from day of surgery to date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
  Adverse Event Definition An adverse event is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience which develops or 
worsens during the course of the study, whether or not the event is considered 
related to study drug. Adverse events (AEs) related to the study interventions  
will be recorded within the first 48 hours after the end of surgery. AEs related to the study will include postoperative hypotension needed pharmacological intervention including fluid resuscitation or temporary holding or discontinuation of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76250], failed block (defined as patchy block or unilateral block needing pharmacological interventions or catheter removal), epi[INVESTIGATOR_76251].  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in any of the following outcomes: 
x death; x is life-threatening; 
x requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32957]; 
x results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
x is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or

within the first [ADDRESS_82803] of 4 quadrants TAP blocks (4Q-
TAP) versus Thoracic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13904] (TEA - routine care) on the quality of 
recovery (QoR) will be conducted using total scores on each patient acquired from the QoR-15.  The QoR-15, as previously mentioned, is a validated instrument with well-studied psychometric properties used to measure postoperative quality of 
recovery.  The QoR-15 consists of 15 items. All 15 items follow a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 10 (where “0” refers to none of the time [poor] and “10” refers to 
all of the time [excellent]).  A patient’s total score is the sum score across all 15

16 
 items (note: the last 5 items are reverse scored).  The lowest score a patient can 
receive is “0” and the highest score is “150”; where hi gher total scores indicate 
better quality of recovery.  To evaluate th e trial changes in QoR-15 total scores will 
be computed for each treatment arm.  The changes will be compared between patients receiving 4Q-TAP Block and patien ts receiving TEA. Figure 1 illustrates 
the trial’s development over time.  Once a patient is randomized and the preoperative QoR-15 is administered, which takes approximately 2.4 minutes to complete, patients will be provided postoperative QoR-15 approximately 26 hours after surgery (Figure 1: [A]; Stark et al).  Within patient changes from baseline will 
be computed for each treatment arm.  These changes will be compared between treatment arms (Figure 1: [B]).     
 
Figure 1: Trial Schema  
         
 
This randomized trial will be used to determine if 4Q-TAP Block is non-inferior to 
TEA based on postoperative changes in QoR-15 using a non-inferiority margin of 
10 units.  According to Stark et al., th e reported mean change in QoR-15 before 
and after surgery is -22 (95%CI: -26 to  -18) based on [ADDRESS_82804] deviation of 23 units for 
the change in QoR- 15’s total score  pertaining to each treatment arm, which was 
ultimately used to derive the study’s sample size.      
The following hypothesis test will be used to evaluate the trial: 
 H
0:  μ4Q-TAP Block  –  μTEA ≥  10.0  
 H a:  μ4Q-TAP Block  –  μTEA = 0 (rejecting H 0 implies non-inferiority) 
 
We will use a one-sided t-test test with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%.  A non-inferiority margin of 10 was considered by [CONTACT_76282]-15 of -25 units in the TEA arm and that the average change in 
QoR-15 for the 4Q-TAP Block treatment arm would be no greater than -35.

Safety 
All patients who receive any portion of the intended treatments (TEA or 
4Q-TAP) will be included in safety analysis.  
Protocol Number 2017-[ADDRESS_82805] will be used to evaluate the difference between QoR-15 change 
scores between treatment arms.  Change scores within treatment arms will be summarized using the mean and 95%CIs.  Linear regression analysis will be 
used to assess QoR-[ADDRESS_82806].   
 
The association between dichotomous outcomes (dependent variables) and treatment-related factors will be assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.  Time-to-event outcomes will be summarized at critical time 
points using the method of Kaplan-Meier.  Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to 
visualize the time-to-event information.  Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to model the time-to-event outcomes using select covariates of interest.     
 
Upon any modifications to the eligibility  criteria and with the intention of 
broadening patient characteristics, for ex ample: by [CONTACT_76283][INVESTIGATOR_2441], we will address this issue by  [CONTACT_76284] a 
regression model that includes prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_76254].  Moreover, subgroup analyses will be explored even though we anticipate randomization will maintain covariate balance between treatment arms.

 Monitoring Procedures  
Monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made periodically during the 
study, to ensure that all aspects of th e current, approved protocol/amendment(s) 
are followed. Original source documents will be reviewed for verification of data 
in the database. In the event that the or iginal medical records cannot be obtained 
for a patient that is seen by a non-study physician at a non-study institution, photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_76256]. It is important that the Investigator a nd relevant study personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Phone contacts and site visits will be conducted to ensure that the protocol is being followed and that any protocol deviations are properly documented.  Clinical monitoring will include a verification that Informed Consent was properly obtained for all enrolled study participants, a review of clinical records for 
accuracy and completeness, resolution of missing or inconsistent results and a 
review of source documents.  The clinical monitor will verify that the CRFs are in 
agreement with the source documentation and other records.  The investigator 
will make available to the clinical monitor for review all Informed Consent documents, Internet access to completed CRFs, source documentation, original laboratory data and other relevant records for all enrolled patients at the site.  It is 
important that the investigator and other relevant site personnel are available for 
consultation with the clinical monitors during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted at the site to the monitoring process. 
Additionally, telephone and/or e-mail contac t will be conducted on a regular basis 
with the investigator and the site staff to ensure that the protocol is being followed and to address any issues that may occur during the course of the 
study. 
If a deficiency is noted during an on-s ite visit (or at any other time during 
the course of the study), the clinical monitor is required to discuss the situation 
with the investigator to secure compliance. Monitoring visit will begin after enrollment of first [ADDRESS_82808] (DSMB): The monitoring of this trial will be provided by [CONTACT_76287] 1, below outlines the re quired study assessments.

Adverse Events 
General  
All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be monitored from 
the time of procedure through end of the study.  
An AE is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a patient whether or 
not it is considered to be device relate d. In addition, the definition of AE applies 
to any event with an onset post study pr ocedure or to any underlying diseases, 
present at baseline, that exacerbate in se verity post study procedure. Therefore, 
an underlying disease that was present at th e time of enrollment is not reported 
as an AE, but any increase in the severi ty of the underlying disease is to be 
reported as an AE. All reported AEs mu st be recorded in the database. A 
description of the event, including the st art date, resolution date, action taken, 
and the outcome should be provided, along with the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship between the AE, the study treatment and the study procedure. This protocol will use common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0. For the AEs not characterized in the CTACE, the following definitions 
for rating severity of AEs will be used:   
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, bu t easily tolerated; are of minor 
irritant type; causing no loss of time from normal activities; 
Protocol Number 2017-0492 
Revised June 12, 2020
22 
 symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; 
signs or symptoms are transient. 
Moderate: Interferes with the patient’s usual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment. 
Severe: Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of 
the patient’s usual activity and requires treatment.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which leads to:   
x Death due to any cause 
x Life-threatening condition 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266] 
x Necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure 
x Results in congenital abnormality 
All SAE’s will be reported.  
 
Device-Related Adverse Event : Not applicable  
 Procedure-Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be 
procedure-related when, in the judgment of  the Investigator; it is reasonable to 
believe that the event is associated with the assigned study procedure.  Other 
products, surgical techniques, or medi cations required specifically for the 
procedure are likely to have contributed to the occurrence of the event.  Concomitant Medication-Related Adverse Event:  Not applicable 
 Pre-Existing Condition-Related Adverse Event:  an adverse event is considered 
to be related to a pre-existing condition when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the patient’s pre -existing 
condition and is not specific to the 
STUDY procedures. Pre-existing conditions that 
are aggravated or become more severe during or after the procedure should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if the event may be more appropriately classified as procedure-related. The Investigator should follow all unresolved serious adverse events until the 
events are resolved, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient has withdrawn 
consent, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. 
For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events, 
because they are normally expected to occur in conjunction post-surgery, or are associated with customary, standard care of patients undergoing these procedures: 
x Early post-operative pain (within 48hou rs post-index procedure) at the 
incision site and/or related to position on procedure table 
Protocol Number 2017-[ADDRESS_82809]-anesthesia emesis, nausea, or headache (within [ADDRESS_82810]-
index procedure) 
x Chest pain without associated ECG changes  
x Hematocrit decrease from baseline not associated with hemodynamic changes, remaining above 30% and not requiring transfusion 
x Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequalea following endoscopic procedure, even if requiring correction 
x Low grade temperature increase ( d38.3qC/d101qF)  
x Sinus bradycardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention 
x Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention 
x Any pre-planned surgical procedures 
This listing of events is intended to prov ide guidance to the investigational sites for 
purposes of adverse event reporting.  The Inve stigator at the investigational site should 
utilize his/her own clinical judgment in evaluating adverse experiences, and may 
decide that the above events should be reported as adverse events.   
Reporting of Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Events, regardless of attribution, will be reported per 
MDACC’s standard practice and requirements, and per sponsor guidelines.  
Device Failures and Malfunctions. Not applicable

Prior to participation in th e clinical Study, each patient must give written Informed 
Consent after the context of the study has been fully explained to the patient in 
language that is easily understood by [CONTACT_102]. The patients must also be 
given the opportunity to ask questions and have those questions answered to their satisfaction. 
Written Informed Consent must be recorded appropriately by [CONTACT_76289]’s, or their legal representative’s dated signature. The patient will receive a 
copy of the Informed Consent form. 
Amending the Protocol 
All significant protocol changes that may affect the following must be submitted 
and approved by [CONTACT_76290]: 
x validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the 
approved protocol; 
x relationship of the likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve 
the protocol; 
x scientific soundness of the investigational plan, or; 
x rights, safety, or welfare of the human patients involved in the 
investigation. 
Emergency Actions 
The Investigator must give notice of any emergency deviations and justification 
for the deviation to the IRB/IEC as quickly as possible after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], in any event no later than [ADDRESS_82811] the study according to the protocol.  
Investigators will adhere to procedures fo r reporting study deviations to their IRB 
in accordance with their specific IRB reporting policies and procedures. 
Deviations will be submitted annually per MDA policy.  
Coverage of Expenses The treated patients will not be reimbursed or compensated for participating in 
the Study.

 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patients will be maintained throughout the study.  A unique 
identification code will be assigned to each patient participating in this Study.  Any data that may be published in abstracts, scientific journals, or presented at medical meetings will reference a unique patient code and will not reveal the patient’s identity.   
All laboratory and clinical data gathered in this protocol will be stored in a password-protected database. All patient  information will be handled using 
anonymous identifiers. Linkage to patient identity is only possible after accessing 
a password-protected database. Access to  the database is only available to 
individuals directly involved in the study. 
 
Information gathered for this study will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, or for other research. Once the research has been completed, identifiers will be retained for as long as is required by [CONTACT_76291], and at that point will be destroyed. 
Source Documentation 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_76259].  Source documents include patient medical record s, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, 
Investigator’s patient s tudy files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests (e.g., 
laboratory tests). 
The following minimum information sh ould be recorded in the patient’s 
medical records: 
x The date the patient entered the study and the patient number 
x The study protocol number 
x The date that inform ed consent was obtained 
x Evidence that the patient meets St udy eligibility requirements (e.g., 
medical history, Study procedures and/or evaluations) 
x The dates of all Study related patient visits 
x Evidence that required procedures and/or evaluations were completed 
x Use of any concurrent medications 
x All lab reports taken for this study

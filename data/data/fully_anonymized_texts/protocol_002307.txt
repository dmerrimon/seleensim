Care versus Anti-hypotension Therapy 
INTRODUCTION
You are being asked to participate in a research study that is supported by [CONTACT_92959] J. Peters Veterans  
Affairs Medical Center (JJPVAMC). This  research study is being performed at the Icahn School of  
Medicine at Mount Sinai, an affiliate of the JJPVAMC.  Before you decide to take part in this study, it is  
important for you to know why the research is being done and what it will involve.  This includes any  
potential risks to you, as well as any potential benefits you might receive.   
Please read the information below closely, and discuss it with your family and friends if you wish.  You  
can also ask one of the study staff members if there is anything that is not clear to you or if you would like  
more details.  Please take your time to decide if you want to participate.  If you do decide to take part in  
this study, your signature [CONTACT_284256],  
and that you were able to discuss any questions and concerns you had with a member of the study team.
1.Purpose of study and how long it will last:
You are being asked to participate in the study because you have a traumatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) and 
are between the ages of 18 and 89 years of age.  The purpose of this research study is to compare usual 
care treatment of symptomatic hypotension (dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, blurry vision, passing-out,  
etc.) to treatment initiated based on low blood pressure (BP) readings (BP<110 mmHg for males and <100 
mmHg for females), regardless of symptoms, during acute rehabilitation following your SCI. The 
medication (midodrine) has been approved for experimental use in this study by [CONTACT_105571] 4 
clinical trial. The results will help us to understand if we can minimize or eliminate disruptions to the 
prescribed rehabilitation program due to low BP during inpatient rehabilitation and explore the safety of 
initiating treatment for low BP before symptoms arise. If you choose to participate in this study, you 
understand that there is an approximated time commitment of 6 weeks. It is also required that you to sign 
both a VA informed consent and Mount Sinai School of Medicine informed consent. A copy of these 
consent forms will be given to you and a copy will be kept by [CONTACT_5051]. This study is sponsored 
and funded by [CONTACT_742116], Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research and 
the Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research & Development Service National Center for the Medical 
Consequences of SCI. 
Participants:
You will be one of about 80 participants in this study participating at Icahn School of Medicine at  
Mount Sinai’s Inpatient SCI Rehabilitation Unit. 
Inclusions:
You are between the age of 18-89 years of age

2.Description of the Study Including Procedures to be Used:
If you consent to participate in this research study, you will remain in the inpatient unit for acute SCI 
rehabilitation therapy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai located on Floor 2 of the Klingenstein  
Clinical Center (KCC building). You will be randomized to receive either the usual care treatment or the 
BP threshold treatment, and you have an equal chance of being assigned to the usual care or the BP 
threshold treatment groups.  The usual care treatment group will receive BP management according to the 
current practice on the SCI Rehabilitation Unit. The treatment group will receive BP management, 
regardless of symptoms, to maintain systolic BP (SBP) between 111-135 mmHg for males and 101-135 
mmHg for females. For both the usual care and the BP threshold treatment groups, the treatment plan will 
be driven by a protocol programmed into your Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with strict guidelines 
for moving from level to level. The protocol will be reviewed daily by a co-investigator who will complete  
a daily decision tree survey within your medical record.  Your doctor will continue to following your

medical care closely and will initiate any necessary clinical intervention in the event of an incidental 
finding.  
Treatment Group - if you are randomly assigned to the treatment group you will receive a 
medication that will increase your BP (midodrine hydrochloride).  This treatment will be started 
based on your low BP, regardless of if you experience symptoms that are associated with low BP 
(dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, blurry vision, loss of consciousness, etc.).  Before you start 
on any medication you will receive physical countermeasures to increase BP (abdominal binders, 
compression stockings, etc.).  If your BP remains low after using these countermeasures you will 
begin to take midodrine 2 or 3 times a day, as appropriate for your BP needs.  We will start you 
at a low dose of midodrine (5 mg) and will monitor your BP several times a day for several days.  
If your BP remains low (SBP<110 mmHg for males and <100 mmHg for females) we will 
increase the dose to 10 mg and again monitor your BP several times a day for several days.  If 
your BP still remains low we will increase the dose to 15 mg and again monitor your BP several 
times a day for several days.  We will repeat this procedure until your seated SBP is between 
111-135 mmHg. If your blood pressure is not well controlled (seated SBP between 111-135 
mmHg) on midodrine or fludrocortisone, you will be prescribed a different medication, droxidopa,  
to increase your blood pressure. You would be started on this medication at a dose of 100mg 1 
or 2 or 3 times a day as appropriate for your blood pressure needs.
 
Usual Care Group  - if you are randomly assigned to the usual care group you will receive treatment only 
if you experience symptoms that are associated with low BP (dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, blurry 
vision, loss of consciousness, etc.).  Treatment to lessen or eliminate these symptoms of low BP will be 
guided by [CONTACT_742118] (abdominal binders, 
comperssion stockings, etc.) and/or medications (midodrine, fludrocortisone, and/or droxidopa) .  
Testing Protocol - Prior to entering the treatment protocol, you will be asked to visit the testing laboratory 
located on the Inpatient SCI Rehabilitation Unit at Mount Sinai. You will be transferred to a laboratory 
bed and will remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742084]. Three sticky electrodes will be placed on 
your chest and abdomen area. A BP cuff will be placed around your upper right arm and a finger cuff on 
the left middle or ring finger. A small Doppler ultrasound probe with ultrasound gel will placed over your 
left temple to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). After a period of [ADDRESS_1014449], a 10-minute 
sample of supi[INVESTIGATOR_27443] (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (RR), BP and CBF data will be collected. Venous 
Occlusion Plethysmography (VOP) will be collected while you remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742085] 5-
minute recordings. After the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742086], you will be passively moved into a seated position, 
with the knees and hips at 90 ° for another 10-minute seated HR, RR, BP and CBF data collection. You

will then be asked to complete two surveys, one related to autonomic dysreflexia (AD) symptoms and 
another related to orthostatic hypotension (OH) symptoms. In addition to the weekly autonomic functional 
assessments, participants will have beat-to-beat BP assessments (via the finometer) performed during at 
least once a week while the participant simultaneously undergoes routine clinical bowel evacuation 
(standard of care) as well as bladder evacuations (standard of care as well). In addition, if a urodynamic 
study is clinically indicated and performed/overseen on the unit by [CONTACT_30951], an assessment 
of beat-to-beat finger BP will be simultaneously recorded. The beat-to-beat BP data will be recorded 
continuously for the entire period of bowel management and bladder management and/or testing. This 
assessment of beat-to-beat finger BP during bowel and bladder management and/or testing is optional 
based on subjects’ willingness. Participants will also complete weekly surveys of autonomic sensations 
and control of bladder and bowel function.  Finally you will be instrumented with a 24-hour Holter 
monitor, which will record HR and BP every 20-minutes during the daytime and every 30-minutes at night  
while you go about your normal daily routine. A log will be kept to record your daily activities, 
rehabilitation, medications, and eating and sleep/wake times. These procedures will be repeated at weekly 
intervals (6-8 days apart) and just prior to your discharge.

Title of Study: Treatment of Post-SCI Hypotension: A Randomized Controlled Study of Usual 
Care versus Anti-hypotension Therapy 
Blood Pressure (BP)  - will be monitored and recorded from your right upper arm (brachial) using an 
automated BP cuff and vital sign monitor. Your brachial BP will be monitored and recorded 1 time per 
minute for 10 minutes while you are supi[INVESTIGATOR_742089] 10 minutes while you are seated.  In addition, BP will 
be monitored on a beat-to-beat basis at your left middle or ring finger for 10 minutes while you are supi[INVESTIGATOR_742090] 10 minutes while you are seated.  These BP assessments will be recorded at admission, discharge, 
during each weekly study visit, and weekly during routine clinical bowel and bladder evacuation.    
Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)  - will be monitored and recorded using a small Doppler ultrasound probe (a 
noninvasive test that measures brain blood flow) with ultrasound gel that will be placed over your left 
temple to measure blood flow velocity through your middle cerebral artery. The Doppler probe will be 
held in place with a head harness, which will be tightened so that the probe doesn’t move around during 
testing. CBF velocity will be monitored and recorded for 10 minutes while you are supi[INVESTIGATOR_742089] 10 
minutes while you are seated during the admission visit, at weekly intervals and at discharge. 
Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VOP)  – will be collected while you remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 
with your right leg propped up on a foam block. A strain gauge (small rubber band) will be placed around 
your calf at the widest point. A BP cuff will be placed on your ankle and another BP cuff will be placed on  
the thigh. The ankle cuff will be inflated to about [ADDRESS_1014452] the accumulation of blood and the increase in volume 
of your lower leg (calf). Once a plateau has been reached (about 3-4 minutes in), the thigh cuff will be 
deflated, and [ADDRESS_1014453], and one on your abdomen and a cuff will be placed on your upper left or 
right arm for 24-hour HR & BP data collection. 24-hour HR and BP data will be collected during your 
usual daily activities at admission, one-time per week and just prior to discharge. 
Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) Symptoms Survey  – will be collected at each study visit.  AD is a condition 
where BP increases higher than normal, usually because of a painful or non-painful stimulus below the 
level of your SCI. Some of the most common causes of AD relate to bowel or bladder fullness, tight 
clothing, or pressure from being in one position for too long, but there may be other causes that we are not 
aware of.  You will be asked to complete a [ADDRESS_1014454] experienced, information about your BP at 
that time, possible causes of the AD, and how frequent these symptoms occur.

Effective Date: April 8, [ADDRESS_1014466]: TREATMENT OF POST -SCI HYPOTENSION: A 
RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF USUAL CARE VERSUS ANTI -HYPOTENSION 
THERAPY   
1. IMPORTANCE OF THE PROBLE M 
 
 Shrinking lengths of stay for acute inpatient rehabilitation make taking advantage of the available time 
allowed for acute rehabilitation essential. From 1973 to 2014 the median length of stay for an admission to 
acute rehabilitation for traumatic SCI decreased from 98 to 36 days within the SCI Model Systems. Given this 
decreased length of stay for acute rehabilitation, there is a critical need for persons with SCI to optimize their time in therapy. However, on average patients with SCI during acute rehabilitation miss about 2.5 hours (17%) of scheduled therapy time per week of which a ‘medical’ complication was the most commonly reported cause.
[ADDRESS_1014467] lesions. OH is defined as a decrease in systolic BP of 20mmHg or more, or a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10mmHg or more, upon changing body position from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_742096], regardless of the presence of symptoms.
18 In 2000, Illman et al. 
reported nearly three quarters of persons with acute SCI (levels of injury ranging from C2 -L3) demonstrated 
OH during acute physical therapy rehabilitation.19 It is important to note that symptoms of OH may or may not 
relate to orthostatic BP changes20 and, while nearly half (43%) of the orthostatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_742097], not all patients were symptomatic.19 
Another investigation reported a prevalence of OH in persons with high thoracic and cervical lesions of 74% within the first days and weeks after injury with systolic BP being significantly lower in those with cervical (107±2 mmHg) as compared to high thoracic (125±7 mmHg)  lesions.
[ADDRESS_1014468] similarly found that more than half of individuals with traumatic SCI 
are impacted by [CONTACT_48005]. We recently conducted a survey of newly injured patients over a 
two-week interval and noted that 10 out of 18 persons with traumatic SCI experienced some interruption (21 -
100%) in their rehabilitation plan due to symptomatic hypotension. Specific examples of how this manifested included individuals ‘not being able to sit fully upright in a wheelchair’, ‘not being able to work on seated balance due to an inability to tolerate upright postures’, ‘not being able to work on transfers due to an inability to sit upright’, and ‘not being able to work on standing or walking due to an inability to tolerate standing’. While the individuals did not miss therapy per se their therapeutic plan was restricted to activities that could be performed in a reclined position or for only short periods in a sitting or standing position. There were several 
instances where the plan was changed from being functionally oriented to one consisting of non- functional 
activities where symptomatic  OH would not pose a significant barrier such as strengthening and stretching 
exercises performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_435945] a mat.  
While treatment strategies for OH have been identified for use in persons with acute SCI, the field of SCI 
medicine lacks a gold standard for treatment thresholds and well -defined outcome parameters. 
Comprehensively documenting the impact of OH during acute rehabilitation and identifying the effects of two 
different treatment approaches on therapy participation and adherence to an intended rehabilitation plan could have a significant impact on clinical practice in the acute rehabilitation setting following SCI.  
2. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE  
 
OH following SCI is well described in the literature and is known to be more common in persons with 
tetraplegia than in persons with paraplegia.19,21-[ADDRESS_1014469] for blood pressure (BP) values that reflected hypotension, 
which was defined by  [CONTACT_742122] 1978 as a systolic BP ≤ 110 mmHg for males & ≤ [ADDRESS_1014470] that hypotension was present in 34% in 
individuals with cervical SCI, compared to 22% in those with high thoracic (T1- T5) and 15% of those with low 
thoracic (T6 and below) lesions. It is important to emphasize that these data were collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742098]. It is highly likely that the prevalence of hypotension and OH will be 
substantially increased in the seated position, as previously described.[ADDRESS_1014471] hypotensive individuals with SCI appear to be asymptomatic there is ample evidence in the 
general medical literature supporting associations between chronic asymptomatic hypotension and adverse changes in mood,
30-33 cognitive function34-37 and increased morbidity and mortality;38-[ADDRESS_1014472] therapy adherence. Confirmatory evidence carried out in our laboratory suggests that asymptomatic individuals with chronic SCI who met the World Health Organization 
definition of hypotension perform significantly more poorly on cognitive tasks of working memory and attention 
processing compared to normotensive individuals with SCI.
6 It is important to note that all study subjects with SCI 
were chronically injured (2- 39 years) and the two SCI groups were matched for positive history of traumatic brain 
injury.[ADDRESS_1014473] frequently used 
pharmacologic options are midodrine and fludrocortisone.  However, there is little evidence to support the wide 
spread use of these options to treat hypotension and OH in acute rehabilitation following SCI.  Of the existing 
studies there is level II evidence that suggests midodrine at high doses (≥10 mg) and functional electrical 
stimulation can be helpful in treating OH post -SCI.23,47,[ADDRESS_1014474] medication usage or titration for the treatment of hypotension and OH during acute rehabilitation following SCI.  
Midodrine hydrochloride [d,1 -alpha- (2’5’-dimethox yphenyl) -β-(glycinamidoethanol); C
12H19N2O4Cl] is an 
alpha agonist which, when taken orally, binds to the alpha receptor on the vascular walls, mimicking the actions of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_742099]. Because the increased prevalence 
of hypotension and OH in persons with SCI is thought to reflect low adrenergic tone,  midodrine has been most 
commonly recommended for clinical use in individuals with symptomatic hypotension.
23,47,[ADDRESS_1014475] been conducted to determine the efficacy of 
midodrine to treat symptomatic OH in various models of autonomic failure, and compared to placebo, 10 mg midodrine increased standing BP and improved symptoms of dizziness a nd light -headedness during 
standing.
50,52-54  Of note, energy level was improved and symptoms of depression were reduced in individuals 
randomized to midodrine compared to placebo.52  
Available data on the effects of midodrine on BP in individuals with SCI include three case reports,47,48,55 
one randomized placebo -controlled trial in 4 individuals with tetraplegia,56 a dose titration, open label trial, in 10 
individuals with tetraplegia,57 and 4 publications describing the effects of midodrine (10 mg) on BP and 
CBF.28,46,58,59 The three case studies in acute SCI report improved orthostatic BP responses and significant 
lesse ning of the symptoms of syncope.47,48,55 The laboratory assessments provide preliminary evidence on the 
efficacy of midodrine to raise BP,46,56,57 and we reported improved orthostatic BP responses to head -up tilt that 
corresponded to an attenuated fall in CBF following administration of midodrine in hypotensive s ubjects with 
tetraplegia.46,57 In addition, Phillips et al. reported that increases in BP following midodrine administration were 
associated with improved cognitive performance in individuals with SCI above T6.59 While midodrine appears 
to be effective at increasing BP in the Individuals with SCI, the question remains as to the clinical significance 
of sustained elevation in BP as well as the safety of this agent in treatment of asymptomatic hypotension and OH during acute rehabilitation following SCI. In addition, data are lacking which describe the effects of 
midodrine on BP changes during autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in the acute rehabilitation setting. However, 
several studies report comparable increases in BP during ejaculation with and without midodrine in males with chronic SCI.
60-[ADDRESS_1014476] lesions, and while midodrine may be safe and effective following a single dose in the seated position, effects on BP during activities of daily living, such as transfers, bladder voiding and bowel evacuation, over the course of 24 -hours has not been described. Therefore documenting the effects of 
midodrine over the course of several representative 24- hour periods during acute rehabilitation following SCI 
will provide unprecedented evidence of the safety and efficacy of this agent in support of wide- spread 
applicability.   
3. OBJECTIVE AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
 T he objective of this proof -of-concept safety and efficacy trial is to compare anti -hypotension treatment 
initiated based upon a BP threshold, regardless of symptoms, to usual care treatment of symptomatic 
hypotension during acute rehabilitation following SCI .  
Primary Hypothesis:  SCI inpatients in the BP threshold treatment group (pharmacological hypotension 
management initiated when systolic BP<110 mmHg for males and <100 mmHg for females) will have less interrupted therapy time than the usual care control group (i.e., those treated for symptomatic hypotension 
only).    
Aim 1 : To compare BP threshold treatment and control groups for differences in therapy time spent  actively 
involved in the prescribed rehabilitation program  during the inpatient rehabilitation stay  (efficacy #1)  
 
Secondary Hypothesis: SCI inpatients in the treatment condition (hypotension management with SBP<110 
mmHg for males and <100 mmHg for females) will have less cumulative time spent outside the normotensive 
range than the usual care control condition (i.e., those treated symptomatically).  
Aim 2:  To compare BP threshold treatment and control groups for differences in cumulative time spent outside 
of normotensive range, based on twice -weekly 24- hour BP observations : 
Aim 2A:  Compare time spent at a systolic BP  > 140 mmHg (safety #1)  
Aim 2B:  Compare time spent at a systolic BP  < 110 mmHg for males and < 100 mmHg for females (efficacy 
#2) 
 Exploratory Hypothes is 1: SCI inpatients in the BP threshold treatment group (pharmacological hypotension 
management initiated when systolic BP<110 mmHg for males and <100 mmHg for females) will report fewer symptoms of OH and AD than the usual care control group (i.e., those treated for symptomatic hypotension only).  
Aim 3:  To compare  BP threshold treatment and usual care control groups for differences in self -reported 
symptoms of OH and AD based on once weekly assessments : 
Exploratory Aim 3 A: To compare groups on OH symptoms by [CONTACT_154700] (efficacy #3)  
 Exploratory Aim 3 B: To compare groups on AD symptoms  by [CONTACT_154700] (safety #2)  
 
Exploratory Hypothesis 4:  SCI inpatients in the BP threshold treatment group (pharmacological hypotension 
management initiated when systolic BP<110 mmHg for males and <100 mmHg for females) will have 
increased seated CBF velocity compared to the usual care control group (i.e., those treated for symptomatic 
hypotension only).    
Exploratory Aim 4: To compare treatment and control groups for seated CBF velocity assessed one time per 
week (efficacy #4) . 
 
4. STUDY DESIGN 
 
The proposed investigation will utilize a two- group randomized design. Subjects that agree to participate 
will be randomly assigned to either the BP threshold treatment group or to the usual care group.  Block 
randomization will be provided for sub -groupi[INVESTIGATOR_742100]: cervical lesions (C1-
C8); high thoracic lesions (T1 -T5) and low thoracic lesions (T6 -T12).  Although use of a placebo control is often 
used to help ensure blinding of subjects and reduce bias in study designs similar to this, it was thought not possible in this particular study as both groups will potentially be receiving the same active intervention, the difference being only when the intervention is given if  at all. Furthermore it would not ensure blinding to give a 
placebo to the usual care group who will only receive the usual care interventions if symptomatic.  
GROUP ASSIGNMENT 
Individuals randomized to the usual care group will receive BP management according to the current 
practice on the SCI Rehabilitation Unit as outlined in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Usual Care Group: Advancement from one level to another will occur no sooner than every 2 days. 
While not identified on figure, the advancement can continue to Level 4 (Midodrine 15mg 2x/d), Level 5  
(Midodrine 20mg 2x/d), Level 6  (Midodrine 20mg 2x/d  + Fludrocortisone 0.1mg 2x/d), and Level 7 (Midodrine 
20mg 2x/d + Fludrocortisone 0.2mg 2x/d).  
 
 Individuals assigned to the BP threshold treatment group will recei ve BP management, regardless of 
symptoms, to maintain systolic BP between 111 -135 mmHg for males and 101-  135 mmHg for females for the 
duration of their in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The BP management algorithm is outlined in Figure 3.  
 
Figure 3.  Treatment G roup: Advancement from one level to another will occur no sooner than every 2 days. 
While not identified on figure, the advancement can continue to Level 4 (Midodrine 15mg 2x/d), Level 5  
(Midodrine 20mg 2x/d), Level 6  (Midodrine 20mg 2x/d  + Fludrocortisone 0.1mg 2x/d), and Level 7 (Midodrine 
20mg 2x/d + Fludrocortisone 0.2mg 2x/d).  
 

The treatment algorithm for both the usual care and BP threshold treatment groups will be driven by a 
protocol programmed into the EMR with strict parameters for moving from level to level. The protocol will be 
reviewed daily by a coinvestigator who will complete a daily decision tree survey within the EMR.  
INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA .  
Participants will include 60 individuals aged 18- 89 with traumatic SCI who: 
• Have evidence of hypotension (systolic BP <110 mmHg for males and < 100 mmHg for females) 
measured in sitting for at least two separate measurements  
Individuals will be excluded if they:  
• Have insufficient mental capacity to independently provide informed consent  
• Have insufficient English speaking or reading ability to provide informed consent or complete assessments in English 
• Have contraindications to the use of midodrine  
• Are pregnant  
• Are hypertensive in sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (systolic BP >140 mmHg)  
Note : If a potentially eligible participant is actively being treated for hypotension or hypertension, these 
medications will be stopped, if medically indicated, prior to rescreening.  
RECRUITMENT STRATEGY AND INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS.  
All individuals with traumatic SCI admitted to the SCI Rehabilitation Unit have their BP taken as per 
standard of care. Those individuals with a recorded BP <110 for males and <100 for females will be identified 
by [CONTACT_408591] -investigators who are the attending physicians for all the persons with SCI admitted to the SCI 
Rehabilitation Unit. Potential subjects will receive a brief explanation of the study’s objectives, procedures, 
risks, and benefits from a member of  the research team, and will be provided a consent form for their review. 
The research team will address questions and informed consent will be documented using an IRB -approved 
consent form. I f medically indicated, individuals who screen out due to use of an anti -hypotensive or anti -
hypertensive agent will be allowed to taper off these medications  and then be rescreened.  
DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES   
Baselin e Testing:  Subjects will visit the testing laboratory on the SCI Rehabilitation Unit for baseline data 
collection, prior to initiation of the treatment protocol. Upon arrival, subjects will be placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742101], which will be conducted in a quiet, dimly lit, thermo -neutral testing 
environment.  After a 20- minute period of quiet rest, a 10 -minute sample of supi[INVESTIGATOR_27443] (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], BP and CBF velocity data will be collected.  Venous occlusion plet hysmography (Vop) will be collected in 
the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742085] 5- minute periods. After the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742086], subjects will be passively moved 
into the seated position, with the knees and hips at 90°, for the [ADDRESS_1014477] of all daily 
activities including rehabilitation, medications, eating and sleep/wake times will be logged. This testing session should take approximately 1 hour. 
Daily Testing:  Every day supi[INVESTIGATOR_742102].  
These BP assessments will be recorded in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742103]’s room by a patient care associate who is blind to the study arm allocation. For every scheduled physical and occupational therapy session, the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742104] a brief 6 question survey to document if that session was altered, disrupted, or missed due to hypotension ( Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742105]) .  The subject will also be 
asked to complete a brief survey to determine if from their perspective the session was altered, disrupted or missed due to hypotension ( Subject Reported Version) . In addition, every day a co -investigator and the 
attending physician for that subject will complete an EMR review of queried BP values within the previous 24 
hours, symptoms of low BP, adverse events related to high or low BP, and will review (and act upon for the usual care arm) the protocol treatment decision tree.  
Weekly Testing: A
 t weekly intervals of between 6 and 8 days, subjects will be asked to visit the testing 
laboratory on the SCI Rehabilitation Unit.  Procedures for the weekly testing sessions will be the same as for the Baseline Testing. The 24- hour BP assessment will be conducted twice weekly.  
Discharge Testing:   A
 t discharge subjects will undergo similar testing as described during the Baseline and 
Weekly Testing with the addition of the Patient Global Impression of Change survey , which will be 
administered by [CONTACT_742123] .

Assessments:  
• Altered, Disrupted, or Missed Therapy Time Survey- Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742106] – A survey has been 
developed to document, any alteration, disruption, or missed time in the therapy plan for all therapy 
sessions over the duration of the LOS. The number of interruptions per session, the percentage of time, 
and total time affected will be captured. In addition the reasons for the altered, disrupted, or missed therapy will be documented. The data will be collected for the expected plan and for a plan (if low  BP is 
the cause of the altered time) that would be expected if hypotension were not an issue. This survey will be completed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_742107].  
• A
ltered, Disrupted, or Missed Therapy Time Survey- Subject Reported- A survey has been 
developed to document any alteration, disruption, or missed time in the therapy plan for all therapy sessions and the subject reported reasons for this. This survey will capture in addition subject reported data regarding therap y adherence such as ‘I was expected to work on ‘XYZ’ but could not due to ‘QRS’.  
• Decision Tree- A checklist will be completed by [CONTACT_30951] (co- investigator or covering 
physician) who sees that subject that day. The checklist queries for BP values, symptoms of low BP, 
adverse events related to high or low BP, and includes a protocol treatment decision tree. This will be 
incorporated into the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36843].

• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991] - Brachial BP will be measured by a trained clinician in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_742108].  
Once Weekly Assessment s: 
• Heart Rate & Respi[INVESTIGATOR_26452] - A three lead electrocardiogram will be used to determine HR and 
autonomic cardiac control with HR variability, with the recording electrode in the V5 position 
(RESP1EKG: Impedance Pneumograph, UFI [ADDRESS_1014478]. Suite C- 2, Moro Bay, CA [ZIP_CODE]).  HR and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_742109] 10- minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 10- minutes in the seated 
positions during the baseline assessment, at weekly intervals throughout the in- patient LOS and at 
discharge. The electrocardiogram data will be viewed in real -time and stored on a secured desktop 
computer for future analysis using LabVIEW graphical software for instrumentation (National 
Instruments, Austin, TX, [LOCATION_003]).     
• Blood Pressure:  
o Brachial BP  (GE Healthcare Information Tech; Milwaukee, WI; # PRO Series 400) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_742124] 1- minute intervals 
during the 10- minute supi[INVESTIGATOR_742110], weekly intervals and at 
discharge.  
o B eat -to-beat finger BP will be monitored continuously using photoplethysmography (Finometer 
® MIDI Model -2; Finopres Medical Systems B.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at the finger 
arteriolar for assessment of BP variability and baroreceptor reflex act ivity.  Beat -to-beat BP data 
will be monitored continuously for 10- minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 10- minutes in the seated 
positions at baseline, weekly intervals and at discharge. Finger BP data will be viewed in real -
time and stored on a secured desktop computer for future analysis using LabVIEW graphical 
software for instrumentation (National Instruments, Austin, TX, [LOCATION_003]).     
• Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound  - CBF velocity will be monitored weekly for 10 -minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_321712] 10- minutes in the seated positions using a transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound (Terumo 
Cardiovascular Systems [ADDRESS_1014479] Tustin, CA [ZIP_CODE]- 6447) to visualize the middle 
cerebral artery (MCA).  The TCD probe will be operated at a frequency of 2.0 MHz to visualize the left 
and right MCA through the temporal window, which will be identified by [CONTACT_742125] (45 -55 mm), sound 
and direction of flow (towards the probe), as evidenced by [CONTACT_742126].  Once the 
MCA has been visualized a head -harness will be used to secure the probe position for the duration of 
testing.   MCA CBF velocity (cm/sec) will be calculated as [peak systolic velocity + (2* end diastolic 
velocity)]/3, which is an  accepted surrogate of CBF.64-[ADDRESS_1014480] for future anal ysis using customized data acquisition and 
analysis programs written with LabVIEW graphical software for instrumentation.   
• Venous occlusion plethysmography (Vop)  - We will use standard equipment; a rapid cuff inflator, 
plethysmograph, and rubber strain gauge (D.E. Hokanson, Inc., Bellevue, WA, [ZIP_CODE]). Subjects will be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_742111] -side leg elevated at heart level. A tape cloth will be used to measure the 
widest circumference on their calf, a strain gauge 2cm smaller than the widest circumference measured will be placed on their calf. A small inflatable cuff will be placed just above the ankle; a second cuff will be wrapped around the thigh at its midpoint. The ankle cuff is inflated to suprasystolic pressure (≈200mmHg) while the thigh cuff is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_742112] (≈50mmHg). The strain 
gauge will measure the change in volume, outputting the data to our autonomic data collection cart. 
The cuff will remain inflated until a plateau in volume change is observed, the cuffs w ill then be deflated 
and we will continue monitoring the change in blood volume until it returns to resting values. The test 
will be repeated two more times.  
• Adverse Events Survey - A checklist will be reviewed with subjects and the treating physician on a 
weekly basis to evaluate for adverse events potentially related to the interventions.  
• Vancouver Autonomic Dysfunction Surveys:  
o AD Symptoms Survey - A 9 question survey which queries about the subjects about potential 
manifestations of autonomic dysreflexia. The survey questions pertain symptoms of AD ranging from sweating and pounding headache to chills and goose bumps and asks the participant 
during w hat activities these symptoms occur and with what frequency.  
o OH Symptoms Survey - A 9-question survey which queries about the subjects about potential 
manifestations of  hypotension and OH. The survey questions pertain to the symptoms of 
hypotension and OH r anging from dizziness and light headedness to fatigue and nausea, and 
asks the participant during what activities these symptoms occur and with what frequency.  
Twice Weekly Assessment:  
• 24-hour BP assessment - Subjects will be instrumented with a 24- hour HR and BP monitor 
(Vasomedical Biox® Model 2301 Combined Ambulatory ECG and Blood Pressure Recorder (BIOX 
INSTRUMENTS CO., LTD. 4/[ADDRESS_1014481] Wuxi, Jiangsu 214062 P.R. China), 
which will record HR and BP 3 times/hour during the daytime and [ADDRESS_1014482] 
once per week during the in- patient stay.  
Discharge Assessment:  
• Patient global impression of change.  In measuring outcomes in intervention studies, transition 
ratings have been used to assess the subjects’ experience of change.67-69 Guyatt et al. as along with 
others has suggested these ratings be used to supplement “objective” outcome measures.68 In a global 
change or global transition rating, the individual expresses how much better or worse the problem being 
treated seems to him/her in comparison to another time point. In this investigation, the Patient Global Impression of Change rating at Discharge, will take the form of, “Taking into account only your ability to 
not be lightheaded or have other symptoms of low blood pressure while you are sitting or standing, are 
you feeling you are able to do all you are capable of doing during therapy now as compared to when you first arrived?”  If the individual states that there is no change, then the rating is complete. If he or she is worse or better, the individual is asked to quantify the magnitude of the change on a seven -point 
scale (1- very much better; 2 -better; 3 -somewhat  better; 4- unchanged; 5 -somewhat worse; 6 -worse; 7-
very much worse).  
5. DATA ANALYSIS  
 
The primary outcome variable is altered, disrupted, or missed time lost in therapy due to hypotensive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The recorded data will be converted to a percent time lost, which is then averaged over the LOS in 
days for each subject. Differences in percent time altered, disrupted, or missed between BP threshold 
treatment and usual care groups will be statistically analyzed using a two- tailed independent t -test. In addition, 
the 95% confidence interval for the difference between groups and the associated effect size (Cohen’s D) will 
be calculated.  
The secondary outcome (Aim 2) of cumulative time spent outside the normotensive range, (i.e., time spent 
at a SBP > 140mmHg, time spent < 110mmHg for males and < 100mmHg for females) and the exploratory outcome of group differences in seated CBFv  (Exploratory Aim 4), will be collectively analyzed using the 
multivariate Hotelling’s T
2 analysis with an alpha level of 0.05. Where appropriate, the data will undergo a 
transformation (e.g., log, square root) if marked deviations from normality (Z for skewness and/or kurtosis > |2.0|) are evident. In addition, potential covariate relationshi ps will be explored between treatment approach 
and each of the dependent variables, age, level of lesion, American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_222597] (ASIA) 
Impairment Scale classification, and previous medical diagnoses by [CONTACT_742127]. For Exploratory Aim 3 A and 3 B, the counts of symptoms of OH and AD will be analyzed using Poisson 
tests.  
 
Statistical Power  
Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_742113], we estimate that at power=0.80 and alpha=0.05, a sample size 
of [ADDRESS_1014483]. She will be blinded to group allocation as well.  
7. TIMETABLE  
  
 A timetable for this investigation is enclosed as Table 4. Recruitment and data collection are expected 
to be complete by [CONTACT_68089] 4, allowing 1 year for data analysis and reporting.  
Table 4: Project Timetable.  
Year  [ADDRESS_1014484]. Pre sentations discussing the 
impacts of the interventions tested and lessons learned for future study planning will be made at scientific 
conferences of rehabilitation specialists (e.g. American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM), 
American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_742114] (ASIA)) in Year 5. Information about study progress and findings will be 
shared with the SCI community via newsletter articles and/or web postings.  
9. STAGE OF RESEARCH  
  
 This project fits the Exploration and Discovery stage of research. W e will discover if we can limit 
alterations and disruptions to prescribed rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742115]- hypotension treatment based upon a BP threshold rather than the usual care 
treatment of  only symptomatic hypotension. We will also explore the safety of initiating treatment for 
hypotension before it becomes symptomatic. In combination, these study outputs will expand the evidence for 
when anti -hypotension treatment should be initiated in persons with SCI and hypotension.

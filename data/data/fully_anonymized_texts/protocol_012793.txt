Statistical Analysis Plan : Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 8 3 INTRODUCTION 
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the planned statistical analys is for the 
study entitled “A Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study t o Evaluate 
the Safety a nd Efficacy of Staccato® Granisetron (A Z- 010) for the Acute Treatment 
of Moderate t o Severe Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome” (Amendment 2 dated 2 8 APR 
2021). M ock shells will be  produced as a separate working document  to facilitate 
programming of Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs) according to the SAP. The 
SAP is to be interpreted in conjunction with the protocol , and supersedes the 
statistical considerations identified in the protocol . If the final clinical study report 
contains changes to any  planned statistical analyses , the justification for any such 
differences will be fully documented in the clinical study report ( CSR). 
4 STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objectives for this study are to: 
• Assess the efficacy of AZ -010 as an acute treatment for moderate to 
severe cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adult patients  
• Assess the safety of AZ -[ADDRESS_400569] dose of the home treatment period.  
5.2 NUMBER OF PARTI CIPANTS  
Approximately 150 participant s are planned to be randomized at approximately 15 
study centers.  
5.3 DESIGN  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group, placebo- controlled, 
efficacy and safety study of adult outpatients diagnosed with CVS and experiencing 
recurring epi[INVESTIGATOR_324436]. Participants  meeting all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each 
randomized participant  will receive training in the use of the Staccato device and 
detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test 
self-administration of their randomized study medication. Each participant  will be 
monitored during a [ADDRESS_400570] 12- lead ECG (triplicate) 
assessments at pre- dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_400571] dose. If there are 
no clinically -significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT 
prolongation, the participant  will be provided with their Patient Kit that contains the 
remaining 5 unused Staccato devices in addition to the 1 Staccato device that they

participation. Approximately 50 participant s will be randomized to each of 3 
treatment groups: 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or matching Staccato Placebo 
(Staccato device without drug coating). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_324512] ’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_324438]: 1) 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324439] [ADDRESS_400573] vomiting/retching event; 2) 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324440] n [ADDRESS_400574] vomiting/retching 
event.  
There will be 3 Research Clinic visits and a home treatment period, as indicated in the Study Schema (5.4). 
Participant s will be screened at the Research Clinic to determine if they are eligible 
for study participation no more than 14 days prior to Visit 2. After the study is explained to the participant  and the participant  has signed an informed consent form 
(ICF), the investigator will establish the participant ’s eligibility according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following assessments: Medical history (with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS diagnosis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_324441] (hrs . vs days), average number of vomiting/retching events in typi[INVESTIGATOR_324442], frequency of CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_11114], any triggers for CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature); 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG); blood draw and urine sample for routine clinical labs (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); and serum pregnancy test (in female participants of child- bearing potential). In light of the COVID -[ADDRESS_400575] procedures should be taken to ensure participant  safety 
when in the clinic.  
Participant s who continue to be eligible for the study will be asked to return to the 
Research Clinic for Visit 2. Participant s meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -
010, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized participant  
will be provided with a Patient  Kit that contains 6 Staccato devices, other study 
materials, and an electronic Patient Diary (ePD) to be used for at -home treatment. 
They will also  receive training in the use of the Staccato device and detailed 
instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test self- 
administration of their randomized study medication. Each participant  will be 
monitored during a [ADDRESS_400576] 12- lead ECG (triplicate) 
assessments at pre- dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_400577] dose. If there are 
no clinically -significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT 
prolongation, the participant  will continue in the study.

period will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (with single daily dosing up 
to 5 consecutive days) within [ADDRESS_400578] with their ePD prior to initiation of treatment (if 
possible) and to capture the study data. The ePD will be used to record the date and 
time of study medication administration, the number of vomiting and retching events, 
and the participant  reported outcome measures (including the intensity and duration 
of the CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and anxiety/panic, and 
characteristics of the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods)  
(section 5.8) . Participants will also record the number of vomiting and retching 
events in the [ADDRESS_400579] rescue medications taken after administration of 
study medication in their ePD and on a paper concomitant medications form . 
Rescue medication may include any agent(s) from the list described in Section 9. [ADDRESS_400580] 2

Participant s will be required to return to the Research Clinic (Visit 3) within 3- [ADDRESS_400581] study medication administration for final in- clinic assessments, to return 
the Patient Kit containing the used and unused study medication, ePD, and any other unused supplies. Conversely, participant s will be asked to return to the 
Research Clin ic after 12 weeks with their unused Patient Kit if they did not treat a 
CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_324443].  
Visit 3 will include the following assessments: Vital signs; full physical examination; assessment for treatment emergent adverse events; 12- lead ECG, concomitant 
medications (including rescue medication taken), and clinical labs.

scheme.  
5.7 RANDOMIZATION  
Participant s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or 
matching Staccato Placebo (Staccato device without drug coating). Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_324512] ’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_324445]:  
1. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324439] [ADDRESS_400588] vomiting/retching event  
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324446] [ADDRESS_400589] vomiting/retching 
event.  
The randomization schedule will be generated prior to study start. All study participant s, 
Investigators, and site study staff will be blinded to study medication assignment. Devices and packaging of AZ -010 and placebo are  identical in appearance.  
5.8 EFFICACY  
5.8.1  EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NUMBER OF VOMITING AND RETCHING EVENTS IN THE FIRST [ADDRESS_400590] 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes on the ePD.  Each of these entries in the ePD 
are cumulative from the time of treatment, so the primary endpoint is the assessment at 120 minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  [ADDRESS_400591] 24 hours after dosing. A 
vomiting or retching event is  defined as one or more continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128] 
(expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt 
to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). If there is a break of at least 1 
minute between vomiting and retching events, those should be considered two different 
events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS)  
The visual analog scale is a scale of continuous measure initially developed for pain that has  been used in a variety of clinical settings where the endpoint of interest is 
based on a subjective perception. The visual analog scale is a distinct 100- millimeter 
line anchored on the left end (0)  at no degree of impairment and on the right end (100) 
at full degree of impairment, where indication of the degree of impairment perceived at 
the time of assessment is captured by  [CONTACT_324513], Inc.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | [ADDRESS_400592] vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]:  
• The assessment of abdominal pain whereby 0 = no pain and 100 = worst 
possible pain;  
• The assessment of nausea whereby 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea;  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic whereby 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible  anxiety/panic.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RHO DES INDEX OF NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND RETCHING (RINVR)  
The RINVR is designed to assess the degree of nausea distress and vomiting distress in patients.  It is composed of 8 questions and each question has 5 choices (see protocol 
Appendix, Section 17.4) . Questi ons 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 deal with symptom occurrence and 
Questions 2, 3, 5 deal with degree of discomfort of the individual symptoms. Individual 
questions can be tracked over time,  or a composite score can be formed by [CONTACT_324514]. This 
scale is adapted for the ePD and participant s are prompted to answer the questions 
according to the Schedule of Events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  INTENSITY OF ATTACK SCALE  
The Intensity of Attack scale is designed to assess the severity of the last vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_324447]. Severity ranges from Mild to 
Excruciating on a 4 point scale.  This scale is  administered on  the ePD and participant s 
are prompted to answer the questions  according to the Schedule of Events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  P RIOR EPI[INVESTIGATOR_324448].  For both Intensit y and Duration, the participant  responds 
whether the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_324449], the Same as, or Greater than their

participation will also be collected.  
6 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
6.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All analysis dataset preparations and statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® 
version 9.4 or higher. No imputation will be performed for missing data unless stated otherwise.  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1695] (1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, placebo). All 
data for analysis will be listed by [CONTACT_3445] . 
The same number of decimal places as in the raw data will be presented when reporting minimum and maximum, [ADDRESS_400597] deviation.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_324515] s tatistics (n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. Baseline is defined as the last observation prior to initiation of Study Medication.  
Listings for  CSR Appendix 16.2 will include all the participant  data points being collected 
or derived for analyses. Data listings will be provided for all participant s up to the point 
of study completion or withdrawal.  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a sig nificance value of 0.05. Participant s will

epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], they will be excluded from efficacy analyses since they did not receive any 
study medication specifically in anticipation of a CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
6.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
This is a proof -of-concept  study. There are no studies in the literature to provide reliable 
estimates of active treatment or placebo response rates us ing vomiting/retching events, 
or the estimate of variances around these measures, in participant s with CVS being 
treated acutely with an abortive therapy. Consequently, sample size was not based on power calculations.  
Approximately 150 participant s will be  randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. An N of 
50 per group should be sufficient to describe and compare across the efficacy parameters.  
6.3 STUDY DATA  
The study data to be analyzed include all clinical data captured by [CONTACT_324516] (eCRF)  or otherwise centrally, including safety lab data  and ECGs . The  database will be 
locked for the final analyses.  
6.4 ANALYSIS SETS 
The following analysis populations  are defined.     
• Efficacy Population - All participant s who receive study medication and treated at 
least 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_254962]/retching due to their CVS, analyzed according to randomized treatment  
• Safety Population - All participant s who receive study drug  
• Per Protocol (PP) Population – A PP population (subset of the Efficacy 
Population) may be decided upon which will exclude participants with important 
protocol deviations thought to potentially impact conclusions , if a sufficient  
number of participants with such deviations exist . If so, this population will be 
defined prior to breaking the blind.       
6.5 TREATMENT GROUPS  
The analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_1570]:  
• 1 mg AZ -010 
• 3 mg AZ -010 
• matching Staccato Placebo (Staccato device without drug coating)  
6.6 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTS  
H
0: There will be no difference between AZ -010 (1 mg or 3 mg) and placebo in the 
mean number of vomiting/retching events in the 2 hours following treatment.

mean number of vomiting/retching events versus placebo in the 2 hours following 
treatment.  
6.7 MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons  for this proof -of-concept  study . 
6.8 DEFINITION OF SUBGROUPS  
No subgroup analyses are planned.  
6.9 ENDPOINTS AND ESTIMANDS  
6.9.1  PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND ESTIMAND  
The mean number of vomiting/retching events in the 2 hours following treatment among 
those treated for a CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (imminent or otherwise).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  TARGET POPULATION 
The target populations are given by [CONTACT_324517] s treated during the Home Treatment Period for a CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (imminent or 
otherwise).  If a PP Population is defined, the primary analysis will be repeated for the 
PP Population.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Number of vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_324451], during the Home Treatment Period as assessed at the designated planned two- hour timepoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  HANDLING OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
1. Clinically significant ECG abnormality during the pre- test s elf-administration 
which preclude further participation - Princip al Stratum Strategy:  
 
• Participant s who are excluded from further participation are not included in 
efficacy analyses, with the population for anticipated use consistent with 
this exclusion.  An underlying assumption is that potential treatment 
benefit is independent of the likelihood of exclusion for this reason.  
 
2. Participant  experiences a CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (imminent or otherwise) requiring 
treatment during the home treatment period - Principal Stratum Strategy:  
 
• The princip al stratum of interest is restricted to those participant s 
experiencing at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_324457] (imminent or otherwise) requiring 
treatment. An underlying assumption is  that likelihood of experiencing at 
least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_324458], Inc.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 21  epi[INVESTIGATOR_324459] (and 
subsequent qualification for the Home Treatment Period) . 
 
3. Use of rescue medication prior to 2 hours - Treatment Policy Strategy:  
 
• P articipant s are encouraged not to use rescue prior to 2 hours, however 
vomiting retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_324460] 2 hours will be counted, irrespective of 
the use of rescue.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  POPULATION- LEVEL SUMMARY 
Mean number of vomiting retching events in the first 2 hours fol lowing the initial 
treatment (during the Home Treatment Period) from an analysis of variance model, with treatment group and randomization strata in the model.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MISSING DATA  
The necessity and approach to handling missing data for the primary endpoint is 
dependent upon the extent of missing data and potential reasons  for missingness  as 
well as imbalance which may be observed with respect to missing data across treatment groups .  A such , post-hoc exploratory analyses may be conducted for this 
proof -of-concep t study  to address missing data, including the use of non- missing data 
from CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_324461] .  
     
6.9.2  SECONDARY ENDPOINTS AND ESTIMANDS  
Secondary endpoints and associated estimands  target the Efficacy Population  and PP 
Population (if defined) and handle intercurrent events 1 and 2 as for the primary estimand and intercurrent event number 3 as for primary (except as noted). Secondary endpoints are described in section 5.8, and population- level s ummaries are as noted 
below.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  POPULATION- LEVEL SUMMARY 
The population- level summary for secondary endpoints are defined as follows:  
• The intensity of the vomiting/retching attack (Intensity of Attack Scale [IAS]) at 2, 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_400599] 
vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_36210] a scale of 1 (mild) to 4 (excruciating).  
• The Rhodes Index of nausea, vomiting, and retching (RINVR) total score at 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment.  
• The assessment of abdominal pain at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (visual analog scale [VAS] 1- 100; 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain).  
• The assessment of nausea at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1-100; 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea).  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1 -100; 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible anxiety/panic).  
• The duration of the CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_324452] 24 hours in relation to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_324453] (Prior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_324454] [PES]), on a scale where 1=shorter, 2=same duration, and 3=longer.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol AMDC 010- 201 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 22  • The intensity of the CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_324452] 24 hours  in relation to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_324455] (Prior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_324454]), on a scale where 1=less intense, 
2=same intensity, and 3=more intense.  
• The proportion of participant s requiring rescue medication (anti-emetics, 
benzodiazapi[INVESTIGATOR_324462])  within the 24 hours following treatment with the 
study medication, as reported either in the ePD or as a concomitant medication.  
• The proportion of participant s requiring a visit to urgent care, emergency 
department, or physician’s office for care related to the treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_324456] 24 hours following treatment with the study medication.  
6.10 MAIN ANALYTICAL APPROACH  
Data from the RINVR, IAS, VAS, and PES will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Fixed effects will include treatment group, timepoint , 
randomization strata, and a treatment -by-timepoint  interaction. Timepoint  will be fit as a 
repeated effect using the repeated statement in SAS. An unstructured covariance structure and Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom will be used. In t he event an 
unstructured covariance structure fails to converge, a Toeplitz structure will be used.  
Least squares means will be presented for treatment* timepoint , with the significance 
level of the treatment -by-timepoint  interaction presented in summary t ables. Pair -wise 
comparisons of differences in LS means, two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on 
differences, and p- values will be provided for each active treatment versus placebo for 
each timepoint . 
Proportion data (ie, rescue medication or visits to urgent care/ER/doctor will be 
analyzed using a Mantel -Haenszel  test, stratifying on randomization strata, in a pairwise 
fashion of each dose versus placebo .

history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature); 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG); blood draw and urine sample for routine clinical labs (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); and serum pregnancy test (in female participants of child -bearing 
potential). In light of the COVID -[ADDRESS_400615] procedures should be taken to ensure 
patient safety when  in the clinic.  
Patients who continue to be eligible to participate in the study will be asked to return to the Research Clinic for Visit 2.  Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo in 
a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized patient will rece ive training in the use 
of the Staccato device and detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test self -administration of their randomized study medication. Each patient will 
be monitored during a [ADDRESS_400616] 12- lead ECG (triplicate) assessments 
at pre -dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_400617] dose. If there are no clinically- significant

Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) [ADDRESS_400630], Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
AZ-010 ( Staccato granisetron) is a hand -held, single dose, single-use drug-device 
combination product using the Staccato delivery system. Oral inhalation through the product 
is detected by [CONTACT_324528], which in turn results in rapid heating of a thin film of granisetron causing the formation of a thermally generated drug vapor. The vapor condenses into aerosol particles with a particle size distribution appropriate for efficient delivery to the deep lung. The rapid absorption of the drug provides peak plasma levels in the system ic 
circulation within minutes after administration.  
Each product is packaged inside a sealed foil pouch. Upon removing the product from the pouch, pulling the tab connected to the device renders it ready for use, as indicated by 
[CONTACT_324529] a green lig ht on top of the device. Successful dosing is signaled by [CONTACT_324530]. 
AZ-010 is administered as a single dose via inhalation, available as 1 mg or 3 mg per device.

4.1 Background Information 
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an idiopathic chronic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_324531][INVESTIGATOR_324471] -fire vomiting lasting for 1 –5 days followed by [CONTACT_324532]- free 
periods ( Hayes et al, 2018).  This alternating pattern of disease and disease- free periods 
distinguishes CVS from other gastrointestinal disorders.  There is no current drug therapy 
approved for treatment of CVS.  
CVS is generally described as consisting of four phases. The inter -epi[INVESTIGATOR_324472]. This phase can last for several months. During the prodromal phase , some patients describe an ‘aura’ that lasts for minutes to 
hours. This phase usually consists of lethargy, anorexia, pallor or abdominal pain or autonomic symptoms such as sweating or salivation. The hyperemesis phase usually starts from the early hours of the morning to noon, and is characterized by [CONTACT_324533]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], vomiting peaks in the first hour and then declines lasting at least 24 hours with epi[INVESTIGATOR_324473]. The vomiting frequency can be up to eight times every hour ( Fleisher et al, 2005 ). This  can last for 1 –[ADDRESS_400639] been reported to be a key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the p rodromal and emetic phases of CVS in adults 
(Abell et al, 2008) . Abortive IV antiemetic agents such as the [ADDRESS_400640] ondansetron at 
high doses and granisetron were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_324474] ( Li and Misiewicz et al, 2003; Yang, 2010; Venkatasubramani, 2007) .  
Treatment of CVS remains largely based on real -world clinical experience . There is no current 
drug therapy approved for treatment of CVS. According to guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by [CONTACT_324534] ( Venkatesan et al , 2019), treatment of CVS should 
be based on a biopsychosocial care model, integrating lifestyle modification, prophylactic and/or abortive medications, and evidenced-based psychotherapy to address psychiatric comorbidity. The guideline recommends using prophylactic medications in moderate -to-severe CVS and 
offering abortive medications to all patients to terminate an acute attack. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_324475]. Antiemetic intravenous therapy was reported to be effective for treatment of nausea and vomiting for CVS acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (Jensen, 2015; Moses et al, 2014) . Granisetron was reported to be an effective pharmacologic 
approach used for abortive and supportive care in CVS ( Li and Balint, 2000; Li et al, 2008;  
Li and Misiewicz, 2003).  
Granisetron is a highly selective and potent 5- hydroxyltryptamine type 3 (5- HT3) receptor 
antagonist widely used for over twenty years as an effective antiemetic treatment (Blower,  2003).  The efficacy of granisetron in the prevention of nausea and vomiting has been 
extensively studied in clinical trials and is approved for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), radiation -induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), and for postoperative nausea 
and vomiting (PONV) ( Kytril (granisetron hydrochloride) Prescribing Information 2011 ,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 Aapro, 2004; Spart inou et al, 2017 ; Gilmore et al, 2018 ). Granisetron has also been shown to be 
effective and well tolerated in special populations, such as patients refractory to antiemetic 
treatment for gastroparesis (Simmons and Parkman, 2014) , bulimia nervosa, cyclic vomiting 
syndrome, HIV (Evans, 2016) and patients with hepatic or renal impairment with minimal 
potential for drug- drug interactions (Aapro, 2004).  
Antiemetic agents have been reported to be a key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the prodromal and emetic phases of CVS in adults (Abell et al, 2008).  Abortive 
IV antiemetic agents such as the [ADDRESS_400641] ondansetron at high doses (0.3–0.4 mg/kg up 
to 24 mg, q. 4–6 hours) and granisetron (10 µg/kg, q 4–6 hours) were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_324474] ( Li and Mis iewicz et al, 2003 ; Yang, 2010;  
Venkatasubramani, 2007 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_324476] [ADDRESS_400642] been no definitive clinical trials conducted to  date.  
Alexza Pharmaceuticals (Alexza) is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_324477]® Granisetron for Inhalation 
(Staccato Granisetron ; AZ-010) as an acute treatment of CVS.  Staccato Granisetron represents a 
new dosage form of granisetron. It is a single-use, hand-hel d, drug- device combination product 
that delivers aerosolized granisetron.  From a drug development perspective, one of the most 
compelling characteristics of Staccato Granisetron is that the drug can be delivered 
non-invasively with rapid IV -like pharmacokinetics to individuals. In previous clinical studies 
with Staccato G ranisetron  and a number of drugs using the Staccato technology, mean peak 
plasma concentration was achieved within  minutes following inhalation.  In a first -in-human, 
single ascend ing dose study with Staccato Granisetron  (AMDC 010 -101; refer to CSR: 
IND 145,487 SN 0009), the median time to maximum plasma concentration was approximately 2 minutes for doses ranging from 0.5–3 mg.  
Staccato Granisetron may provide significant benefit f or the treatment of CVS  since it has rapid 
pharmacokinetics and by[CONTACT_324535]. Because of the simplicity of the 
delivery, the patient is only required to take a normal breath for delivery of the aerosolized drug . 
Consequently, inhalation via Staccato delivery could provide a non-invasive, rapid delivery  of 
granisetron and lead to a more rapid and effective control of acute vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , 
represent ing an improvement to existing patient care . Consequently, this study (AMDC 010-201) 
is designed to assess the effects of Staccato G ranisetron as an acute treatment during an epi[INVESTIGATOR_324478].

using Alexza’s proprietary Staccato delivery system. Oral inhalation through the product initiates 
the controlled rapid heating of a thin film of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]- free granisetron to form a thermally 
generated, highly pure drug vapor. The vapor condenses into aerosol particles with a particle size 
distribution appropriate for efficient delivery to the deep lung. The rapid absorption of the drug provides pea k plasma levels in the systemic circulation within minutes after administration.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 The principal components of Staccato G ranisetron  (shown schematically below) are as follows:  
• Breath sensor: The breath -activation mechanism that initiates actuation of the hea t source  
• Heat source ( i.e., heat package): The mechanism comprised of a reactant coating on the 
interior surface of a stainless -steel substrate that generates heat to vaporize the drug and 
produce the aerosol  
• Drug coating: The thin film of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]- free granisetron  on the exterior surface of the 
stainless -steel substrate  
• Airway: The medical-grade plastic housing surrounding the heat package; it controls and 
directs the airflow over the vaporizing drug.  
 
Schematic Side -View of Staccato  Granisetron  
  
 The interior surface of the stainless -steel substrate of the heat package is coated with a mixture of 
zirconium and molybdenum trioxide powder with a clay binder. When activated, this undergoes

4.4 Clinical Information for Staccato Granisetron  
While granisetron  has been available worldwide in various formulations for many years, AZ -010 
has been administered to healthy volunteers in a single ascending dose Phase 1 study 
(AMDC 010-101) and a multiple ascending dose study (AMDC 010-102). Study 
AMDC 010-101 was desi gned in 2 parts in separate cohorts of healthy volunteers. The primary 
objectives for each part are as follows.  For Part A  the purpose was t o examine the tolerability , 
safety , and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of 0.5, 1, and 3 mg of AZ 010 in healthy 
volunteers. The purpose of Part B  was to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single 
dose of 1 mg of AZ-010 with that of 1 mg granisetron hydrochloride intravenous (IV) injection in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in a total of 36 subjects at a single clinical research unit. Across the 3 doses of Part A, the drug was generally well tolerated with 3 of 8 subjects (6 AEs in total) in the 0.5 mg cohort, 3 of 8 subjects (6 AEs in total) in the [ADDRESS_400645] 1 adverse event. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and there were no serious adverse events (SAE).  
Study AMDC 010-102 was designed to examine the tolerability , safety , and pharmacokinetics 
(PK)  of AZ -010 following 7 days of dosing (up to 3 mg) in healthy volunteers. The data obtained 
from this study were  intended to guide selection of s afe and tolerable doses for the Phase 2 
clinical trial. The study was conducted in a total of 30 subjects (8 fo r each of the AZ-010 dose 
groups and 6 for placebo) at a single clinical research unit. Across the 3 doses the drug was generally well tolerated with a total of 13 of 30 subjects (43%) experiencing an AE (7 of 8 subjects for 0.5 mg; 0 of 8 subjects for 1.0 mg; 4  of 8 subjects for 3.0 mg of AZ-010 and 
2 of 6 subjects for p lacebo ) There were a total of [ADDRESS_400646] reported for 
Gastrointestinal diso rders (n  = 9) and Nervous System disorders (n  = 9). There were no clinical 
laboratory changes for serum chemistry or hematology or any changes in urinalysis between baseline and discharge that were notable. There were no serious adverse events (SAE) .

The primary objectives of the study are to assess:  
• The efficacy of AZ -010 as an acute treatment for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adult 
patients.  
• The safet y of AZ -010 in adult patients with CVS. 
 
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) [ADDRESS_400651] 6 months are eligible for participation. Approximately 50 patients will be randomized to each of 3 treatment 
groups: 1 mg AZ-010, 3 mg AZ -010, or matching Staccato Placebo ( Staccato device without 
drug coating). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_324527]’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_324482] f ollowing two categories: 1) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324439] [ADDRESS_400652] vomiting/retching event; 2) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_324446] [ADDRESS_400653] vomiting/retching event. 
There will be 3 Research Clinic visits and a home tr eatment period:  
 
 
Patients will be screened at the Research Clinic to determine if they are eligible for study 
participation no more than 14 days prior to Visit 2. After the study is explained to the patient and the patient has signed an informed consent  form (ICF), the investigator will establish the 
patient’s eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following assessments: Medical history (with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS diagnosis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_324483] (hrs  vs days), average number of vomiting/retching 
events in typi[INVESTIGATOR_324467], frequency of CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_11114], any triggers for CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature); 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG); blood

Patients who continue to be eligible to participate in the study will be asked to return to the 
Research Clinic for Visit 2. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1  mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo in a 
1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized patient will receive training in the use of the Staccato device  and detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a 
pre-test self -administration of their randomized study medication . Each patient will be monitored 
during a [ADDRESS_400657] 12- lead ECG (triplicate) assess ments at pre -dose and 
2, 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_400658] dose. If there are no clinically-significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT prolongation, the patient will be provided with their  
Patient Kit that contains the remaining 5  unused Staccato devices in addition to the 1 Staccato 
device that they used in the clinic .  
Randomized patients will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (with single daily dosing up to 5 consecutive days) within [ADDRESS_400659] with their ePD 
prior to initiation of treatment (if possible) and to capture the study data. The ePD will be used to 
record the date and time of study medication administration, the number of vomiting and retching events, and the patient reported outcome measures (including the intensity and duration 
of the CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and anxiety/panic , and characteristics of 
the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods). In addition, patients will complete a paper questionnaire to record the number of vomiting and retching eve nts within the 
first [ADDRESS_400660] in the ir diary  any medications 
taken  during the Home Treatment period. Rescue medication s may in clude any agent(s) from the 
list described in Section 9.8; however for the purpose of defining the responder endpoint, only 
anti-emetic medications , benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and triptans will be considered a rescue medication . 
Patients are encouraged to avoid rescue medication use for the first 2 hrs following treatment with the study medication. The patient will be required to return to the Resea rch Clinic (Visit 3) 
within 3–[ADDRESS_400661] study medication administration for final in -clinic assessments, to 
return the Patient Kit containing the used and unused study medication, ePD, and any other unused supplies. Conversely, patients will be asked to return to the Research Clinic after 
12 weeks with their unused Patient Kit if they did not treat a CVS epi[INVESTIGATOR_324443]. Visit 3 will include the following assessments: Vital signs; full physical examination; assessment for treatmen t emergent adverse events; 12 -lead ECG, concomitant medications

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 CVS is generally described as consisting of four phases. The hyperemesis phase usually starts 
from the early hours of the morning to noon, and is characterized by [CONTACT_324533]. The vomiting frequency can be up to eight times every hour (Fleisher  et al, 2005). This can last for 1 –[ADDRESS_400666] been reported to be a 
key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the prodromal and emetic 
phases of CVS in adults ( Abell et al, 2008) . Abortive IV antiemetic agents such as the 5 -HT
3 
antagonists ondansetron at high doses and granisetron were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_324474] ( Li and Misiewicz et al, 2003 ; Yang, 2010; 
Venkatasubramani, 2007 ). 
Granisetron is a highly selective and potent 5- HT
[ADDRESS_400667] widely used fo r over 
twenty years as an effective antiemetic treatment ( Blower, 2003) . Because of its demonstrated 
effectiveness as an antiemetic treatment, granisetron was selected as the drug for development using the Staccato technology. One of the potential advantages of Staccato Granisetron (AZ-010) is rapid IV -like pharmacokinetics. In Phase [ADDRESS_400668] been shown to be effective in treating 
nausea and vomiting. For example, a randomized, double-blind dose-ranging study for IV granisetron in the prevention of PONV found that a single dose of 1 mg or 3 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of patients experiencing postoperative nausea or vomiting during postoperative periods of 0–6 h and 0–24 h (78% and 77% of patients, respectively) (Wilson et al, 1996) . Granisetron was well tolerated and the optimum dose was 1 mg. Consensus 
guidelines for the prevention of PONV in adults recommend t reatment with 0.35 –3 mg IV 
granisetron or 4 mg IV ondansetron at the end of surgery ( Gan et al, 2014) .  
The selection of the 1 mg and 3 doses of AZ -010 for this study is supported by a Phase 1 study 
(AMDC 010 -101) demonstrating the equivalence of PK exposure between 1 mg AZ-010 and 
1 mg IV granisetron . In this crossover study conducted in healthy volunteers, mean peak  and 
total granisetron exposure (C
max and AUC) were similar for both routes of administration with 
both treatments yielding peak exposure within 2 minutes. The half- life w as the same with the IV 
and Staccato treatments  at 10 hr. Consequently, given the importance of the 1 and 3 mg IV doses 
for granisetron in treating nausea and vomiting noted above and the PK equivalence of IV and Staccato granisetron, doses of 1 mg and 3 mg AZ-010 were selected for this study.  
CVS is characterized by [CONTACT_324540]. The primary endpoint for this study is aimed at capturing the number of t imes the patient has vomited or retched ( which will be considered the 
same as vomiting in the enumeration of events) in the time period specified post dosing. This endpoint is the most direct assessment of the primary symptom and will be recorded by [CONTACT_324541] e PD.

All assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
10.1 Demograp hic Characteristics and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics [i.e., sex, ethnic origin, date of birth, and height and weight will be 
collected at the S creening V isit and detailed on the eCRF.

and will include  blood pressure , pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and temperature . 
Patients should wear light clothing, empty pockets of heavy objects, and remove his/her shoes 
before weight is measured.  Height will be measured after the patient has removed his/her shoes.  
Height will only be measured at the Screening Visit.  
10.[ADDRESS_400700] 5 minutes. Individual parameters including heart rate, PR, QT, 
QTcF, QRS, and RR intervals will be collected.  Repeat electrocardiograms (if deemed 
necessary) should be performed at least [ADDRESS_400701]. 
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) [ADDRESS_400702] of clinical laboratory assessments to be performed is included in  the 
Appendix, Section  17.1. Specific days for c linical laboratory assessments can be found in  the 
Schedule of Events (Table  1). 
The results of clinical laboratory tests conducted at the Screening V isit must be assessed by [CONTACT_324546]’s eligibility for participation in the study.  The Investigator 
should indicate review of the laboratory reports by [CONTACT_324547].   
Any significant abnormalities should be fully investigated. Whenever possible, the etiology of 
the abnor mal findings will be documented . Laboratory results with significantly abnormal values 
should be investigated  as such  and checked for verification . Additional tests and other 
evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. In particular, if a clinically significant abnormal result is observed that is not resolved by [CONTACT_53601], repeat tests will be performed if possible and resolution or stability of the abnormality  will be recorded in the 
source documentation. 
Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either serious or unexpected will be promptly 
reported to Alexza’s Medical  Monitor. Any additional relevant laboratory results obtained by [CONTACT_324548] . 
10.[ADDRESS_400703] 24 hours after dosing. A vomiting or retching event is defined as one or more continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128] (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach 
contents). If there is a break of at least [ADDRESS_400704] 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes on the ePD. 
10.7 Visual  Analog Scale (VAS) 
The visual analog scale is a scale of continuou s measure initially developed for pain that has 
been used in a variety of clinical settings where the endpoint of interest is based on a subjective 
perception. The visual analog scale is a distinct 100- millimeter line anchored on the left end (0) 
at no degree of impairment and on the right end (100) at full degree of impairment, where indication of the degree of impairment perceived at the time of assessment is captured by [CONTACT_324549]. The measur ed distance 
of the mark from the left anchor will be recorded in millimeters  and this scale will be adapted for 
the ePD.  
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) [ADDRESS_400705] vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]:  
• The assessment of abdominal pain whereby 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain; 
• The assessment of nausea whereby 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea; 
• The assessment of anxiety/panic whereby 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible 
anxiety/panic. 
 
10.8 Rhodes Index of Nausea, V omiting, and R etching (RINVR)  
The RINVR is designed to assess the degree of nausea distress and vomiting distress in patients. 
It is composed of 8 questions and each question has 5 choices (see Appendix, Section 17.4) . 
Questions 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 deal with symptom occurrence and Questions 2, 3, 5 deal with degree 
of discomfort of the individual symptoms. Individual questions can be tracked over time or a 
composite score can be formed by [CONTACT_324550].  This scale will be adapted for the ePD and patients will be 
prompted to answer the questions according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
10.[ADDRESS_400706] vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_324447]. Severity ranges from Mild to Excruciating  on a 4 point scale. 
This scale will be adapted for the ePD and  patients will be prompted to answer the questions

10.[ADDRESS_400707]. For both Intensity and Duration, the patient will respond whether the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_324495], the Same as, or Greater than their typi[INVESTIGATOR_324450]. The questions will be prompted  approximately 24 hours after each dose of study medication is administered.  
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) [ADDRESS_400708] medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a patient 
during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant 
illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient’s health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i .e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an adverse event. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All patients will be monitored for adverse events during the study.  Assessments may include 
monitoring of the following parameters: the patient’s cl inical symptoms, laboratory, physical 
examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.  
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study medication, 
will be considered a pretreatment adverse event  (or interim medical event) and will be captured 
on the eCRF . Adverse events will be considered treatment -emergent if the onset is after the first 
dose of study drug.  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an adverse event if the abnormality: 
• Is con sidered clinically significant; OR  
• results in discontinuation from the study; OR 
• is judged by [CONTACT_324551], 
modification/interruption of investigational product dose, or any other therapeutic intervention. 
 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the adverse event. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be rec orded as a medical term and not 
simply as an abnormal laboratory result (e .g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased 
platelets).  
11.2 Evaluation of Adverse Event s  
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/int ensity, and 
relationship to Study Medication , duration, action taken, and outcome.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 11.2.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that 
fulfills the following criteria:  
• Is fatal (results in death);  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324496], regardless of length of stay); 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
patient 's ability to conduct normal life functions); 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
• Constitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result  in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the patient or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Event s not considered  to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., sampling for laboratory tests). 
However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of such procedur es 
remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social reasons, in absence of an adverse event.  
• A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the eCRF. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing medical condition that does not worsen.  
• Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.

and outcome. 
Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will  be handled through the electronic data capture 
system or other appropriate means. Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be 
handled by [CONTACT_756]. 
11.2.2 Severity/Intensity  
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the 
severity/intensity of the event.  
The N ational C ancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 
Version  5.0 should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events.  These criteria will be  
provided in a study manual. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the I nvestigator should grade 
the severity according to the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (mild): does not interfere with the patient’s usual function  
• Grade 2 (moderate): interferes to some extent with patient's usual fun ction  
• Grade 3 (severe): interferes significantly with patient's usual function  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating disability  
• Grade 5 (death): results in death  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is based 
on patient/e vent outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 11.2.3 Relationship to Study Medication  
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event 
based on currently available information. Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.  Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_324552]:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 Related  for Regulatory Reporting Assessment:  
Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result , occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].  The event resolves or improves upon withdrawal 
of drug (de- challenge).  The event would be considered as definitely related to the Study 
Medication upon results of a positive re- challenge procedure.  
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication).  However , the influence of 
other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is unlikely, and the event follows a clinically reasonable response upon withdrawal of drug (de- challenge).   
Possibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the Study Medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed t o the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other 
concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events).  
Unrelated for Regulatory Reporting Assessment:  
Unlikely Related : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose tempo ral 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Not related : The adverse event is completely independent of Study Medication administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].

Adverse events assessed as related to Study Medication and serious adverse events will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, is otherwise expla ined, death occurs, or the patient is lost to follow -up. If resolved, a 
resolution date should be provided. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up 
includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causal ity of the 
adverse event.  This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations,

11.5 Recording Adverse Events  
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to Study Medication) including 
those from the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study vis it are to be 
recorded in the eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry.  The 
Investigator will provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity,

11.6.2 Repor ting Urgent Safety Issues  
If the study site staff becomes aware of an actual or potential urgent safety issue, then the Sponsor and Medical Monitor mus t be immediately contact[CONTACT_324554].  An urgent safety issue is defined as:  
• An immediate hazard to the health or safety of patients participating in a clinical study 
• A serious risk to human health or potentially a serious risk to human health 
 
An urgent safety issue may include: (1) issues with an investigational drug or comparators; 
(2) study procedures; (3) inter current  illness (including pandemic infections); (4) concomitant 
medications; (5) concurrent medical conditions; or (6) any other issues related to the safe conduct of the study or that pose a risk to study patients. 
In exceptional circumstances of imminent hazard and in order to safeguard the health or safety of 
individuals, the Investigators may  take urgent safety measures before informing the Sponsor, but 
the Sponsor must be informed immediately after the hazard has resolved.

Early
Discont inuation
(ED)The act of concluding participation prior to completion of all protocol -required 
eleme nts in a trial by [CONTACT_186045] . Four categories of discontinuation 
are distinguished as follows : a) dropout: Active discontinuation by a subject 
(also a noun referring to such a discontinued subject); b) Investigator -initiated 
discontinuation (e.g., for cause); c) loss to follow -up: cessation of participation 
without notice or action by [CONTACT_423]; d) Sponsor -initiated discontinuation. 
Note that subje ct discontinuation does not necessarily imply exclusion of 
subject data from analysis. “Termination” has a history of synonymous use, 
but it is now considered non -standard.
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a trial.
Enroll The process of registering or enter inga subject into a clinical trial. NOTE: 
Once a subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF) , the clinical trial 
protocol applies to the subject. 
End of Study

a Follow -upvisit and an End of Study Phone Call.
Independent Data 
Monitoring
Committee
(IDMC)The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is responsible for the 
interim futility evaluation of efficacy data defined in the IDMC Charter. 
Participants in the IDMC include, but may not be limited to an Independent 
Astellas Statistici an who is not on the study team and does not communicate 
with study team or Site staff. The IDMC will ev aluate unblinded data and 
provide conclusion of futility analysis to Astellas Management.
Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that 
is believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g ., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics). 
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Randomization will occur after predose assessments and eligibility criteria 
have been confirmed at Visit 3.

Washout Time (post review of safety laboratory assessments) when a subject 
discontinues use of prohibited medications , as medically indicated and based 
upon the Investigator’s recommendation, to allow for medication to be 
eliminated from the body. Completed prior to Diary Run-In.

prohibited medications (if applicable), and a 7 -day Baseline Diary Run -In. The wash -out of 
prohibited medications should be completed prior to the initiation of the Baseline Diary 
Run-In. The Baseline Diary Run -Inmay be extended up to 2 days if necessary in the 
Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. In general, the Screening period should not exceed [ADDRESS_809878] to exceed 42 days.
Double -blind randomized treatment period (Day 1 to Day 57 [End of Treatment (EOT)]) 
Eight -weeks of treatment with study drug and site visits at Day 1,15, 29 and 57.
Follow -up period (Day 58 to Day 85 [End of Study (EOS)]) 
Includes a follow -up site visit on Day 71 and an (EOS) phone call on Day 85.
Screening Period: 
After signing the informed consent, screening procedures for the subject will start ( Visit 1). 
Subjects will be required to meet both the 1990 and 2010 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia. T he Investigator or other qualified individual at the site will 
confirm the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. 
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria [see Section 3.2Inclusion Criteria] will be instructed , if 
medically appropriate, to wash -out of any prohibited medications via phone call. At Visit 2 all 
subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria w ill be provided with an electronic diary (e -
diary). Subjects will enter a [ADDRESS_809879] their daily average pain score (0 -10Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]) and sleep quality 
information with the Fib romyalgia Sleep Diary (FMSD) in the e -diary. They will receive 
instructions regarding its use and begin entering daily scores. Upon awakening, subjects are to rate 
their sleep quality during the previous night using the e -diary. Each evening before bed, su bjects 
are to rate their average pain during the previous [ADDRESS_809880] a mean daily average pain score ≥ 4 and ≤ 9, and meeting pre -specified criteria for daily 
average pain scores.
A subject who does not meet the required mean daily average pain score or who is not compliant 
with e -diary entries by [CONTACT_9159] 5 of 7 days in the baseline run -in, will be considered a 
screen failure and will not be allowed to repeat the pain assessments nor rescreen for the s tudy.
After confirmation of eligibility at Visit 3 (Randomization ), subject s who meet the mean daily 
average pain score eligibility requirements at this visit will be randomized. For subjects that meet 
the entry criteria at Visit 3 (Randomization ), additio nal baseline assessments will be obtained (see 
Schedule of Assessments). 
Double -Blind Randomized Treatment Period (treatment period):
Subjects will enter the treatment period and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ASP0819 or placebo once per day for a period of 8 weeks. Acetaminophen may be used as rescue 
therapy for intolerable pain due to fibromyalgia during the baseli ne period and in all subsequent 
study periods (see rescue medication section). Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
may be used (with the exception of celecoxib) as needed for non -fibromyalgia pain (e.g., 
headache ).

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Throughout the treatment period, beginning on Day 1 (Randomization ) through Visit 6/Week 8, 
subject s will record all daily average pain scores (NRS) and any acetaminophen use in the e -diary. 
Sleep quality scores (FMSD) will be recorded through Visit 6/Week8. Subjects will take study 
drug once per day ( qd). Subject s randomized to ASP0819 will receive 15 mg (3 capsules of 5 mg 
each) .In order to maintain the study blind, ASP0819 andplacebo treated subject s will receive 
matching capsules . 
During the treatment period, subject s will return to the clinic per schedule for safety and efficacy 
procedures (see Schedule of A ssessments for details). Subject s who do not complete the treatment 
period will be requested to complete EOT visit procedures.
Follow -up Period:
Subject s areencouraged to abstain from any concomitant medications for the treatment of pain 
prior to Visit 7/Week 10. Rescue medication is allowed duri ng the follow -up period. Subject s will 
continue to enter their daily average pain sc ore (NRS) , sleep quality scores (FMSD) and 
acetaminophen use into their e -diary and return diaries at Visit 7/Week 10. All subjects will return 
to the site for a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2weeks following the EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up 
safety phone call will take place approximately [ADDRESS_809881] study drug discontinuation

Statistical Methods:
Sample size justification: 
The sample size calculations are based on the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline

endpoint for the comparison of ASP0819 vsplacebo, [ADDRESS_809904] s in the ASP0819 and placebo 
groups would be required to provide 80% power to demonstrate statistical significance using a 
1-sided 5% significance level (based on the assumption of normally distributed data, and taking 
into account the interim analysis for futility).
The total number of subject s required for the analysis would be 168 (84:[ADDRESS_809905] s in ASP0819 : 
placebo) . Assuming approximately 5% of randomized subject s will not contribute to the analysis, 
and then a total of [ADDRESS_809906] s would be required for randomization using a 1:1 randomization 
ratio (89:89) subject s for the ASP0819 group and placebo group.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Efficacy:
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean daily average pain NRS. 
The baseline mean daily average pain score will be derived from the daily average pain scores 
(based on the daily NRS recorded in the [ADDRESS_809907] day of dosing ). The primary 
analysis population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which will include all randomized 
subject s who received at least 1dose of study medication. Unless otherwise stated, all assessments 
of statistical significance will be one -sided at the 5% significance level, and as such one -sided p -
values will be shown.
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean 
daily average pain NRS will use a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, where the 
model will include the effects for treatment group, center (pooled where necessary), time (study 
Week 1 to 8) and treatment -by-time interaction, as well as the covariates of baseline mean daily 
average pain NRS and baseline pain -by-treatment interaction and subject as a random effect. The 
unconstrained between -time-point covariance structure will be used. This analysis will utilize 
observed data, a nd there will be no imputation for missing data. Least squares estimates for the 
primary endpoint will be shown for both treatment group s, and for the treatment comparisons of 
ASP0819 vsplacebo (together with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals [CI]). A one -sided 5% 
significance level will be u sed for the comparison of ASP0819 vsplacebo. This analysis will also 
display the same estimates for the exploratory endpoints of change from baseline to each Week
from Week 1 to 7 in the mean daily average pain NRS. Th e analysis of change from baseline to 
EOT in mean daily average pain will use analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ), with covariates of 
baseline average pain NRS score and center (pooled where necessary).
A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will use the same MMRM model as described 
previously. However, for this secondary analysis, multiple imputation will be used for imputation 
of any missing data, using the ‘Jump to Reference’ algorithm (where placebo is the reference 
group) for subjects who discontinue due to lack of efficacy or AEs and standard regression -based 
multiple imputation for subject s with missing data for other reasons. An additional sensitivity 
analysis for the primary endpoint will use modified baseline observation carried forward 
(mBOCF) for missing data with analysis using ANCOVA, with covariates of baseline mean daily

1.1 Back ground
Background on Target Indication
Fibrom yalgia is a complex sy ndrome characterized by  [CONTACT_610896], fatigue, sleep disturbances and/or cognitive 
complaints. Fibromy algia pain ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y includes deep musculoskeletal pain with tender points 
in the shoulder, girdle, torso, hips and extremities. Fibrom yalgia may include various somatic 
symptoms, such as headache and irritable bowel sy ndrome. The core diagnostic criteria for 
fibromy algia are defined by  [CONTACT_941] 1990 American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) [Wolfe et al, 
1990]. While the ACR has published new, as well as subsequent amended criteria [Wolfe et al, 
2011; Wolfe et al, 2010], the 1990 version is still commonly  utilized in clinical trials. The 
overall prevalence of fibromy algia in the general population was estimated to be 2. 2% in the 
[LOCATION_002] (3.4% and 0.5% in females and males, respectively ) [Queiroz, 2013].
Drugs used to treat fibromy algia (e.g., pregabalin andduloxetine) provide, at best, only  
modest relief of s ymptoms and are accompanied by  [CONTACT_610897], 
dizziness, cognitive complaints, weight gain, edema and headaches. The approved 
medications for the treatment of fibromy algia ([LOCATION_002] [ US]:pregabalin, duloxetine
andmilnacipran; Japan: pregabalin) result in only an incremental increase in the percent of 
subject s (~8% to 13%) with a 30% pain reduction compared to 28% to 34% of subject s with 
a similar level of improvement on p lacebo in randomized clinical trials [Häuser et al, 2014]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_610848], novel medications to treat pain, fatigue, sleep 
disturbances and impaired cognition without intolerable AEs are required to address an 
unmet medical need for subject s with fibromy algia .
A pathophy siological mechanism for fibrom yalgia has not y et been established . The concept 
of altered central processing of nociceptive information has dominated the fibromy algia 
literature [Woolf, 2011; Staud, 2011] . Howeve r, accumulating evidence suggests an 
abnormality  in both peripheral nerve fibers, as well as central pain processing in subject s 
with fibromy algia [Serra et al, 2014; Staud & Smitherman, 2002] . Studies have suggested 
that peripheral abnormalities in sensor y nerves may be important in contributing to and/or 
possibly  maintaining fibromy algia symptoms [Staud, 2006] . Increased spontaneous and 
evoked firing was observed in fibromy algia subject s [Serra et al, 2014] ;while lidocaine was 
shown to improve hy peralges ia in fibrom yalgia subject s [Staud et al, 2014] . Abnormal 
(increased) peripheral sensory  afferent input may  be amplified in the presence of central 
sensitization (decreased inhibition) [Staud et al, 2014; Staud, 2006].
Furthermore, specific C -fiber abnorma lities have been reported in fibrom yalgia subject s. 
Skin biopsies obtained from fibromy algia subject s showed distinct ultrastructural 
abnormalities in C -fibers including ballooned Schwann cells (concentrated in tender areas)

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1and peripheralized small axons of Remak bundles [Kim et al, 2008] . Serra et al. [2014] 
reported h yperexcitability , as well as structural changes in peripheral nociceptive C -fibers of 
fibromy algia subject s, suggesting abnormal peripheral C nociceptor ongoing activity  and 
increased mechan ical sensitivity  could contribute to the pain and tenderness suffered by  
[CONTACT_610898] s [Serra et al, 2014].
In addition, studies have reported that small -fiber pathology  is a contributor to the widespread 
pain in fibromy algia subject s [Oaklander et al, 2013; Üçey ler et al, 2013] . Oaklander et al 
[2013] demonstrated that subject s diagnosed with fibromy algia have evidence of a neurological 
cause of their chronic pain and other s ymptoms, specificall y small -fiber poly neuropathy . 
Further, Üçey ler et al [ 2013] challenged the concept of fibromy algia being a form of depression 
or a ps ychological disorder, illustrating small -fiber impairment on a ps ychophysical, 
neuroph ysiological and morphological level in fibromy algia and postulating that small -fiber 
pathol ogy may  be a peripheral nervous sy stem contributor to the complex pathophy siology  of 
pain in fibromy algia .
Taken together, these findings suggest that some fibromy algia subject s may  have underl ying 
peripheral nerve damage that may  contribute to pain sy mpto ms. Given the significant unmet 
medical need and emerging understanding of peripheral pathoph ysiology , targeting 
peripheral mechanisms may  be helpful in the treatment of fibrom yalgia.
Background on Pharmacological Concept
Ca2+-activated K+channels are cla ssified according to their single channel conductance: large 
conductance channel (K+large conductance Ca2+-activated channel, subfamily  M, alpha 1 
[KCNMA1]), intermediate conductance channel (K Ca3.1) and small conductance channel 
(SK) . KCa3.1 is voltage -insensitive and requires only  a small increase in intracellular Ca2+to 
open, subsequentl y maintaining a negative membrane potential through K+ efflux [Bradding 
andWulff, 2009] . Opening of K Ca3.1 results in a period of reduced excitability  after each 
actio n potential called afterhy perpolarization . The phy siological role of K Ca3.1 is considered 
to be regulation of cellular excitability , which suggests it is a potential therapeutic target for 
various diseases associated with abnormal nerve excitation [Wulff e t al, 2007] . For example, 
the activation of K Ca3.[ADDRESS_809915] on visceral 
hypersensitivity  [McHugh et al, 2008], but also to be involved in the analgesic action of 
peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor agonists [L oVer me et al, 2006]. The channel is 
represented in A -delta and C -fiber dorsal root ganglion and axons [Tsantoulas and
McMahon, 2014] . Thus, the regulation of K Ca3.[ADDRESS_809916] s.

of multiple once- daily dose (1 to 18 mg) in the same tablet formulation as that tested in the 
current stud y. ASP0819 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y absorbed with median t maxranging from 1.[ADDRESS_809918] variability  (12.3% 
to 41 .5%). The average terminal elimination half -life ranged from 38.9 to 54.5 hours with a 
mean apparent oral clearance vary ing from 0.196 to 0.285 L /h. Drug accumulation was on 
average 2.82- to 3.45-fold higher (AUC tau) at steady-state compared to single dose with no 
clear differences across dose levels . Most of the subjects with once dail y doses of ASP0819 
appeared to be at stead y-state after 8 to 10 day s of dosing. The peak to trough ratio was low 
(1.57 - 1.87 on average) ,thus suggesting a low degree of flu ctuation in the plasma 
concentrations over the dosing period. The anal ysis of urine concentrations collected at 
steady -state showed, that after repeat dosing, ASP0819 excretion in urine was very  low 
(≤2%) and not dose dependent . Overall, no sex effect cou ld be observed and the effect of 
food was clinicall y insignificant (approximately 20 -36% lower following a high- fat meal) .
In the phase 1 stud y, , where single and multiple ascending doses of ASP0819 
were assessed, ASP0819 was well tolerated in healthy  males and females. There were no 
deaths, other serious treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ), or TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation during the study . In general, the most commonly  reported adverse events 
(AEs) observed across the single ascendin g dose and multiple ascending dose parts of the 
study , were constipation and other Gastrointestinal Disorder SOC events; the majority  of 
these events were mild. There were no clinicall y significant abnormalities in any  of the liver 
or hematologic parameter s or other clinical laboratory  test results considered related to 
ASP0819. There were no clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs or 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs) ; there were no cardiac repolarization ( QTcF )intervals greater 
than [ADDRESS_809919] (at 18:[ADDRESS_809920]-dosing). Based on a 
concentration vs change from baseline anal ysis, ASP0819 sho wed no clinically  significant 
effects on QTcF.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Given the early  stage of development, there are currentl y no expected AEs for ASP0819.
ASP0819 may  be associated with TEAEs based on the nonclinical studies . The following 
were key  nonclinical observations: signs of liver abnormality ; gastrointestinal atroph y, 
inflammation; changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit and other red blood cell parameters (Refer 
to the IB for detailed information) . 
1.[ADDRESS_809921] been conducted to evaluate ASP0819 in the treatment of pain 
associated with fibrom yalgia;therefore, the actual benefit of ASP0819 in the treatment of pain 
associated with fibrom yalgia is unknown . There are no known risks identified with this 
mechanism of action , as ASP0819 is a first -in-class compound . Based on the safet y profile 
from the phase 1 clinical data, the risks appear to be ju stified from a risk benefit assessment. 
An overview of the risk benefit of ASP0819 can be found in the IB , including monitoring and 
mitigation steps taken to maintain safet y of the subjects while on study treatment . Routine risk 
minimization procedures areplanned in this study .Overall, the fibrom yalgia subjects that will 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be relatively  healthy ;therefore increased risk is 
not expected in this population. [See Section 2.2.2 Dose Rational efor safety  margins relative 
to non-clinical toxicology ].

quality  scores and acetaminophen use into their e -diary  and return diaries at Visit 7/Week 10. 
All subject s will return to the site for a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2weeks following the 
EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up safet y phone call will take place approximately [ADDRESS_809928] study  drug discontinuation ( Day 85/EOS).
Interim Analys es:
Two interim anal yses for futility  based on the p rimary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted. 
The timing of these anal yses will be at approximately 35% and 55% of allsubject s with 
Week 8/EOT data [see Section 7.7Interim Anal ysis]. The plan for the interim analy sis may  
be modified based on the speed of recruitment.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
The analgesic efficacy  of ASP0819 w ill be assessed at a dose of 15 mg qdover a period of 
8weeks.
Target exposures assessed in this proof -of -concept study  are based on efficacious exposures 
from the rat vagotom y model,which showed significant signs of analgesia with an EC50 (C eff) 
at 119 ng/mL , and rat reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_610849] m yalgia nerve firing model ,which showed significant 
signs of pharmacology  at tested ex posures ranging from approx imately 90ng/mL to 
5000 ng/mL . Based on the Phase 1 human PK data, the predicted mean C trough (95% Prediction 
Interval [PI ]) following 15mg qdis 2610 ng/mL  (1450 -3850 ng/mL) . All subject s are 
predicted to have C trough concentrations above the target efficacious exposure (C eff119 ng/mL).
The predicted mean C max(95%PI) and AUC tau(95%PI) for a [ADDRESS_809929] s are 4380 ng/mL (2790 –6090 ng/mL) a nd [ZIP_CODE] ng*hr/mL

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1([ZIP_CODE] -109800 ng*hr /mL), respectivel y. These predicted mean exposures are below the 
previously  established mean exposure limits; and they  are approximately  3-fold or m ore below 
the [ADDRESS_809930] level (LOAELs ; 10 mg/kg/day  in rat and dog 
studies) are based on the observations of atroph y in mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_610850]. All findings were reversible. There is 
approximately  a 9-fold safet y margin based on the LOAELs from the 13 -wk rat and dog 
toxicology  studies to the predicted upper 95% PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178] C maxand AUC 24 from a 15 mg qddose.
Thus, a dose of 15 mgqd should provide exposure within an efficacious target range and 
below exposures associated with toxicity  in nonclinical studies.

Severity  of pain due to fibromy algia will be assessed through the PGI S and the FIQR and 
subjects will use a tablet device for completion .Subjects should have a FIQR pain score of 
≥4 at Visit 1 to be eligible for participation in this study . In addition, the NPSI  will be used 
to characterize the presence of neuropathic pain sy mptoms.
In order to be eligible for Randomization (Visit 3), subjects will be required to have a mean 
daily  average pain score of ≥ 4 and ≤9on the NRS during th e Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod 
and meeting pre -specified criteria for dail y average pain scores. 
The Complex Medical Symptoms Inventory  (CMSI ) is designed to aid clinicians in 
collecting information from fibromy algia patients regarding their disease -specific s ymptoms 
and to characterize th e diagnosis . The inventory  contains 2parts: a sy mptom checklist to be 
completed b y patients, and a diagnostic inventory completed b y the clinician . In this study , 
only the s ymptom checklist will be utilized.
The sy mptom checklist contains 39 items (males) or 41 items (females) . For each s ymptom 
question, patients mark a box to indicate if the s ymptom: 1) h as occurred for at least 
3months in the past y ear, and/or 2) has occurred for a [ADDRESS_809967] at Baseline Diary  Run -In

5.2.4 Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The M.I.N.I. International Neurops ychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 7.0) is a short, structured 
diagnos tic interview administered by  [CONTACT_21724] . The instrument captures the major 
Axis I  psychiatric disorders in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM -V)and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems ( ICD-10), and has demonstrated equivalent reliability , validit y, and decreased 
interview time when compared to the Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM diagnoses 
(SCI D-P). Each module begins with screening questions that are answered y es or no. A
negative response in the screening algorithm advances the interview to the next module, 
whereas a positive response will prompt additional questions that ask patients to characterize 
behavior with “y es” or “no” responses . Some questions contain a recall p eriod (e.g., “Past 
Two Weeks ,”“Past Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]” and “Current Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]”) . After completion of the additional 
questions, the clinician indicates whether or not the diagnostic criteria have been met, based 
on the instrument scoring criteria [Sheehan et al, 1998; Amorim et al, 1998; Sheehan et al, 
1997; L ecrubier et al, 1997] .

In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead 
to a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received treatment. AE collection begins after the signing of the informed consent and will be

Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
Requires active intervention
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug
The abnormalit y or test value is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An AEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the following outcomes: 
Results in death
Is life -threatening (an AEis considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except for planned procedures as allowed per study )or 
leads to prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106306]/observat ion/examination caused by  [CONTACT_610910]) 
Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77746] 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, incl uding those that may  result in disability /incapacity , should also 
usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result i n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events . If an AEis 
reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “alway s serious ,” 
additional information on the event may  be requested .

A discontinuation from treatment is a subject who enrolled in the study  and for whom study  
treatment is permanently  discontinued for any  reason . 
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treat ment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty  or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from study  treatment or toterminate a 
subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the subject 's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing AEor an unresolved laboratory  
result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to 
provide follow -upuntil the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  significant.

The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  [CONTACT_610916] s 
Pharma Global Development -[LOCATION_002] ( APGD -US). A Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) 
will be written to provide details of the anal ysis, along with specifications for tables, listings 
and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before the first interim lock at the 
latest. Any  changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be justified in the Clinical Study  
Report (CSR).
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
SD, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and frequency and 
percentage for categorical endpoints.

and placebo groups would be required to provide 80% power to demonstrate statistical 
significance using a 1-sided 5% significance level (based on the assumption of normally  
distributed data, and taking into account the interim analy sis for futility ).
The total number of subject s required for the analy sis would be 168 (84:[ADDRESS_810009] s in 
ASP0819 :placebo groups ). Assuming approximately  5% of randomize d subject s will not 
contribute to the anal ysis, then a total of [ADDRESS_810010] s would be required for randomization 
using a 1:1 randomization ratio (89:89) subject s for the ASP0819 :placebo groups.
7.2 Analysis Sets
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in Classification Specifications and for the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets, except Pharmacokinetic Anal ysis Set (PKAS), will be

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis
The primary  analysis for the primary  endpoint of c hange from baseline to Week 8 in the 
mean dail y average pain NRS will use a MMRM analysis, where the model will include the 
effects for treatment group, center (pooled where nec essary ), time (stud y Week 1 to 8 ) and 
treatment -by-time interaction, as well as the covariates of baseline mean daily  average pain 
NRS and baseline pain -by-treatment interaction and subject as a random effect . The

ASP0819 group i s less than the placebo group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis
The following sensitivity anal yses will be conducted for the primary  endpoint. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint will use the same MMRM model as 
described in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Anal ysis]. For this sensitivity  anal ysis, multiple 
imputation will be used for imputat ion of any  missing data, using “ Jump to Reference ”
algorithm (where placebo is the reference group) [ Carpenter et al. 2013] for subject s 
who discontinue due to lack of efficacy  or AEs and standard regression -based multiple 
imputation for subject s with missing data for other reasons. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis will use modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) 
for missing data at Week 8 with analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA), with covariates of 
baseline mean daily  average pain NRS score and center. mBOCF is defined as 
imputation by  [CONTACT_564602] ( BOCF )for subjects who 
discontinue due to lack of efficacy  or AEs , and imputation by [CONTACT_610919] (LOCF )for subjects with missing data at Week 8 for other reasons. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis for t he primary  endpoint will use the same MMRM model as 
described in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Anal ysis] using the PPS .
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis
Subgroup anal ysis of primary  efficacy  endpoint will be considered for following subgroups: 
sex, age category, category of baseline pain sco re, with or without depression (current vs no 
current diagnosis and current/prior diagnosis vs no current/prior diagnosis) , and central or 
peripheral pain etiology (subgroups b y CMSI, NPSI ). Additional subgroups will be 
considered as appropriate. More deta ils about subgroup anal ysis will be provided in the SAP. 
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints

The primary  anal ysis for the secondary  endpoints of mean dail yaverage pain score (≥30% 
and 50% reduction from baseline to Week 8 and to EOT) will be carried out with the Fisher’s 
Exact Test. For the Week 8analysis, subject s with missing data will be classified as non-
responders (BOCF group ) and an additional anal ysis will use mBOCF. For the EOT anal ysis, 
LOCF will be used . 
The primary  anal ysis for the change from baseline to Week s2, [ADDRESS_810016] will use the same MMRM 
analysis as described in [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Analy sis]. The primary  analy sis for the

Sponsor: APGD ISN/Prot ocol [ADDRESS_810017] s with missing data, the analy sisat Week s2, 4 and 8 will be c onducted 
using mB OCF. An additional anal ysis at Week s2 and 4 will use LOCF . 
7.4.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory  efficacy  endpoints are defined in [Section 2.3.3 Exploratory  Endpoints ]. For 
the treatment period, the following analyses will be performed. 
The anal ysis for the change from baseline to each week from Week 1 to 7in mean dail y 
average pain is included in the primary  analy sis of primary  endpoint as described in 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Analy sis], which includes data from Week [ADDRESS_810018] s who meet cumulative response levels of > 0% to = 100% at Week [ADDRESS_810019] s with missing data will be classified as non -
responders (BOCF group ) and an additional anal ysis will use mBOCF . 
The change from baseline to Week s 2, 4, 8 in FIQR Total Score and PGIS wil l be anal yzed 
using the MMRM model as described in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Anal ysis]. The change

change from baseline to Week 8will be conducted with mBOCF. 
The subject ’s response defined as achieving ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in FIQR Total 
score at Week 8 and EOT will be anal yzed using the Fisher’s Exact Test. For the anal ysisat 
Week 8, mBOCF will be used for subject s with missing data. 
The percentage of subject s who achieve PGIC response ( Much Improved , Very Much

In addi tion, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks . 
ALT or AST > 3× ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper

The investigator may  determine that abnor mal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thor oughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the liver abnormalit y 
case report form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for an y 
study or an appropriate document . Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing 
should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated [ADDRESS_810044] is

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to do the 
following :
Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Symptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the(e)CRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events and decompensated cardiac disease t hatmay lead to 
secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in obese 
hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients and may  be associated with fluctuating AT 
levels .The investigator should ensure that the me dical history  form captures any  illness 
that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and special 
diets . Medications, including dose, is to be entered inthe (e)CRF . Information on alcohol, 
other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
Obtain a history  of exposure to envi ronmental chemical agents .
Based on the subject ’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including the following : 
oacute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) ,
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin .
Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document .
Subject S tudy Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease ,or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may  
be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine that it is not in t he subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
ifthe LFT results are as follows :
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks .
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated) .
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Substantial Change
1.PoC Fibromyalgia studies  0819 -CL-0201 and  (see separate 
submission to PAC) are pi[INVESTIGATOR_610876]:
New screening assessment added to section 2.2.1 : after signing informed consent and 
during the screening period, study  site personnel will check that potential subjects have not 
alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed screening or have been ran domized into 
this study , or another clinical trial, using an independent subject participation database.   
Independent subject participation databases seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by  
[CONTACT_610928] , and th is measure is consistent 
with exclusion requirement of not participating in another interventional clinical trial during 
the conduct of the stud y.  
In order to complete this check and per the informed consent, study  personnel will request 
that the subject present a valid pi[INVESTIGATOR_152679] (e.g. driver’s license, passport, state 
issued ID card, etc.)  and study  personnel may  be required to provide certain authorized 
information that could potentially  be used to identify  study  subjects identifiers (e.g. date of 
birth, initials, etc.) so that the match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not identified 
as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainl y, possible, probably), will be enrolled into t he study .
Appropriate documentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility  according to these criteria will 
be reflective in the subject’s source documents.
Note : Protocol wording developed in collaboration with the legal department
RATIONALE:
Proliferating problem of professional patients (recognized for a.o. US trials) -Websites 
dedicated to train people on how to get into research studies (e.g. 
Finance. youngmoney.com)
6-11% who seek entry  are, on another trial, in a lock out period or are att empting to enter 
at another facility
Incidence of dual enrollment per trial ranges from 2% to 10% according to the 
therapeutic area and the phase of the stud y
Certain indications attract “repeat” subjects 
Recent study  (3662 -CL-0049) demonstrated that 3% o f subjects were within study  
duplicates (screened only) at two different sites in a small POC study
Fibrom yalgia is a very  heterogeneous disease, lacks rigorous standardized and objective 
diagnostic criteria and relies on patient reported medical history
Implement checking prospectivel y in new (CNS) clinical trials to maximize the signal to 
noise ratio and increase chance of detecting effect size.A third party  vendor will be used

Non-Substantial Changes
1.Minor Administrative -type changes
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Wording changes for 8062 protocol also implemented here in the 0819 protocol to align the 2 
FM PoC Ph2 studies.
RATIONALE:
To align with the  study .
2.Clarification of  the number of tender point sites
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Clarify  the expectation that the patient will be eligible if she/he has pain in ‘at least’ 11 of the 
18 tender point sites.
RATIONALE:
The expectation is that a patient is eligible for study participation if he/she has pain in at least 
11 of the 18 tender point sites. The wording is only mentioning that the patient has pain in 11 
of 18 tende r point sites.
3.Update collection of tender points on site tablet instead of CRF 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The FM diagnosis is confirmed using the ACR criteria: Widespread Pain Index, Sy mptoms 
Severity  Scale and the Tender Points. WPI  [INVESTIGATOR_610877]. We want to include the tender point assessment here as well instead of capturing it 
separately  in the CRF.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1II  Amendment Summary of Changes :
2.1 Study Design and Dose Rationale
Section 2.2.1, Study Design
ADDED :
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, study site personnel 
will check that potential subjects have not already been pre -screened, initiated or 
completed screening or have been randomized into this study, or another clinical trial, 
using an inde pendent subject participation database.  Independent subject 
participation databases seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by [CONTACT_610929], and this measure is consistent with exclusion 
requirement of not partic ipating in another interventional clinical trial during the 
conduct of the study ( inclusion criterion 17).  In order to complete this check and per 
the informed consent, study personnel will request that the subject present a valid 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_152679] ( e.g. driver’s license, passport, state issued ID card, etc.)  and 
study personnel may be required to provide certain authorized information that could 
potentially be used to identify study subjects identifiers (e.g. date of birth, initials, etc.) 
so that t he match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not 
identified as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainly, possible, probably), will be enrolled 
into the study. Appropriate documentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility according 
to these criteria will be reflective in the subject’s source documents.

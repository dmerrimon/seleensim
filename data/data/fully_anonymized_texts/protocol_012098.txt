This document is confidential and the property of the Duke University.   Statistical Methodology  129Xe MRI metrics will include RBC/barrier, barrier/gas, 
RBC/gas and several spectroscopic indices. Continuous data 
will be presented using the mean ± SD if normally distributed and median with [ADDRESS_1130185] 
undergone the same 129Xe MRI protocol and were recruited 
with no histories of smoking or cardiopulmonary disease, 
FEV1>80%, FEV1/FVC>0.70 and DLCO>80%. For subjects to be 
included in the reference cohort they further had an 
RBC/barrier ratio  ≥0.45 (at TR=15 ms), and image SNR >5, 
based on the Rose criterion. Comparisons between these 
groups will use analysis of variance (ANOVA0 methods or 
Kruskal -Wallis test as appropriate.  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1130186] elucidate not only the cardiac 
and pulmonary  causes, but monitor them longitudinally and non- invasively. We now know that 
the long -term sequelae  within the pulmonary system includes  diffuse alveolar damage in the 
setting of ARDS  (Bradley '20) as well as significant fibrotic changes (George '20) and pulmonary 
vascular abnormalities (Ackermann '20). Moreover, recovered patient s have been reported to 
harbor significant myocardial injury on cardiac MRI (CMR) (Puntmann '20). This may be due to: (1) direct myocardial damage from viral infection (Lindner '20) or the effects on the right ventricle from damage to the pulmonary vascula ture caused by [CONTACT_816282]. 
Unfortunately, we currently have little understanding of these short - and long -term 
cardiopulmonary effects in survivors of COVID -[ADDRESS_1130187] pi[INVESTIGATOR_816265] 129Xe pulmonary 
functional MRI and high- resolution cardiac MRI. This combination of technologies  
addresses the unmet need by [INVESTIGATOR_173003], and non- invasively quantifying regional 3D ventilation,  
alveolar capi[INVESTIGATOR_48635], and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics. With the addition  
of a full cardiac assessment, it can be used to elucidate the causes of dyspnea and monitor progression or resolution of disease non -invasively over time. Our central hypothesis is that 
noninvasive imaging of the pulmonary airspaces, interstitial membrane and capi[INVESTIGATOR_423027], combined with cardiac structure/function assessment, provides an unprecedented and

sequalae, and its tr eatable traits. This approach to characterizing the aftermath of SARS- COV2 
infection will improve our understanding of the underlying pathology and provide fundamental 
insights upon which to design future interventions, such as tailoring treatments to spec ific 
patterns of cardiopulmonary impairment.  
 Investigational Agent  
1.2.1 Hyperpolarized 129Xe  
129Xe MRI also provides the unique ability to image the diffusive transfer of gas into the 
alveolar- capi[INVESTIGATOR_816266] (RBC) compartments. Like  oxygen, 129Xe 
must traverse the interstitial barrier to reach capi[INVESTIGATOR_816267] (RBCs). Notably 129Xe in 
barrier tissues and RBCs exhibits a unique frequency shift, allowing it to be separately imaged in each compartment. It has demonstrated sensitivi ty to gas exchange impairment in pulmonary 
fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular disease, without ionizing radiation.  
1.2.2 Study Dose  
Each xenon dose will be limited to a volume less than 25% of subject lung capacity (TLC), as is the case for all protocols currently carried out under IND 109,490 . 
  Risk and Benefits  
1.3.1 Potential Risk  
1. Inhalation of hyperpolarized 129Xe may carry some minor risks. Xenon is a general anesthetic when breathed continuously at concentrations greater than 70% for extended periods of time. In the proposed study, Xenon will be delivered in a single 
breath, with alveolar concentrations below 25%. At these concentrations, subjects may 
experience transient effects, including dizziness, slight tingling or numbness of the 
extremities, nausea, smellin g of flowers, or a feeling of well- being and euphoria. These 
effects will wane within 1 -2 minutes of exhaling the Xenon and are documented in the 
consent forms.  
2. The risks of participating in the MRI component of the study are considered minimal. MRI is a n oninvasive imaging modality that involves no ionizing radiation. At the time of 
recruitment/consenting and again before the MRI session, all subjects will complete a standard questionnaire to screen for contraindications to MRI imaging (e.g., presence of metal in the eye).  
3. There is also the potential risk of loss of confidentiality.  
4. Administering HP 
129Xe without oxygen - This is necessary to preserve good image 
quality because O2 is paramagnetic and depolarizes the HP 129Xe. Therefore, 129Xe is not 
mixed w ith O2 within the dose delivery bag, but only once it is inhaled. Administration 
of a single anoxic [ADDRESS_1130188]'s lungs is 
sufficient to maintain blood O2 saturation during the breath -hold. For each subject, 
their blood -oxygenation will be monitored throughout the time they are in the MRI 
  Page 5

oxygen will be required.  Furthermore, supplemental oxygen will be provided during the 
MRI exam, as indicated.  
5. The IV contrast material that is used routinely during the cardiac MRI procedure. However, as with any foreign material in the body, whether food or medicine, there is always the risk of an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions occur uncommonly but may be severe and can result in death. Other specific risks from the contrast agent relate to leaking of the agent at the injection site and side effects  or reactions to contrast agents.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1130189]'s body (this includes certain dyes found in tattoos). If there is any question about potentially hazardous metal within the subject's body, we will be excluding the subject from participation in this research study. We will also keep the exam room locked so that no one carrying metal objects can enter while the subject is in the scanner.  
  The study involves entering a large room in which a magnet is present. The subject will be 
placed on a narrow bed and then slid into a small tunnel approximately [ADDRESS_1130190] (SDCT) Risk 
SDCT is a standard medical procedure in lung imaging, widely used clinically and in research. Risks to participants are minimal. The study will involve a small amount of radiation exposure to the 
subjects. There will be one SDCT scan performed during the study. The scan protocol will be adjusted based on the participant weight. The average weight adult radiation dose is 4 mSv per scan, (8mSv) for the study. This compares to the US limit on radiation workers which is 50 mSv.  
Risk: The SDCT (lung scan) will be reviewed by a qualified person. There is a possibility that while 
reviewing the SDCT an incidental finding will be identified.  
Managing risk : T he patient will be informed about the incidental finding. With permission from 
the patient, the information about the incidental finding will be forwarded to the primary doctor or the patient can be referred to an appropriate doctor for further evaluatio n.  
The patient will be provided the following information:  
• An incidental finding may cause you to feel anxious.  
• Since an incidental finding will be part of your medical record, it may affect your 
current or future life or health insurance coverage. This risk will vary depending on 
the type of insurance plan involved.  
  Page 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential and the property of the Duke University.   • The costs for any care that will be needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding 
would not be paid for by [CONTACT_98139]. Any additional tests or treatments will be your choice; you or your insurer will be responsible for additional costs.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1130191] Risk:   
1. Subjects will stay  on their prescribed oxygen levels while participating in the 
study . 
Oxygen will be discontinued briefly for [ADDRESS_1130192]  
3. Every effort will be  made to keep your information confidential; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed  
4. Duke University has formal education and certification procedures regarding 
research ethics ( https://irb.duhs.duke.edu/training -and-education
). All research 
personnel will complete these in full before entry into the protocol; the study's nature and risks  will be reviewed with each subjects.  
2 Study Objectives  
The proposed research builds on the established sensitivi ty of Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI to 
obstructive (Ebner’17 , restrictive (Rankine’20) and pulmonary vascular lung disease (Wang ’19), features expected to represented in the Covid- 19 cohort. It further incorporates new 
understand of the possible role of myoca rdial injury in these recovered patients by [CONTACT_816283].  
 Although the initial presentation of patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID19 
infections is dominated by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1856], 10% go on to develop persistent post -
infection symptoms which are thought to have an inflammatory etiology. Evidence suggests that pathologic activati on of the inflammasome persists beyond the acute initial presentation 
that contributes to the persistent disabling symptoms characterized as “long -haul COVID”. For 
this trial, subjects will be eligible for enrollment if they are outpatients with a history of a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID -[ADDRESS_1130193] respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (i.e., cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion). An additional 10 subjects engaged in competitive sports and diagnosed with COVID -19 will also be enrolled. These subjects can be asymptomatic or mildly to 
moderately. Although rare, cardiac impairment has been documented in <2% of these 
  Page [ADDRESS_1130194] and PFTs will not be used to guide enrollment, but rather will be used in 
combination with XeMRI/cMRI to assess degree of functional impairment. We will stratify our 
results based on ethnicity and spi[INVESTIGATOR_816268].  
 
Existing data highlight significant racial and ethnic disparities with historically underserved 
minority populations (i.e., Black, LatinX) suffering disproportionately higher infection rates and 
more severe illness compared to Whites. This is reflected by [CONTACT_816284]. As such 30% of subjects enrolled will be required to be 
from underserved communities.  
 
 Primary Study A ims  
• Aim 1 - Determine the cardiopulmonary structure -function abnormalities that 
characterize early phase COVID -19 recovery. We anticipate conducting 129Xe and 
cardiac MRI in 13 recovering COVID patients recruited at their clinic visit 60 days’  or 
longer post-discharge from their acute infection. We will recruit patients with new onset 
persistent and continued dyspnea and to characterize the interstitial, pulmonary 
vascular and myocardial abnormalities relative to a control population.  
• Aim 2 – Characterize the evolution of cardiopulmonary abnormalities over 9 months. 
Patients will undergo repeat scanning 9 months later to assess changes in all regional parameters acquired from pulmonary and cardiac MRI, directly addressing the possible reversibility of cardi opulmonary limitations arising from “long COVID.”  
• Aim 3 – Identify MRI features that predict physiologic outcomes and can alter treatment  
decisions. Patients will undergo PFTs and quality of life evaluations at 3, 6 and 9 months, as well as detailed clinic al histories. These data will be used to understand which 
baseline imaging features are predictive of long -term quality of life and physiology 
outcomes as well as those that represent “treatable traits” that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

focus on identifying subjects with persistent and continued dyspnea after COVID- 19 infection. 
At initial SOC visit ( post -diagnos is of COVID positive), subjects will undergo  evaluation in 
pulmonary clinic.  Pulmonary function testing  (PFTs) [ADDRESS_1130196] (6MWT), and relevant 
labs will be ordered as indicated by [CONTACT_816286]. Subjects will be invited to 
participate in the post -COVID Pulmonary Biorepository and the COVID Long -Haulers pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
A subject can enroll in the COVID Long Haul ers pi[INVESTIGATOR_816269].  
 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
A participant will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• Death.  
• If a  participant is poorly compliant with study procedures, visits, and assessments,  
   withdrawal should preferably take place after evaluation and discussion.  
• If the investigator considers that continued participation in the study would be  
   contrary to the best interests of the participant.  
• Principal investigator’s decision for any reason, including, but not limited to, premature 
termination or suspension of the study.  
 
When a subject withdraws before completion of their study activities, the reason for  
withdrawal is to be documented in the eCRF and in the source document.  
 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. A subject cannot be deemed 
lost to follow -up until all reasonable efforts made by [CONTACT_816287]. The following actions must be taken if a participant fail to return to 
the study site for a required study visit:  
  Page 9 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential and the property of the Duke University.   • The study site personnel must attempt to contact [CONTACT_816288], to counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, to ascertain whether the participant wishes to or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee 
must make every reasonable effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls, e -mails and a certified letter to the 
participant’s last known mailing address). These contact [CONTACT_19425]’s research  records.  
 
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have  withdrawn from 
the study.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_1130197] withdraws 
from all study  activities  before the study is completed for any reason (except for death or 
withdrawal of consent), every at tempt should be made to schedule the end of study telephone 
call to assess the safety and well -being of the subject . Attempts should also be made to obtain 
permission to record at least survival data up to the protocol- described end of subject follow -

4.4.3 Replacement of Early Complete  Withdrawal (s)  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to completing study  activities  will have the 
data  collected about them  used in the primary and secondary endpoint analys es. A new 
subject will be consented to replace the one withdrawn to ensure data analysis of [ADDRESS_1130198] completed competency training from the

 Sample Size Determination  
Power  calculation:  Based  on the 129Xe MRI metrics  from  our study  (Wang,  et al., 2019),  we 
expect  that we could  detect  an absolute  difference  of high  barrier  uptake  of 10%  between  the 
post -COVID  subjects  and an existing  cohort  of healthy  controls.  We assume  that with  a 
standard deviation  of 10%  high  barrier  uptake  within  patients,  and requiring  a power  of 90%,  
that a two-sided test would  require  a sample  size of [ADDRESS_1130203] sugges ts the 
proposed  sample  size has 99%  power  to detect  a significant  difference.   
 Statistical Methods  
129Xe MRI metrics will include RBC/barrier, barrier/gas, RBC/gas,  
and several spectroscopic indices. Continuous data will be presented using the mean ± SD if  
normally distributed and median with 25th and 75th percentiles otherwise. We are fortunate to 
be able to compare the findings in our images to a database of approximately [ADDRESS_1130204] unde rgone the same 
129Xe MRI protocol and were recruited with no histories of smoking or cardiopulmonary disease, FEV1>80%, FEV1/FVC>0.70 and DLCO >80%. For subjects to be included in the reference cohort they further had a ventilation defect percentage ≤6%, ( upper limit of normal 
VDP (Ebner '19)) as well as RBC/barrier ≥0.45 (at TR=15 ms ), and image SNR>5, based on the 
Rose criterion. Comparisons between these groups will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods or Kruskal- Wallis test as appropriate.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 Overview  
As the sponsor of the s tudy, Duke University Medical Center and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_816270], within the required timelines, any safety reporting obligation to competent Health Authorities , IRB  and any participating (co or sub) investigators, 
as defined in applicable laws and regulations.  For this protocol, safety data include adverse events and special situations , including pregnancies.  
 Management of Safety data  
This study has been desig nated as an interventional study.  As such, all adverse events, special 
situations including pregnancies and product quality complaints will be reported as described in this protocol from the time a subject has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form (IC F) 
until [ADDRESS_1130205] documented use of the study drugs (i.e.,  end of study (9 months )). 
 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the study.  Intercurrent diseas es or injuries should be regarded as adverse 
events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
  Page 13 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential and the property of the Duke University.   • results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs  or symptoms  
• is associated with Abnormal lab values  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -seriou s.  A serious adverse event  is any AE, that 
is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Important medical even ts may not be immediately life -threatening but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in an in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of 
bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non 
serious adverse events .  
 NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON WILL BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 Post -study Adverse Event  
The investigator should follow all unresolved adverse events until the events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or  the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the resident, or the subject's physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in  this 
study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of cancer development or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.

if the condition meets the adverse event criteria.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery is reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:

 Life-Threatening Conditions  
The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_1130206] be recorded.  Each event's clinical course should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed to determine the outcome.  Any 
serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported  
immediately.  
 Study Closure  
Following the completion of the studies, the sponsor will be responsible for ensuring the following activities:  
o Data clarification and resolution  
o Review of Site study records for completeness

 Termination Criteria  
Premature termination of these clinic al trials may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
a change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100], or the FDA's discretion. DUMC also reserves the  
right to discontinue the trial before inclusion of the intended number of subjects, but intends only 
to exerc ise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.   
 CQMP Monitoring  
The Duke School of Medicine Clinical quality management program (CQMP) may conduct confidential audits to evaluate compliance with the protocols and GCP principles. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_816277]/her time and the time of the study team to the CQMP reviewer to discuss findings and any relevant issues. CQMP audits are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects.  
 Consent Process  
The Duke IRB must approve the informed consent form and comply with ICH, GCP, local regulatory requirements, and federal laws.  The investigator must ensure that each trial subject is fully informed about the tri al's nature and objectives and possible risks associated with participation.  
 The investigator will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any study -specific 
activity is performed.  The IRB must prospectively approve the informed consent  form used in this 
trial, and any changes made during the trial before use.  Additionally, the FDA will be notified of any changes before implementation as appropriate. The subject must sign this consent form, and the 
investigator -designated research profe ssional obtaining the consent.   The investigator will retain a 
copy of each subject's signed consent form.

 It is the investigator 's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRFs. 
CRFs must be electronic ally signed by [CONTACT_816289].  These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true.  At all times, the investigator has final,  personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs  
 All consent and case report forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the study coordinator or principal investigator's office. Any other digital data (images, image analysis) will be associated only with the subjec t identification number and the date and time of the 
129Xe 
MRI. Image data will be retrieved and analyzed only by [CONTACT_3462]. Data will be captured 
in a RedCap database. After all, manuscripts have been published, the key to the code will be 
destroyed.  
 RedCap 
Data will be captured in a RedCap© database. The database will be reviewed and discussed before database closure and closed only after resolving all remaining queries.  An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent changes to the  data. Only Key personnel will have access to the 
database.  
 Records Retention  
 As required by [CONTACT_816290], the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subject's (i.e., sufficient information to link records to identify), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], other source documents, and detailed descriptions of treatment disposition  
 
[ADDRESS_1130210], data, and safety of this study 
to ensure that:  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_26501];  
• The r isk/benefit ratio is  not altered to the detriment of the subjects;  
• Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done;  
• Over -accrual does not occur;  
• Under accrual is addresse d with appropriate amendments or actions;  
• Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner  
 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory do cuments, data 
collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implie s acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_17256].  
12 Ethical Considerations

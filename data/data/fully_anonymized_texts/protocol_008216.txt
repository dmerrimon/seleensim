CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  2. INTRODUCTION 
 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)  is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in The [LOCATION_002] affecting 
approximately 5.4 million Americans [1]. AD is characterized by [CONTACT_876068] a decline in the ability to learn that is associated with neuronal death. Well known hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2, 3] and extensive inflammation [4]. Currently, no treatment has been developed to fully cure or prevent the progression of dementia that is associated with AD.  In addition  to neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
hormone dysregulation, inflammation, mitotic dysfunction, calcium imbalance, and genetic risk factors are all involved in AD processes [5]. The disease is now re cognized as multifactorial and consequently strongly 
demands more effective treatments.  
 Therapeutic potentials of stem cells in several brain disorders are enticing researchers to apply stem cell based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ 6–9]. Among stem cells, adipose  tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (A MSCs), 
mesenchymal stem cells isolated from adipose tissue, are well known for their pluripotency and ability to differentiate into mesenchymal and non- mesenchymal lineages [10 ]. AMSCs are readily accessible and 
show high proliferation rates in vitro with lower senescence ratios than bone marrow derived mesenchymal 
stem cells [11 ]. Considering clinical applications, A MSCs are the most suitable source of stem cells due to 
the possibility of intravenous transplantation of autologous A MSCs with no immune rejections, ethical 
problems or tumorigenesis [12] and intravenous injection is the most convenient, simple and safest method 
of administration. 
 The paracrine effects  of stem cells, including the production of growth factors and anti -inflammatory 
cytokines and anti -apoptotic regulation, are strongly exerted and induce neural regeneration, remyelination 
and immunomodulation [13]. In a preclinical study, we demonstrated that intravenously injected stem cells  
could enter the brain through blood brain barrier and hASCs could have  beneficial effects in  a murine model 
of Alzheimer’s disease  [14]. Compared to placebo group, memory impairments , the number of amyloid 
plaques, protein level of Amyloid beta (Aβ) and Am yloid Precursor Protein (APP) were reduced after 
intravenous injection of hASC s in Tg2567 mouse brain. Furthermore , analysis  of Tg2576 mouse brain 
revealed that anti- inflammatory cytokine, IL -10 and neurotrophic factors including vascular endothelial 
growt h factor ( VEGF ), Glial cell- derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ), and Neurotrophin 3 ( NT3) were 
significantly increased after the injection of hASCs.  These findings suggest that a convenient and safe 
intravenous injection of hASCs might be very useful for the treatment of AD.     The clinical study of AstroStem aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AstroStem as a potential  
treatment for AD. B ased on the preclinical results, AstroStem  could be an effective treatment option with 
a mechanism of action that has not been explored for AD indication.

3.3 Removal of Subjects from Study  
 Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
• At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative 
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject’s well -being  
• At the specific request of the sponsor 
 
Also, subjects must be withdrawn for the following reasons: 
• A significant violation of the protocol, as determined by [CONTACT_103708] 
• Highly significant abnormalities in the laboratory results  (Highly significant abnormalities 
generally follow lab related exclusion criteria, but a PI [INVESTIGATOR_876059]) 
• Use of any other investigational drugs 
• Subjects enrolled in the current trial but taking any prohibited medication/therapy stated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Subject enrolled in the current trial but having a baby  
 
[INVESTIGATOR_72924] a subject prematurely withdraws from the study, the subject must return to the clinical site for 
the early  termination visit. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF ) and in the subject’s medical records. 
 
AST- ADP2-US01 
Version 6.0, Mar 4, [ADDRESS_1223799] will be maintained with subjects who are removed due to an adverse event (AE) until it 
has b een resolved or stabilized, and the information will be documented in the eCRF and in the 
subject’s medical records.  
 
3.4 Premature Termination of Study / Closure of Center  
 The sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the investigator/sponsor has the right to close 
a clinical site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultation between involved 
parties; the IRB must be informed in any case . Should the clinical site be closed prematurely, all 
study materials  (equipment, study medication, etc.) must be returned to the sponsor. 
 This study will discontinue  due to medical or administrative reasons such as:  
• Serious adverse events probably related to study drug administration so that the use of study drug may no l onger be justifiable  
• 2 or more deaths are observed during any point in the trial 
• Significant change of benefit -risk ratio for the subjects  
• Sponsor discontinues the investigation of AstroStem for the treatment of Alzheimer’s  
Disease or determines that the doses being studied are no longer justifiable  
 Possible reasons for closing of a clinical site include the following: 
• The investigator feels that the number or severity of adverse events is excessive 
• A change of technical, administrative, or personal circumstances occurs and the conduct of 
the study no longer meets ICH-GCP guidelines 
• In case of evident, significant non-compliance to protocol or poor data quality 
 3.5  Treatment  
 3.5.1 Treatment to be Administered  
 At Visit 2 (Week -4), a  subject, who is qualified  for this study, will be randomized to one of two

with the ITT population, this per -protocol (PP) cohort w ill also be evaluated for all efficacy 
variables.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population 
 
A safety population will include subjects who received at least one intravenous injection and  have 
post- injection safety measurements. This population will be evaluated for all safety variables.   
 6.1.[ADDRESS_1223815] will be performed using a 5% significance level. For the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, hypothesis tests will be performed individually at the 5% 
significance level. All hypothesis tests will be performed with two -sided alternative hypotheses. 
No adjustments on the significance level for multiple comparisons are planned, as this is a phase 
1/[ADDRESS_1223816] deviations, medians and 
ranges, overall and by [CONTACT_19313].  The change from Baseline ADAS -Cog sc ore will be analyzed with 
Student’s t- test  or Kruska l-Wallis test depending on the violation of normality assumption.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1223817] or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.  Fisher’s exact test will be used if the ex pected 
frequency in any of the cells of the crosstabulation is less than 5.   
 
Change from baseline at Week [ADDRESS_1223818] will be used.   
 
6.1.6 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
 Change from baseline scores at Visits 6, 9, 12, 13  and 14 or Early Termination  for: ADAS -Cog, 
MMSE , CDR -Box, NPI, GDS,  and ADCS -ADL will be  summarized with means, standard 
deviations, medians and ranges by [CONTACT_6982] .  Biomarkers in blood [Amyloid beta 
40, Amyloid beta 42, Amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD), soluble neuregulin-1 (sNRG -1)] will be summarized at all visits with means, standard deviations, medians and ranges 
for continuous variables and with counts and percentages for categorical variables.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  7. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
 
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is defined in the 21 CFR 312.32(a)  as “Adverse event means any untoward 
medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related .” 
 An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and  
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any 
use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout) after the drug administration  should be 
considered an adverse event if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 
 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from baseline values . Abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment 
in prior therapy are considered adverse events.  
 Adverse events will be reviewed continuously throughout the study. 
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction t hat in the view of either 
the investigator  or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE: it is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view 
of the investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function .  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
AST- ADP2-US01 
Version 6.0, Mar 4, 2019  Page 33  of 124  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  • Important medical events that may not result in death,  be life-threatening,  or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171763], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  
to prevent one of outcomes listed in the above definition 
 
Life threatening :  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” 
if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse ev ent or suspected adverse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Any adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876061] ‘serious’, UNLES S at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
• the admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 24 hours OR 
• the admission is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start 
of the study) OR 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477673] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as a SAE dependent on clinical 
judgment.    
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
Important medical event: As guidance for determination of important medical events see the 
‘WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical Terms List’ . These terms either see or might be 
indicative of a serious disease state.  Such reported events warrant special attention because of their 
possible association with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on other terms. 
 
7.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in Section 7.1) 
observed by [CONTACT_121355]’s medical records and reported on the eCRF.  
 
Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s file . A laboratory test abnormality 
considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations,  or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], 
should be reported as an adverse event . Each event should be described in detail along with subject 
identification, relationship to investigational product , start and stop dates, severity, action taken, 
and outcome.  
AST- ADP2-US01 
Version 6.0, Mar 4, [ADDRESS_1223822] be assigned by [CONTACT_093]:  adverse event 
diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event description (with 
detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severi ty; assessment of relatedness 
to study drug and action taken . The investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information, 
discharge summaries, and extracts from medical records or eCRFs.  
 If applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug  will be assessed by [CONTACT_121356]: “ Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_50464]?”  The investigator should respond to this question with either Yes or No.  
7.2.2 Adverse Event Severity  
 The severity of adverse events should be graded as follows: 
• Mild – Usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• Moderate – Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• Severe – Prevents normal activities  
 Medically significant adverse events considered related to the study drug by [CONTACT_121357].  
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is  
related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment or from the study . 
A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an 
intolerable adverse event . If either of these situations arises, the subject should be strongly 
encouraged to undergo an end-of- study assessment and be under medical supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1223823] immediately (within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness) be reported to the pe rson/parties as detailed in the  study file . A Serious 
Adverse Event form must also be completed within 1 day of the investigator’s awareness and 
forwarded to the designated person/parties as detailed in the study file . Each Serious Adverse 
Event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by  [CONTACT_121358]/parties.  
 Reporting of SAEs begins from the first administratio n of the study drug through within [ADDRESS_1223824] dose of study drug.  Events assessed by [CONTACT_876076] d rug (or 
AST- ADP2-US01

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  having an unknown relationship at the time of reporting) should be reported within [ADDRESS_1223825] dose of study drug.  Deaths  assessed b y the Investigator as related to study 
drug (or having an unknown relationship at the time of reporting) should be reported within [ADDRESS_1223826] and Regulatory Authorities.  
7.4 Procedures for Managing Microhemorrhages and Cerebral Vasogenic Edema  
 MRI scan will be performed at screening, Visit 9 (Week 12), Visit 13 (Week 30), Visit 14 (Week 
52), and/or Early Termination Visit. The protocols for MRI  scans should include  fluid -attenuation 
inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2- weighted gradient -recalled -echo (GRE) sequences. Standar ds 
for the detection of cerebral microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis will include: 2D T2 GRE; 
field strength of 1.5 Tesla or greater; slice thickness of 5mm or less; Echo Time (TE) of [ADDRESS_1223827] to the sponsor thirty days in advance of submission in order to obtain 
approval prior to submission of the final version for publication. This will be reviewed prompt ly 
and approval will not be withheld unreasonably . In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_121335](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution that satisfies both parties.  
 The investigator is encouraged to participate in the evaluation of the data for scientific purposes 
but is expected to work with the sponsor in the development of any scientific presentation or 
publication. Since the sponsor authors will be included, it is expected that al l co-authors of the 
manuscripts will have an opportunity for feedback in the content and conclusions . The technical 
and editorial resources of the sponsor will be available to assist in the development of abstracts, 
presentations, and publications regardin g this study and it is expected that drafts will be sent to the 
sponsor with adequate time for input and revisions prior to submission.

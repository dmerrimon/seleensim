Title of Study: A Phase 2 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel study to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of CBT-008 ophthalmic solution in patients with 
Meibomian Gland Dysfunction associated Dry Eye Disease (MGD-DED)  
Study Period:   
Study Initiation Date (First Subject Enrolled): 04 March 2022 
Study Completion Date (Last Subject Completed): 07 September 2022  
Phase of Development:  Phase 2 
Objectives:    
The study objective for Stage 1 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CBT-008 topi[INVESTIGATOR_20713]−associated dry eye disease (MGD-DED). 
 
The study objective for Stage 2 was to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of CBT-008 topi[INVESTIGATOR_20714] a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_20715] (MGD) or 
healthy patients. 
Methodology:    
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study with a 
4-week treatment period (Stage 1). The co-primary endpoints were measured at Week 4. Stage 2 used a 
2-day, single-center, randomized, open-label design to assess PK. Patients from a single center who 
completed Stage 1 participated in Stage 2 (unless more patients were needed, in which case healthy 
CBT-008 ADS Therapeutics Inc

Confidential volunteers could be enrolled). 
 
Stage 1: Randomized comparison of CBT-008 (2 concentrations) vs CBT-008 vehicle 
In Stage 1, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 treatment allocation to receive CBT-008 2.5%, CBT-008 
10%, or CBT-008 vehicle, with no stratification by [CONTACT_20720]/orsymptoms. One drop of 
study drug was self-administered in both eyes (OU) 3 times daily (TID) for 1 month, starting at the Day 1 
Visit, with additional visits at Weeks 1, 2, and 4. Efficacy was assessedby [CONTACT_3252]-primary endpoints – change 
from baseline at Week 4 in ocular discomfort score (ODS) and in cornea staining grade using the National 
Eye Institute (NEI) scale of 0 to 3. Additional efficacy variables were change in ocular discomfort as 
assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS), change in BLepharitIS Symptom (BLISS) score, change in 
meibum quality score (MQS), change in eyelid margin vascularity grade (EMVG), change in tear break-
up time (TBUT), and change in Schirmer I Test score. Safety was assessed by [CONTACT_20721] (AEs), best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated 
ophthalmoscopy, vital signs, urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential), and laboratory 
assessments. 
 
Stage 2: Pharmacokinetic analysis of CBT-[ADDRESS_19592] a 1-month waiting period after completion of Stage 1, patients from a single site 
enrolled in an optional PK substudy (healthy volunteers could have been used if not enough patients were 
enrolled). Patients were dosed by [CONTACT_20722] 1 drop of CBT-008 2.5% or CBT-008 10% 
in the study eye only. Blood was collected from these patients at pre-dose and at the following postdose 
time points: 15 ± 3 min, 30 ± 5 min, 1 hr ± 10 min, 2 hr ± 10 min, 4 hr ± 15 min, and 8 hr ± 30 min.

Statistical Methods:  
 
Stage 1 statistical methods: 
Continuous (quantitative) variable summaries included the number of patients (n) with non-missing 
values, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical (qualitative) 
CBT-008 ADS Therapeutics Inc 
 Page 6  
 
Confidential variable summaries included the frequency and percentage of patients who were in the particular 
category of each possible value. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests were conducted at the 0.05 significance level using 
2-tailed tests, and P values were reported. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals were presented for 
statistical tests, if applicable. 
The analyses and documentation described in this Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) were for the final 
analysis of the study. All statistical analyses were programmed using SAS® software version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]). 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, the planned sample size was determined empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]. To 
account for premature discontinuation, [ADDRESS_19599] 75 patients (25 per treatment group) would complete the study. It was anticipated that this 
sample size would be adequate to identify trends in the data. 
Stage 2 statistical methods: 
Prior to database lock, a detailed SAP was approved. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, etc.) were 
calculated for plasma CBT-008 concentrations for each treatment group. If applicable, plasma PK 
parameters were calculated. Parameters included Cmax, Tmax, and, if applicable, AUC0-8hr and t1/2. 
Duration of Study Follow-Up:  None

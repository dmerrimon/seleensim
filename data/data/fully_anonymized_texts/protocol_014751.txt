Study Title:  
Dose -Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Miconazole Oil Used for 7 or 14 Day 
Compared with Vehicle in the Treatment of Otomycosis  
Study Number:  HD-MCZ -PHII-DRF062016  
Study Center(s):  Up to 10 study centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 75 
Study Period: 
The study duration for each subject will be up to 30 days (up to 14 days of treatment, and 8 
days of follow -up, including the visit window of up to 8 additional days after the scheduled day 
to complete the final visit)  
Phase of Development:  2 
Objectives:  
• Obtain preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil compared with vehicle over a 14-day treatment duration 
• Descri ptively compare the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil over 7 versus 14 days  
Design and Methodology:  
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple-dose, parallel -group design study 
conducted at up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive miconazole oil [administered as 5 drops per ear at ~30 mg per drop instilled into the 
external ear canal of the ear(s) affected by [CONTACT_59170]] for [ADDRESS_138488] and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double-blind), but the treatment duration 
assigned to each subject (7 or 14 days) will be unmasked to both the subject and the 
investigator and study staff.  
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment 
of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of fungal elements, and pain), and an evaluation of medical history. Urine will be obtained for pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant 
medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and 
who meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study, and a subject global assessment of disease will be performed. Fungal and bacterial cultures of the affected ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned from the affected ear(s) following the site’s normal procedures. The subject will then begin treatment with study drug. The subject or caregiver will 
instill the first dose of study drug at the site, under the supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events (AEs) will then be assessed. The subject will then leave the clinic and continue to administer the study drug twice per day as instructed. Subjects will be 
instructed to avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by

help keep water out of the ear while bathing or showering. 
 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8. For subjects randomized to the 7-day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as 
described for that visit below. Subjects randomized to 7-day treatment will not administer study 
drug on Day 8. For all other subjects, for whom this visit will constitute an On Treatment Visit, a 
clinical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, a cleaning of the affected ear(s) (following the site’s normal procedures), and an assessment of 
AEs and concomitant medications will be performed, and these subjects will continue to 
administer the study drug twice per day, up through Day 14, following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15. For subjects randomized to the 7-day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the Test of Cu
re Visit, with procedures performed as described 
for the Test of Cure Visit below. For subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment duration, this 
visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as described for the 
End of Treatment Visit below. 
Subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment durations will return to the clinic on Day 22, for 
the Test of Cure Visit, with procedures performed as described for the Test of Cure Visit below.  
Procedures performed at the End of Treatment Visit will include an assessment for clinical 
signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and a fungal culture of the 
affected ear(s). For subjects randomized to the [ADDRESS_138489] the 
affected ear(s) cleaned according to the site’s normal procedures at this visit, after the efficacy 
procedures have been completed. AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all unused study drug. 
Procedures performed at the Test of Cure Visit will include an assessment of clinical signs and 
symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s). AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be 
performed in wome n of childbearing potential.

imputation will be made for missin g data.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with 
“therapeutic cure,” defined as a negative mycological culture plus “clinical cure.” Clinical cure is 
defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms according to the scales for each 
individual sign or symptom and with absence defined as a score of 0 on each of the scales for pruritus, debris, fungal elements, and pain.  
Other efficacy endpoints will include: 
• Percentage of subjects with clinical  cure at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure visit as well as 
individual sign or symptom score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus and debris and 
a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements and pain. 
• Percentage of subjects with individual signs or symptoms with a score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus and debris and a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements 
and pain.  
• Subject global assessments at Baseline and Test of Cure as well as categorical shifts in the subject global assessment scale scores from the Screening/Baseline to the Test of Cure 
Visit 
• If feasible, analyses may also be conducted by [CONTACT_123021]/Baseline.  
The primary population for all efficacy analyses will be the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) 
population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, dispensed study drug, and with a 
clinical diagnosis of otomycosis confirmed by a positive fungal culture.  
In cases of bilateral otomycosis, the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_123022], will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears are determined by [CONTACT_59186]/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy anal yses.  
The primary population for all safety analyses will be the safety population, defined as all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-
Baseline safety assessment.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Summaries will provide the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by [CONTACT_59222], each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_119117], system organ class, preferred 
term, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
All efficacy and safety analyses and comparisons between groups will be descriptive in nature, 
with no formal hypothesis testing performed.

Sample Size:  
The sample size for this stu dy is not based on statistical considerations and is instead intended 
to be a reasonable number of subjects upon which to gather preliminary information on the 
efficacy and safety of miconazole oil when administered via the otic route to subjects with 
otom ycosis.  
Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s) : 
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may result in imbalance between treatment groups. Therefore, 
at least one assessment during the conduct of the study is planned to ensure that there is  a 
sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least [ADDRESS_138492] been enrolled in the 7-Day active group, the number s of MITT subjects in the 
14-Day active group and the 14-Day vehicle group will be determined by [CONTACT_123023]; no persons involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. Randomization allocation for future subjects may be adj usted if deemed necessary to achieve 
minimum number of subjects  within each arm.

Page 13 of 64 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Brief Background Information 
Miconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent that has been available by [CONTACT_59181] (OTC) , in different formulations, for many years. It is commonly used for different types 
of fungal skin infections, such as Candida, ringworm, jock itch, athlete’s foot, nail fungus, vaginal yeast infections, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Formulations containing up to 4% miconazole nitrate have been app roved for OTC use as topi[INVESTIGATOR_59139], 
ointment, powder, or gel dosage forms. The 2% formulation is commonly used for dermatophytic infections. 
While antifungal agents including miconazole are used in practice for the treatment of fungal 
otitis externa (also called otomycosis), there are currently no treatments approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication in humans. Miconazole is 
currently FDA -approved as a component of two veterinary combinatio n products (Surolan and 
Easotic ) administered otically to dogs  for the treatment of canine otitis externa caused by 
[CONTACT_59183]. Each veterinary product contains miconazole in combination with an antibacterial agent and a corticosteroid. The concentration of miconazole present in Surolan (23 mg/mL miconazole nitrate) is similar to the 2% concentration of miconazole planned for use in humans in this study. The concentration of miconazole present in Easotic is 15.1 mg/mL miconazo le nitrate, which equates to approximately 1.5% miconazole. 
While the causative organism of canine otitis externa, Malassezia pachydermatis , is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_59140], it is expected that human otomycosis, which is most co mmonly associated with organisms from the Candida and Aspergillus  genera, would 
respond to concentrations of miconazole similar to those used in dogs. 
The mechanisms of action of miconazole when used topi[INVESTIGATOR_122999], rather than their human host. 
Miconazole targets the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme 14- α-sterol demethylase, an enzyme 
that is also involved in mammalian cholesterol synthesis, resulting in inhibition of ergoste rol 
biosynthesis in the cell membrane. Because ergosterol is an important component of the cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis inhibits fungal cell growth [Vandenbosch 2012]. In addition to its activity toward the enzyme 14- α-sterol demethylase, miconazole also leads to 
increased reactive oxygen species in  fungal organisms, which appears to result in fungicidal 
activity [Vandenbosch 2010; Musaji 2010]. 
The mechanisms of action of miconazole against fungi in general appear to be applicable to 
fungi as sociated with otomycosis, in that miconazole has been demonstrated to have activity 
against some clinical isolates of fungi associated with human otomycosis in the US in vitro  
[Bassiouny 1986; Stern  1988]. Clinical studies of 2% miconazole conducted outsid e of the 
[LOCATION_002] also suggest the efficacy of miconazole in the treatment of human otomycosis [Kiakojuri 2007; Vennewald 2010; Navaneethan 2015].  
The purpose of this study  is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of 2% 
miconazole oil after topi[INVESTIGATOR_59142]. A 14-day regimen of

oil will be compared with a 7-day regimen, to gather preliminary dose- ranging data regarding the 
duration of treatment. The 2% concentration of miconazole is selected  for this study due to the 
results of an internal study conducted by [CONTACT_123024] 2% concentration compared with the 1% 
concentration. Furthermore, the 2% miconazole concentration is commonly used for dermatophyte infections, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_123000] ≥1000- fold the minimum

1.[ADDRESS_138502] included systemic (int ravenous) routes, as well as a variety of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_123001] (dermatologic, intravaginal, and buccal).  
Miconazole has not been FDA -approved for otic administration for any indication in humans, but 
clinical stud ies in other countries  of otically -administered miconazole have been conducted and 
support the efficacy of miconazole in the treatment of otomycosis [ Kiakojuri 2007 ; Vennewald 
2010; Navaneethan 2015]. I n vitro  evidence exists of the susceptibility of clinical isolates from 
patients with otomycosis to miconazole, including one study of isolates from patients with otomycosis in the US [Bassiouny 1986; Stern 1988]. These results, along with the potential complications of untreated otomycosis, suggest a potential benefit to patients to study miconazole administered otically for the treatment of otomycosis.

in the Monistat 1 consumer information leaflet include burning, itching, irritation, swelling, hives, skin rash, abdominal pain, and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Other possib le local effects of 
miconazole which may provide benefit in otomycosis may include anti- inflammatory activity at 
the skin, and possible restoration of skin barrier function in some circumstances of skin injury [Xhauflaire -Uhoda 2006; Liebel 2006].

Page 15 of 64 Evidence supporting the safety of miconazole administered b y the otic route comes largely f r om 
nonclinica l studies. The possibility exists that micona zole could access the middle ear through 
the tympanic membrane, then diffuse through the round window membrane of the middle e ar to 
reach and  damage the cochlea. M iconazole appeared to b e non -ototoxic when ins ti lled a t a 2% 
concentration directly into the round window niche of guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_123004] 
a week [Tom 2000]. M iconazole oil, instilled at 1% and 2% concentrations to guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_123005] a period of 14 days in a nonclinical study conducted by [CONTACT_456], also generally 
failed to demonstrate ototoxicity, alt hough minor hair cell los s was observed in 1 animal in each 
of the 1% and 2% miconazole groups. B ilateral h earing loss , as assessed by  [CONTACT_123025] i n audi t ory 
brainstem r esponses, w as observed in al l animals in t he miconazole vehicle group  as well as in 
eac
h of the 1% and 2% miconazole groups, but not in the saline control group. T hese results 
suggest that the hearing loss was due to the miconazole oil vehicle, rather t han t he miconazole 
itself. Because this hearing  loss w as ge nerally no t assoc iated with ha ir cel l los s, it is believed t hat 
this he
aring  loss was caused by [CONTACT_123026] a rel atively la rge volume of  produc t in  a small 
animal (resulti ng in physical blockage of conduction), rather than actual damage to t he ear 
caused by  [CONTACT_123027]. R efer to the  Investigator’s B rochure  (IB) for 
miconazole oil [Investigator’s B rochure f or miconazole oil 2016] for more i nformation on the 
14-day study of miconazole oil in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. 
The bilateral hearing loss observed in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_123006] a 14- day treatment with miconazole oil 
and its vehicle is not expected to occur in humans at the doses and volumes of study drug 
planned for clinical use. The miconazole oil vehicle is almost identical to that of another product 
manufactured by [CONTACT_123028][INVESTIGATOR_123007] (DermOtic™, containing 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide and used for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis). No subjects randomized to the DermOtic group of the clinical studies reported hearing loss , and no post-marketing reports of hearing loss have been received since DermOtic ’s 
approval in 2005. 
The non-ototoxicity of the active ingredient, miconazole, is also supported in another species of 
animal by [CONTACT_123029] (Surolan, which contains 
approximately 2% miconazole, and Easotic, which contains approximately 1.5% miconazole) administered by [CONTACT_123030].  In the studies of Surolan in which hearing loss was assessed, 
hearing loss  was only reported in 3 of 161 dogs (1.9%) and with apparent reversibility in the [ADDRESS_138503] been demonstrated to be low after topi[INVESTIGATOR_123008], as has been reported for other miconazole-containing products such as the Vusion™ topi[INVESTIGATOR_123009]. Thus, although some potential systemic effects of miconazole have been reported and the liver has been identified in prior FDA miconazole product approvals to be the main toxicological target of systemic miconazole; these 
effects are generally not expected after topi[INVESTIGATOR_123010].

Page 16 of 64 1.3.2 Dose  
The 2% dose was selected for this study based on its widespread use in clinical practice in a 
variety of antifungal products already approved by [CONTACT_8415], and the larger zones of inhibition of 2% compared with 1% miconazole when incubated with two organisms commonly associated with otomycosis ( Candida albicans  and Aspergillus niger ) in a sponsor-conducted study in vitro . The 
use of [ADDRESS_138504] ( at ~30 mg per drop) is based on the estimated volume of the human 
external ear canal, and the amount believed to be needed to fully coat the canal. The 5 drops planned for this study is the same as that used for DermOtic in the treatment of chronic eczemat ous external otitis. It is noted that the dose regimen for Floxin™ otic solution (0.3% 
ofloxacin), an FDA-approved product for the treatment of bacterial otitis externa, is 10 drops in adults and children >13 years. Floxin is aqueous and may not adhere as well to the ear canal  as 
the oil- based miconazole oil. The twice- daily dosing was selected based on evidence that 
miconazole may not maintain bioactivity in the stratum corneum for a full 24 hours [Pershing 1994]. 
1.3.3 Inclusion of Subjects with Peanut Allergy 
Miconazole oil  contains refined peanut oil. Inclusion in this study of subjec ts with peanut allergy 
is justified by [CONTACT_59184], as well as 
products containing the refined peanut oil (such as Derm Otic, which is the same product as the 
Derma -Smoothe/FS for  which two safety studies were performed in subjects with known 
hypersensitivity to peanuts) [Yunginger 2001; Paller 2003]. Reports also exist of subjects with known peanut allergy who have continued to safely use products such as Derma- Smoothe/FS 
even after an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts [Paller 2003]. The refined peanut oil used in the Derma -Smoothe/FS, DermOtic, and miconazole oil products has been treated to remove the 
peanut proteins which are generally responsible for allergic reactions to peanuts. Thus, the inclusion of subjects with peanut allergy in this study is not expected to pose an excessive risk to these subjects.  
2 OBJECTIVES AND RATIO NALE  
The objectives of the study are to:  
• Obtain  preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil compared with 
vehicle over a 14-day treatment duration. 
• Descriptively compare the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil over treatment durations of 7  
versus 14 days.

Page 17 of 64 3 STUDY DESIGN 
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple- dose, parallel -group design study 
conducted at up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
miconazole oil [administered as 5 drops per ear at ~ 30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear 
canal of the ear(s) affected by [CONTACT_59170]] for 7  or 14 days, or vehicle for 14 days. I nterim 
assessment s are planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within each group 
for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be adjusted following 
the interim assessment s; see Section 10.5.[ADDRESS_138505] and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double-blind), but the treatment durat ion assigned to each subject (7 or 14 days) will be unmasked to both the subject 
and the investigator and study staff.  
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of fungal elements, and pain), and an evaluation of medical history . Urine will be obtaine d for 
pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and who 
meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study, and a subject global assessment of disease will be performed. Fungal and bacterial cultures of the affected ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned from the affected ear(s) following the site’s normal procedures. The subject will then begin treatment with study drug. The subject or caregiver will instill the first dose of study drug at the site, under the supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events ( AEs) will then be assessed. The subject will then leave the clinic and contin ue to 
administer the study drug twice per day as instructed. While in the study, s ubjects will be 
instructed to avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by [CONTACT_2329] a blow dryer, and to place a Vaseline-impregnated cotton ball over the affected ear(s) to help keep water out of the ear while bathing or showering. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8. For subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as 
described for that visit below. Subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment duration will not 
administer study drug on the day of this visit. For all other subjects, for whom this visit will constitute an On Treatment Visit, a clin ical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, 
a subject global assessment, a cleaning of the affected ear(s) (following the site’s normal procedures), and an assessment of AEs and concomitant medications will be performed, and these subjects wil l continue to administer the study drug twice per day, up through Day 14, 
following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15. For subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment  
duration, this visit will constitute the Test of Cure Visit, with procedures performed as described 
for the Test of Cure Visit below. For subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with pro cedures performed as described for th e

ear(s). For subjects randomized to the [ADDRESS_138507] the affected 
ear(s) cleaned according to the site’s normal procedures at this visit, after the efficacy procedures have been completed. AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all study drug.   
Procedures performed at the Test of Cure Visit will include an assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and  a fungal culture of the affected ear(s). 
AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of childbearing potential. 
Efficacy assessments will include fungal culture of the affected ear(s), assessmen ts of clinical 
signs and symptoms of otomycosis, and a subject global assessment. In cases of bilateral 
otomycosis, both ears will be treated and evaluated by [CONTACT_093], but the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as assessed by [CONTACT_123031], will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears are determined by [CONTACT_59186]/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy analyses. 
Safety assessments will include AEs.  
3.1 Number of Subjects 
Approximately 75 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled in order to achieve approximately 
10 subjects per group (randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 7-day active, 14-day active, and 14-day 
vehicle treatment groups) with a positive fungal culture at baseline and who have completed the 
Test of Cure Visit .

all study drug. 
Due to the time required to obtain fungal culture results from Screening/Baseline, subjects will 
be enrolled into the study based on a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis (including the visible 
presence of fungal elements at  Screening/Base line), without a requirement for a positive fungal 
culture. Subjects who end up with a negative Screening/B aseline  fungal culture will not be 
discontinued from the study, but these subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis. Because the sponsor’s goal is to obtain approximately 10 subjects per group who meet both criteria of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of Cure Visit, the number of subjects enrolled into the study may be adjusted depending on the rates of negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and of discontinuation or loss to follow-up. 
Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the applicable electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced, but additional subjects 
may be enrolled and randomized if it appears that approximately 75 subjects is insufficient to meet the sponsor’s goal of approximately 10 subjects per group who meet both criteria of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of Cure Visit.

Page 29 of 64 7 STUDY PROCEDURES 
The required study procedures are detailed in this section. The timeline for these procedures is 
presented in Section 6. 
7.1 Medical/Medication History  
At Screening/Baseline, the investigator or designee will interview each subject and obtain a 
complete medical  and medication history, including a history of all surgeries and past medical 
procedures. The subject must not require any treatment or medication for concurrent illnesses as specified by [CONTACT_123034]. 
7.2 Physical Examination 
At Screening/Baseline, the investigator or designee will perform a complete physical 
examination to include the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, throat; neck; 
cardiovascular; lungs; abdomen; lymph nodes; extremities; neurological; skin; and musculoskeletal . 
7.[ADDRESS_138523] (performed in females of childbearing potential only) must have a minimum sensitivity of 25  mIU of β -hCG/mL of urine. 
7.4 Otomycosis Signs and Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of otomycosis will be assessed according to the scales for pruritus (see Section 7.4.1), debris (see Section 7.4.2), presence of fungal elements (see Section 7.4.3), and pain (see Section 7.4.4). The same evaluator should assess each subject for signs and symptoms 
of otomycosis at each visit throughout the subject’s participation in the study, if possible. 
7.4.1 Pruritus 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Assessment 
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be handed a 
questionnaire for each ear being treated with study drug and asked to indicate the choice that 
most closely reflects the severity of itching  in the ear  over t he last 24 hours. Choices and scores 
will be according to the following scale:  
Score  Category  Description  
0 None No itching 
1 Mild  Occasional itch, not interfering with daily activities  
2 Moderate  Fairly persistent itch, partially tolerated; sleep is not interrupted 
3 Severe  Intolerable, constant itch; sleep is interrupted  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 30 of 64 [IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Assessment  
After subjects have completed the questionnaire described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], subjects or their 
caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) about the severity of itching present in each ear being treated  with study drug. 
Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this assessment: 
“Have you had itching in your ear over the last day or so?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching interfered with your daily activities?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching been bad enough to keep you awake?” “Over the last 24 hours, would you describe your itching as intolerable or constant?” 
The investigator will then score the symptom of pruritus for each ear being treated with study 
drug, taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the investigator’s observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the same scale as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
7.4.2 Debris 
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will score the amount of debris present in each ear 
being treated with study drug. Scores will be  according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 None No debris present 
1 Scant  Debris minimally present, but with no notable occlusion of external ear 
canal  
2 Moderate  Debris present with partial occlusion of external ear canal; tympanic 
membrane can be visualized  
3 Heavy  Complete occlusion of ear canal; tympanic membrane cannot be visualized  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 31 of 64 7.4.3 Presence of Fungal Elements 
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will assess the presence of fungal elements in each 
ear being treated with study drug. Scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 Absent No fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope 
1 Present  Fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope, such as 
visualization of white filaments in debris; black, gray, bluish, yellow, 
or white discharge; white debris with hyphae; or moist white plugs with black debris; or other observations that in the investigator’s judgment are indicative of the presence of fungus 
7.4.4 Pain  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked by [CONTACT_1275] (or designee) whether pain is present in each ear being treated with study drug. Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this assessment: 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your ear hurt?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your pain been constant?” “Over the last 24 hours, would you characterize your pain as more dull or sharp ?” 
“Over the last [ADDRESS_138524] you had pain when your earlobe or the front part of your ear is 
touched?” 
“Over the last [ADDRESS_138525] you felt pain inside your ear?” “Over the last [ADDRESS_138526] you felt pain on the outside of your ear?” 
The investigator will then score the symptom of pain for each ear being treated with study drug, 
taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the investigator’s observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 Absent No pain 
1 Present  Pain present, easily tolerated to intolerable  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version [ADDRESS_138527] Global Assessment  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked to 
choose among the following three options to assess the overall level of discomfort in each ear being treated with study drug. Subjects or their caregivers will be handed a questionnaire for 
each ear being treated with study drug and asked to indicate the choice that most closely reflects 
the subject's situation  with the ear. Choices and scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
[ADDRESS_138528] some of my normal activities  
7.6 Microbial Culture 
At designated visits, the investigator or designee will obtain a sample from the external ear to be sent to a laboratory for microbial culture  (for both fungi and bacteria at the Screening/Baseline 
visit and for fungi only at the End of Treatment and Test of Cure visits). Techniques for obtaining and handling the sample and sending it to the laboratory will be described in a separate laboratory manual. If both ears will be treated with study drug, both ears will be cultured. 
7.7 Ear Cleaning 
At designated visit s, the investigator or designee will clean the ear(s) that are being/have been 
treated with study drug, according to the site’s normal procedures. Ear(s) being treated will be 
cleaned  at the designated visits even if they appear clear of debris . In cases i n which the 
investigator would normally not clean the ear because it appears to be clear, this cleaning may  be 
minimal . All ear cleaning will be documented in the e CRF.

designee and to  the IRB immediately.  Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to 
the requirements of the governing IRB. 
All changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_59205], submitted to the FDA, and approved by [CONTACT_123036]. New or 
altered consent forms required by [CONTACT_59206] a protocol revision must be signed by [CONTACT_123037].

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational or marketed study drug, whether or not considered re lated to the 
investigational or marketed study drug . AEs include any illness, sign, or symptom that has 
appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug . Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator 
product. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before signing the informed consent form are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after the informed consent form is signed.  
AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a 
subject. At each examination or visit, study personnel will ask each subject the following question, “Have you had any problems since we last spoke?” If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_138531] medical occurrence occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threate ning (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment may jeopardize the patient/subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to : allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasia or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that has 
not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE. 
8.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_123038]:  
• Mild: Awareness of event, but easily tolerated and does not disrupt usual  activity  
• Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual  activity  
• Severe:  Incapacitating, with inability to perform usual activities  
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_38237]: 
• Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
• Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect 
relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.”  
If the relat ionship between the AE and the study drug is determined by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor to be 
“suspected,” the event will be considered to be related to the study drug for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.

8.4.[ADDRESS_138533] of Cure Visit will be reported. Additionally, any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study drug and discovered by [CONTACT_123039]. Each of these SAEs must be reported to the sponsor’s designee within [ADDRESS_138534] complete the SAE form. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports 
are required. Follow-up information (e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s 
chart and a copy (with the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified only by [CONTACT_18022]) will be sent by [CONTACT_123040] . In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report (with 
the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified only by [CONTACT_18022]) should be sent to the medical monitor. 
As required  and after the sponsor’s review and determination of causality , the sponsor and/or 
designee will notify investigators of all AEs that are serious, unexpected, and considered by [CONTACT_59213] a suspected  relationship to the study drug . This notification will be in the 
form of an update to the Investigator’s Brochure (i.e., “15- day letter ”). An AE, whether serious 
or non- serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported in the clinical safety 
section of the Investigator’s Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity.  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator’s Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Follow-up reports should be submitted when requested or when pertinent information becomes available.

[CONTACT_59240], Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version [ADDRESS_138544] the same degree of infection at Screening/Baseline, the left ear will b e 
used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy analyses.  
10.5.2 Safety Analyses 
Safety summar ies will be conducted using the safety population (see Section 10.4.4) . All AEs 
occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on  or after the date of first study drug application, 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . Summaries  will provide the number of subjects 
reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
When summarizing TEAEs by [CONTACT_59222], each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the 
greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be 
summariz ed by [CONTACT_119117], system organ class, preferred term, 
severity, and relationship to study drug. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_123042] a verbatim description of the event as reported by [CONTACT_093], as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and relationshi p to 
the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of subjects who report an SAE.

10.5.5 Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s)  
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may r esult in imbalance between treatment groups. Therefore, at 
least one assessment during the conduct of the study is planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least [ADDRESS_138546] been enrolled in the 7-Day active group, the numbers of MITT subjects in the 14- Day 
active group and the 14-Day vehicle group will be determined by [CONTACT_89813]; no persons involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. Randomization allocation for future subjects may be adjusted if deemed necessary to achieve minimum number of subjects within each arm.

3 Study Design 
….. 
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and subjects 
will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of fungal elements, and pain), and an evaluation of adverse events (AEs).  medical history. Urine will be obtained fo r pregnancy 
screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant medications will be 
reported.  Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and who meet all other eligibility 
criteria will be entered into the study, and a subject global assessment of disease will be performed.  A 
culture Fungal and bacterial cultures of the affected ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned 
from the affected ear(s) following the site’s normal procedures…… 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8. For subjects randomized to the 7-day treatment duration, 
this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as described for that visit below. Subjects randomized to the 7 -day treatment duration will not  administer study drug 
on the day of this visit. ….

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: 1) 7-day treatment with miconazole 
oil; 2) 14 -day treatment with miconazole oil; or 3) 14- day treatment with miconazole oil vehicle. 
Interim assessments are planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within 
each group for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be 
adjusted following the interim assessment s; see Section 10.5.[ADDRESS_138586] (LOCF) method.estimated by [CONTACT_71874] (MCMC). The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot

estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing Therapeutic Cure values in each data set will be filled in using the 
MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The resulting data set for each 
treatment group will be combined into 1  complete data set for each imputation.

If multiple imputation is impaired due to not sufficient missing data to allow for multiple imputation to 
be performed, multiple imputation may be performed on the computed endpoint rather than the 
individual efficacy assessments. If multiple imputation is still not possible, other sensitivity methods 
may be used such as imputing failure for any missing Therapeut ic Cure determinations.  
 
Section 10.5.5 Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s)  
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may result in imbalance between treatment groups . Therefore, at 
least one assessment during the conduct of the study is  planned to ensure that there is  a sufficient 
number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least [ADDRESS_138588] been enrolled in the 7 -Day active group,  the number s of MITT subjects in the 14 -Day active 
group and the 14 -Day vehicle group will be determined by [CONTACT_89813]; no persons 
involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. R andomization allocation  for 
future subjects may be adjusted if deemed necessary to achieve minimum number of subjects  
within each arm.  
Full details will be provided in the SAP.

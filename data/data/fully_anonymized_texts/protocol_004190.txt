Title of Study:  
A Phase 3, Double- Blind, Randomized, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
and Safety of TNX-102 SL Taken Daily at Bedtime in Patients with Fibromyalgia (Protocol No. TNX-
CY-F306) 
Study center(s):  30 to 4 0 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  (US)  
Estimated Studied period: [ADDRESS_89966] patient enrolled:  Aug  [ADDRESS_89967] patient completed: Oct 2021 
 Phase of development: 3  
Objectives:  
 
Primary  
To evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) 5.6 mg in the treatment  
of patients with fibromyalgia.  
Secondary  
To evaluate the safety of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) 5.6 mg in the treatment 
of patie nts with fibromyalgia.  
 Methodology:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, double- blind, placebo -controlled, 14-week study designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) taken daily at bedtime for 
the treatment  of fibromyalgia.  The study is to be conducted at approximately 30-[ADDRESS_89968] of a Screening V isit (Visit 1, Days −35 to −8), a washout and screening period of at 
least 7 days (for those patients not requiring washout) and no more than 35 days, inclusive of a 7-day 
baseline data collection phase immediately preceding the Baseline visit.  For extenuating circumstances, 
the duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval.  
Note , this trial is being initiated  during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the exceptional 
circumstances caused by t he COVID-19 pandemic, we are providing an option f or a remote ( telephone) 
visit for Weeks 2, 6, 10 (Visit 3, 4, 5), and , only with Medical Monitor approval, Week 14/Visit 6  (or 
Early T ermination)  for those unable to attend an in- clinic visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In cases in 
which it is feasible for a site’s own research staff , with  or without a research clinician , to make a home 
visit for Week 14 /Visit 6 (or E arly T ermination ), a home visit should be conducted rather than a telephone 
visit in order to collect greater safety data  than the telephone visits allow . The Screening phase will be 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 5 of 92  followed by [CONTACT_82516]/Randomization Visit (Visit 2, Day 1), and 4 treatment visits at Weeks 2, 6, 10, 
and 14 (or E arly Termination).  The total duration of the study, including Screening, will be 
approximately 15-[ADDRESS_89969] study assessments performed at 
Screening and will stop all excluded medications during the washout period through the Week 14 visit 
(Visit 6) .  Patients will record their average pain intensity for the previous [ADDRESS_89970] 7 day s, patients will return to the investigative site for Baseline assessments and randomization 
(Day 1), where they will be randomly assigned to receive TNX-102 SL or matching placebo sublingual 
tablets in a 1:1 ratio . 
 Patients will take the study drug sublingually daily at bedtime, starting on the day that they are randomized (Day 1), for [ADDRESS_89971] two weeks of treatment, patients will start on TNX -102 
SL 2.8 mg (1 tablet) or placebo. Upon return to the site
1 for the Week 2 visit (Visit 3), al l patients will 
have the dose increased to TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or two placebo tablets.  Patients will 
return to the site1 for assessment of efficacy and safety, as well as dose tolerability , at Weeks 6, 10, and 14 
(or E arly T ermination) . 
 In scenarios in which TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or 2 placebo tablets,  is considered intolerable  due to adverse 
event(s) and would otherwise lead to study discontinuation, with Medical Monitor approval , the 
Investigator may lower the dose back to 1 tablet every  night ( TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg  or one placebo tablet) .  
Re-challenge with 2 tablets TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg  (5.6 mg dose) /placebo may be attempted at a  later date 
if/when it is deemed clinically  warranted  by [CONTACT_737] , or the patient may remain on the lower dose 
for the remainder of the study.  
 
Patients who wish to withdraw from the study may do so at any time. 
 
Patients will be trained on use of the diary system and will be asked to complete a brief online training a t 
each study visit starting from the Screening visit.  Each evening, when the patient utilizes the diary, the 
system will prompt the patient regarding daily average pain intensity, sleep quality from the previous 
night, and study drug dosing the previous n ight (post-randomization). 
 At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should be 
discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_82472].  This down titration and discontinuation of excluded medications  must be accomplished so 
that the patient is medication -free for at least 21 days prior to randomization.  This will provide 14 days 
off the excluded medication before the patient starts the 7 -day run-in phase during which critical baseline 
daily diary efficacy data are collected.  Any additional time required for down-titration would be in addition to this 21-day washout requirement.  For this reason, patients can remain in screening for up to 35 days, which provides an additional 2 weeks for down-titration, if required. 
 
Number of patients (planned):  
Approximately 670 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with TNX-102 SL or placebo 
tablets.  Randomized patients who withdraw will not be replaced.  
 
1 All references to a site/study center  visit for Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14 include telephone visits for Weeks 2, 6, and 10, 
and home visit or telephone visit for Week 14/ET that are being allowed due to the circumstances of the COVID- 19 
pandemic.

Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Name: [CONTACT_82594], route, frequency: For Days 1-14, 1 tablet of placebo taken sublingually (under the tongue ) each day 
at bedtime. For Days 15-98, 2 tablets of placebo taken simultaneously and sublingually each day at bedtime.  
 
Treatment Regimens:  
Patients will take 1  tablet of randomly assigned study drug sublingually at bedtime starting on Day 1 for 2 
weeks; then patient will take 2 tablets of assigned study drug simultaneously and sublingually starting on 
Day 15 for 12 weeks. If necessary, a drink of water is recommended prior to dosing for patients with a dry

seconds) and not to crush or chew the tablets.  Patients should not eat, drink or chew gum for at least [ADDRESS_89980] 5 minutes after dosing.  
 
In scenarios in which the dose of 2 tablets ( 5.6 mg) is considered intolerable and would otherwise lead to 
study discontinuation, with Medical Monitor approval the Investigator may lower the dose back to 1 tablet 
(2.8 mg) per day.  Re -challenge with 2 tablets (5.6 mg) may be attempted at a later date if/when deemed 
clinically  warranted  by [CONTACT_737] .

Concomitant Medications:  
Patients who are taking certain medications to manage their FM are eligible for the study if they are 
willing and able, and it is medically reasonable, for them to be withdrawn from these medications prior to 
randomization and then refrain from usage during this study.  The specific medications that must be 
withdrawn include milnacipran, pregabalin, duloxetine, tramadol, tapentadol, gabapentin and other 
anticonvulsants (aside from those used as migraine prophylaxis), any form of cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, 
or generic equivalents), amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone, narcotics/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
naltrexone (including CONTRAVE®) and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. 
 Due to the exclusion of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (including tramadol and tapentadol) during the treatment phase  of the 
study, patients requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_39938] a regular or frequent basis for any indication should not be considered.  In addition, patients who are taking gabapentin, pregabalin or any other anticonvulsant due to neuropathic pain should not be considered. 
 
Other prescription or over- the-counter medication not specifically excluded by [CONTACT_82520], provided that the patient has been on this medication for at least 30 days at a stable dose (except for allowed antidepressan ts, which require 90 days at stable dose) prior to the date of 
randomization , and usage is expected to remain stable throughout the study. 
 
In addition, certain other medications will also be prohibited and may require washout, or exclusion of the 
patient if washout is not appropriate (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], levomilnacipran, nefazodone, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_34900], stimulants, sodium oxybate, ketamine, etc.).  Patient s 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.[ADDRESS_89981] agree to 
discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their study participation. 
 
After randomization, sedating antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) can be used as needed 
for insomnia ; however, patients must be able to discontinue them during the screening phase and must 
refrain from their use during the week of baseline data collection preceding V isit 2.  The use of sedating 
anti-histamines after randomization should always be  under the  direction of the Investigator, and such use 
should be minimized to no more than a few  nights in a row, followed by [CONTACT_82521].   
 
The use of melatonin, ramelteon, and valerian root is not restricted.    
 
New medications that are deemed required, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_82478], will be allowed, including medications needed to treat adverse events.  If there is a requirement for acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], corticosteroids , or other treatments that could confound the evaluation of pain at critical 
times (defined as the week prior to Clinic Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6), the Investigator may consult with the 
Medical Monitor to potentially delay the study visit until the medication is no longer needed.  At a 
minimum, no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/narcotic should have been utilized within [ADDRESS_89982] been no usage during the 7 days prior to any visit since important efficacy data will be collected 
on the diary during the week leading up to each clinic visit.   
   
 
Statistical methods:  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The pr imary efficacy parameter will be the contrast between TNX -102 SL and placebo in the weekly 
mean change from baseline pain score at the endpoint visit.  The weekly pain score will be based on the 
weekly average of the daily diary patient self -reported 24-hour recall average pain severity scores using 
an 11-point (0-10) NRS.   
 
The primary ITT analysis will provide the following causal estimand  for the primary analysis:  the 
difference in the weekly mean change from Baseline of the daily patient self -reported 24- hour recall 
average pain severity rating using an 11- point (0-10) NRS evaluated at the Week 14 endpoint in all 
randomized patients attr ibutable to the initially randomized treatment assignment.  The primary analysis 
will use a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM ) approach with multiple imputation for missing 
data.  Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical effects of trea tment, center, study week, 
and treatment by [CONTACT_82522], as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score by [CONTACT_82522].
  Please see the separate S tatistical A nalysis P lan (SAP)  for more 
details on the primary and secondary analyses .  
 
Safety Analyses: 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_82523].  Adverse e vents will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_11762].  Serious AEs, AEs involving the oral cavity and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized.  Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory  test results and vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  The number of patients with baseline and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior or self-injurious behavior, based on the C- SSRS, will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 
Sample Size:  
The study is planned to enroll approximately 670 patients total in a 1:1 randomization ; that is, 335

completion will start on the evening of Visit 1 and continue through Week 1 4.  Diary responses will be monitored during the study.  
i The study drug will be dispensed to patients at Baseline on Day 1 (following randomization) and at Weeks [ADDRESS_89983] 24 hours every evening using an 11- point (0 -10) numerical rating scale.  Patients should be instructed 
to complete  their diary responses in the evening, but before taking their bedtime dose of study drug.  The 24- hour recall interval will assess  the previous night’s 
sleep and symptoms of pain since bedtime the previous night.

other than oral numbness, tingling or noticeable taste (eg, bitter, metallic, or unpleasant) after dosing which do not require unscheduled examinations.  
*/o The blood draw for the pharmacogenomic assessment can be obtained at any study visit post -Screening (including an Early Termination visit).  D ue to 
circumstances caused by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic and possibility of no further in -clinic visits after Baseline visit (Visit 2), it is strongly recommended that the 
pharmacogenomics blood sample be o btained at the Baseline visit (Visit 2).  It should only be obtained one time during the study.  Separate written, signed 
informed consent is required if the patient is to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic assessment.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 31 of 92  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel -group, double-blind, placebo -controlled, 14-week study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) taken 
daily at bedtime for the treatment  of fibromyalgia.  The study is to be conducted at 
approximately 30-[ADDRESS_89996] of a Screening V isit (Visit 1, Days -35 to -8), a Baseline/Randomization 
Visit (Visit 2, Day 1),  a Week 2 Visit (where the dose will be increased to 5.6 mg/day), and 3 
more treatment visits (Weeks 6, 10 and 14 or Early Termination).  The period between the 
Screening and Bas eline Visit wills be at least [ADDRESS_89997] one week of 
daily pain data collection, and up to 35 days, to accommodate any necessary scheduling 
challenges or prohibited medication washout time. For extenuating circumstances, the duration of the Screening period may be increased to up to 49 days with Medical Monitor approval, and 
an option for a telephone visit will be available for Weeks 2, 6, and 10 for those unable to attend 
an in -clinic visit due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic. Additionally , a Week 
14/ET telephone visit or home visit by [CONTACT_82528] a case-by- case basis , 
approved by [CONTACT_941] M edical Monitor, if the only other choice is losing the patient completely from 
the study if patient absolutely cannot come in  to the clinic  for the visit.  The total duration of the 
study, including Screening, will be approximately 15-[ADDRESS_89998] study assessments performed at 
Screening and will stop all excluded medications during the washout period, as required, through 
the Week 14 visit (Visit 6). An in -clinic 7- day recall NRS average daily pain intensity score at 
Screening must be ≥ 4 and ≤ [ADDRESS_89999] their average daily pain intensity on the 11-point (0-10) NRS scale using 24-hour recall, and to provide an assessment of sleep quality from the previous evening, also using an 11-point 
NRS scale. Each evening, when the patient completes the diary, the system will prompt the 
patient regarding daily average pain intensity, sleep quality from the previous night, and study drug dosing (post-randomization). Due to limitations in the diary completion window, patients 
that are planning on international travel during the study period should not be considered for the 
study.  Patients whose employment involves overnight shifts also should not be considered for the study due to the restricted completion window and the requirement for consistent bedtime dosing.   
After completing any required washout of excluded therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see next paragraph) and recording 
Baseline Diary scores for at least 7 days, patients will return to the investigative site for Baseline 
assessment s and randomization (Day 1, Visit 2), where they will be randomly assigned to receive 
TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or matching placebo sublingual tablets in a 1:1 ratio. 
The mean of the 7 days immediately preceding Visit 2 (Baseline Randomization  Visit; Day 1) 
will serve as the baseline pre- treatment pain score.  
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 32 of 92  At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should 
be discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_82481].  This down titration and withdrawal must be accomplished so that the patient is medication -free for at least 21 days prior to randomization.  This will provide 14 days 
off the excluded medication before the patient starts the 7-day run-in phase during which critical baseline efficacy data are collected  by [CONTACT_82529].  Any additional time required for 
gradual dose reduction/ down -titration would be in addition to this 21-day washout requirement.  
For this reason, patients can remain in screening for up to 35 days, which provides an additional 2 weeks for down- titration , if required.  
Patients will take the study drug sublingually daily at bedtime, starting in the evening of the day 
that they are randomized (Day 1, Visit 2), for 14 weeks.  Patients will be instructed to take one 
tablet (2.8 mg) sublingually daily  at bedtime for the first 2 weeks (Days 1 -14). Patients will then  
return to the clinic
1 at Week 2 (Visit 3) for efficacy and safety assessments, assessment of s tudy 
drug compliance, and the study drug dose will be increased to two tablets (2 x 2.8 mg ) taken 
sublingually and simultaneously daily at bedtime. Patients will next return to the clinic1 at Week 
6 (Visit 4) for efficacy and safety assessments, assessment of study drug compliance, and an 
assessment of dose tolerability at the 5.6 mg dose.  If the patient reports intolerable side effects at 
this visit (Visit 4), the Investigator may consider a reduction in dose to one tablet sublingua lly 
every night (with Medical Monitor approval), either temporarily or for the remainder of the 
study, depending on what the Investigator considers clinically appropriate. It will be emphasized 
to Investigators that such dosage reduction should only be considered when the patient’s 
intolerability is sufficient to cause the patient to consider discontinuing from the study. It will be 
emphasized to participating patients that they should only make changes in study drug dose upon 
consultation with the Investig ator, and they should notify the clinic immediately if they think the 
dosage needs to be adjusted. Ideally, any changes in dose should only be made at a scheduled 
visit, but, if necessary to change dose between visits, the change should only be made upon t he 
recommendation of the Investigator after discussion between the patient and the Investigator.  
Patients will return to the study center1 for safety and efficacy assessments, and assessments of 
study drug compliance and tolerability at Weeks 10 (Visit 5), and 14 (Visit 6) or E arly 
Termination.  
An interim analysis will be performed to assess whether the study should be halted for 
overwhelming efficacy, stopped for futility, or the sample size should be increased; see S ection 
13.6.  In the case of an early stop (for either efficacy or futility), all ongoing patients  will be 
asked to return to the clinic and complete an early termination visit, and the study will be halted once all patients  have completed their termination visit.  
 
Patients who wish to withdraw from the study may do so at any time.  
The study timeline and events schedule is provided in Table 2.

9.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Patients who are taking ce rtain medications to manage their FM are eligible for the study if they 
are willing and able (and it is medically reasonable  for them ) to be withdrawn from those 
medications that are specifically excluded by [CONTACT_82532].  The specific medications  that must be withdrawn  include milnacipran, 
pregabalin, duloxetine, tramadol, gabapentin, any form of cyclobenzaprine (AMRIX®, 
FEXMID® or generic cyclobenzaprine), t apentadol, amitriptyline and other tricyclic 
antidepressants,  trazodone, narcotics/opi[INVESTIGATOR_82485] (including CONTRAVE®).  In 
addition, certain other medications are prohibited and may require washout, or exclusion of 
patients for whom washout is not appropriate (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], anticonvulsants (except 
when used as migraine prophylaxis), levomilnacipran, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nefazodone, St. John’s wort, phentermine, diethylproprion, muscle relaxants (e.g., methocarbamol, baclofen, carisoprodol), 
and systemic use of  strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors as defined in Appendix 1 (i.e., topi[INVESTIGATOR_82486]). 
All patients undergoing washout must complete a 3- week drug -free interval prior to the 
Baseline/Randomization visit (Visit 2); this will provide two weeks of washout prior to the [ADDRESS_90006] return to the clinic for a repeat UDS before they begin their 7- day baseline 
data collection period leading up to V isit 2.   
In general, patients utilizing benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s on a chronic or regular basis should not be 
considered for the study; however, washout may be considered for those patients utilizing them 
only on an occasional or as-needed basis  (e.g, three times per week or less, on average).

colle ction period prior to V2.  All other repeat urine drug screens can be conducted on- site.   All 
repeat UDS results must be confirmed negative before the patient can be randomized.   
Patients using non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82490] (e.g., zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], zaleplon) on a 
chronic, nightly basis should not be enrolled; however, patients utilizing these medications on an infrequent or occasional basis only (e.g., three times per week or less, on average) may be considered.  Similar to the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], drugs in this class of medication can negatively 
impact sleep architecture; therefore, patients utilizing either non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82491].   Patients washing off non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82492]-free through their 7- day baseline data collection

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 41 of 92  After randomization, sedating antihistamines (e .g., diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) may  be used 
as needed for insomnia; however, patients will need to refrain from their use during the week of 
baseline data collection leading up to V isit 2.  Patients should track their use of sedating 
antihistamines in  between study visits so that changes in usage during the course of the study can 
be tracked and recorded.   
The use of melatonin, ramelteon, and valerian root is not restricted.  Similarly, the use of 
cannabidiol (CBD) products is not restricted, but like all other allowed concomitant medications, 
its usage should have been stable for at least 30 days prior to randomization, and usage should 
remain stable during the study.  Additionally, the use of CBD products should not be started after randomization.  All CBD products should be added to the concomitant medication source and case report form (CRF).  
Due to the exclusion of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_82494] T reatment Phase of the study, patients requiring 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_39938] a regular or frequent basis for any indication should not be considered.  In addition, 
patients with neuropathic pain in addition to fibromyalgia should not be washed off of 
gabapentin, pregabalin or any other anticonvulsant, and therefore should not be considered for the study. 
At Screening Visit 1 and after signing the written informed consent, any required washout should 
be discussed with the patient and plans made for an appropriate schedule for reducing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_82472].  This down titration and withdrawal must be accomplished so that the 
patient is medication free for at least [ADDRESS_90007] 30 days at a stable dose (except for allowed antidepressants, which require 
90 days at stable dose)  from the date of randomization, and usage is expected to remain stable 
throughout the study.  Allowed medications include , but are not limited to, hormonal therapy 
(contraceptives and replacement therapy), anti -hypertensive agents, lipid-lowering medications, 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor s (SSRI ) and other allowed antidepressants (e.g., 
venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], vilazodone).   
Acetaminophen (up to 3000 mg/day) and  non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may 
be continued in a stable fashion for osteoarthritis  or other allowed indications (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_82495]), or used as needed for other sources of acute, minor pain.  Note that 
acetaminophen and NSAIDs may be taken either on a regular basis, or on an as-needed (prn) 
basis; however, if used as-needed, the Investigator should ascertain the patient’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_82496] (e.g., average dosage and frequency per defined time interval) so that this information 
can be recorded on the CRF.  Any significant change in the patient’s usage of any medication, 
including those taken only as needed, should result in an update to the CRF.  The CRF entry for any prn medication is expected to include an estimation of the patient’s average dosage and 
frequency per defined time interval.

Final Version 1.[ADDRESS_90008] occurred during the 90 days leading 
up to randomization, and no changes are antic ipated or planned during the treatment phase of the 
study.  In addition, FM patients with comorbid depression who are being treated with duloxetine, 
milnacipran, levomilnacipran, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants should 
in general not be considered for the study since washout of these agents could destabi lize their 
psychiatric status.  
NOTE: Participating patients receiving treatment with antidepressants should be cautioned about the possibility of serotonin syndrome, which has been reported in patients receiving cyclobenzaprine with SSRIs, serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] ( SNRI ) and related 
agents. This will be included in the ICF. 
New medications that are deemed required, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_82478], will be allowed, including medications needed to treat adverse events.  After 
randomization, if there is a requirement for treatment with an acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_82497] (defined as the week prior to Visits  3, 4, 5 or 6), the Investigator may consult with the Medical Monitor to potentially delay 
the study visit until the medication is no longer needed.  At a minimum, no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/narcotic 
should have been utilized within [ADDRESS_90009] consequences on the patient’s data.  
Similarly, if there is a requirement for acute , short- term opi[INVESTIGATOR_82498], 
the start of the 7-day run-in phase should be delayed to ensure at least [ADDRESS_90010] 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_82499] 7-day run-in phase.  In other words, there may be some 
circumstances when the unexpected requirement for short-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444], specifically due to an acute  medical, dental or surgical condition, does not require the full 21-day washout.  This 
provision only applies to acute  pain conditions – not to opi[INVESTIGATOR_82500] a flare in patient’s 
FM or other chronic pain condition.  Any requirement for acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_82501] M edical Monitor to ensure adequate

Patients should refrain from drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit during the study due to its ability to inhibit CYP 3A4 activity.  Aside from this restriction, there are no other food or fluid 
restrictions in this stud y except for the instructions pertaining to dosing ( Section  10.2).  
Patient s using teeth-whitening products such as whitening strips or prescription whitening 
products must agree to discontinue their use from the day of randomization until the end of their study participation. 
Any concomitant medications or other treatments must be recorded in the patient’s medical 
record and case report f orm along with the dose and dates of treatment. 
 
9.2. Cannabis /THC  Use 
 
Patient s utilizing cannabis /THC  are to be excluded if MINI 7.0.2 criteria are met for greater than

otherwise allowed, with  caution .  The screening drug screen will also test for THC to provide the 
investigator with information regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is disclosed and 
taken into consideration when conducting MINI Module J.    
9.3. Enrollment of Patients  
Before undergoing any study-related screening procedures, each potential patient must provide 
written informed consent.  The Investigator will then determine the potential patient’s suitability 
for the study by [CONTACT_82533]-protocol screening assessments.  If excluded medications  are to be withdrawn for the explicit purpose of participation in this 
study, the patient must have already provided consent and signed  an informed consent form

10.1. Study Drug Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study drug supplies will be packaged identically so as to  maintain the integrity of the study 
blind.  The study drug bottles will be labeled minimally with the following information:  study 
number TNX- CY-F306, sponsor name [CONTACT_3816], bottle number, quantity, storage conditions, 
usage instructions, and caution statements for investigational new drug, i.e., Caution: New Drug 
– Limited by [CONTACT_36974], and Keep Out of Reach of Children and Pets.   
Each study drug bottle will contain 40 tablets.  One bottle will be dispensed to each patie nt at 
Visit 2 (Baseline) and then two bottles will be dispensed at Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 
6), and Visit 5 (Week 10).  Study drug will be mailed via courier to a patient’s home where a 
telephone visit is scheduled to be conducted. This will provide the patient with enough tablets to 
cover the 2 or 4 weeks of dosing between visits, plus additional tablets to cover loss and/or visit 
window variability.  The patient should be instructed to take all the tablets in one bottle before 
opening the second bottle.   The patient should be instructed to keep this study drug in a safe 
location out of extreme environmental conditions and out of the reach of children and pets, and 
be instructed that this drug is not to be taken by [CONTACT_82534].   Each 
patient will also be instructed that they are expected to return both bottles (even if empty) and all 
unused study drug at each clinic visit
1; unused drug will be counted to assess compliance with 
study drug treatment.  
Storage of the study drug at the investigational site should be under locked and secure conditions 
with limited staff access.   Study drug should be stored at 20-25°C/68-77°F in a 
temperature/humidity -monitored room; however, brief excursions (15-30°C/59-86°F) as defined 
in the Study Reference Manual (Investigational Product Receipt and Storage) are permitted without the sponsor’s approval. 
 
10.2. Dosing Instructions  
Patients will be instructed to take 1 tablet of randomly assigned study drug TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or SL placebo tablet sublingually, under the tongue, each evening at bedtime starting at bedtime on Day 1 (Day of Visit 2) and continuing through Day 14. At  the Week 2 visit, patients will be 
instructed to increase the dose to 2 tablets at bedtime, adminis tered simultaneously and under the 
tongue beginning on Day 15 and continuing through the end of the study.    
The study drug should be taken at bedtime after teeth brushing and other oral care has been 
completed.  The mouth/sublingual area should be moist at the time of dosing, so the patient 
should drink a few sips of water prior to dosing, especially if prone to dry mouth.  Patients will be instructed to place the one or two SL tablets under their tongue (if two, placed simultaneously 
under tongue) and keep them there until they have dissolved (approximately 90 seconds).  They 
should not swallow, crush or chew the tablets.  Patients should not eat or drink (or chew gum) for at least 15 minutes after dosing, and preferably not to drink any hot, cold or acidic beverage until

All patients will be expected to bring their bottle s of study drug with them to all study visits  
(including empty bottles), unless a telephone visit, where patie nts will be asked to count the 
number of tablets remaining in their  current bottles, document this on a form provided to patient, 
and return this form and study drug (with bottles) via courier to the site .  At each study visit, the 
site staff will inspect the drug bottle s, and perform a count of the tablets remaining in the bottles 
and document this in the patient’s record.  For telephone visits, drug accountability by [CONTACT_82535].  For home visits  (Week 14 
or ET only) , site staff will collect bottles and conduct accountability upon return to the site . An 
assessment of drug adherence should be done by [CONTACT_82536]. Patients will be asked for 
an explanation if the count of returned study drug tablets indicates a discrepancy between the 
expected number of tablets dosed and the number returned in the bottles. If it is found that the patient is not taking the study drug as expected, the patient will be re-counseled with 
instructions, and this should be noted in the patients’ records. A deviation should be recorded on 
any patient who is less than 70% compliant with dosing between visits and one of the Medical Monitors should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].    
Tonix or its  designee will perform drug accountability which entails reconciliation between the 
amount of drug shipped to the study site, study drug assigned and dispensed to the patient 
(including returned unused assigned study drug), and study supplies that were never dispensed and/or assigned to patients.

The first study visit, Screening Visit 1, will be where the stu dy is thoroughly explained to the 
prospective study patient, where written informed consent will be obtained and documented, and 
where certain protocol -specified study procedures and assessments will be completed.  Screening 
Visit 1 will start a variable length screening period.  The length of the screening period is to be 
no shorter than 7 days (since the “run-in” period during which baseline diary data are collected 
must be at least 7 days in duration), but may be as long as [ADDRESS_90012] been successfully completed and initial eligibility has been confirmed, then the 
patient may begin the 7-day run-in period as soon as the screening visit has been completed.  Yet, d ue to potential delays in the issuance of a final laboratory report (e.g. when a confirmatory 
analysis is required , typi[INVESTIGATOR_82502] a urine drug screen analyte that is preliminarily positive) , it is 
recommended that the Baselin e Visit is scheduled at least 10 days from the Screening Visit. If 
the patient needs to complete medication wash -out prior to the start of the run-in period, the 
down titration schedule for the patient and the date on which the patient should start the run-in period should be provided in writing to the patient.  It is acceptable if another clinic visit is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_82537] -in period (and should be recorded 
as an unscheduled visit).  It is important to remember th at any patient with a positive urine drug 
screen (for a drug requiring washout) must return to the site for a repeat UDS prior to beginning 
their [ADDRESS_90013] be 
centrally analyzed; all others may be performed on site.  Patients who test positive for cannabis/ THC at the screening visit but are deemed eligible to continue are not required to 
undergo repeat UDS testing.

The following screening assessments/procedures will be completed in the following general order:  
• Obtain written informed consent to participate  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Demographics 
• Medical history  
• Confir mation that patient satisfies the 2016 Revisions to the 2010/2011 fibromyalgia 
diagnostic criteria  (2010 American College of Rheumatology provisional diagnostic 
criteria /2011 self-report modification for survey and clinical research) 
• Prior medication history  
• Lifetime fibromyalgia pharmacotherapy history  
• NRS assessment of 7- day recall of average daily pain . Patients should only continue

5 ideation during the preceding 6 months or any suicidal behavior during the preceding 12 months should be screen failed. 
a. Results of the C- SSRS and BDI -II should be reviewed together at each visit to 
ensure (1) the patient  is not experiencing suicidal ideation or worsening 
depression that requires intervention and (2) both scales are providing a consistent 
clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_82503].  
• Physical examination, including vital signs, height, weight and BMI . Patients with

patient w ill be authorized to continue in the study, will undergo several baseline assessments at 
this visit, and will be randomized via the randomization system to receive double-blind study drug. 
If the patient does not satisfy randomization criteria, the patient has failed to qualify for this 
study and should be considered a screen failure, with the reason documented.  There is no 
requirement for a follow-up vi sit for screen failures.

immediately preceding Visit 2; and  
b. No more than 2 individual days with a score <4 on the 7 days immediately preceding 
Visit 2; and  
c. No score of [ADDRESS_90015] qualified for randomization, these assessments and procedures will be 
completed in the following general order: 
• Confirm patient’s eligibility based on the diary data collected during the preceding 7 days   
• Review completed diary data with the patient 
• Update medical history (with any changes noted since screening)  
• Assess chan ges in medication history and concomitant medications 
• Have the patient complete the BDI -II.  If the BDI score is >24, the patient is not 
eligible for randomization and should be screen failed.  In addition, a score > 1 on item #9 (suicidal ideation) is exclusionary. 
• Administer the “Since Last Visit” version of the C- SSRS.  Any patient exhibiting 
Type 3, 4, or 5 suicidal ideation or any suicidal behavior since the Screening visit should be screen -failed and assessed for appropriate follow- up care.  
a. Results of the C- SSRS and BDI -II should be reviewed together to ensure (1) the 
patient is not experiencing suicidal ideation or worsening depression that requires intervention and (2) both scales are providing a consistent clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_82503].

• Receive an appointment for Visit 3.  
• The patient should be instructed to call the site if they develop a lesion under the 
tongue or any other localized AE in the oral cavity thought potentially related to study 
drug exposure,  specifically to determine if  an unscheduled visit for an oral cavity 
examination is necessary prior  to the next scheduled visit.  Reports of oral numbness, 
tingling or noticeable taste (e .g., bitter, metallic , unpleasant ) after dosing do not 
require unscheduled examinations.

In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, patients have the right to withdraw from t he 
study at any time for any reason, and they will be advised of this right.  The Investigator and 
Tonix also have the right to remove patients from the study.  Specific reasons for removal of a 
patient from the study could include, but are not limited to: 
• An AE  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator or T onix, might invalidate the 
study data or place the patient at risk  
• The request of the patient, Investigator, or Tonix, whether for administrative or other reasons - including halt of the study for efficacy or futility  at the interim analysis  
• Pregnancy  
Patients who wish to terminate their participation in the study should be instructed to come to the 
clinic for an Early Termination Visit.  The purpose of the Early Termination visit is to obtain 
critical information about the patient’s participation and should be scheduled preferably before there has been a substantial lapse in study drug usage.  However, even if there has been a drug 
lapse, the patient should be encouraged to return to the clinic for this visit and should be 
instructed to return all study drug and bottles.  NOTE:  These visit procedures are not intended for patients who fail to qualify for randomization or for patients who withdraw from the study prior to receipt of a dose of double-blind study drug. 
The following assessments and procedures are completed at this visit as ordered below: 
• Document reason for early termination

• Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, and  
• Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months; and  
• WPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] ≥7 and SSS score ≥5; OR WPI [INVESTIGATOR_82473] 4-6 and SSS scor e ≥9 
• The patient does not have another disorder that would otherwise explain his/her pain. 
The [ADDRESS_90022] either a history of or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g., significant arrhythmias or heart block , left bundle 
branch block (LBBB), heart failure, symptomatic  coronary artery disease,  myocardial infarction  
within the preceding 2 years ) or a QTcF at Screening >[ADDRESS_90023] ECG 
parameters including rhythm, heart rate, and intervals for RR, QT, PR, QRS, and QTcF 
(Fridericia’s correction) will be recorded.  
If the Investigator has any concerns about the e ligibility of a patient or wishes to confirm his/her 
assessment, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor for this study. 
12.2. Efficacy Assessments 
The primary efficacy endpoint and many of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints in this study are derived from subjective patient- completed assessments.  Therefore, it is critical 
that these assessments are conducted in the specified order, according to specific instructions, and in a setting where the patient has minimal distractions and sufficient time to complete them.  After completion of these assessments, the study coordinator should review the responses for completeness with the patient.  
12.2.1. Daily 24- hour pain recall using 11 -point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  
Patients will provide a nume ric assessment of their pain (24 -hour recall), via the diary, using an 
11-point (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain) NRS scale.  Patients will be asked to complete 
this assessment on a daily basis starting from the Screening Visit and throughout the double-

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 61 of 92  blind treatment period.  Additional information regarding the patient diary is provided in 
Section  12.2.6. 
12.2.2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
The PGIC is a FM -specific validated instrument to gauge the patient’s assessment of change in 
condition.  This form will be completed by [CONTACT_82549] 3, 4, 5 and 6.  The patient will answer a single question:  
Since the start of the study, overall my fibromyalgia is: 
1 = Very much improved 
2 = Much improved 3 = Minimally improved  
4 = No change 5 = Minimally worse  
6 = Much worse 7 = Very much worse  
12.2.3. Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - Revised (FIQR)  
The patient’s total score on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (revised version) will be 
assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and  6.  The FIQR is made up of 3 domains: functional (9 questions), 
overall  impact  (2 questions) and symptoms (10 questions). 
12.2.4. Clinic Assessment of Pain (24 -hour and weekly recall)  
In addition to the diary  assessments of 24 -hour pain recall ( Section  12.2.1), patients will be asked 
to rate their average pain on paper using the 11-point (0- 10) NRS scale at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
using both a 24-hour and 7- day recall interval.  There is no requirement to reconcile the pain 
responses obtained from these paper assessments to the 24 -hour daily diary assessments.  
12.2.5. PROMIS Scales  
PROMIS is the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
(www.nihpromis.org), an NIH -funded initiative to develop instruments to be used across chronic 
conditions. 
Two PROMIS Scales will be assessed in this study, including the sleep disturbance scale 
(version 8a) and the fatigue scale (version 8a).  Each of these two  scales will be assessed at 
Visits 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_90024] difficulty completing the diary . 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 62 of 92   
The diary should be started the evening of Visit 1 and completed daily until Visit 6 (Week 14). 
Patients should be instructed to complete the diary in the evening before  dosing. Once the pati ent 
has properly identified themselves, the diary will prompt answers to the following: 
• Rate your average pain during the past [ADDRESS_90025] possible pain. 
• Rate your sleep quality last night on a scale from [ADDRESS_90026] possible sleep. 
After randomization to study drug at Visit 2, the following questions will be added  to the daily 
diary (starting in the evening of the day after randomization, Day 2):  
• Did you take your study drug last night? (Yes/No)  
• If yes, how many tablets of study drug did you take last night? (1 tablet/2 tablets) 
 
The study staff will be expected to monitor patient adherence in completing the diary throughout 
the study, and will be instructed to call the patient should any problems or significant non-
adherence be observed.  During the screening period, there are dia ry compliance requirements 
that must be met in order for the patient to qualify for randomization.  Patients who have been 
randomized should be encouraged to continue to complete their diary.  Patients will receive a 
reminder to c omplete their diary if the y miss diary entries .  Patients who miss two diary entries  
will be flagged by [CONTACT_82550], and site staff will be alerted to contact [CONTACT_82551] -training 
and to instruct the patient on the importance of routine completion of their diary. 
12.2.7. Assessment of Changes in Sexual Function: Changes in Sexual Functioning 
Questionnaire Short -Form (CSFQ -14) 
The CSFQ -14 ( Keller et al. 2006 ) is validated scale with internal reliability designed to allow a 
patient to self -evaluate his or her sexual behaviors or problems in a number of areas.  The CSFQ-
14 will be administered at Baseline (Visit 2) and Week 14/ET (Visit 6).  It yields a total score, 
three subscales corresponding to phases of the sexual response cycle (i.e. desire, arousal, orgasm), and five subscales corresponding to important dimensions of sexual functioning.  It is 
considered a useful scale for assessing sexual side effects of medications.  For all items, higher 
scores reflect higher sexual functioning.  For 12 of the 14 items, higher sexual functioning corresponds to greater frequency or enjoyment/pleasure (e.g. 1=never to 5 = every day).  For two 
items (item 10, assessing loss of interest after arousal for women and priapi[INVESTIGATOR_82508], and item 
14, assessing painful orgasm), higher sexual functioning corresponds to lower frequency (e.g. 1=every day; 5=never). Items 10 and 14 are included in the total score but not in any subscale scores.  
12.3. Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_76606], vital signs, responses on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, responses on the BDI- II, and by [CONTACT_82552], including visual inspection of the oral cavity.

12.3.1. Adverse Events  
Patients will be monitored for AEs throughout the study.  Any clinically significant abnormal 
findings at screening should be recorded in medical history.  Adverse Events will be recorded 
after the informed consent is signed.  AEs that are spontaneously reported or elicited or observed are to be recorded on the CRF with the date, time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, 
seriousness, causality (relationship to study drug), actions required, and outcome.  Additional 
questions will be triggered for AEs involving the oral cavity.   
To elicit AEs, non-leading, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the study.  Examples of these questions can be: 
• How have you felt since your l ast visit?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last visit? 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as deemed appropriate.  
If an AE is unresolved on the last day of the study, an effort should be made to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the patient is lost to follow -up, or there is some other resolution 
of the event. 
There are many symptoms associated with fibromyalgia that can vary in intensity and frequency 
over time.  Only symptoms that worsen or become more frequent, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_82509], should be reported as adverse events. 
Additional information regarding definition and reporting requirements for adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and pregnancies is provided in Section  14. 
12.3.2. Oral Adverse Events  
Patients should contact [CONTACT_82553] a lesi on under 
the tongue or any other AE thought to be due to study drug exposure (other than transient numbness, tingling or bitter/metallic/unpleasant taste after dosing),  specifically to determine 
whether an unscheduled visit is necessary prior to the next scheduled visit.  If the patient does not call the site to discuss the oral cavity adverse event, the oral cavity exam should be performed at the next regularly scheduled visit and any findings noted.  If a telephone visit, the 
patient  should be queried  if there have been any changes or problems in the oral cavity. Patients 
reporting any concerning lesion description or painful processes in the oral cavity possibly 
related to study drug exposure should be strongly urged to come into the clinic for an 
unscheduled visit for an oral cavity exam . This exam must be performed by a qualified licensed 
medical professional who has been specifically trained and certified by [CONTACT_82554].  In circumstances in which, due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_90027] the patient by [CONTACT_82543], potentially augmented with images of oral

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 64 of 92  12.3.3. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II) 
The BDI -II is a 21 -item measure of the severity of current depressive symptoms, extensively 
validated for use in both medical and mental health populations.  While this instrument does not 
provide a psychiatric diagnosis of depression, it does provide a continuous scale for measuring the severity of depressive symptomatology.  Scoring allows for the identification of mild, 
moderate, and severe levels of depressive symptoms, and for the quantification of change in 
status over ti me. 
The patient will be asked to complete this questionnaire at all in -clinic study visits , and for all 
telephone visits.  The BDI -II will be  sent by [CONTACT_82556] . 
At Visit 1 and Visit 2, patients whose responses are indicative of suicidal ideation, as defined by a response to Item #9 of >1, will be excluded from participation, and appropriate intervention 
prescribed.  In addition, patients whose total BDI score is > 24 at either Visit 1 or Visit 2 will not 
be eligible  for randomization and should be screen failed (and referred for appropriate 
psychological evaluation or care, if indicated).  After Visit 1, the responses to Question #9 
should be monitored to ensure that there is no increase in suicidal ideation during the study (and 
to assess correlation with C -SSRS findings) and the total score also followed to ensure the 
patient’s psychological status remains stable. 
12.3.4. Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_82557].  This scale is intended to be used by [CONTACT_82558].  The questions contained in the Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes.  Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. 
Two versions of this questionnaire will be utilized in this study.  At Visit 1, the 
“Baseline/ Screeni ng” questionnaire will be administered , and the recall periods will be “lifetime” 
and “within the past 6 months” for suicidal ideation and “within the past 1 year” for suicidal 
behavior. Patients whose responses are indicative of suicidal ideation with intent and/or plan 
(e.g., Type 3, 4 or 5 suicidal ideation) within the past [ADDRESS_90028] year will be excluded from participation, with recommended referral for appropriate intervention. 
At all subsequent visits ( Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), the “Since Last Visit” version of the 
questionnaire will be administered, and the recall period on this will be “since the last visit”.  
Note that if there has been appropriate intervention should be prescribed. 
12.3.5. Physical Examinati on and Vital Signs  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1.  The complete physical 
examination may exclude rectal, genitourinary, and breast examinations. 
Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and heart rate, temperature, and weight) wil l be assessed at 
Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (unless a telephone visit , in which case vital signs will not be assessed at 
Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6/ET) .  Height will be measured without shoes at Visit 1 only.  The BMI will 
be a derived variable, based  on height and weight entries (but a Week 14/ET weight will not be 
assessed , if approved by [CONTACT_82559] a telephone visit) .

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 65 of 92  12.3.6. Visual Examination  of the Oral Cavity 
A thorough examination (visual plus palpation) of the oral cavity will be completed at Visit 1, 
with visual examinations performed at each subsequent study visit (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6/ ET). 
Visual exam of the oral cavity will not be performed if  it is a t elephone visit. This examination 
should include a careful visual examination of the sublingual area, tongue, buccal mucosa, lips, palate and gums, aided with a tongue depressor, as well as palpation of the lips, hard palate, and 
floor of the mouth.  
Each examination must be performed by a qualified medical professional who has been 
specifically trained and certified by [CONTACT_82560] .  An oral cavity  
examination may also be required at an unscheduled visit if a patient reports an oral AE t hat 
requires follow-up prior to the next scheduled visit. 
 
12.3.7. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be performed in this trial are listed in Table 3.  Those 
marked as screening tests will be performed at Screening only.  All other tests will be performed at Screening Visit 1 and at Visit 6 (Week 14) or Early Termination, aside from urine pregnancy tests and ad hoc urine drug screens.  
With the exception of the urine pregnancy test or an ad hoc urine drug screen, all clinical 
laboratory evaluations will be analyzed via a central clinical laboratory, and information 
regarding appropriate sample volume, collection tubes, sample labeling and handling, and 
shipment will be provided in the clinical laboratory manual. 
As per exclusion criterion #14, any patient with evidence during the preceding year of drug or 
alcohol use disorder by [CONTACT_82561].   
A centrally analyzed urine drug screen (UDS) will be performed at Visit 1.  If the patient has a 
positive drug screen at Visit 1 due to a drug of abuse (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy) or due to a non-disclosed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], amphetamine or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], then he/she should be screen failed.   As discussed in Section 9.2, patients utilizing cannabis /THC  are to be excluded if MINI 
criteria are met for  greater than MILD Cannabis  Use Disorder during the preceding 12 months, 
OR if the investigator is concerned that the patient’s use of cannabis/THC  could interfere with 
patient ’s ability to provide reliable data or comply with the protocol.  Otherwise, patients 
utilizing cannabis or THC products are allowed, w ith caution .   
 The screening drug screen will test for THC to provide the investigator with information regarding exposure, and to ensure that all usage is disclosed and taken into consideration when conducting MINI Module J. Repeat testing of THC  is not necessary for patien ts testing positive 
for cannabis/THC at screening . 
Any patient deemed appropriate for washout of a prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82510] a repeat UDS before the beginning of their [ADDRESS_90029] be sent to the central laboratory for analysis, hence results may be delayed; 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.[ADDRESS_90030] be confirmed negative prior to randomization.   
Patients with a positive screening UDS due to an allowed prescription drug (e.g., headache 
remedies containing butalbital) do not require further drug screening.   
Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality 
should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely 
to resolve.  If such abnormalities do not return to normal within a reasonable period, their 
etiology should be identified and Tonix or designee should be notified.  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values after the Screening visit labs will be recorded as AEs . 
 
NOTE:  A screening TSH level greater than 1.[ADDRESS_90031] level > 2 times the upper limit of normal, is exclusionary; however, the patient may 
remain in screening to undergo repeat LFT assessments if a transient  abnormality (eg, viral illness; 
effects of a medication being discontinued, etc) is thought to be responsible for their initial elevation.    Table 3: Clinical Laboratory Assessments

that the pharmacogenomics blood sample be obtained at the Baseline vi sit (Visit 2). The purpose 
of this testing is to allow exome sequencing and analysis for genetic variants related to treatment response to TNX-[ADDRESS_90033] the patient’s eligibility for the main study. Patients have 
the right to stop participating at any time during the study or during the time of sample storage, 
and, if a patient decides to withdraw from the pharmacogenomics portion of this study, any remaining sample will be destroyed and not used for further research.  Data c ollected before a 
patient’s withdrawal from the pharmacogenomics portion of this study will remain in the research database and included in the sponsor’s analyses and reports.

13.4.1. Efficacy Endpoints  
 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
• Change from Baseline to the Week 14  endpoint in the diary NRS weekly average of 
daily self -reported average pain severity scores.  
 
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 The six  secondary efficacy endpoints listed below are considered key secondary endpoints 
and will be tested in that order: 
• Proportion of patients with a PGIC rating of “very much improved” or “much improved” at the Week 14  endpoint  
• Change from baseline in the FIQR symptoms domain score at the Week 14  endpoint 
• Change from baseline in the FIQR function domain score at the Week 14 endpoint

13.4.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy parameter will be the contrast between active and placebo in the weekly mean change from baseline pain score at the Week 14 endpoint.   The weekly pain score will be based on the weekly average of the da ily patient self -reported 24- hour recall average pain 
severity scores using an 11-point (0-10) NRS.   
The primary ITT analysis will provide an estimate of the following causal estimand for the 
primary analysis:  the difference in the weekly mean change fro m Baseline of the daily patient 
self-reported 24-hour recall average pain severity rating using an 11-point (0-10) NRS evaluated 
at the Week 14 endpoint in all randomized patients attributable to the initially randomized treatment assignment.  
The primary analysis will use a MMRM approach with multiple imputation for missing data.  Covariates in the model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, center, study week , and treatment by [CONTACT_82522], as well as the continuous fixed cova riates of 
baseline score and baseline score by [CONTACT_82522].  Please see the separate SAP for more details on the primary and secondary analyses. 
13.4.3. Sensitivity Analyses 
The primary analysis will be followed by [CONTACT_82562].  The SAP will include full 
details of the sensitivity analyses planned for this study. 
13.4.4. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population only.  For PGIC, patients with a 
“very much improved” or “much improved” response at the Week 14 endpoint will be 
considered responders. Patients with results in any other category or who discontinue early will 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 71 of 92  be considered non-responders.  PGIC responder status (yes/no) will be analysed using logistic 
regression with treatment and site  as categorical effects.  In addition, odds ratios and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
Analysis of continuous secondary endpoints and adjustments for missing data will be described in detail in the SAP.  Significance tests of treatment differences will be tested at the two -sided 
0.05 level and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
To adjust for multiplicity and to control for overall type I error, a sequential test procedure will be applied to the efficacy endpoi nts.  If the primary analysis produces a result that is statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level, a significance level of 0.05 will be used for comparing the secondary 
endpoints in an ordered fashion.  If the analysis for a secondary endpoint does not produce a 
statistically significant result at the 0.05 level, then the remaining secondary endpoint analyses 
will automatically be considered non -significant regardless of the p-value produced. The order in 
which the secondary endpoints are to be tested wil l be specified in the SAP.  
No other adjustments for multiplicity will be made and other p -values displayed in the output 
will be considered for descriptive summary purposes only and will not be used for formal inference.  Full details regarding the statistical analyses for the listed endpoints, including 
graphical presentations, can be found in the SAP.  
13.4.5. Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population.  Details on exploratory efficacy analyses can be found in the SAP. 
13.5. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population.  The analysis of safety assessments in this study will include summaries of the following safety and tolerability data collected for each patient:  
• Incidence of Adverse Events  
• Changes from baseline in c linical laboratory tests  
• Changes from baseline in vital signs 
• Changes from baseline in physical examination findings including examination of the oral cavity  
• Monitoring suicidality using the C- SSRS  
• Changes from baseline in BDI -II scores  
All AEs, treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAE ), and serious adverse events ( SAE ) will be 
coded using the MedDRA . 
An AE summary table will be presented for the following: 
 
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs  by [CONTACT_82563]. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL

Each patient will be counted only once within each summation level (SOC; preferred term).  If a 
patient experiences more than one TEAE within each summation level, the TEAE with the 
strongest relationship or the maximum severity, as appropriate, will be included in the summaries of relat ionship and severity. 
In the AE data listings, all AEs w ill be displayed. 
Laboratory data include analytes for Chemistry and Hematology, and these will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_82567].  Descriptive summaries of actual values and 
changes from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_82568]- treatment assessment for each 
clinical laboratory analyte and each treatment  group.  95% confidence intervals will be presented 
for change from baseline.  
Laboratory values will be displayed in the data listings with their corresponding normal ranges, and those values that are outside the normal range will be flagged.  For each laboratory analyte, 
shifts in assessments of abnormality from baseline to each scheduled time point will be presented 
in shift tables.  
A by -patient listing of all clinical laboratory data will also be provided.  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from baseline at each assessment time point and last on -treatment assessment will be 
calculated for vital signs including weight, BMI, body temperature, pulse rate, systolic blood 
pressure and diastolic blood pressure. 95% confidence intervals will be presented for change 
from baseline.  
Based on the C- SSRS results, the overall number of patients with lifetime and/or current suicidal 
ideation (by [CONTACT_82569]), suicidal behavior (by [CONTACT_82569]), or s elf-injurious 
behavior at the screening and baseline visit will be summarized by [CONTACT_3232].  Additionally, the overall number of patients with any suicidal ideation or behavior (by [CONTACT_82570]) or self -injurious behavior while on- treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Patients will only be counted once for on- treatment at the worst- case response for each item.  
Physical examination data and oral examination data will be presented in data listings.  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD , median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 74 of 92  14. DEFINITIONS, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
14.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
According to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidance E2A, Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administe red a pharmaceutical 
product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
A TEAE is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study treatment or was present 
prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study 
treatment.  
14.2. Adverse Event Recording  
14.2.1. Coding the Adverse Event  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  MedDRA® will be used as the 
standard coding dictionary for AEs and in describing the patient’s medical history, and the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to code concomitant 
medications.  Informal descriptions should be avoided. 
14.2.2. Severity of Adverse Event  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions. 
• Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a 
medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moder ate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe: Ev ents interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious “and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severi ty) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, maybe of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcom e or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Protocol No. TNX- CY-F306  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 75 of 92  14.2.3. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following 
descriptions. 
• Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the study 
drug beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; 
and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
event and the administration of study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered 
biologically implausible.  
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that could reasonably be considered 
caused by [CONTACT_6615], and where there is no known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from  administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
14.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal 
laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) so that T onix may comply with regulatory obligations.  If the SAE is life -threatening or fatal, it 
must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) immediately, by [CONTACT_82572].  For these 
and all other SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed and sent by [CONTACT_82573](s) within 1 working day of the site’s initial awareness of the event.  These requirements apply equally to all patients, regardless of the study phase or the at- risk patient’s 
treatment assignment or dosage. 
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untow ard medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening, 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth def ect, or  
• Is an important medical event 
 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

eliminate an apparent hazard to patients do not require preapproval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB.  However, the EC/IRB must be notified, in writing, as soon as possible after the modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to Tonix. 
15.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time at the discretion of Tonix, its designee, or the P rincipal Investigator.  Should premature termination be considered necessary, written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided, and specific 
procedures for termination will be arranged.  Circumstances that may warrant premature study 
termination include, but are not limited to, the following. 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data 
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug 
• Either halting the study for success or futility from the results of the interim analysis  
In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, all study materials must be returned to Tonix or its designee.

Final Version 1.[ADDRESS_90038] of the Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and amendments and clarifications adopted by 
[CONTACT_82575].  The I nvestigator will make sure that the study described in this 
protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the protocol, current FDA 
regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 
guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act, US applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any EC requirements relative to clinical studies. As required by [CONTACT_55257], the study drug may not be shipped to any participa ting Investigator until the requisite study documentation has been submitted to the IND. 
Should a conflict arise, the Investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the greater protection to the individual patient.  The Investigator will also make sure he or she is 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of 
the study drug, as described in this protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure, prior to the initiation of the study. 
16.2. Ethics Committee/In stitutional Review Board (EC/IRB) Review  
The EC/IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 21 CFR Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.”  This protocol, any protocol amendments, the associated informed consent forms, and the informed consent procedures must be submitted to the EC/IRB for review and approved before the enrollment of any patient into the trial. 
All types of patient recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to T onix or its 
designee and to the EC/IRB for review and approval prior to implementation.  EC/IRB approval 
of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the 
amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a potential hazard to study patients.  In such cases, the chair of the EC/IRB should be notified immediately and the amendment forwarded to the EC/IRB for review and approval. 
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain signed written informed consent from each potential study patient prior to the conduct of any screening or other study procedures.  This written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, and potential risks of the 
study have been fully explained to the potential patient.  The Investigator must explain to each 
patient that he or she is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time.  NOTE:  Patients on antidepressant therapy should be warned of a potential serious drug 
interaction and should be advised to contact [CONTACT_82576], including fever, confusion or agitation, hallucinations, sweating, high or low blood pr essure, rapid heart rate, tremor, muscle

AUDITS  
17.1. Maintaining Privacy and Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, and other 
documents, including communications between the study site and Tonix, will identify patients 
only by [CONTACT_82579].  If required, the Investigator 
will grant monitors and auditors from Tonix or its designee and/or regulatory authority’s access to patients’ original medical records for verification of the data gathered on the CRFs and to 
audit the data collection process.  Patients’ confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available unless mandated by [CONTACT_774]. 
17.2. Maintaining Essential Clinical Documents  
Study site files for the retention of regulatory documents will be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to FDA and ICH/GCP 
guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.  The records maintained must be adequate to 
fully document appropriate protection of study subjects/patients, the validity of the study, the integrity of the data, and the manner in which the study was conducted. 
The Investigator ’s site file, copi[INVESTIGATOR_82512], CRFs, originals of test result reports, drug 
disposition logs, correspondence, records of written informed consent, and other documents 
pertaining to the conduct of the study must be kept on file by [CONTACT_82580] [ADDRESS_90041] Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the contract research organization ( CRO ).  The 
Investigator will assume the responsibility of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the clinical data.  All data will be verified for quality control and will also be subject to audits from Tonix or designee to ensure quality.

Final Version 1.0 March  3, 2021  Page 82 of 92  All laboratory results will be analyzed by [CONTACT_82581].  
Clinical laboratory data will be tran sferred from the central laboratory to the clinical database 
maintained by [CONTACT_82582] 11-compliant. 
The responsible clinical study monitor(s) will check data at the monitoring visits to the clinical 
study site.  The Investigator will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete, and legible.  Any changes made to the clinical data will be documented with a full audit trail.  
Aspects of the clinical and statistical phases of the study, including all associated d ocumentation 
may be reviewed by [CONTACT_82583] a 
risk-assessment approach.  The final clinical and statistical report will be audited to ensure that, 
as far as can be reasonably established, the methods described and the results reported accurately reflect the raw data generated during the study.  
17.4. Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient.  
Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by [CONTACT_82584].  Data (including AEs) will be 
recorded on raw data sheets and/or electronic or paper source documents. 
If selected data is collected vi a paper (patient questionnaires, etc.), the data must be entered into 
the eCRF and verified that it has been transcribed correctly.  
17.5. Clinical Laboratory Certification  
A central clinical laboratory will be used to analyze all samples in this study, with the exception 
of the post- screening urine pregnancy tests and ad hoc urine drug screens.  The Investigator must 
maintain, on file, written evidence that the central clinical laboratory to be used is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act or equivalent certification (depending on local regulations).  Further, the Investigator will maintain a copy of the certification, the range of 
normal values, the effective dates for the ranges, and the units of measurement for all laboratory 
tests requested i n the protocol.  If any of the laboratory measurements will be transformed and/or 
categorized in any way, a description of the procedures(s) used should be included.  The Investigator is expected to receive these documents before the shipment of clinical s upplies. 
17.6. Site Monitoring and Tonix’s Right to Review Records  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_82585]/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines. 
Tonix’s designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact [CONTACT_82586].  In extenuating circumstances  related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, remote monitoring will be permissible . The monitor will be expected and allowed to 
verify the Investigator ’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study 
records, including proof of EC/IRB review, with the stipulation that patient confidentiality will 
be maintained  in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  
The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source

designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study to at least [ADDRESS_90043] make sure that each patient’s anonymity is maintained.  On CRFs or other 
documents submitted to Tonix or its agent, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but 
rather by [CONTACT_82587].  The Investigator should 
keep a separate record of the patient initials, randomization codes, patient names, address, and contact [CONTACT_3031].  Documents that contain the names associated with these initials and codes 
are not for submission to Tonix or its agents (e.g., written informed consent forms).  These 
records should be maintained by [CONTACT_82588], Tonix, or its agents.  These records should be kept in compliance with HIPAA regulations. 
18.2. Confidentiality of Study Information  
All information relevant to this study, whether supplied by [CONTACT_82589], is privileged and confidential.  The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to carry out the study and will not use it for other 
purposes without written consent from Tonix.  It is understood that the Investigator is under obligation to provide Tonix with all data obtained during the study.  The information obtained 
from this study will be used by [CONTACT_82590], other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants as required. 
18.3. Publication of Data and Protection of Trade Secrets  
No presentations, abstracts (including meeting abstracts), or other publications based on the 
conduct or results of this study will be permitted without the express written permission of Tonix 
or its designated agent.  All such presentations or publications will proceed only as collaborations between Tonix and the Investigator s.

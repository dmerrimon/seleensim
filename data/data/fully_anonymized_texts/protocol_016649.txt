2.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives  of this research . 
Aim 1 : To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the MMPH in 
community -dwelling URM adults with PH as a symptom self -management 
tool. 
Aim 1a : Feasibility will be assessed by 1) frequency of home 
practice (> 2/week) and 2) retention rate (>70% of participants remaining 
at study completion).  
Aim 1b : Acceptability will be determined by 1) participants ' 
evaluation of the MMPH program (composite m ean System Usability 
Scale score > 5, scale 1 -7), 2) session completion rate (at least 6 of 8 [75% 
attendance] by [CONTACT_540176]), and 3) 
qualitative thematic analysis of participants.  
Aim 2 : To determine the clinical impacts o f an MMPH program in PH -symptom, 
anxiety, and depression reduction among community -dwelling URM adults with 
PH for symptom management.

existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.   Include  
relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by [CONTACT_093].   
Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) live with a plethora of 
bothersome symptoms,1 of which are consequences of the severe 
cardiopulmonary deterioration of right -sided heart failure. Because PH 
pathophysiology is complicated due to multiple causes, PH  diagnosis is 
confirmed with right -sided cardiac catheterization documenting the 
elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 25 mmHg with 
pulmonary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg.2 There are five etiological 
classifications of PH: idiopathic (Class I), due t o left -heart diseases (Class 
II), due to lung diseases (Class III), due to chronic thrombolytic/embolic 
diseases (Class IV), and other causes (Class V).2 Class I PH or pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) is considered the most severe form of PH and 
compr ises approximately 50% of the PH population. Regardless of the 
cause, normalizing pulmonary pressure using PH -specific drugs is the 
main objective of medical management. Little evidence is currently 
 Page 7 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 available regarding effective self -management strategies to reduce 
symptom burden among under -served racial minority (URM) patients with 
PH. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of pharmacological treatment 
have shown to improve clinical outcomes, two critical ingredients often 
not available to URM adults. Amon g patients with a sub -type of PH, PAH 
(pulmonary arterial hypertension), African -Americans (AA) have higher 
mortality rates than Caucasians, and AA women had the highest mortality 
rates across all ages. (3.0, 3.1) Among patients diagnosed with incidental 
PH, AAs were younger with significantly higher right ventricular 
dysfunction and were more frequently covered by [CONTACT_540177]. (3.2).  Therefore, URM PH patients are disproportionately 
affected by [CONTACT_90050]: experiencing a significant b urden of healthcare 
needs related to existing health disparity and limited psychological, 
economic, and healthcare resources. (3.3, 3.4). Even though there have 
been tremendous medical and pharmacologic advances in PH treatment in 
the past decades, patient s continue to live with unmet psycho -social and 
behavioral health needs that impact their long -term prognoses. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_540159], patients living with PH continue to suffer 
psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and stress,4 -10, along  
with a high symptom burden.11,12 Poor physiologic conditions and high 
psychological distress are predictive of poor quality  of life among patients 
with PH.13 -16 The physiological and psychological distress often leads to 
challenges in successfully managin g PH conditions. A culturally tailored, 
innovative complementary health approach to addressing this gap is 
needed to augment symptom self -management, reduce symptom burden, 
promote health and wellness, and health -related quality  of life (HRQOL).  
Complemen tary Health Approach (CHA), defined as non -mainstream 
integrative therapy self -management practice of chronic conditions, has 
been shown to reduce symptom severity and improve quality  of life 
(https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative -health).17 A mindfulne ss-based 
stress reduction (MBSR) intervention program, which includes eight 2.[ADDRESS_704069] shown effectiveness in symptom burden,19 fatigue,19 -22 
and HRQOL22 among persons with cancer. While patients with cancer 
and other chronic conditions use the mind -body intervention (MBI) to a 
greater extent, MBI use among patients with PH is somewhat limited and 
even more so amo ng URM adults with PH. A gentle walking exercise 
program is associated with improvements in six -minute walk distance, 
lung functions, depression, anxiety, and HRQOL.23,24 In a randomized 
controlled trial of 103 PAH patients, a 12-weeks progressive muscle 
relaxation program improved anxiety, depression, and HRQOL.25 Eight -
weeks of slow -paced breathing technique was associated with a reduction 
in depressive symptoms, improved sleep, and HRQOL.26 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
randomized controlled trial of MBSR demonstrated some i mprovement in 
psychological symptoms (depression and anxiety).27 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_516535] -group 
 Page 8 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 testing of an Urban Zen Integrative Therapy (UZIT) is associated with 
symptom burden reduction and HRQOL improvement.[ADDRESS_704070] UZIT program reductions in PH -related 
symptoms.28 These CHA 's show positive effects on the overall 
psychological health; however, practical implementation of CHA is 
limited to the patients ' abilit y to attend in -person sessions, adherence to 
prescribed home practice, and more importantly , availability of culturally 
tailored MBI content.  
Complementary Health Approach (CHA), such as in -person MBI, has 
moderate effects in reducing depression and anxiet y across chronic health 
conditions, including PH. However, these benefits were mostly 
demonstrated among participants who had high adherence to the 
intervention practice.27 Technology -assisted MBI (TeleMBI) has shown 
comparable efficacy with in -person MBI among persons with chronic 
conditions; TeleMBI has the added benefits of cost reduction and ease of 
implementation.29 -31 TeleMBI for patients with multiple sclerosis via 
skype shows improvement in HRQOL, depression, anxiety, and sleep 
disturbance when deli vered at a 5:[ADDRESS_704071] 
comparable efficacy, we postulate that the mobile -MBI has the advantages 
of user -activated, "as needed " delivery, consistent dose delivery, and ease 
of use for symptom management for adults with PH. Clearly, given these 
advantages of mobile -MBI and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_540160] -[ADDRESS_704072] 
MMPH mobile MBI for PH in URM communities to address our research 
aims.  
MMPH is a TeleMBI program tailored for URM patients with PH. The 
intervention is modified from  an in-person  UZIT program  that showed clinical 
results in symptom severity reduction and HRQOL improvement among 14 adults 
with PH.28 This 8 -weeks program will engage participants, employing both 
instructor -led and self -guided delivery of mindfulness practices (via Zoom and 
APP) t o introduce and facilitate the training . Our experience in developi[INVESTIGATOR_540161] -MBI APP is gleaned from current testing of a mobile -
MBI APP among high -stress college students and URM African -Americans 
participants in Buffalo, NY. Prelimina ry testing of mobile -MBI among URM 
adults with PH is invaluable from the perspective of addressing health disparity, 
 Page 9 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 making available a culturally tailored evidence -based intervention of Mindfulness 
for reduction of symptom burden and psychological stress reduction. More 
importantly, the mobile -MBI prototype can be modified and tailored with broader 
applications to other chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Asthma, and COVID -19 long -haul.

5.0 Study Design * 
5.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
This study will engage community -dwelling URM adults with PH living in  the 
[LOCATION_002] . We will use a two -group comparative study design where 
waitlisted participants will serve as  controls. Considering a 20% attrition rate in a 
behavioral health intervention study, we aim to enroll a total of 20, with at least 
16 participants to address study aims (8 -10 in each Group).[ADDRESS_704083] as 
appropriate and Cohen 's d effect size calculation. Multi -time data co llection will 
be done via daily mobile -APP use.  
6.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
6.1  Describe the study intervention and/or investigational agent (e.g., 
drug, device) that is being evaluated.  
The MMPH program will include two Zoom -delivered sessions (Weeks #1 & #4), 
six video -recorded sessions (Weeks #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8), and daily mindfulness 
meditation practice  using a mobile  APP during  an eight -week study period. 
Similar to the UZIT intervention, each MMPH session will in clude Gentle Body 
Movement (GBM,10 -min), Restorative Pose (Pose,10 -min), and Body Awareness 
Meditation (BAM, 20 -min). Self -guided audio -video modules of various 
durations will be available according to participants ' preference and level of 
comfort (5, 10, 20 minutes). The mobile -APP content will reinforce Zoom content 
such as mindful breathing, GBM of upper extremities, GBM of lower extremities, 
Pose sitting, Pose lying, and BAM practices. The MMPH content will be tailored 
to health management needs specifi c to PH with cultural consideration of 
mindfulness -related concepts (stress, responding to stress, resiliency).

Our target population is adults with PH li ving throughout the [LOCATION_002] . There 
is a high likelihood that our  study participant s may include economically 
disadvantaged persons. The study recruitment and enrollment process will occur 
in collaboration with PH doctors and nurses from these 3 locat ions and across the 
country who are likely aware  of their vulnerability. We will follow the 
standardize d and consistent approach in presenting the study material and 
remuneration for their participation. We will provide a s ufficient amount of time 
and info rmation to consider their involvement  in the study.  
 
10.0 Eligibility Screening * 
10.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects ' eligibility.  
Screening refers to determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   
Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  
Screening for inclusion criteria includes a YES response to the following 
questions:

research team member will contact [CONTACT_540185] a 
convenient time for a Zoom meeting . 
3. During the Zoom meeting , the research staff member will describe the 
study and review the consent document. If the  participants decides to 
participate in the study, the research staff will  obtain  verbal informed 
consent.  
4. The participant will be provided a link (via email or text) to the 
REDC ap database  to complete a screening questionnair e. 
 
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part of this protocol.  
11.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that 
all records review proc edures  and inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequately described  in other sections.  
11.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study .  Include specific methods you will use (e.g. 
searching charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advertisements, etc.) . 
 Page 19 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 There are two ways we will make the study known to potential eligible 
participants (1) They may hear about  the study from their PH doctors during 
routine clinic visits  (2) They may see study f lyers  in recruiting partners’ offices  or 
clinics during their routine  care.   
Even though we originally proposed that PH doctors send out emails inviting their 
patients to contact [CONTACT_540186], none of the doctors used the letter. 
They chose to tell their patients about the study verbally, and we only got one 
referral from RRH. That was the recruitment process we did. As I previously 
indicated, we are no longer enrolling and will not use it. We only want to 
complete the study.  
Electronic recruitment will include direct email sent using  the University at 
Buffalo’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute ’s (CTSI)  Buffalo Research 
Registry  and social media (Facebook) . The registry includes names of in dividuals 
who have expressed interest in participating in research studies.  Facebook -based 
recruitment will consist of advertisements for the study.  
Flyers will be distributed to  our referring partners and will be recruited by [CONTACT_540187], self -referral, the use of Buffalo Research Registry, CTSA Hub 
advertisement, Social Media posts (Faceb ook), and Research  Match . Flyers will 
be placed by [CONTACT_540188] ( our referring partners at 
URMC and RRH ). These flyers will be  made available in waiting rooms as well 
as in healthcare professionals’ offices.  
In both recruitment methods, interested participants will contact [CONTACT_540189] 10.1.  None of the referring 
partners will participate in any screening activities, only referrals.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_704092]  the privacy inter ests of prosp ective subjects 
during the recruitment process .   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual 's right to control access to him or herself.    
The recruitment email and flyer information offers individuals the freedom to 
participate in  the study  only if they are interested in doing so.  
Screening i nterviews will take place by [CONTACT_540190]. Recordings 
will be destroyed after transcripts are created . Participants may take part in the 
interview at a place and time of their choosing.  
Potential research participants will know about the study from PH 
providers, paper brochures, Buffalo Research Registry, or the 
ResearchMatch registry. Researchers will make initial contact [CONTACT_540191] a clear indication that they a re interested 
to learn more about  the study. These indications are referral from their PH 
provider, email or phone contact [CONTACT_540192], or "yes" response 
through the ResearchMatch registry.

Examples of appropriate responses include: "participant only meets with a s tudy 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear ", or "the participant 
is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that they do not 
feel comfortable answering ."   
To protect participants ' privacy interests and safety during the study, a research 
team member  will only contact [CONTACT_540193] a private office 
where no one can overhear the conversation. Any email communications with 
participants will be kept private and confidential. All data collected during the 
study will be stored on a secure, password -protected cloud that only the research 
team has access  to. 
About  Zoom communication, p articipant s will meet with a study coordinator from 
the privacy of their home where no one can overhear the discussion about their 
participation in the study. Participants will be reminded no t to discuss any 
personal information outside of the group discussion during the Zoom 
intervent ion.

Sources of information about the subjects before  enrollment will only be 
accessible to PH doctors. Once enrolled, research data will be stored in Research 
Files at UBSON , and only research team members (PI, co -I, RA) will have 
access. There will be no need for medical record review because the outcome data 
will be participant -reported outcomes (symptom presence, symptom severity, 
quality of life).   
 
19.0 Data Management  and Analysis * 
19.[ADDRESS_704105] 
as appropriate and Cohen 's d effect size calculation. Multi -time data collection 
will be done via daily mobile -APP use.  
We will follow the standard procedure in quantitative data anal ysis that 
includes general data inspection to verify the accuracy, completeness, and 
normality of the dataset using the SPSS23 program. We will compare 
clinical outcomes within -group (pre -post) as well as between groups in the 
post-intervention period. We will follow the recommendation of 
inappropriate statistical analysis and interpretation specific to each survey. 
For continuous variables, we will use a paired student t -test, independent 
t-test analytical approaches. For categ orical variables and non -normally 
distributed variables, we will use non -parametric statistical methods (X2). 
Frequency distributions will be produced for all variables, and 
demographic information will be used to describe the sample. The impact 
of the M -App use on outcome variables will be analyzed using paired t -
test and repeated measure ANOVA.  
Qualitative data (focused -group interview data) will be analyzed using the 
standard qualitative thematic analysis procedure. We will transcribe the 
audio -recorded data and upload it into NViVo data management system. 
We will adhere to the thematic analysis method, described as follows:  
1. A researcher will read and re -read the entire text to get a general sense 
of the participants ' whole experience of being a stude nt during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. While reading through the transcript, the researcher 
will take initial notes and perform a general review  to get familiar with the 
data before analyzing the data.  
2. The researcher will descriptively open code by [CONTACT_540194] 'meaningful units ', keepi[INVESTIGATOR_540169] ' own words. 
The researcher will re -read all the codes again to eliminate redundancies. 
 Page 28 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 The comparative discussion of these codes with other research team 
members to achieve a c onsensus will provide a validation step.  
3. The researcher will use an inductive approach to look over the 
consensus codes, identify patterns among them, and start coming up with 
categories that describe 'critical moments, ' significant aspects of the 
expe riences.  
4. The researcher will categorize the codes into overarching elements and 
higher -level categories and then cluster similar categories into the related 
themes. To make sure that the themes are useful and accurately represent 
the data, the research er will return to the original data set and reflectively 
compare the categories against it.  
5. The researcher will discuss with the research team members to refine 
the themes and develop the central theme. The researcher will then define 
and name [CONTACT_540204] [CONTACT_540195] s' experience s.  
6. Finally, the researcher will develop an overall description of the essence of the 
participants ' experience by [CONTACT_540196]/s in a 
flowing narration.  
19.2 If applicable, p rovide a power analysis.    
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/ records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the inves tigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.   
NOT APPLICABLE  
 
19.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data.  
We will set up the required data entry field within the M -App and 
REDCap function to ensure that the data entry is accurate and complete. 
Erroneous (out -of-range) data entry will be less likely, as controlled by [CONTACT_540197]. Also, t he system will remind participants to 
enter data into the required data field before proceeding to the following  
sections. A dedicated research coordinator will review data entry once a 
week to verify survey completion and confirm no missing data. In the c ase 
of missing data discovery, the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_540198].  
Before the data analysis process, two researchers will review the dataset for 
accuracy and discuss any possible reliability issues  in data collection.

physical or emotional health . 
NOT APPLICABLE  
 
22.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including retention of already collected data, and partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection , as applicable . 
We will attempt to use all the available data obtained from all participants 
(intention to treat). Pre and post comparison of the experimental Group 
will be conducted as aggr egate means using all available data collected.  
When participants decide to leave the study, we will ask the m if they would allow 
us to use the data we have collected before their decision to withdraw. If the 
subjects agree to use the data, the collected d ata will be handled and analyzed the 
same as research data. If the participants do not allow the use of the data, we will 
make every attempt to destroy the data.  
23.0 Risks to Subjects *

the proper use of the  M-App a nd the environment/conditions they need to 
avoid practicing with the M-App.  
For a Zoom intervention group, there is always the chance that someone 
will share something someone else said (confidentiality breach). At the 
beginning of the interview, w e will remind participants not to share this 
information with anyone. (This information will be a part of the consent 
document , indicating  no guarantee that this may not occur).  
 
There is a potential risk of emotional discomfort to participants when answe ring 
survey questions about symptoms or feelings. Although unlikely, participants may 
experience sensations of anxiety, depression, and worse physical symptoms. 
Participants will be instructed to rest and re -focus their attention from completing 
the survey  in such a scenario . If needed, participants will be given the contact 
[CONTACT_540199] (according to their primary care doctors). 
Questionnaires included in this research study are standardized tools used widely 
with no reported adverse ha rm. Fatigue is possible when answering questions 
from a battery of questionnaires. However, most  surveys used in this study are 
shortened versions that generally require less than 10 minutes to complete.  
23.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probabil ity or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
To address potential physical harm (mentioned above), we will provide 
specific instructions on how to complete the M -App modules at home.  
To monitor s ubjects for safety risk , we will conduct weekly research 
meetings to review the progress of the research activity and any 
participants' safety concerns . We will create action plans to mitigate any 
issues that may arise.  
We wi ll employ all reasonable effor ts to protect the confidentiality of the 
participants ' protected health information. Identifiable data is immediately 
de-identified, and de -identified data is stored separately from identifiable 
data. We will keep participants ' names and other identifying information 
confidential when the data is prepared or oral or written publications.  
Specific to participants ' interview s, there is a potential risk of emotional distress 
due to the sensitive nature of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. We will provide a ll interviewed 
participan ts with information on mental health resources and support groups at the 
time of enrollment.

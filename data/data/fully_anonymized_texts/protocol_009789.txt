How does the length of pulse trains and pulse intervals affect 
tolerability with transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation?
Short Title: taVNS Dosage Study 1
2)IRB Review History*
Not applicable
3)Objectives*
We will compare the tolerability and intended physiological effects for 2 different 
pulse train length applications of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation 
(taVNS).  Specifically, a crossover design will be used to assess if 30 seconds on 
and 30 seconds off (Protocol 1) is equally tolerable and effective to 10 seconds on 
and 10 seconds off (Protocol 2) with a set stimulation intensity (2 mA) for 60 
minutes. This study is part of a larger research agenda designed to inform the 
development of personalized pain relief programs based on using patient 
preferences and a mechanistic understanding of the interventions to integrate 
neurostimulation interventions into multimodal care for persistent pain.  30 healthy 
adults (15 female) will receive  60-minute sessions of [ADDRESS_421076] a 50% duty cycle, but Protocol-[ADDRESS_421077] a 30s 
on and 30s off cycle, while Protocol-2 will use a 10s on and 10s off cycle.  Each 
participant will receive both protocols in random order and on separate days.
Aim 1: Determine the effects of different taVNS pulse train and interval 
lengths on tolerability and heart rate variability (HRV).   Tolerability will be 
assessed using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires.  HRV will be 
assessed using a chest-strap heart rate monitor (H10, Polar, Finland).
We hypothesize that Protocol-[ADDRESS_421078] greater tolerability and it will be 
associated with a greater increase in HRV.  
Aim 2: Determine if the taVNS protocols differ in their effects on pain 
sensitivity and cortical excitability response . A subset of the participants (n=12) 
will be used to assess the how the different protocols affect corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_340268].  Corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_340269] (TMS) single and paired pulse paradigms.  Pain 
sensitivity response will be assessed using thermal and mechanical quantitative 
sensory testing.  We hypothesize that there will be no difference between protocols 
on the effect of corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_340270]. 
4)Background*
Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive 
technique that involves the application of electrical currents through surface 
electrodes on the outer ear to target the auricular branch of the vagus nerve 
(ABVN). The vagus nerve is part of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates 
various bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and 
inflammation.[ADDRESS_421079] various therapeutic effects on different

[ADDRESS_421080] to optimize monophasic 
taVNS.   Our aim is to determine the effects of different pulse train and interval 
lengths on tolerability and response to taVNS in 30 healthy adults.  Specifically, a 
crossover design will be used to assess if 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off 
(protocol 1) is equally tolerable and effective to 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off 
(protocol 2) with a set stimulation intensity (2 mA) for 60 minutes.

A detailed description of each procedure is provided below:
Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ)8: The PTQ is a 15-item, Likert-type 
scale designed to measure the broad idea of repetitive negative thought. It is 
expected to take less than 10 minutes to complete and it will be completed at visit 
1.
Semi-structured interviews: Post-trial semi-structured interviews will be used to 
examine the perceived experience of each taVNS protocol.  See interview 
template. Each interview is expected to take 5 minutes and will be conducted at 
the end of visits 1 and 2.
Tolerability questionnaire: A questionnaire will be used to assess pain ratings 
(with scores ranging from [ADDRESS_421085] pain), potential side 
effects, and belief in taVNS after each session.  This questionnaire is expected to 
take ~5 minutes to complete and it will be administered at visits 1 and 2.
Heart rate variability (HRV): HRV will be measured with an H10 chest 
strap device (Polar, Finland) and will serve as the primary endpoint for 
response to taVNS in Aim 2.  Participants will wear the chest strap 
continuously throughout the application of taVNS, and for 15 minutes 
prior (baseline) and [ADDRESS_421086] taVNS trial at each session.
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST): Each of the 12 participants who complete 
data collection at the Lynn Center will undergo pressure pain threshold (PPT) 
using the Algomed Digital Algometer (Medoc, Israel), thermal pain testing using 
the TSA2 Air (Medoc, Israel), and temporal summation pain sensitivity (wind-up 
ratio) testing using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_340273] (MRC Systems GmbH, [LOCATION_013]). The 
- Study #: 20240134        Effective Date: 3/29/2024
Page 7 of 20Revised: March 26, 2024entire QST protocol will take less than 15 minutes to complete.  The purpose of 
these tests are to determine the threshold for pain; thus, the stimulus will be 
discontinued immediately as soon as the participant indicates that the stimulus has 
become painful.
PPT: PPT is the force at which pressure begins to be perceived as pain. PPT 
assists in quantifying static mechanical hyperalgesia to blunt pressure and has 
been recommended for capturing pain sensitivity. PPT will be measured at the 
mid-belly of the upper trapezius with a probe area of 1 cm2 (probe diameter of 1.1 
cm). The tip of the algometer will be placed perpendicular to the skin and gradual 
pressure will be applied at a rate of 30 kPa/s. Participants will be asked to press a 
button to indicate as soon as a painful sensation is perceived, and then rate the 
intensity of the painful sensation. The PPT will be determined as the average of 
three trials.  
Thermal pain testing: All measurements will be completed using a 30x30mm 
thermode. Cold Pain Threshold (CPT) is the temperate at which cold begins to be 
perceived as pain. CPT assists in quantifying static thermal hyperalgesia to 
contact [CONTACT_340287]. CPT will be measured on the forearm. The thermode will be 
placed perpendicular to the skin and gradual decreasing temperature will be 
applied at a rate of 5℃/𝑠  with a maximum cut-off at 0 ℃. Participants will be 
asked to press a button to indicate as soon as a painful sensation is perceived, and 
then rate the intensity of the painful sensation on a NRS. The CPT will be 
determined with three series of descending stimulus intensities, as described 
above, at each point over 3 rounds.
HPT is the temperature at which heat begins to be perceived as pain. HPT will be 
measured on the forearm. The thermode will be placed perpendicular to the skin 
and gradual increasing temperature will be applied at a rate of 5℃/𝑠  with a 
maximum cut-off at 50 ℃. Participants will be asked to press a button to indicate 
as soon as a painful sensation is perceived, and then rate the intensity of the 
painful sensation on a NRS. The HPT will be determined with three series of 
ascending stimulus intensities, as described above, at each point over 3 rounds.
Wind-up ratio: A 256 mN pi[INVESTIGATOR_340274]-up ratio over the 
participants’ hand. The perceived intensity of a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_340275] a series of 10 repetitive pi[INVESTIGATOR_340276] 
(1/s applied within an area of 1 cm2). The participant will be asked to give a pain 
rating representing the single stimulus, and the estimated mean over the whole 
series of 10 stimuli using a ‘0–10’ numerical rating scale. The whole procedure 
will be repeated 3 times. Wind-up ratio (WUR) will be calculated as the ratio: 
mean rating of the 3 series divided by [CONTACT_340288].
Quantitative sensory testing is expected to take <[ADDRESS_421087] taVNS at visits 1 and 2 for a subset of the participants 
(n=12).

Page 8 of 20Revised: March 26, 2024TMS single pulse, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and 
intracortical facilitation (ICF): Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (i.e., SICI and ICF) has become an increasingly popular 
method of using TMS techniques to probe intra and inter cortical 
connections. For paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, a 
subthreshold conditioning stimulus is followed by [CONTACT_340289] (TS) with varying interstimulus intervals. ICF can 
be elicited with ISI of 6–25 ms while SICI is elicited at 1–6 ms. Both, 
SICI and ICF prove intracortical excitability but through different 
mechanisms. 
 SICI and ICF will be assessed using TMS paired-pulse paradigms with 
the Magpro X100 (MagVenture, Alpharetta, GA).  These TMS paired-
pulse measures will serve as secondary endpoints for response to taVNS in 
Aim 2. 
Participants will be comfortably seated in an armchair with 
the head on a foam headrest. TMS will be delivered 
through a focal figure-of-eight shaped magnetic coil.  The 
coil will be placed flat on the head over the left motor 
cortex (Figure 1), at an approximate angle of 45° to the 
sagittal plane, inducing a current in the brain roughly 
perpendicular to the central sulcus, flowing from posterior to 
anterior, as this has been reported to be the most effective 
way to activate the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_340277].  
Motor evoked potentials (MEP) will be recorded using 
surface EMG Ag/AgCl electrodes placed over the right abductor digiti 
minimi muscle in a belly-tendon montage. The optimal coil placement will 
be determined by [CONTACT_340290]. The coil 
position leading to the highest peak-to-peak amplitude of the MEP (‘hot 
spot’) will be marked using the TMS navigation system (Localite, 
[LOCATION_013]) to ensure accurate coil positioning throughout the testing.  A 
fixed sequence of TMS measurements will be followed: First, TS and 
resting motor threshold (RMT) will be defined as the lowest stimulator 
output intensity that induced MEP peak-to-peak amplitude greater than 50 
μV in five out of 10 consecutive trials.
 Then the single pulse and paired-pulse parameters, SICI and ICF, will be 
obtained in a pseudo-random order. EMG response to single pulse stimuli 
of 130% of RMT will be recorded.  For paired pulse, the conditioning 
stimulus will be set to an intensity of 70% of the RMT as this does not 
produce MEPs, and the intensity of the following suprathreshold test 
stimulus will be set to 130% of RMT. We will use multiple interstimulus 
intervals (ISIs), including 1, 2, 3, and 5 milliseconds for SICI and 7, 10, or 
15 milliseconds for ICF, with 10 pulses at each interval, to produce a 
response curve. The average of the 10 trials will be used to define the 
amplitude of the peak-to-peak MEP for each condition.

DS8R Biphasic Constant Current Stimulator (Digitimer, [LOCATION_008]) will 
be used with flexible hydrogel electrodes to administer taVNS at the cymba 
concha (Figure 1), using the parameters described in Table 1.  Both devices 
are approved for research purposes, and these parameters have been shown 
to safe in healthy people and across a variety of patient populations.  
Participants will be quiet sitting in a comfortable chair during the 
application of taVNS.

NA 
14)Data Management*
The principal investigator (Marlon Wong) will be responsible for all data 
management and analyses.  A research assistant will assist with data entry 
and qualitative data coding. All quantitative data will be entered and stored 
in the University of Miami REDCap system. NVivo software (QSR 
International, [LOCATION_002]) will be used for qualitative data management 
and analyses, and SPSS version 28 (IBM, [LOCATION_002]) will be used for 
quantitative analyses.  
Qualitative Analysis:  The Interviews will be recorded and transcribed 
verbatim. Transcripts will be checked for accuracy against recordings. We 
will apply rapid qualitative analysis to the interview transcripts to create 
structured templates and matrix displays. Analysis will be performed 
independently by [CONTACT_340291]. First, qualitative team members will use the 
interview guide, while reviewing the transcripts, to create summaries 
(structured templates) of the interviews. The structured templates will be 
aggregated to create matrices that enable systematic comparison between 
participants.  After rapid qualitative analyses are completed, the transcripts 
will be uploaded into NVivo for coding.
Quantitative Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be assessed, including 
sample mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range for each 
continuous variable, and frequencies and percentages for categorical 
variables. We will test distributional assumptions of all variables by [CONTACT_340292].  Paired T tests will be used to assess 
differences in post-trial values between protocols.    
Convergence of Qualitative and Quantitative Data: An exploratory 
sequential mixed methods approach will be used to integrate qualitative and 
quantitative data, when appropriate, for determining tolerability.

16)Withdrawal of Subjects*
To address the challenge of early identification of an increased risk of a 
known adverse event, all adverse event data will be tracked and evaluated 
by [CONTACT_64839] a regular basis. A participant may be taken out of the 
study if any of the following criteria are met: (i) the participant chooses to 
withdraw from the study; (ii) the participant’s physician determines that 
the participant should not continue for physical or mental health reasons; 
(iii) a physical injury that would prohibit continuation of the study is 
sustained by [CONTACT_2299]; (iv) continuing involvement in the study 
would result in a degradation of participant health; (v) personal, family, or 
other obligations prohibit further involvement in the study. 
No special precautions are needed for the participants before, during, or 
after the study, including medication or dietary restrictions. No special 
care is required for or by [CONTACT_3038].
Participants may be withdrawn from the research without their consent if 
it is deemed that they are unsafe to participate (e.g., abnormal vital signs, 
signs of distress such as unexplained diaphoresis, change in cognitive 
status, and/or signs of intoxication) or if there has been a change in their 
medical status (e.g., recent surgery or ongoing illness).
If a participant is withdrawn without their consent (fully or partially), the 
reason will be explained to them and will be notated in REDCap.
17)Risks to Subjects*
The risks associated with participation in the study are deemed to be extremely low. 
Nevertheless, this study involves the administration of assessment instruments that 
may cause minor discomfort, the application of an experimental intervention, and 
the risk of loss of confidentiality. All participants will be informed that all aspects 
of this study are voluntary.  It is also important to note that we have used very 
similar procedures in a previous study involving cancer survivors with 
chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (IRB#20230154) with no adverse 
effects.
Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation is reported in numerous systematic 
reviews to be effective in treatment of insomnia and relief of acute and chronic 
pain. Given the non-invasive nature of taVNS, its use is growing for clinical 
purposes as well as in healthy populations for basic research in cognitive 
neuroscience and related fields.  
Risks/discomforts associated with taVNS: A systematic literature review on the 
safety and tolerability of tVNS has evaluated [ADDRESS_421088] was local skin 
irritation from electrode placement, occurring in about 18% of included subjects 
following long-term stimulation. Headache (3.6%) and nasopharyngitis (1.7%) were 
- Study #: 20240134        Effective Date: 3/29/2024
Page 11 of 20Revised: March 26, 2024more rare side effects, and only 2.6% of participants dropped out of studies due to 
side effects. taVNS will be administered in a laboratory by [CONTACT_340293]. Adverse responses will be 
tracked and reported to the SCCC Data & Safety Monitoring Committee.
Risks/discomforts associated with TMS: 
Seizure or syncope: Induction of seizures is the most severe acute adverse effect of 
TMS; however, the risk is very low. A published search of the literature only 
identified 41 reports of seizures. The estimated standardized risk for paired-pulse 
TMS stimulation is 2/100,000 sessions. Such a seizure has never been reported to 
result in any permanent damage, and the risk only occurs during the stimulation: 
there is no heightened risk of seizure after the stimulation. A licensed physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and certified basic life support (CPR and AED) provider, will be present 
at all times. In the case of a seizure, TMS will be terminated immediately, and the 
provider will follow guidelines for seizure managment4 and activate emergency 
response if needed. The subject will be assisted in controlled reclining without 
impact. Airway breathing and circulation will be assessed. Unless tonic-clonic 
seizure activity occurs, the subject will be turned on one side to help clear the 
airway and avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_340278]. Delayed recovery of normal consciousness beyond 30 s following a 
seizure will mandate further medical evaluation.
Hearing: There is a very small risk of hearing damage. After exposure to the TMS 
stimulus, a few adult subjects have experienced transient increases in auditory 
thresholds, and there was a single report of permanent small threshold shift in a 
person whose ear plug slipped out during stimulation. To minimize the risk of 
hearing damage, participants will be fitted with ear plugs. 
Local pain, headache, or discomfort: TMS is generally well tolerated and 
experienced as painless by [CONTACT_340294]; however, there is a small risk of pain 
or discomfort with paired-pulse TMS.  Less than 2% of patients in TMS trials 
discontinued treatment due to pain.
Risks/discomforts associated with completion of questionnaires: Some questions 
may be emotionally distressful to some participants or make them uncomfortable. 
Participants will be instructed that they can skip any questions which they do not 
wish to answer.
Risks/discomforts associated with measurement of sensory function (QST): Pain 
thresholds will be measured for pressure as well as for pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107]. This will result in 
slight discomfort for the participant. As soon as the participant indicates that the 
stimulus has become painful, the stimulus will be discontinued immediately. The 
equipment used for sensory testing has been used in our laboratory for the last few 
- Study #: 20240134        Effective Date: 3/29/2024
Page 12 of 20Revised: March 26, 2024years, without any adverse events. This equipment is also used in many other 
laboratories and has an excellent track record.
Risks/discomforts associated with heart rate variability monitoring:  Heart rate 
variability data will be gathered through two standard ECG pads on the chest that 
will be worn continuously.  There are no significant risks associated with heart rate 
variability monitoring.  Some people have minor discomfort or skin irritation where 
the sensors (electrodes) are placed, and we will inspect the skin after assessment. 
Risks/discomforts associated with completion of questionnaires: Some questions may 
be emotionally distressful to some participants or make them uncomfortable. Participants 
will be instructed that they can skip any questions which they do not wish to answer.

Device deficiencies are doc umented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as

Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s) , as defined below:

Page 51of 63
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the su bject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_13302], as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  [CONTACT_13303] y procedure.
Not Related An AE classif ied as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).

12ANAL YSIS PLAN
Data from a subset of subjects in the CLL949 -C009 study  will be combined with data from 
this study . This combined set will serve as the basis for all anal yses detailed in this section. 
Subjects in CLL949 -C009 will be included in the combined set only  if they satisfy  the 
following criterion:
BCV A of 20/20 or better in each ey e at the Screening /Baseline /Dispense V isit
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_592170] be determined prior to breaking the code for masked treatment

(DEP).
12.2 Analysis Sets
12.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
Safety  analyses will be conducted using the safet y anal ysis set on a treatment- emergent basis.
As such, the safety  anal ysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any stud y lenses
evaluated in this study , 
For treatment- emergent safety  analy ses, subjects/ey es will be categorized 
under the actual study  lenses exposed.
12.2.2 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (F AS) is the set of all randomized subjects who are exposed to any  study
lenses evaluated in this , and who have at least one 
post-baseline ( post-Dispense) CL CDV A.

met any  of the critical deviation or evaluability  criteria identified in the DEP .
12.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic information, recent lens -wearing experience (including wear modality  and 
wear success), and habitual lens information will be presented b y lens group and overall.
Counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables such as sex, age group, 
race, an ethnicity . Number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum will 
bepresented for continuous v ariables such as age.
12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)
The primary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y   compared to 
Biofinity  in mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow-up.
The primary  endpoint is the mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow- up. The corresponding 
assessment is collected with study  lenses, in Snellen, for each ey e. Conversion w ill be made 
to the logMAR scale. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(in logMAR scale) for noninferiority :
H0: μ(T)− μ(C)≥ 0.10
Ha: μ(T)− μ(C)< 0.10

where μ(T)andμ(C)denote the Week [ADDRESS_592171] lenses, respectively , on the logMAR scale .
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fects repeated measures model will be utilized to t est these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit (Dispense, W eek 1 Follow - up, Month 1 Follow -up, and 
Month 3 Follow -
up), and lens -by-visit interaction as fixed ef fects, protocol as a random 
effect and baseline best corrected distance V Aas a covariate. W ithin-subject correlation due 
to ey e will also be accounted for in the model. Lens dif ference (  minus Biofinity ) and 
the corresponding two -sided 95% CI will be computed for 1 -Week Follow -up. Noninferiorit y 
in CLCDA will be declared if the upper confidence limit is less than 0.10.
12.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint
The secondary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y 
  compared 
to Biofinity  in the percentage of subjects achieving CLCDVA 20/20 or better ,in each ey e,at 
Week 1 Follow -up.
The corresponding end point is the percentage (proportion) of subjects with CL CDV A of 
20/20 or better , measured monocularly ,in both OD and OS at Week 1 Follow -up.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(10%) for noninferiorit y.
H0: P(T)– P (C)≤ -0.10
Ha: P(T)– P (C)> -0.10
where P (T)and P (C)denote the proportion of subjects attaining at least 20/20 in CL CDV A at
Week1 Follow -up in each ey e (OD andOS) for  and Biofinity  contact [CONTACT_13276], 
respectivel y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods
A binary  variable will be defined for each subject to indicate whether the CLCDV A at Week 1 
Follow -up is no worse than 20/20 in both OD and OS, and the corresponding proportion will 
be computed for each lens using the number of subjects as the denominator  
 
 From the two

IN-HOME Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan  
 Official Study Title : 
Testing Preliminary Effectiveness of a Community Health Worker (CHW) Training Program to Support African American and Latino Male Caregivers of Older Adults  
 Document Date : 
January 1, [ADDRESS_922577]  with a two-group pre–post  design with 87 CHWs  will 
explore the following question: To what extent is IN -HOME exposure (treatment) associated 
with greater CHW knowledge, skills, and perceived self -efficacy to conduct outreach to reduce 
caregiver burden for African American and Latino male informal caregivers of older adults 
compare to CHWs reviewing caregiver information from AARP’s English “Care at Home” resource  page  (control)?  What  is the relation  between  demographic  characteristics (e.g., age and 
race/ethnicity) and experimental differences in knowledge, skills, and perceived self -efficacy? 
What is the extent of difference in outcomes between treatment and control participants?  
We will enroll  60 CHWs  per arm. Eligible  participants  will (1) be at least 18 years old, (2) self- 
identify  as a CHW,  (3) live in the United  States,  (4) conduct  outreach, to African  American  and 
Latino male informal caregivers, (5) have at least six months of field experience and (6) be an active CHW within the last six months.  
We will randomly assign participants to the treatment and control conditions. Any stratification based on potentially confounding factors will be done by [CONTACT_681305]. Treatment  participants  will complete  a pretest  before  and a posttest  after viewing the IN-HOME 
prototype. Control participants will complete a pretest before and a posttest after reviewing caregiver information from AARP’s English “Care at Home” resource page.  
IN-HOME  is feasible if the treatment  group shows  statistically  significant  higher  mean  scores in 
knowledge, skills,  and perceived  self-efficacy  at posttest  compared  to the control  group. We will 
use covariate- adjusted ANCOVA to control for group differences (e.g., received caregiver 
training before) that may confound outcomes. We will use two- tailed tests to identify potential 
iatrogenic effects.  
 
 
II. IN-HOME  study  research  questions  
 
1. To what extent is IN -HOME exposure (treatment) associated with greater CHW 
knowledge, skills, and perceived self -efficacy to conduct outreach to reduce caregiver 
burden for African American and Latino male informal caregivers of older adults 
compare  to CHWs  reviewing  caregiver  information  from  an online  resource (control)?  
• What is the relation between demographic characteristics (e.g., age and 
race/ethnicity)  and experimental  differences in knowledge, skills,  and perceived 
self-efficacy? 
2. What  is the extent  of difference in outcomes  between  treatment  and control  participants?  
• What is the relation between demographic characteristics (e.g., age and race/ethnicity)  and experimental  differences in knowledge, skills,  and perceived 
self-efficacy? 
3. To what  extent  do CHWs  exposed to IN-HOME  show  greater  gains  in knowledge 
compared to the control group?  
• What is the relation between demographic characteristics (e.g., age and 
race/ethnicity)  and experimental  differences in knowledge, skills,  and perceived 
self-efficacy? 
4. To what  extent  do CHWs  exposed to IN-HOME  are more  prepared to provide  support  to 
male caregivers compared to the control group?  
• What is the relation between demographic characteristics (e.g., age and 
race/ethnicity)  and experimental  differences in knowledge, skills,  and perceived 
self-efficacy?

III. IN-HOME  study  summary  
 
Study  design:  Randomized controlled  trial with a two-group online  pretest/posttest design.  
Study  population  and sites:  The study population  will include  active CHWs.  The study will be 
conducted online and include participants recruited by [CONTACT_681306], 
Georgia, [LOCATION_012], Virginia, Illinois, and [LOCATION_007]. 
Treatment  regimen:  Treatment group  participants  will view  the IN-HOME  prototype.  Control 
group participants will view materials from AARP’s English “Care at Home” resource page.  
Randomization:  The research  assistant  will randomly  assign  participants  to the control  or 
treatment group after they consent to the study.  
Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB):  KDHRC received  approval  for pi[INVESTIGATOR_681303] 
2, 2023 IRB # 00005850.

V. Recruitment  
We contracted with six sites with CHW- related programs. All sites received a brief training 
video to explain IN -HOME and provide an overview of the study requirements, time 
commitment,  and consent  process.  After  completing  the training  call, sites will begin recruitment 
using KDHRC- developed and IRB -approved recruitment materials. Sites shared the recruitment 
materials with their CHWs via email, newsletter, fliers, in -office communications (e.g., Slack) 
and social media posts. The recruitment period began upon receiving IRB approval, and ended 
when we received enough participants for power for analysis.  
 
The recruitment  period for IN-HOME  lasted  from  May 15, [ADDRESS_922580]  16, 2023.  
 
IV. Data  collection  
• Recruitment  numbers  (aimed):  123 CHWs  
• Recruitment  numbers  (actual):  123 CHWs  consented  [52 control;  55 treatment] 
• Dates:  May 15, 2023 – August  16, 2023  
 
 
V. Data  cleaning  
1. Make changes in Alchemer  (if required)  
 
2. Download pretest  and posttest  from Alchemer  and save in the “raw  data” folder  – do not 
make any changes to this data.  
• Location (control  group):  S:\Projects\ IN-HOME \Feasibility  evaluation\ Raw 
data\Control \Final control group raw data  
• Location (intervention  group):  S:\Projects \IN-HOME \Feasibility  evaluation \Raw 
data\Treatment \Final treatment group raw data  
• File is password  protected with standard  data protection  password. See Dexter  for 
password.  
 
3. Copy the raw data file exported from  Alchemer  into the “Manipulated data folder”  
• Location:  S:\Projects \IN-HOME \Feasibility  evaluation \Manipulated  data 
 
4. Merge the posttest  treatment and posttest  control  surveys  together  to form  a single 
posttest file.  
• Archive  separate posttest  treatment and posttest  control  surveys.  
• Save  combined posttest  survey files as _COMBINED.  
 
5. Merge pretest  and posttest  data by [CONTACT_681307]- and posttest  responses by [CONTACT_681308]. 
• Compare  participant ID (last- initials -state)  between  pre and posttest  responses.  
• If the participant  matches,  merge  the pre and posttest  variables.  
• Archive  pretest  and posttest  survey files.  
• Save  merged  survey files as _MERGED.  
 
6. Delete observations, if applicable.  
 
7. Clean  data in preparation  for data analysis.  
 
  
 
VI. Data  analysis  
1. Create dichotomous  variables for incorrect and correct  answers 
a. For the knowledge  and skills  variables,  we will code  correct  answers as ‘1’ and 
incorrect answers as ‘0’.  
b. The new variable  name  [INVESTIGATOR_52396] “_correct”  (e.g. q1_t1_correct). 
2. Create a dummy  variable  for treatment.  
a. For all participants  in the treatment  group, we will code  the variable  “treatment” 
with a ‘1’ and control group participants with a ‘0’.  
3. Create composite  variables for the knowledge, skills,  and self-efficacy  questions.  
a. Create composite variables for each participant that sums all their answers for 
each outcome and divides them by [CONTACT_681309], ranging from 0 to 100 (e.g., a composite knowledge score of 
[ADDRESS_922581]).  
b. The new variable names will be “know_comp_t1,” “know_comp_t2,” “att_comp_t1,”  “att_comp_t2,”  “se_comp_t1,”  “se_comp_t2,”  “int_comp_t1,” 
and “int_comp_t2.”  
4. Create “gain” or “differences” score for the composite  variables.  
a. Subtract  the t1 composite  variables from  the t2 composite  variables to get the 
change in composite score from pretest to posttest for each outcome area.  
b. The new variable  names  will be “know_comp_diff,”  “att_comp_diff,” 
“se_comp_diff,” and “int_comp_diff.”  
 
Methods  
• Between  groups  t-tests on each outcome’s  composite  score  at pretest  and posttest.  
• Within  group t-tests between  each outcome’s  pretest  and posttest  composite  scores.  
• Regression analyses using each primary outcome’s posttest composite score as the 
dependent variable and group assignment as the primary independent variable, while 
controlling for participant characteristics at baseline including race, ethnicity, age, sex, 
education, time as CHW,  paid/volunteer  status,  having over 16hrs  of training,  number  of 
usual topi[INVESTIGATOR_681304], and whether participants had been trained previously in older adult care.

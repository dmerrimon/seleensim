1.0 BACKGROUND  
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, minimally invasive  treatments 
and aesthetic applic ations . RF technology is a safe method for non -ablative (A nonwounding 
device treatment which stimulates collagen growth and tightens underlying skin ) treatment 
because  energy can  be precisely delivered through the skin to the dermal tissue beneath without 
damaging the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  The gentle heating of deep dermal tissue induces collagen 
denaturation, contraction, and subsequent synthesis.  The collagen synthesis, in turn, creates a 
tightening effect that helps to eliminate mild to modera te facial wrink les and rhytid es (A wrinkle, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a facial wrinkle secondary to muscular co ntraction patterns in the skin ) and is used also 
for other cosmetic treatments on the body.  Radiofrequency surgery  is currently used to remo ve 
lesions such as moles, warts and skin tags  and perform cosmetic surgeries such as, but not 
limited to; blepharoplasties , abdominoplasties, breast augmentations, face lifts, labiaplasties, 
and vaginoplasties.  It involves the passage of radio waves into the skin to perform the removal 
or reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] o f a lesion. Different types of electrodes are used depending on the type of lesion  
(e.g. fine needle, wire loop, scalpel blade etc. ). 
 
In this study t his family of generators will be tested  for: 
Gene ral surgical procedures such as  (but not limited to) ; 
o Urologic, thoracic, plastic, reconstructive and gynecological  
o Electrosurgical coagulation (hemostasis or coagulating) of tissue  
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_723009]-ablative /aesthetic  treatments such as  (but not limited to) ; 
• Facial wrinkles and rhytids  
• Heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for selected medical conditions 
such as temporary relief of pain, muscle spasms, an d increase in local circulation  
• Temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite

Photographs will be taken at all visits and will be used to assess safety and efficacy of 
treatment.  
 
Treatment Discomfort /Pain Evaluation : 
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 
(none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain)  using the universal pain assessment tool 
(Appendix B)  
 
Subject Experience E valuation:  
Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their treatment experience.  
 
User Experience Evaluation:  
The clinician will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the usability of the 
device.  
 
Diary:  
A subject diary may be collected to assess the recovery time of the treatment for [ADDRESS_987368] Satisfaction :  
The subject will be asked their level of satisfaction using a 6-point  Likert scale that range s 
from “extremely satisfied” to “extremely unsatisfied. ”  
 
Rating  Description  
6 Extremely Satisfied  
5 Satisfied  
4 Slightly Satisfied  
3 Slightly Unsatisfied  
2 Dissatisfied  
1 Extremely Unsatisfied  
 
 
Ultrasound (U/S) : 
An ultrasound scan is a medical test that uses sound waves to capture live images from 
the inside of the body. The subject will most likely be lying down on a table with a section 
of their body exposed for the test.  A special lubricating jelly will be applied to their skin. 
This prevents friction between the ultrasound transducer —similar in appearance to a 
microphone — and the skin. The jelly also helps transmit the sound waves. After the 
procedure, the gel will be cleaned off the subject. The whole procedure typi[INVESTIGATOR_723014] [ADDRESS_987369] will be free to go about their day and normal 
activities.  
 
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  
An OCT device uses a very low power laser that is directed at the skin. The reflected light 
is captured by [CONTACT_8121] t o provide images of the skin layer down to [ADDRESS_987370] will be 
asked to lay down and the device’s arm will be brought into contact [CONTACT_723023]. De pending on the area of skin to be measured, the exam will take 15 to 30 
minutes to perform.

8.0 RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experienc e with the use of  system , similar systems and industry experience . Experience with  
treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial.  All other known risks 
will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this is an elective 
procedure and the subjects are volunteers, it can be assume d that their signature [CONTACT_723030].  
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. To minimize/avoid bias objective evaluation 
methods may also be used in conjunction with  subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_987374] the  Investigator at any time throug hout the course of the study . 
The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review each event and asse ss its relationship 
to the study device  (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the device  treatments:  
• Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does  not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study 
sampling sessions; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
subject.  
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational  product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject.  
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there 
is a positive reaction at the application site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity.  Using t he following 
definitions for rating severity will be used:

• Mild – easily tolerated, causing m inimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday  
activities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adverse device experience, in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse device 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or 
subject may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by [CONTACT_723025] (CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will 
be reported within [ADDRESS_987375] to follow -up.  Adverse events will be 
captured throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations w ill be 
performed to document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, 
improved, uncha nged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow -up.  Following the resolution of any 
study -associated adverse events there will be no further adve rse event reports for that subject.

requirements, as well as t he possible risks involved with study participation.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_987379] appropriate method of handling missing valu es will be chosen based on the particular trial's 
goals, endpoints and context.  
 
Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized with n, mean, standard deviation and range.  Frequency counts and percentage  of 
subjects within each category will be presented for categorical data.  If applicable, Student’s t -
test may be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other and 
p-values will be reported.  If the calculated p -value is  below the threshold chosen for statistical 
significance (0.05, or 0.01 level) then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis.  Subgroup analyses may be performed to identify a subject  population that achieves 
the most benefit.   Interim results may also be collected an d reported as deemed necessary.

Study Design:  This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, 4 -part, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of once -daily 
(QD) treatment with PLN -[ZIP_CODE] in participants with idiopathic pul monary fibrosis 
(IPF).  
Each study part consists of an up to 28 -day screening period, a 4 -week (Part A), 
12-week (Parts B and C), or at least 24 -week (Part D) treatment period, and a 2 -week 
(±3 days)  post-treatment follow -up period.  Part A enrollment has b een completed, so 
is not further described herein; no further participants will be enrolled or treated in this 
part of the study. Part B enrollment has been completed; no further participants will be 
enrolled or treated in this part of the study.  Part C en rollment was initiated following 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of the clinical data supporting the 
evaluation of [ADDRESS_41097] dose of study drug.  
In Parts B, C and D, eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Rando mization will be stratified by [CONTACT_39578] (SoC) IPF therapy 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]) (SoC use; yes or no).  
In Part B, 29 eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (active:placebo) and 
treated for 12 weeks.  
In Part C, approximatel y 56 eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio 
([ADDRESS_41098] -[ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_41099] -[ZIP_CODE]:placebo) and treated for [ADDRESS_41100] -[ZIP_CODE] dose of 320 mg is planned for evaluation based on 
the follow ing criteria:  
 Part C has been completely enrolled (i.e., [ADDRESS_41101]- [ZIP_CODE] -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 3

o Safety and PK data from study , an ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_41102] -[ZIP_CODE] at multiple doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg in healthy 
participants, as described in the Investigator’s Brochure   
In Part D, approximately 28 eligible participants will be rando mized in a 3:1 ratio 
([ADDRESS_41103] -[ZIP_CODE]:placebo) on  Day 1 (Visit 2). Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_39580] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]) (SoC use; yes or no). Study 
treatment will be administered for at least [ADDRESS_41104] participant enrolled in Part D reaches Week 24. 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 
12 weeks (Parts  B and C) or at least 24 weeks (Part D) of treatment will b e asked to 
remain in the study to complete all remaining assessments; if this is not feasible, they 
will be asked to return to the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) visit for follow -up 
evaluations.  
The DSMB will assess participant safety at predetermine d intervals during the study, 
including prior to  initiating Part D and following the enrollment of the last participant 
in Part D.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 1 INTRODUCTION 
Pliant Therapeutics Inc. (Pliant) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_39558]-7 4809 for the treatment of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).  
IPF is a rare condition, usually of the elderly, characterized by [CONTACT_39584], with median survival of 3.8  years after diagnosis based on 
2014 data in the [LOCATION_002] (US). The hallmark honeycomb appearance of IPF on 
high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the result of extensive fibrosis 
. Although not completely understood, IPF has been proposed 
to stem from ongoing microinjury to alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Injured epi[INVESTIGATOR_39559] (TGF- β), which 
promote fibroblast recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation into fibrogenic 
myofibroblasts . As the disease progresses, 
actively proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts organize into fibroblastic foci and 
produce excessive fibrillar collagen that results in scarring of the lung which, in turn, leads to 
distortion of the tissue architecture and loss of function . 
As has also been indicated to be the case for other fibrotic conditions, signaling mediated by 
αv integrins is central to the control of fibrosis in the lungs. Specific roles proposed for α vβ6 
in epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] α vβ1 in myofibroblasts for induction of fibrosis are summarized in the 
Investigator’s Brochure for PLN -[ZIP_CODE]. 
PLN- [ZIP_CODE] is a small molecule and a selective dual inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins 
(50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50] , respectively). Additionally, 
integrin-ligand binding assays have demonstrated that PLN- [ZIP_CODE] is highly selective for α vβ6 
and α vβ1 over other integrin receptors, including those leukocyte-expressed integrins where 
therapeutic inhibition has previously been associated with significant toxicities (e.g., 
vedolizumab [ 47 inhibitor; increased risk of infections, potential risk of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); ] and 
natalizumab [ 41 and 47 inhibitor; increased risk of PML;  
]). PLN-[ZIP_CODE] reduced collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin-induced lung 
injury, a commonly used experimental model for IPF ( ). In ex vivo human 
IPF lung tissue (precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN-[ZIP_CODE] significantly decreased 
collagen type 11 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels after a 3-day 
incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice completely 
deficient for α vβ6 function live a normal lifespan ( ), suggesting that even 
full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated.

murine) exhibiting geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of  and 
 against the human receptors, respectively. 
Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) generated from IPF patient lungs collected during transplant 
were used to evaluate the ability of PLN-[ADDRESS_41135]-[ZIP_CODE] ( ), collagen gene expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation (a 
marker of TGF- β signaling) in IPF patient PCLS were significantly reduced by 
[CONTACT_3450] . Further studies with bleomycin-injured mouse PCLS also showed 
significant reductions in collagen gene expression observed at concentrations of PLN-[ADDRESS_41136]-[ZIP_CODE] were performed using the bleomycin mouse model of 
pulmonary fibrosis. In a prophylactic treatment study (PLN -[ADDRESS_41137] -bleomycin challenge), PLN -[ZIP_CODE] significantly decreased 
Ashcroft score, total hydroxyproline levels in lung tissue, and phosphorylation of  in 
lung tissue, confirming inhibition of collagen d eposition and TGF - signaling.   Similar 
effects were observed with therapeutic treatment with PLN -[ZIP_CODE] in the bleomycin model 
(oral administration from  days post -bleomycin challenge). Lung hydroxyproline 
levels were significantly reduced and morph ometric analysis of lung tissue showed a dose -
dependent and significant reduction in interstitial fibrillar collagen deposition in mice treated 
with PLN -[ZIP_CODE].  
The main purpose of the current study is to confirm that PLN-[ADDRESS_41138] of care (SoC), and

The DSMB will assess participant safety at predetermined intervals during the study, 
including prior to initiating Part D and following the enrollment of the last participant in

The total number of participants enrolled in Parts B, C, and D of the study will be 
approximately 112, with approximately [ADDRESS_41159]-[ZIP_CODE] in 
participants with IPF, with or without co-administration with SoC (pi[INVESTIGATOR_39563]- [ZIP_CODE] -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 25

in the assessment of drug safety and tolerability. Stratification for background treatment with 
SoC will ensure a similar proportion of participants in each treatment group. The proposed 
sample size and 12-week treatment duration of Parts B and C are expected to provide 
meaningful PK information in the IPF population, as well as allow for preliminary evaluation 
of dose-dependent treatment effects on  study endpoints, comparing PLN-[ADDRESS_41160]-[ZIP_CODE] 40 mg in Part B of this study is supported by [CONTACT_941] 13-week 
toxicology data, safety and PK data at these doses from study , as well as 
the PD findings from study , where this dose led to reduction of TGF- β 
activation in the lungs of healthy participants following 7 days of dosing, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_39589]2 (pSMAD2)/SMAD2 ratio in BALF (See PLN-[ZIP_CODE] 
Investigator’s Brochure for more details).  
The evaluation of PLN-[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg and 160 mg doses in Part C is supported by [CONTACT_39590] A and B, as well as safety and PK data evaluating 
higher doses (80 and 160 mg) from study .  
The evaluation of PLN-[ZIP_CODE] 320 mg in Part D is supported by [CONTACT_39591] B and C, as well as safety and PK data evaluating the higher dose (320 mg) 
from study .  
In Study , PLN -[ZIP_CODE] showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in 
healthy participants after single doses of up to  mg and after 7 days of treatment at doses 
of up to  mg ( Section 1.1.2 ). The safety margins determined after single doses of  
 mg and multiple doses of  mg were calculated using the NOAEL observed in 
toxicology studies in  for both area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) and C max for the measured  of 
PLN-[ZIP_CODE]. At all dose levels studied, there was a  between the unbound 
AUC 0-[ADDRESS_41161] level (NOAEL). See the PLN-[ZIP_CODE] 
Investigator's Brochure for more details. 
Comparison of the unbound AUC 0-24 across all doses studied in the relevant dose escalation 
Phase 1 studies (i.e., ) demonstrates that doses 
ranging from  in the SAD and  in the MAD remain  
 the NOAEL established in the  toxicology studies. 
The higher dose of 320 mg to be evaluated in Part D of this study provides a reasonable 
escalation and separation from the 80 and 160 mg doses evaluated in Part C, allowing for 
appropriate dose ranging  (please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for f urther details).  
Emerging data indicate that a [ADDRESS_41162] -[ZIP_CODE] achieves  
exposure,  expected to provide greater levels of α vβ6 target engagement, PD response and 
potential clinical benefit. Interim findings from an ongoing investigation measuring uptake 
kinetics of the α vβ6 knottin PET radiotracer in the IPF lung indicate > 90% target saturation 

Protocol PLN- [ZIP_CODE] -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page [ADDRESS_41163]-[ZIP_CODE] (Study PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-201). In addition, 
preliminary data investigating PK and PD effects in BALF from healthy participants 
demonstrate a dose- and concentration- dependent reduction of SMAD2 phosphorylation (a 
marker of reduced TGF- β signaling) when PLN-[ZIP_CODE] was dosed at  mg QD for 
7 days (Study ). These dose-dependent PD responses were associated with 
 PLN-[ZIP_CODE] concentrations that exceeded the cell- based α vβ6 IC50 (protein binding-
corrected) for 6 hours (at  mg) or 24 hours (at  mg). A greater PD response is expected 
from a 320 mg dose, which is projected to achieve  concentrations that approach  
αvβ6 IC80 at steady-state. These higher  exposures achieved with a 320 mg QD dose 
are expected to elicit increased α vβ6 target engagement and additional PD response,  leading 
to reduced TGF- β signaling in the lung  and potentially slowing the clinical progression of 
pulmonary fibrosis. 
Part D initiation will be contingent on DSMB review of the above-mentioned data from 
Part C.  
Findings from this study will inform dose selection for future IPF studies. 
3.3 Study Duration  
The duration for Parts B and C of the study will be up to 18 weeks each (up to 4 weeks of 
screening, 12 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up). 
The duration for Part D of the study will be variable depending on the study enrollment rate; 
i.e. the time between enrolling the first and last participant. The minimum duration of 
participation will be up to [ADDRESS_41164] participant enrolled (up to 4 weeks of 
screening, 24 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up) and a maximum 
of up to [ADDRESS_41165] participant enrolled (up to 4 weeks of screening, up to 
48 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up).  
The end of study will commence once the last participant reaches 24 weeks of treatment. At 
that time, all study participants will complete their next scheduled visit (End of Treatment 
[EoT]) and the 2 weeks of follow up (End of Study [EoS]).

 Hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1) 
 Copper intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1) 
Male Participants 
Male participants, including those who are surgically sterile, must agree to use contraceptive 
measures as defined below, or alternately to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual 
intercourse)   
 Male participants, with female partners of childbearing potential, must use a condom 
plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% 
per year or remain abstinent during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_41196] dose of study treatment. 
 Male participants with pregnant female partners are excluded from this study  
 Male participants whose female partners become pregnant during the study must stop 
the medication immediately as outlined in Section 8.6 
 
 
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those with a failure rate of < 1% per

The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception. Complete abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method when refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment.

causal relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and  
unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been presen t prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or 
a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reporte d as an AE/SAE). Events 
that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
- Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
- Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• If there is evidence of an AE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee 
will evaluate further and record the following information:  
- Time of onset and resolution  
- Severity  
- Causality/relation to study treatment

Grading the severity of AEs will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grading system (  as described below. The clinical significance of the 
AE is determined by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator is encouraged to consult with the 
Study Director.

recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The following definitions 
are general guidelines to help assign grade of attribution.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN -[ZIP_CODE] or placebo) should be 
assessed usi ng clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
No  
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug. For 
SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing condition, 
underlying disease, intercurre nt illness, or concomitant medication).  
Yes 
(related):  A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the 
study drug that cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state 
or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, the  AE appears with some degree of 
certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic 
actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of 
the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations:  
No 
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study procedure.  
Yes 
(related):  The AE occurred as a result of protocol -mandated procedures.  
 
8.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:

• Recovering / Resolving  
• Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae  
• Not Recovered / Not Resolving  
• Fatal  
• Unknown

participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be followed through the 
outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information 
to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so. 
The pregnancy will be followed through delivery. If the pregnancy results in a congenital 
anomaly/birth defects/miscarriage, this will be considered and reported as an SAE as per 
definition detailed in Section 8.8. 
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, , vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or 
symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as described in 
Section 8.2 (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious, as described in 
Section 8.8). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that are 
detected after consent or that are present at baseline and worsen after consent are included as 
AEs (and SAEs if serious). 
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. 
Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or 
be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical 
symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate 
consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_39597], yet be of a magnitude to require glucose 
administration to prevent such sequelae.

• Is life-threatening 
- An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_39571], its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not

clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant, or when medical or surgical 
intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
- Examples of such events include but are not limited to: laboratory abnormalities

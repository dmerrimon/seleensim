 1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose:  
The primary objective of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, safety and targeted 
outcomes of a 3 -month hatha and restorative yoga intervention to decrease sedentary 
behavior (primary outcome), stress and blood pressure in 60 sedentary (<3 0 minutes of 
moderate -to-vigorous PA per week) African -American women.  The proposed study has four 
aims:  
Aim 1 : To refine a promising and innovative intervention to enhance its feasibility.  Based on 
our previously developed intervention, I HEART Yoga!, and subsequent experience, we will 
refine intervention strategies to incorporate findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_288018]  (i.e., social connectedness, sense of belonging, and 
community cohesion). We will conduct two focus groups of sedentary African -American women 
(n=16) to seek feedback on the intervention strategies (e.g., yoga sequences).  
Aim 2 : Assess feasibility of a ha tha and restorative yoga intervention (n=30) compared to a 
control group (n=30). We will examine feasibility of participant recruitment, retention and 
adherence; fidelity of intervention delivery; and intervention materials.  
Aim 3 : Evaluate the acceptabil ity and safety of a hatha and restorative yoga intervention (n=30) 
compared to a control group (n=30). We will examine the acceptability of intervention location 
and strategies, class format, enjoyment of sessions, and safety of the intervention.  
Aim 4 : To test feasibility and appropriateness of the targeted outcomes (i.e., primary: sedentary 
behavior and secondary: blood pressure and stress) for subsequent trials. It is important to 
properly measure expected outcomes but not make comparisons between inter vention and 
control groups.  
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
A sedentary lifestyle is associated with chronic cardiovascular and physiological diseases and 
psychological disorders.1,2 Indeed, the 2018 Phy sical Activity Guidelines for Americans 
emphasize targeting sedentary time (i.e., waking behaviors in a seated or reclining posture at 
low energy expenditure8), independent of total activity .1,2 The Guidelines state: “Adults should 
move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better than none.”[ADDRESS_351081] 10 years: (a) adults spend inordinate time 
sedentary (~7.5 hr/day on average);10-16 (b) physiological mechanisms linking sedentary time to 
increased chronic disease risk are understood;17-19 and (c) excess mortality due to sedentary 
behavior is substantial.20,[ADDRESS_351082] 
sedentary lifestyles,22 a “move more and sit less” philosophy to target decreasing sedentary 
behavior is appropriate . Sedentary lifestyle has contributed to African -American women being 
80% more likely to be overweight or obesity compared to non -Hispanic  white women,[ADDRESS_351083] be addressed. Decreasing 
sedentary time has many mental, s ocial, and psychological health benefits.25,27 Given the 
current state of health statistics among African -American women, it remains critical to find 
innovative ways to decrease sedentary time in this population.  
2.2 Preliminary Data:  
Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_288019] -Anderson conducted a 6 -month, randomized controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_288020], I 
HEART Yoga!,  with 59 overweight, sedentary African -American women.28 Thirty women were 
randomized to the intervention group and offered in -person and online yoga classes; the [ADDRESS_351084] -intervention focus group revealed that participants enjoyed 
the intervention and posted several affirmations on a private Facebook group page. Although the 
feedback was positive, there were several areas of I HEART Yoga!  pi[INVESTIGATOR_288021], thus warranting the proposed YogaMoves feasibility 
study to test refined strategies.  
2.3 Existing Literature:  
Previous interventions to decrease sedentary behavior in African -American women. Previous 
intervention s for African -American  women to address sedentary lifestyles have mainly included 
traditional physical activity strategies such as walking, aerobics and dance.29-[ADDRESS_351085] utilized of the interventions, are easy to implemen t, require minimum equipment, and 
usually are safe and acceptable for high -risk populations,32 such as sedentary adults carrying 
excess weight. However, focus groups with African -American women reported that the 
repetitiveness and monotony of traditional exercise interventions (i.e., walking and aerobics) 
may reduce motivat ion33 or cause musculoskeletal issues that may make typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], repetitive 
weight -bearing exercise uncomfortable or painful.[ADDRESS_351086] to encourage less sedentary beh avior; 
improve strength, balance, and flexibility,[ADDRESS_351087] anywhere at a variety of intensities, 
and can be used to decrease inactivity.36 However , yoga introduc es not only physical movement, 
but also mindfulness and deep breathing that can lead to mental and psychological benefits,37 
and may be as effective as higher intensity activity for improving some health -related 
outcomes.38  
How can yoga decrease sedentary behavior? Preliminary research suggests that there a re 
several mechanisms proposed for yoga to lead to better health outcomes. Biological mechanisms 
related to the autonomic nervous system have been connected to lowering blood pressure.[ADDRESS_351088] less sedentary lifestyles.  
In the U.S., yoga has become increasingly popular in recent years. From the 2017 National 
Health I nterview Survey (NHIS) Adult Complementary and Alternative questionnaire, over [ADDRESS_351089] year.51 Although yoga has the 
reputation of attracting college -educated, white populations52 and is sometimes viewed as 
exclusionary to those outside that community, it has become increasingly popular among African -
Americans with the growth of Afrocentric yoga (i.e., focusing on Black or African culture),[ADDRESS_351090] 10% of African -Americans have practiced yoga in the past year compared to 13.5% of 
white Americans.51  
African -American women attend mainstream (i.e ., majority white) yoga classes, but they 
do not always continue, partially due to unfamiliarity with various aspects of yoga.47 Chanting, 
use of Sanskrit instead of English to name [CONTACT_102947], and “religious” sounding music can stimulate 
preconceived notions that yoga conflicts with religious beliefs.47 An additional barrier to adopting 
and sustaining a yoga practice is not feeling included due to the lack of representation of f uller -
body, African -American yoga practitioners.47 Previous yoga studies that targeted African -
Americans and modified classes to make it more culturally acceptable46,47 (i.e., no chanting, 
generic instrumental music, English names for poses, matching yoga instructors by [CONTACT_288045]), reported that participants found yoga to be more acceptable. One study even 
reported that 100% of the pa rticipants were still practicing yoga three months after the 
intervention.[ADDRESS_351091] been critical in African -American 
women being open to practicing yoga and subsequently re cognizing the health benefits.57 
In summary, the scientific premise  of our proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_288022] -American 
women are highly affected by a sedentary lifestyle, and yoga is an engaging activity with 
biological and psychological mechanisms39-41 having promise to reduce sedentary behavior and 
improve health outcomes such as blood pressure and stress. The proposed study is highly 
significant given that it will address the need for innovative and culturally acceptable appr oaches 
to reduce sedentary time among those at elevated risk for chronic diseases.

4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Interaction(s)  
4.1 Description:  
Formative assessment focus groups : After the research team revises the intervention 
strategies, the newly revised intervention strategies, including yoga sequence, will be presented 
and discussed during two focus groups of [ADDRESS_351092] virtually approximately in April - June 2021.  
Yoga intervention : Please note that although we are anticipating conducting the yoga pi[INVESTIGATOR_288023] -person, it is dependent on whether it is safe to have face -to-face contact [CONTACT_288046] -19. If it is deemed unsafe to have face -to-face contact, the MPIs will submit a 
modification to IRB to reflect this change. Additionally, if it is safe to conduct the intervention 
face -to-face, the MPIs will submit the University -required “Sunrise Plan” outlining risk 
mitigation related to COVID -19.  
 
[ADDRESS_351093]. 60 participants will be randomly assigned to the yoga intervention (n=30) or 
control condition (n=30). It is anticipated that the yoga intervention will be a hybrid delivery 
(combination of in -person and virtual)  (June  – Augus t 2022) at two intervention locations, [ADDRESS_351094] with control participants during the 
implementation of the yoga intervention. The yoga intervention components are:  
• Hybrid , 60-minute yoga s essions  will take place three times per week for [ADDRESS_351095] to provide feedback as a group on how the practice felt and strategies for 
integration into ones’ daily life . Specifically , each session will include gentle hatha yoga 
which includes physical poses combined with stretching, breathing and some 
meditation. A proposed session would include:  
o Warm -Up: Controlled Breathing Meditation & Mindfulness  (10 minutes): Mindful 
breathing (4 -6 second inhales/exhales) through nose to increase focus on yoga 
practice and to build internal heat to better prepare the body for movement  
o Warm -Up: Gentle Movement  (5 minutes): Child’s, Cat/cow, Thread the needle, 
Side puppy  
o Active Movement: Strength, F lexibility & Balance Poses  (20 mins):  
o Cool Down: Stretching Poses  (10 mins): Cobbler’s, Seated forward fold, Legs up 
the wall, Happy baby, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_245302]  
o Cool Down: Resting Pose  (5 mins): Final resting pose on back using props  
o Sharing Circle & Wrap -Up (10 mi ns): Group gathers in circle and share feedback 
about yoga session  
These classes will be held in -person, but there will be a synchronous option for participants 
to join virtually. Yoga sessions will be led by [CONTACT_288047]. As preparation for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], they will participate in 
intervention -specific training developed by [CONTACT_288048] (1) instructing yoga 
as part of  a scientific study, and (2) the practice of restorative yoga for race -based 
trauma. They will be provided yoga sequences outlined by [CONTACT_288049] 15.2.     
 
• A private Facebook group  will be set up to keep participants connected to each other, 
thus further promoting collectivism, and for the research staff to maintain contact [CONTACT_288050]. Participants will be able to post freely to the 
Facebook page to stay  connected, offer encouragement, and provide accountability to 
attend the weekly yoga sessions. Research assistants will keep track of the number of 
posts and “likes” each participant makes. Research staff will use Facebook to maintain 
contact [CONTACT_288051]: 1) provide a weekly reminder for 
upcoming yoga sessions and workshops; 2) inform/remind participants of the biweekly 
themes of the sessions  – there will be a new theme every other week (i.e., weeks 1, 3, 5, 
7, 9, 11) ; and 3)  remain accessible to participants for assistance or requested 
information participants may need . This contact [CONTACT_288052].

 • To align with and reinforce the biweekly themes established for the weekly yoga 
sessions (i.e., common yoga poses, the importan ce of breath, strengthening your core), 
biweekly, hybrid  workshops  will be offered. These workshops  will take place during 
weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and will be specialty classes that allow participants 
additional exposure to meditation and breathing an d longer class formats so they can 
delve deeper into yogic philosophy and practice. These workshops will be held in -
person, but there will be a synchronous option for participants to join virtually.  
Data collection : Yoga intervention and control participa nts (n=60) will complete baseline 
(March  – May  2022), post -intervention ( September – October 2022), and 3 -month follow -up 
measures ( January – February 2023) in-person at the University of Minnesota’s Epi[INVESTIGATOR_288024] . 
Post -intervention  focus groups : Four groups (high attendance and low attendance from each 
intervention location) of randomly chosen  intervention participants ( anticipated n~20) will be 
invited to participate in a post -intervention focus group to assess intervention feasibility, 
acceptability, and safety with the overall program and specific components, and in order to 
inform program improvements. Focus groups will take place at  the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_288025] . 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design:  
Our proposed feasibility study will be two -arm, RCT with 60 participants randomly assigned to 
either an intervention group (n=30) or control group (n=30).  
5.2 Study Procedures:  
Formative assessment focus groups  will be conducted in April - June 2021. Data collected from 
these focus groups will be qualitative feedback on the proposed intervention strategies. The  
focus group guide is submitted with this IRB application.  
Data collected directly related to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_288026]:  
• Quality control data to make sure the yoga movements follow protocol and are safe for 
participants will be collected duri ng the implementation of the yoga intervention. One 
yoga session will be randomly selected biweekly (during weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) and 
videotaped so the content can be analyzed based on the established criteria related to 
poses, breathing and medita tion. During these videotaped quality control sessions, 
participants will be asked to wear the activPAL to assess activity intensity.  
• Acceptability of yoga classes will be assessed during the yoga intervention via a short 
self-reported survey after each yo ga session. The survey is included with this 
application.  
• Three, in -person data collection time points: baseline ( March – May  2022), post -
intervention ( September – October 2022), and 3 -month follow -up measures ( January – 
February 2023). Data to be collected during these time points are:  
o Sedentary behavior  will be assessed with the activPAL3 micro accelerometer 
(PAL Technologies, Glasgow, [LOCATION_008]) for seven consecutive days at 
 
[ADDRESS_351096] -intervention and 3 -month follow -up periods. The activPAL provides a 
valid and reliable measure of posture (sitting/lying vs. standing) for free -living 
settings58,59 and uses a transducer suitable for detecting lower intensity 
movem ents.60 The activPAL will be waterproofed using m edical grade adhesive 
covering and attached to the midline of the thigh  using a breathable, 
hypoallergenic tape. This method allows for the monitor to be worn 
continuously without removing for bathing or other water -based activities (a 
valuable feature tha t reduces missing data).  
o Blood pressure  will be objectively measured using BpTRU BPM -200 (VSM 
MedTech Ltd, Coquitlam, Canada), an automated blood pressure recorder that 
has been validated against the mercury sphygmomanometer.[ADDRESS_351097].  
o Stress  will be measured in two different ways: biomarkers of physiologi cal stress 
using cortisol saliva and perceived stress using questionnaires. Acute stress will 
be assessed using salivary cortisol levels taken at three different times (upon 
waking, 30 minutes after waking, and before going to bed) for 2 days at each 
data collection time point (assayed by [CONTACT_288053] ).62 Participants will be 
provided detailed instructions. Kits will be sent home with participants with clear 
instructions for capturing saliva samples in the morning and evening, and storing 
the d ate- and time -labeled plastic vials in their home freezer to be carried with 
them to their next clinic visit. Chronic stress will be assessed using common, valid 
self-report measures.63-65 
o Additional measures : Trained research staf f will collect height , weight , and body 
fat %  using a Shorr Height measuring board and Tanita BF -350 scale, 
respectively, to calculate BMI. Diet will be assessed using NCI’s web -based 
dietary recall, ASA -24, which has been validated in adults.66 A self -reported 
survey will be completed that inquiries on demographic characteristics (age, sex, 
marital status, education level, income), physical activity -related psychosocial 
variables (social support,67 self-efficacy,68 barriers,69 enjoyment70), eating -related 
behaviors (intuitive eating,71 eating as a copi[INVESTIGATOR_56979]72), and additional 
variables (collectivism,73 social connectedness,74 sense of belonging,75 
community cohesion76and embodiment77). The survey with the listed measures 
is included with this application.  
Post -intervention focus groups  to assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and safety with 
the overall program and specific components, and in order to inform program improvements 
will be completed September  2022. The focus group guide is submitted with this IRB 
application.  
5.3 Follow -Up: 
The data to be collected at follow -up are outlined in the previous section: sedentary behavior 
using activPAL, blood pressure using an automated blood pressure recorder , stress using 
 
11 of 29 
 salivary cortisol samples and a survey, height, weight, and bo dy fat % measured by [CONTACT_92519], and a survey of additional measures.  
5.4 Individually Identifiable Health Information:  
PHI will not be collected from any participants.  
6.0 Data Banking  
N/A 
7.[ADDRESS_351098] -intervention focus groups : After each set of focus groups, 
research staff will summarize the findings in a report that will be shared with respective focus 
group participants. This methodology is referred to as member checking and allow s the focus 
group participants the opportunity to provide feedback on whether the content of the 
summary accurately depi[INVESTIGATOR_288027].  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_288028] : Findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_288029] a 
presentation . Participants will have the opportunity to provide additional feedback  and the 
research team will discuss plans for next steps. Additionally, the research team  will utilize other 
online and media platforms, such as social media, i nfographics, videos, and podcasts, to 
disseminate our findings to a broader audience .  
 
8.0 Study Duration

10.2 Additional Safeguards:  
By [CONTACT_288054], all participants will be minority women, specifically African -American 
women over the age of 18 years. African -American women are disproportionately affected with 
a sedentary lifestyle, excessive weight, hypertension, and stress. Ov er 60% of African -American 
women report being sedentary, and 80% are more likely to be at higher weight status (BMI >25 
kg/m2) compared to non -Hispanic white women. These statistics underscore that a significant 
public health problem, a sedentary lifestyle,  coupled with overweight/obesity, is associated with 
chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension) and psychological disorders. Decreasing sedentary behavior 
has mental, social, and psychological health benefits in adults, independent of total physical 
activity. Given the current state of health statistics in African -American women, finding 
innovative ways to decrease sedentary time in this population are of particular interest. Inclusion 
of African -American women is essential to the success of this project.  
 
Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion at recruitment and during the intervention due to the possible 
risk of engaging in yoga if a participant is randomized to the yoga intervention group. However, 
if a participant becomes pregnant after the intervention has  ended which overlaps with the post -
intervention and follow -up data collection periods, they will be retained and included in the 
study. Data collection at all time points include completing an electronic survey, wearing an 
activity monitor that tracks phy sical activity with the request for participants not to alter their 
usual behavior, and collecting salivary samples which entails collecting less than an ounce of 
saliva over two days. All of the data collection are of minimal risk to pregnant women.  
The potential adverse events anticipated in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_288034] (e.g., muscle strain, fainting, falling) as well as other complications from comorbidities 
such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and medication use. Participants will be instructed to 
call their healthcare provider and notify the research staff if they experience an injury or any 
adverse event. As a proactive measure, a detailed plan for monitoring risks, tracking and 
reporting adverse events will be e stablished at the start of the study. Adverse events will be 
classified as severe (cause major disruption to participant’s life, e.g. sprain, broken bone, 
cardiovascular event, death), moderate (causes minor inconvenience to participant, e.g. 
fainting spel l, sore muscles for >3 days), and mild (no major impact on participant, e.g. 
headache, sore muscles for 2 -3 days).  The PIs will implement the data collection form for 
monitoring side effects and adverse events on a routine basis.  The research assistants w ill 
administer this questionnaire weekly during the study to track any side effects or adverse 
events.   
 
[ADDRESS_351102] (DSMB) has been mandated by [CONTACT_22866], NIH. 
Members of the DSMC will be three senior PhD -level researchers including a biostatistician. The 
research staff will submit a written monitoring report to the DSMB twice a year (April and 
October).  
To further protect participants, participants will clearly know that they can end participation at 
any time, researchers will provide information to participants for UMN IRB advisors to report 
any activity that the find troublesome, and research staff will undergo cultural sensitivity 
training.

For formative assessment focus groups , a maximum number of 16 (minimum of 12) participants 
will be enrolled for an average of [ADDRESS_351103],  a maximum number of 60 (minimum of 54) participants will be enr olled for an 
average of [ADDRESS_351104] -intervention focus groups.  
12.0 Recruitment Methods  
12.1 Recruitment Process:  
Participants will be recruited using  radio and print newspaper advertisements in media outlets 
with a predominantly African -American  audience; social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and 
Twitter) posts targeting l ocal, African -American individuals, groups and organizations; email 
blasts distributed to local churches, community centers, libraries, and community organizations 
(particularly health organizations such as NorthPoint Health & Wellness Center, Smiley’s Cli nic, 
Whittier Clinic) that serve African -Americans  and/or women in the North Minneapolis area of 
Minnesota. All recruitment materials will have culturally appropriate representations  of 
African -American women and examples are provided in this application.  
12.2 Source of Participants:  
Participants will be drawn from the greater Twin Cities, MN area.  
12.3 Identification of Potential Participants:  
All recruitment materials will have contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone number and email address) that 
interested participants will use to express their desire to be involved in the study. All potential 
participants must self -identify as an African -American woman over the age of 18.  
Initial contact [CONTACT_288055] d on the 
IRB application; these research staff members will be trained by [CONTACT_288056].  
12.4 Recruitment Materials:  
 
16 of 29 
 Materials that will be used to recruit participants and are included in this application are:  
• Flyer to be distributed via email and social media  
• Text for social media posts  
• Text for print newspaper posts  
• Transcript for recorded radio posts  
12.5 Payment:  
For the formative assessment focus groups , each participant will receive $25 as a thank you for 
their feedback and time.  
For each data collection timepoint , each participant will receive $50 for completing 
assessments, which includes wearing activPAL for 7 days; collecting two salivary samples; 
having blood pressure, height, weight, and body fat % measured  by [CONTACT_32341]; and 
completing an electronic survey. After completing the in -person baseline assessment, each 
participant will receive $5 to complete an online survey. There are three data collection 
timepoints: baseline, post -intervention, and [ADDRESS_351105] 
participants (both intervention and control participants) are able to receive up to $[ADDRESS_351106] -intervention focus groups  will 
receive a meal during the focus group and a $[ADDRESS_351107] as a thank you for their 
feedback and time.  
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Because participants will be rigorously screened for participating, we will not withdraw any 
participants from the study. Only participants who are eligible and pass the screening will be 
recruited for the study. However, participants can assent or withdra w from the study at any 
given point , they will not be questioned nor will face penalty.   
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  
This is a voluntary study, so participants can withdraw at any time during the study without any 
penalty or consequences.  Once a participant wi thdraws from the study, there will be no 
attempt to collect additional data from them.  
13.3 Termination Procedures:  
 
17 of 29 
 It is highly unlikely that any one would be terminated from the study by [CONTACT_16133], but 
participants may choose to withdraw and terminate their participation. In those cases, all 
available data may potentially still be used in data analysis.  
14.0 Risks to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Formative assessment and post -intervention focus groups : N/A  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393] : The potential risks to participants assigned to the yoga intervention , 
including psychological, social, and legal, are considered minimal. The potential adverse events 
anticipated in our intervention would be injuries due to participation in yoga (e.g., muscle 
strain, fainting, falling) as well as other complications from c omorbidities such as obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes and medication use. Participants will be instructed to call their 
healthcare provider and notify the research staff if they experience an injury or any adverse 
event. As a proactive measure, a detailed p lan for monitoring risks, tracking and reporting 
adverse events will be established at the start of the study. Adverse events will be classified as 
severe (cause major disruption to participant’s life, e.g. sprain, broken bone, cardiovascular 
event, death) , moderate (causes minor inconvenience to participant, e.g. fainting spell, sore 
muscles for >3 days), and mild (no major impact on participant, e.g. headache, sore muscles for 
2-3 days).  Any adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and IRB. If an adverse event does 
occur, t he only alternative to participation in the intervention is not to participate, which 
eligible participants are able to opt out.  
14.2 Reproduction Risks:  
N/A 
14.3 Risks to O thers:  
N/A 
15.0 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception  
15.1 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception:  
There is no incomplete disclosure or deception to be utilized in this study.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
16.1 Potential Benefits:  
Formative assessment focus groups : No direct benefits are expected.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] : Participants enrolled in the yoga intervention will potentially receive the direct health 
benefits associated with regularly practicing yoga.  
17.0 Statistical Considerations  
17.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
Aims [ADDRESS_351108]: a) the count of women 
 
[ADDRESS_351109], b) weeks elapsed to screen 200 women, and c) num ber enrolled and 
consented as a % of the targets  – 16 for focus groups and 60 for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. For 
retention and adherence , we will compute % of participants  who attend > 80% of the yoga 
sessions by [CONTACT_288057] -person sessions.  For intervention fidelity , [CONTACT_288064] -
Anderson will analyze the videotaped yoga sessions  using established criteria to enumerate the 
number of planned specific yoga components that were completed as a percentage of the total . 
For feasibility  we will compute  the percentage of participants  who: a) receive the materials and 
resources throughout the intervention, b) rate the assessments as ‘not too burdensome’ on a 
multiple choice question, and c) complete baseline, post -intervention, and follow -up 
assessments. For acceptability  we will compute the percentage of participants  who rate the 
various intervention components as acceptable. For safety  we will track all adverse events 
experienced by [CONTACT_4317], report them to the UMN IRB, and compare to the benchmarks. If 
benchmark goals are not met, we will explore why they were not met during the post -
intervention focus groups in hopes of gaining su bstantive information to address the missed 
benchmark goals in the future trial.  
Aim 4. Targeted Outcomes .  Per the NCCIH’s “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4287]: Common Uses and Misuse”,77 the 
rese arch team do not intend to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. The behavioral and 
biological outcome data will be used to inform the design of the future trial by [CONTACT_288058]/adherence problems with measures and suggesting effect size ex pectations.  Data 
will be cleaned for errors and outliers, checked for normality, and transformed if necessary. The 
primary behavioral outcome will be time spent sitting/lying down from the activPAL3 as the 
gold standard measure of sedentary time.  The res earch team will also analyze standing, 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sit -stand transitions, and moderate and vigorous physical activity data from the 
activPAL.  Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic average of three measurements), perceived 
stress, anthropometry and other ex ploratory measures will be analyzed similarly.  If missing 
data  exceed 10% multiple imputation will be performed in addition to complete case analysis.  
For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will report 95% confidence intervals.  
Proposed statistical analyses are outlined abo ve.  
17.2 Data Integrity:  
There are two PIs for this study and the leadership plan helps to maintain the integrity of this 
study. [CONTACT_288064] -Anderson will be responsible for overseeing intervention development, 
implementation, and qualitative evaluation and will not be involved with data collection and 
analyses. [CONTACT_288065] , along with our analyst and biostatistician , will lead quantitative data

18.9 Links to identifiable data:  
As participants are enrolled in the study, they will receive a unique identifier that will be 
attached to all of their research materials (i.e., data collection and assessments, intervention 
materials). A password -protected document will contain identifyin g information and will only 
be accessible by [CONTACT_288060] . In accordance 
with NIH guidelines (i.e., the funding agency), identifiable data will be destroyed 5 years after 
the conclusion of the study.  
18.10  Sharing of Data with Research Team Members.  
Electronic files will be stored in the University’s Box Secure Storage and only authorized 
research staff will have access to a given file (i.e., measurement staff, but not intervention staff, 
will be able to ac cess baseline data files).  
 
18.11  Storage and Disposal of Paper Documents:  
We do not anticipate any paper documents as we will use electronic forms only. However, in 
the case that we have to use paper documents, we will keep all paper data collection forms in 
locked filing cabinets housed in the School of Kinesiology or Division of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_288035] 5 years after the conclusion of the study.  
19.0 Confidentiality  
19.1 Data Security:  
All data collected , especially participant information,  during the study will be treated with strict 
confidentiality. Information will be entered into our data files by [CONTACT_24655] (without 
recording individual names), thus assuring anonymity. Only authorized  research staff will have 
access to participant  identities  or condition allocation (i.e., [CONTACT_288065] and the measurement 
team will be blind to condition allocation) . When the research team  report s study  results, 
 
[ADDRESS_351114] (or 
will) completed human subjects training.  
Yoga classes will be recorded as part of the intervention and will be stored on a password -
protected, view -only Google Drive. Videos will focus on instructors, with t he goal of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_288036]. Instructors will sign a video release form and participants will 
consent to being recorded in case of audio being pi[INVESTIGATOR_288037]. Only the research 
team and participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_288038] a ccess to the catalog of yoga videos. No 
identifiable information will be shared over the videos.  
 
20.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
 
20.1 Data Integrity Monitoring.  
Drs. Barr -Anderson and Pereira will be responsible for monitoring the safety of this study, 
executing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), complying with any reporting 
requirements, and consulting with the DSMB about any adverse events  that may occur.  If 
funding agency -mandated DSMB will receive formal reports from the research staff twice per 
year. The DSM report will include the participants’ socio -demographic characteristics, expected 
versus actual recruitment rates, retention rates, quality assurance, or regulatory issues that 
occurred during the past year, a summary of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol. The DSM report will also 
include, when available, the results of any interim outcome analyses. In addit ion to the annual 
DSM report, the PI s will be responsible for informing NIH of any IRB actions within two weeks of 
their occurrence as well as any substantial changes or amendments to the study protocol prior 
to their implementation.  
20.2 Data Safety Monitoring . 
No Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are expected as a result of the 
study procedures or intervention.  If any AEs or SAEs occur during the study, they will be 
documented  by [CONTACT_288061]. Quality control videos will be collected biweekly (i.e., 
every other week – weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). Although these videos are intended to 
make sure yoga instructors are following the training protocol, the resear ch staff will be 
able to use the videos to identify any participants who may be performing yoga poses 
that could put her at an increased risk for injury. Yoga instructors will review and correct 
any injury risks participants . Please note that all yoga inst ructors will be 200 -hour 
certified (Yoga Alliance registered) with current CPR certification and at least one year 
experience teaching yoga. The yoga proposed for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_288039] a 
combination of hatha and restorative yoga, which is lower i ntensity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_288040]. Additionally, the instructors will be trained on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]’s yoga protocol by [CONTACT_288062]: two 500 -hour and one 250 -
hour certified yoga teachers.

TITLE  Phase 1/2 Study of a CpG -Activated Whole Cell Vaccine 
Followed by [CONTACT_656135] “Immunotransplant” for Mantle 
Cell Lymphoma  
STUDY PHASE  Phase 1/[ADDRESS_883374] 
OR PROCEDURE  CpG -MCL Vaccine  
Vaccine -primed T cells  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S)  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate freedom 
from molecular residual disease at one year post -autologous 
transplant.  
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S)  Secondary objectives  are Time To Clinical Progression 
(TTP),  and evaluation of anti-tumor immune responses 
after vaccination, and after immunotransplant.   
TREATMENT SUMMARY  Patients will undergo excisional tumor biopsy or apheresis 
(for patients with significant peripheral bloo d involvement), 
to obtain at least 1.5 x 109 malignant cells, which will be 
used to produce a patient -specific “CpG -MCL” vaccine.  
Patients will receive standard induction chemotherapy.  
Once in remission and after recovery of sufficient number 
of T cells,  patients will receive three ‘priming’  CpG -MCL 
vaccinations at within a period of 21 days (4 -7 day 
intervals ).  Within approximately four weeks thereafter, 
patients will receive an infusion of rituximab as an in vivo 
“purge” as per standard institutional protocol, followed by 
[CONTACT_656136] -primed T cells.  In 
preparation for AHCT, patients will then  undergo 
peripheral blood progenitor  cell (PBPC) harvesting, 
myeloablative chemotherapy, and AHCT per standard 
institutional protocol.  Between day [ADDRESS_883375] -transplant.   
 
Based on the 2 -Stage Simon Optimal Design with both 
error rates below 0.1 for testing a null (unacceptable) rate of 
MRD of 70% agai nst an alternative (acceptable) rate of 
85% has [ADDRESS_883376] stage, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656117] 14 or fewer successes (MRD negative 
patients), otherwise going on to a total of 59 patients, 
   
CpG -MCL Vaccine Study  
 Version: Amend  5:April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089   IND #[ADDRESS_883377] 46 
successes (MRD negative patients) and results determined 
favorable to move to additional clinical investigation. If the 
true rate is 70%, the expected number of patients is 36, and 
the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270478] 1 is 58%. This design 
minimizes the expected number of patients exposed to an 
ineffective treatment, given the error rates.  
 
In addition, to determine if chemotherapy regimen does 
influence MRD rates, we will stratify MRD status by 
[CONTACT_656137].  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
Secon dary outcome analysis will focus on TTP (from the 
date of autoHCT). TTP among patients evaluable will be 
reported including measure of centrality and variance of the 
outcome.  
 
The immune response will also be reported descriptively at 
the completion of the trial.  
 
Correlative Biomarker Endpoints  
At the completion of the trial, we will explore new putative 
immune biomarkers of clinical response (molecular MRD 
at 1 year).  
 
Stopp ing rules:  
Though similar studies using PF -3512676, whole -cell 
cancer vaccines, and re -infusion of T cells post -transplant 
have shown minimal associated  adverse events , we will 
assess the patient cohort in an ongoing manner and use the 
following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] r ule for the Serious Adverse Events of: 
non-engraftment or early death (within 100 days from 
transplant) from any cause.  
 
After patient number:   8 16 24 
Non-engraftment seen in:  2 4 5 
Early mortality seen in:               3      5 6 
 
This rule would stop the study if the statistics indicate the 
possibility with even 80% certainty that the non -
engraftment rate is > 10% or the early mortality rate is > 
15%.

Secondary endpoints  are Time To Clinical Progression (TTP) ,  and evaluation of anti-tumor  
immune  responses after vaccination, and after im munotransplant.   
 
An additional consideration will be to determine feasibility; specifically what proportion of 
enrolled patients will be able to complete the  entire  immunotransplant protocol.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 RATIONALE  
2.1.1  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): prognosis and treatment  
Mantle  cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) subtype [1], 
representing 4 -6% of all NHL [2]. The characteristic molecular featur e of MCL, the (11;14) 
(q13;q32) translocation, places the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus upstream of the BCL1 
gene, resulting in over -expression of its cyclin D1 gene product. In a series of 1361 patients 
diagnosed from 1988 to 1990, MCL carried the wors t long -term failure -free and overall survival 
rate of any of the major subtypes [3]. The poor prognosis of patients with MCL makes it 
imperative to deve lop more effective treatments [4]. To date, no therapy has been shown to be 
curative for a significant proportion of patients, and , thus, there is no broadly recognized 
standard of care for MCL. Unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_3252] -morbid conditions or very advanced age, 
most patients are currently treated with either a R -CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisone) -like reg imen followed by [CONTACT_656138] -intense versions of CHOP 
sometimes alternated with methotrexate and/or cytarabine. While such a hyper -CVAD+MA 
regimen has shown encouraging results in single -institution phase 2 studies, it was associated 
with significant m orbidity, an 8% treatment related mortality and less satisfactory results in 
patients over age 60 years [5].  CHOP -like induction followed by [CONTACT_656139] a median 
progression -free survival (PFS) of 39 months, significantly longer th an the 17 months for 
patients randomized to consolidat ion with interferon (p=0.018). Though AHCT  demonstrated a 
prolongation in PFS, there was a continuous pattern of disease recurrence in this phase 3 trial[6]. 
The addition of ritu ximab to induction therapy has yielded significantly higher response rates in 
randomized and non -randomized trials [7-10].  In the context of AHCT for MCL, molecular 
remission as defined by [CONTACT_656140] , was strongly predictive 
for outcome (p< 0.0001), suggesting that molecular assessment could be used to measure 
efficacy of other consolidative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [11].     
 
There is evidence that MCL may be responsive to active immunoth erapy.  Immunologically 
mediated graft -versus -lymphoma effect is evidenced after allogeneic stem cell transplantation by 
[CONTACT_656141] [12, 13] , clinical responses occurring 
after development of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) [14], or after donor lymphocyte 
infusion [13].  In accord with the potential immunogencity  of MCL, there have been several 
clinical trials of active immunization of MCL patients [15-17] with good evidence of immune

eProtoc ol #5089   IND #[ADDRESS_883380] 
demonstrated sensitivity in vitro to the TLR9 agonis t CpG [18, 19]  
 
2.1.2  CpG Basic Biology and V accines   
Consistent with their B -cell lineage, MCL and other B -cell NHLs express Toll -Like Receptor 9 
(TLR9).  Ligation  of TLR9 by [CONTACT_656142] (usually 20 -30 bases long) 
enriched for hypomethylated Cytosine -Guanosine repeats (CpG) activates a broad signal 
transduction network culminating in the upregulation of costimulatory molecules such as CD80, 
CD86 , and CD54 as well as improved APC function with upregulation of MHC molecules [20, 
21].  Additionally, TLR9 ligation can lead to upregulation of fas, which transmits a pro -apoptotic 
signal to the NHL cell upon exposure to fasL expressing cells such as NK - or T-cells.  TLR9 
ligation by [CONTACT_656143].   
 
Hence, there are two mechanisms by [CONTACT_656144] -
activated NHL can induce systemic, tumor -specific, T cell mediated immunity:  
 - CpG -NHL can directly present tumor antigens to T cells ; 
- CpG -NHL undergoing apoptosis can transfer tumor antigens to nearby [CONTACT_656145], in turn , be activated by [CONTACT_656146] T cells . 
   
2.1.[ADDRESS_883381] recently published our initial findings of an in situ vaccination strategy using intra -
tumoral injection of CpG combined with cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [22] and these data have shown the 
importance of co -localization of tumor antigens with the immuno -stimulant CpG.  In more recent 
studies, we hav e tested lymphoma  cells cultured ex vivo  with CpG  as a therapetic vaccine.  Anti -
tumor T cells can be generated by [CONTACT_88318] a vaccine.  These T cells could be transferred to syngeneic 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_656118] a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and mediate the cure of large 
established tumors [23]. This result provides the rationale for the design of the current clinical 
trial.  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_883382] been numerous studies of CpG in patients with cancer [24-29] these studies have 
demonstrated the safety profile of CpG in over 1500 patients.  Based on our initial studi es of in 
situ CpG vaccination [22], demonstrating the importance of  co-localization of tumor and 
immuno -stimulant, we initiated a phase 1/2 trial of intra -tumoral CpG with low dose (2x200cGy) 
external beam irradiation for patients with recurrent, low -grade lymphoma.  Therapy was 
extremely well tolerated in all [ADDRESS_883383] also demonstrated the induction of tumor -specific, memory CD8 T cell responses 
resulting from vaccination, correlating temporally with the development of clinic al tumor 
regressions (Figure 2)[30].

2.15CpG in MCL  
There have been several studies of in vitro  CpG -activation of primary MCL tissues, which 
suggest an increase in antigen -presenting features [18, 19] .   Together, these studies demonstrate 
up-regulation of CD40, CD54, CD80, CD86, MHC -I, and MHC -II as well as the well -described 
target of passive immunotherapy CD20.  
  
We have c onfirmed these findings using primary tumor samples from patients with newly 
diagnosed or recurrent classic MCL.  Culture with varying doses of CpG - oligodeoxynucleotides 
induced upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules as well as the co -stimulatory mo lecules 
CD80 and CD86 (Figure 3).

Figure 3:  CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induce an immunogenic pheynotype in primary MCL cells.  Single -cell 
suspensions of primary MCL cells from four specified patients were cultured with media alone (red line) or 2,10,or 
50g/ml of PF-3512676 (black, blue, and green lines respectively) at 37 C, 5%CO 2 for 72 hours, then flow 
cytometrically assessed for surface expression of the indicated antigen presentation or co -stimulatory molecules. 
 
2.1.6  CpG -MCL Vaccination Do se, Route, and F requency  
CpG -MCL vaccination will be administered  within a period of 21 days  (4-7 days between 
treatments is allowed),  prior to leukapheresis for collection of primed T cells.  The three 
‘priming’  vaccinations of CpG -MCL 108 cells are administered subcutaneously (s.c.) together 
with PF-3512676 18mg s.c.  The 18mg dose is well tolerated  and was  used in the majority of 
prior clinical studies (Investigator Brochure). The timing of the pr iming  vaccinations is intended 
to maximize  the amount of time since the immunosuppressive effects of induction 
chemotherapy, but minimize the delay time prior to myeloablative therapy and AHCT.  There is 
some evidence that a cancer vaccine can induce a tumor -specific immune response in MCL 
patient s at this time point after induction therapy [17].    
       
Within [ADDRESS_883384]-transplant time -point, the vaccine primed T -cells will be administered i.v.  
(immunotransplant), followed by [CONTACT_20904]  s.c. dose of CpG -MCL vaccine with [ADDRESS_883385]-transplant vaccination is given s.c. along with 18 mg of PF-3512676 at 
≥[ADDRESS_883386] , as medically feasible with resolution of interfering morbidities and 
medications.  

   
CpG -MCL Vaccine Study  
 Version Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtoc ol #5089   IND #[ADDRESS_883387]-transplant ‘boost’ vaccinatio n is to coincide with the infusion of vaccine -
primed PBMCs.  The timing of the final,  post-transplant vaccination is intended to allow an 
opportunity for priming of the reconstituted immune system, as CD8 T cell levels are generally 
regained by [CONTACT_159753] [31]. 
 
2.1.7  Vaccination During a State of Minimal Residual D isease  
Vaccination  in the presence of tumor or tumor antigens specifically d ecreases immune response 
to those antigens [32-34]. Tumors secrete factors and recruit cell s that impede tumor 
immunity [35-37]. In our recent trial of DC -Id vaccination for lymphoma, we found  that 53% of 
patients with minimal residual disease mounted cell -mediated immune responses as opposed to 
0% in those with residual disease [38]. In the European MCL ph ase 3 study, 81% of MCL 
patients were in complete remission (CR) after the completion of high dose chemotherapy and 
AHCT [6]. These data suggest that vaccination in a state of minimal residual disease such as the 
post-AHCT setting will be possible and that the absence of tumor will facilitate the development 
of an anti -tumor immune response.  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_883388] (Immunotransplant)  
The period immediately following AHCT is a setting of severe lymphodepletion. Though 
myeloid reconstitution occurs within weeks after AHCT, lymphoid reconstitution, particularly 
that of B -cells and CD4 T -cells, takes several months [31, 39] . This time period has been 
considered a window of opportunity for adoptive transfer of primed T -cells to be more effective 
in eliminating cancer [40]. Levitsky et al, have clearly shown that adoptive transfer of otherwise 
unstimulated T cells can cure a majority of mice in a model system of non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma [41].  Dudley et al. have demonstrated the impressive clinical benefit of 
immunotherapy with adoptive T -cell t ransfer in the context of a lymphodepleted host with 
achievement of objective response rates as high as 50% in metastatic melanoma patients [42], 
including several instances of massive tumor reduction. The mechanisms suggested to explain 
this effect are two -fold. First, the relative reduction of T regulatory (Treg) cells with 
lymphodepleting chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [43, 44] ) prevents inhibition of the administered vaccine. 
Secondly, there is decreased competition for the homeost atic proliferation cytokines (e .g. IL-7 
and IL -15), which allow for expansion of the administered effector cells [41, 45] . A recent 
randomized study of vaccination in the post -AHCT setting demonstrat ed that specific immunity 
was induced after AHCT only with adoptive transfer of primed T -cells (collected after priming  
vaccinations) [46]. Our earlier pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] [47] was based on these advantages provided by [CONTACT_7620] -
AHCT setting, and others have initiated vaccine strategies post -AHCT in AML and  myeloma as 
well as indolent lymphoma.  
 
Our r ecent pre -clinical studies have shown that the homeostatic proliferation induced by [CONTACT_941] 
“empty” post -transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_656119] T cells.  Specifically, we have shown that there is a proportional 
increase in the proliferation of NK cells and CD4 or CD8 effector T cells relative to that of T regs - 
as defined by [CONTACT_656148]3 expression (Figure 4).

   11 Figure 4:  Homeostatic proliferation of tran sferred splenocytes preferentially expands T effector  cells over 
Tregulatory  cells  50 x 106 balb/c splenocytes were labeled with CFSE and injected by [CONTACT_656149] 5 x 106 bone 
marrow cells into A) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_656120] B) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_656121] (900cGy) irradiation.  14 days later 
spleens were harvested and stained (above results gated for CD3+, CD4+ cells).  
 
Consistent with our finding that immunotransplant i nduces preferential proliferation of T effectors  
over T regs, we have shown that CpG -based vaccination, such as described in Section 2.1.3. is 
significantly enhanced by [CONTACT_656150].  Specifically, the proportion of tumor -specific T 
cells induced in immu nized donors is increased nearly ten -fold upon immunotransplant into 
lymphodepleted (‘empty’) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Figure 5).   
 
Figure 5: Immunotransplant enhances the vaccine -induced tumor -specific T -cell response.  Mice received 
either: no vaccine, CpG -based ly mphoma vaccine, or vaccinated -donor bone marrow and splenocytes after no 
irradiation (‘full’ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) or 900cGy TBI (‘empty’ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).   On day [ADDRESS_883389] -transplant, peripheral blood 
lymphocytes were tested for lymphoma -specific IFN  production.  Graph s gated for CD3(+) lymphocytes and 
statistics are IFN (+)cells as a percentage of all CD44hi cells.

   12 Additionally, protection from subsequent lymphoma challenge increased from 70% with 
vaccination to 100% with immunotransplant.  Further, we have shown tha t the addition of a post -
transplant CpG -A20 vaccine boost further enhances anti -tumor immunity insofar as the transient 
tumor growth otherwise seen was eliminated with the addition of the vaccine boost (Figure 6).  
 
 
Figure 6: Immunotransplant  of CpG -A20 vaccinated donors increases anti -tumor immunity.  Donor mice 
were vaccinated with irradiated CpG -A20 cells on days [ADDRESS_883390], one 
cohort had bone marrow and splenocytes transferred i.v. to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_656122] 900cGy (immunotransplant), one 
cohort received the same immunotransplant plus an additional i.v. CpG -A20 ‘boost’ vaccination at the time of 
transplant.  On day 16 all cohorts were tumor -challenged s.c. and followed for tumor growth.  Statisti cs shown are 
proportion of tumor -free mice at day 30.  
 
Together, Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate that CpG -based vaccination induces a tumor -specific, 
memory T -cell immune response that is enhanced by [CONTACT_656150].  Our recent 
demonstration of a tumor -speci fic T -cell immune response induced by [CONTACT_637622] -based vaccination of 
low-grade  lymphoma patients ( Figure 2B) suggests that immunotransplant could have the same

eProtoc ol #5089   IND #[ADDRESS_883395] 1.5x109 cells.  Alternatively, patients with 
significant peripheral blood involvement may undergo leukapheresis to yield the same number of 
MCL cells.  Biopsy samples will be dissociated into single cell suspension under sterile 
conditions, placed directly in to Culture Media as per CpG -MCL SOP  and split into two 
fractions:  1x109 cells for CpG -MCL produ ction and the remainder will be stored in the vapor 
phase of liquid N2 for immune assays.  An aliquot from the immune assay  fraction will be used 
for the development of patient -specific assays of molecular residual disease (MRD).  
 
Production of CpG -MCL  
CpG-MCL production is carried out per SOP included with this product’s approved IND, which 
is maintained on file with the Principal Investigator.  Briefly, a  sterile aliquot of the MCL single -
cell suspension totaling 1x109 cells will be suspended in medium containing 3 g/ml PF -3512676 
and cultured at 37 C, 5%CO 2 for 72 hours [18] to allow for up -regulation of antigen -presenting 
and co -stimulatory molecules, then irradiated to 200Gy [48], split into aliquots of 1x108 cells in 
Cryopreservation Media, comp osed of saline, human serum albumin,  hydroxyethyl starch, 10% 
DMSO , and cryopreserved in the vapor -phase of liquid N 2.   
 
Quality testing criteria of CpG -MCL is conducted as per SOP .  Briefly, CpG -MCL cells and an 
aliquot of  5x106 MCL cells cultured in parallel without  PF-3512676 are assesse d by [CONTACT_656153] ‘identity’ per non-expression of CD3, 4, 8, and co-expression of CD5 and 20 
and for their ‘activation’ per expression of the activation markers, MHC class I, II, CD25, 40, 54, 
69, 70, 80, and 86.  Identity is confirmed by [CONTACT_656154]5(+)CD20(+)CD3( -)and 
effective potency  is defined by a > 2-fold up -regulation of at least 3 of the activation markers . 
 
Lot release criteria are as follows:  upon cryopreservation of at least 7 CpG -MCL cell aliquots in 
1mL, a sample (of less than 10% of volume of a vial) from one vial of the cells will be set aside 
and tested for bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasma contamination, endotoxin content (all pre -
freeze). If any of the above tests is positiv e, and at least [ADDRESS_883396] will be deemed 
acceptable only if initial tests or if both duplicate repeat tests are negative.   
 
Immunization with CpG -MCL p lus PF -3512676  
At each vaccination time point, one aliquot of CpG -MCL  1x108 cells will be thawed, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_656123] a 1ml sterile syringe, and given as a subcutaneous injection in the patient’s lateral thigh.  
Patients receive simultaneous, adjacent injection s of the adjuvant PF -3512676 18mg s.c.

events of PF-3512676 as described in the Investigator’s Brochure include systemic reactions 
such as Gra de < 2 flu-like symptoms, fevers, myalgias, and arthralgias lasting 12 -72 hours and 
Grade < 2 injection site reactions including pain, erythema, and induration.  The primary adverse 
events of whole -cell cancer vaccines include primarily injection site reac tions [48-57].  The 
primary adverse events seen in other studies of T cell re -infusion post -transplant [46] were  a less 
than 20% incidence of transient flu -like symptoms, but no adverse events were tre atment -
limiting.  In this study, unacceptable adverse events, including local or systemic grade > 3 
adverse event or toxicity thought to be related to the vaccine or immunotransplant, will result in 
discontinuation of vaccine therapy.  Grade < 3 adverse events or toxicities may prompt treatment

Reactions common to all surgical procedures, e.g. risk of bleeding, scarring, infection, pain, and 
subsequent development of lymphedema . 
 
5.2 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Once in remission and after recovery of sufficient number of T cells, patients will receive 
priming vaccinations ; the immunotransplant and CpG -MCL vaccine within [ADDRESS_883416], and the CpG -MCL vaccine >/= [ADDRESS_883417].  If a patient develops intercurrent 
illness or adverse event during the study, the CpG -MCL vaccinations and immunotransplant 
infusion may be given once it is medically feasible and any interfering morbidities and/or 
medications are resolved .   If there is failure of lot release criteria for the first tested dose of a 
vaccine batch, and two additional lots are available, those wil l both be re -tested for all lot release 
criteria and if both of those additional lots pass all criteria, they may be used.  
 
All adverse events thought to be related to the study treatment will be followed until reasonable 
resolution.  All intercurrent illn esses and adverse events temporally associated with the 
vaccinations will be collected and documented.  
 
Dose modifications of the investigational agents are not planned . 
 
Patients experiencing local injection site reactions of grade 3 or higher will be tak en off study.  
Patients experiencing local injection site reactions of grade 1 or 2 may receive subsequent 
injections in an alternate site (alternate thigh or either deltoid), or, per the discretion of the 
investigator, may be taken off study if additional  vaccine doses are felt to be medically contra -
indicated.

CpG -MCL  Vaccine Study   Version: Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089    IND #[ADDRESS_883428] autologous transplant , as has been previously validated to be predictive for 
subsequent clinical outcome in mantle cell lymphoma [6].   
 
A Secondary endpoint will be anti tumor immune response, as measured by [CONTACT_656159]/or intracellular pe rforin/granzyme in CD8+ T cells, and/or CD137 induction on 
CD4+ T cells.  
 
Our hypothesis is that immunotransplant will significantly increase the proportion of tumor -
specific T cells relative to that induced by [CONTACT_656160].  
 
Another Secondary endpoint will be the clinical outcomes of progression -free and overall 
survival.  Previous studies of ‘standard’ auto HCT for MCL patients have demonstrated median 
PFS and OS of 3.[ADDRESS_883429] “Cheson” criteria [58]. Additional 
clinical endpoints will be overall survival, The initial time point for all endpoints will be the date 
of transplant.  
 
Measurable disease will be detected at least by [CONTACT_483446], usually of the neck, chest, abdomen 
and pelvis and compared to baseline imaging.  In the event that a patient has additional sites of 
adenopathy that are best measured by [CONTACT_656161], t hose sites will also be included in 
baseline and follow -up imaging.  All patients will require bone marrow (BM) biopsy at initial 
diagnosis as per standard of care.  Those patients with evidence of BM involvement at any time 
point may require follow -up bio psy to determine extent of clinical response per standard of care.  
 
10.  REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
10.1   Adverse Event Reporting  
 
10.1.1 Definitions : 
 
Adverse Events (AEs):  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
treated with the vaccine during treatment and post -treatment follow -up period regardless of 
causality assessment.  This includes adverse clinical or laboratory findings, intercurrent illness or 
an exacerbation or progression of a disease/condition present at  the time the study was initiated, 
other than signs or symptoms resulting from the disease being treated (MCL), which are 
considered lack -of-efficacy as opposed to an adverse event.  The study will collect adverse event 
information during the CpG -MCL vaccin e treatment s and for 2 weeks following the final study 
related procedure .  Adverse events will be followed until reasonable resolution.  Adverse Events 
will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3. Adverse events occurring during the patient’s 
induction ch emotherapy will not be collected.  Adverse events occurring during standard of care 
treatments (i.e. stem cell transplant) and that are temporally associated with study related 
   
CpG -MCL  Vaccine Study   Version: Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089    IND #[ZIP_CODE]  
  29 treatment will be collected during the study.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An adverse event which meets one or more the following 
criteria is considered serious.  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Is disabling  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is medically significant or requir es medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
 
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Participants or Others (UPs)  
Serious Adverse Events that are:  
 Unexpected : Not in the consent form, investigator brochure, protocol, p ackage insert, 
or label, or unexpected in its specificity, severity or frequency AND  
 Related to the research:  Caused by, or probably caused by [CONTACT_656162]. Events 
caused by [CONTACT_656163]. If a device is involved, 
caused by, or associated with the device.  
 Caused harm or increased risk of harm:  Involves harm to participants or others, or 
places participants or others at increased risk of harm.  
 
Unanticipated problem s involving risks to participants or others (UP), that are  unexpected and 
related and harmful  must be reported to the IRB and to the FDA.  
 
 
10.2  Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events  should be captured in the CRF. The research team will meet regularly to discuss 
AEs being experienced by [CONTACT_3038].  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
The Sponsor -Investigator shall promptly notify the IRB and the FDA in writing of the 
occurrence of any unexp ected and “serious” adverse experience  in accordance with GCP, 
regulatory agencies and institutional procedures and guidelines.   All serious adverse events 
occurring in patients at Stanford will be reported to the Sponsor - Investigator (also the PI) within  
10 days (5 days if the event is life -threatening or resulted in death). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_656125] (CCTO) in accordance with the CCTO Standard 
Operating Procedures.  Deaths within 30 days of a patient bein g treated with the study drug will 
be reported within 5 days, all other SAEs will be reported within 10 days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_499406]. If the event qualifies as an Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to 
Participants or Others (UP), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_656126].  
 
   
CpG -MCL  Vaccine Study   Version: Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089    IND #[ZIP_CODE]  
  30 SAEs which are  considered  suspected adverse reactions  will be reported by [CONTACT_656164] (the provider of PF -3512676) using the MedWatch 3500a form. The Medwatch Report 
will be faxed to [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Safety (using the [COMPANY_007] provided SAE Fax Cover sheet) at 
fax number 866 -997-8322 within 24 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_656127].  
  
10.2.1  Forms  
 
FDA Form 3500a (MedWatch ) will be used to report serious adverse events and UPs.  The form 
is available for download from the FDA website : 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm . 
 
 
10.2.2  Secondary Malignancies  
 
 Investigators will report secondary malignancies occurring on or following treatment using the 
appropriate form noted above.  Exception:  Cases of secondary AML/MDS will be reported 
using the NCI/CTEP Secondary AML/MDS Report Form .  
 
10.3 Data Reporting  
  
The data will be monitored continuously over the accrual and follow -up periods by [CONTACT_1961] (PI) and the study coordinator.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_656128], reporting adverse events, assuring tha t consent is obtained and documented, reporting 
unexpected outcomes, and reporting the status of the trial to the IRB and the data monitoring 
committee provided by [CONTACT_656165] 
(DSMB).   The DSMB will re view the study data at scheduled intervals and when the data 
suggests safety threats to the patients.   DSMB responsibilities will be to review the general 
process and conduct of the study, including accrual, eligibility, data completeness, data 
timeliness,  adverse events, consent forms, and trial renewal and amendments . 
There are no well -described toxicities of the CpG -MCL vaccinations in the above described 
studies [48, 56, 57] . 
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
Study Design/Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
Statistical evaluation of our study is based on a Simon Two Stage Optimum Design powered to 
the endpoint of Minimal Residual Disease at the time point of [ADDRESS_883430] transplant is based on the literature that has 
validated  this endpoint for prediction of continued clinical remission after autologous stem cell 
transplantation for Mantle Cell lymphoma (24 -26).  To allow for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656129], a 2 -stage optimum design, following pre -specified pro bability of the null 
hypothesis (no effect on MRD rate) of 70% (p0=0.7) and alternative hypothesis of 85% (an 
increase in molecular MRD of 15% with vaccination; p1=0.85) with desired significance level 
(α) and desired power (1 -β) of 0.1 and  0.9, respective ly was used for sample size assessment.  
 
   
CpG -MCL  Vaccine Study   Version: Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089    IND #[ZIP_CODE]  
  31 Based on the 2 -Stage Simon Optimal Design with  both error rates below 0.1 for testing a  null 
(unacceptable) rate of MRD of 70%  against an alternative (acceptable ) rate of 85% has [ADDRESS_883431] s tage, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656130] 14 or fewer  successes  (MRD 
negative patients) , otherwise going on to a total  of [ADDRESS_883432] 46 successes  (MRD negative patients) and results determined 
favorable to  move to additional clinical investigation. If the true rate is  70%, the expected 
number of patients is  36, and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656131] 1 is 58%. This design 
minimizes  the expected number of patients exposed  to an ineffective treatment, given the error 
rates.  
 
The goal is to enroll patients sufficient to obtain a total of 5 9 treated patients over 60 months.   
 
Our current rate of accrual predicts that we will equal or exceed that goal. As recent data 
suggests RCHOP/DHAP alternating chemotherapy  is superior to RCHOP or modified 
RHyperCVAD. As our null, or baseline response rate is based on MRD rates using RCHOP or 
modified RHyperCVAD, our endpoint analysis will exclude patients who receive 
RCHOP/DHAP chemotherapy (currently 3 of all enrolled pati ents will be excluded from 
analysis). Finally, to determined if chemotherapy regimen does influence MRD rates, we will 
stratify MRD status by [CONTACT_656137].  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary outcome analysis will focus on TTP (from the date of autoHCT ).  In the 
aforementioned European MCL Network randomized trial, the median TTP was [ADDRESS_883433]. The trial is not powe red to secondary 
endpoints. TTP among patients evaluable will be reported including measure of centrality and 
variance of the outcome.  
 
The immune response will also be reported descriptively at the completion of the trial. Note that 
this was the original  endpoint that has already been reached and therefore a clinical endpoint has 
now replaced immune response as the primary endpoint to which the study is powered. Our prior 
primary endpoint of i mmune response was assessed using a 2 -stage optimum design allo wing 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656132], following pre -specified probability of the null 
hypothesis (no immune response) of 5% (p0=0.05) and alternative hypothesis of 35% (presence 
of an immune response with vaccination; p1=0.35) with desired signific ance level (α) and 
desired power (1 -β) of 0.[ADDRESS_883434] 6 patients showed an immune 
response as defined by a >10% change in [ADDRESS_883435] 10 patients showed an in immune response . Therefore we previously determined early 
success of stage 1 and stage 2 (stage [ADDRESS_883436] 3 immune responses among 17 patients).  
 
Correlative Biomarker Endpoints  
At the completion of the trial, we will explore new putative immune biomarkers of clinical 
response (molecular MRD at 1 year). As there will be approximately 300 potential comparisons 
to consider, we will evaluate each based on a desired false discovery ra te (FDR) of less than 
20%. Putative biomarkers with a FDR of <20% will be selected for further study and validation 
   
CpG -MCL  Vaccine Study   Version: Amend 5: April 4, 2016  
eProtocol #5089    IND #[ADDRESS_883437]<20%. This is secondary, because it is not possible, at this point, to specify the distribution 
of response and whether the relationship between the res ponse measure and the putative 
biomarkers will be strong or weak.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  
Though similar studies using PF -3512676, whole -cell cancer vaccines, and re -infusion of T cells 
post-transplant have shown minimal associated  adverse event or  toxicity, we will assess the 
patient cohort in an ongoing man ner and use the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_656133]: non -engraftment or early death (within 100 days from transplant) from any cause.  
 
After patient number:   8 16 24 
Non-engraftment seen in:  2 4 5 
Early mortality seen in:  3 5 6 
 
This rule would stop the study if the statistics indicate the possibility with even 80% certainty 
that the non -engraftment rate is > 10% or the early mortality rate is > 15%.  
 
 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The goal is to enroll patients sufficient to obtain a tot al of 59 evaluable patients over 60 months.

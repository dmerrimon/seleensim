2 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONAL E 
 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver problem which affects 30% of the United 
States population. Liver biopsy is accepted as the most accurate technique to detect patients at risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_126436]. However, liver biopsy is an invasive test with risk for complications 
and risk of mortality. Alternative imaging and bloo d-based biomarkers are needed to replace liver biopsy  
for screening and longitudinal assessment , to assist drug development process and  to detect patients at 
high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_126437] -related complications.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
NAFLD is defined as fat accumulation in liver, when other fat -accumulating factors like alcohol 
consumption and stea togenic medications are excluded. NAFLD can be classified into two sub -types; 1) 
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL), and 2) Nonalcoholic Steatohepatiti s (NASH). Both NAFL  and NASH  can 
progress to cirrhosis, however, NASH patients progress  more frequently and more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_126438]. NASH -related cirrhosis  is currently the second most common indication for liver 
transplantation in the [LOCATION_002] and is projected to become the leading cause in the near future 1,2,3. 
NASH is associated with a vast economic burden, estimated at $[ADDRESS_142331] for diagnosis and risk stratification of NASH , as it can 
evaluate both the inflammatory and fibrosis components of NAFLD . However, biopsy is limited by 
[CONTACT_126449], and high intra - and inter -observer variability
5. Moreover, liver biopsy is invasive, painful, 
costly, and associated with morbidity and even mortality6. Considering the large disease burden with 
high prevalence, it  is not feasible to scre en, diagnose, or monitor all suspected patients with non -focal 
liver biopsy. As a result, only a small minority of NASH patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_126439] 95% of patients remain undiagnosed
7, 8. Non -invasive and inexpensive methods are needed to 
diagnose , risk-stratify , and monitor  NASH.  
 Noninvasive tests including imaging techniques and blood biomarkers might be useful in management of high -risk patients. Liver -specific ultrasound -based  measurements including shear wave speed , or 
equivalently Young ’s modulus , and sonographic fat assessment methods have the potential to provide 
complementary information, improving diagnostic confidence and guiding clinical and research practice

procedures  are non -invasive  ultrasound -based  imaging tests. Th ese technique s are performed using 
FDA-cleared  devices that comply with [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug administration ( FDA) safety 
requirements , have no known bioeffects , and cause no patient discomfort. Images will be obtained on 
multiple ultrasound devices over 1.[ADDRESS_142334] benefits to study participants. The benefit  of participation in  this study is the 
contribut ion to the advancement of non -invasive biomarkers for NAFL and NASH , a contribution which 
could benefit the participant in their own future clinical surveillance or screening exams.  
 
2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL R ISKS AND BENEFITS  
 Non -invasive biomarkers could be  valuable tool s for advancing the care of patients with NAFL and NASH. 
Participation in NIMBLE could advance the knowledge of imaging biomarkers to allow for more routine use in clinical trials and routine clinical care. The broader benefits of biomarker development are as 
follows:  
 
Drug and Biomarker Development  
 
Difficulty in finding high -risk patients and risks of repetitive liver biopsy as a tool to assess 
treatment response, are  major limitations in NASH drug development. By [CONTACT_126450], this 
limitation will be addressed.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
 
Hypothesis . The upper bound of the 95% Confidence Interval ( CI) of the pooled different -day, different -
operator reproducibility coefficient (true RDC diff-operator, diff -day) of shear- wave speed values for the five 
participating ultrasound vendors  (Canon, GE, Philips, Siemens, and Supersonic)  will be less than 35%.  
The conserv ative assumption underlyin g this hypothesis is that the true RDC diff-operator, diff -day values for the 
five ultrasound  vendors will be 23, 25, 25, 27, and 30%, with no assumption made about how those true 
values correspond to the five vendors . 
 
Design . This is a p rospective, low-intervention al, two -center, short -term cross -sectional precision study.  
 
Study interventions . Ultrasound exams , blood collection, physical measurements, clinical history and 
medication reviews . 
 
Methods . At each of the two participating clinical sites (MGH and UCSD), a pproximately equal numbers 
of eligible participant s will be enrolled , for a projected tot al enrol lment of 40 participant s across both 
sites  (about 2 0 at each site) . To ensure adequate representation of the disease severity spectrum, 
participants will be enrolled into three categories according to the likelihood for advanced fibrosis based 
on Fibrosis -4 (FIB-4) values:  
 
• low likelihood of advanced fibrosis (FIB -4 ≤ 1.3)  
• intermediate likelihood of advanced fibrosis (1.3 < FIB -4 < 2.67)  
• high likelihood of advanced fibrosis (FIB -4 ≥ 2.67)  
NIMBLE Study 1.1 Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol Version number: 4.[ADDRESS_142338]  of total participants (about 13 participant s total - minimum 8, maximum 18), about 6 at 
each site (minimum 3 , maximum 1 0) will be enrolled in each category.  
 
The rationale for using FIB- [ADDRESS_142339] for 
fibrosis stage, and the accuracy of the ultrasound -based measurements to diagnose advanced fibrosis 
will not be teste d in Study 1.1. The components of FIB -4 are age (years), AST level (U/L), platelet count 
(109/L), and ALT (U/L). The FIB -4 value is derived from a simple algebraic formula of these four 
components.  
 
Participants  will be consecutively assigned to  their corresponding  categor y until the category is closed  
(reaches maximum  of 11). Once a category is closed at a given site , participants  will no longer be 
enrolled into that category at that site.  
 
Each participant  will under go ultrasound imaging at Visit 1 (by [CONTACT_126451]  1) and at Visit 2 (by [CONTACT_126451]  2), 
separated by 1 to 7 days. The 7 -day window for Visit 2 is selected to allow flexibility in scheduling while 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_126440]. Ultrasound exams at 
Visits  1 and 2 will be performed at about  the same time of day  (target is ± 2 hours)  and with identical 
fasting and other preparation instructions . For each visit, each participant  will be assigned to three of 
the five ultrasound  scanne rs plus VCTE . As shown in the Schema ( Section 1.2 ), for Visit 1,  two of the 
three ultrasound exams  will be repeated; the third ultrasound exam and the VCTE exam will be 
performed once.   For Visit 2, the third ultrasound exam  and the VCTE  exam will be repeated; the other 
two ultrasound exams  will be performed once .  The selection of exams to be repeated will be based on a 
block assignment strategy to ensure an approximately equal number of scans are performed by [CONTACT_126452], in additi on to VCTE. Thus , each subject will undergo a total of six exams at each of 
their two visits, for a total of 12 exams across both visits.  For the repeated exams, subjects will get off 
the table with a short break (target about 5 minutes) before getting back on the table. Subjects will not be required to leave the room. The machine will not be turned off and powered up again  to save time  
 Ultrasound operators  will follow the acquisition procedures  outlined in the imaging manual . The imaging 
manual will address  patient positioning, image acquisition and quality control with scanning protocol 
input from the relevant ultrasound vendors. Additi onal investigational ultrasound data may be acquired, 
including with use of non -FDA-approved vendor proprietary software.  
 As outlined in the Schedule of Activities (SOA), screening  data  will include demographic, medical history, 
medication review, physical activity review, vital signs, height, and weight . Body ma ss index (BMI) will be 
calculated. Fasting blood samples will be collected if needed  at PI’s discretion  based on availability of 
previous blood samples . The Alcohol Use Di sorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) questionnaire will be 
administered to assess alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol -relate d problems , 
information useful for assessing eligibility.   On the subsequent visit, interim medical history, and changes in medications , physical activity, vital 
signs, and weight will be collected.

  11 8. Patients with active implants such as pacemakers or defibrillators or any other contraindication to 
ultrasound or VCTE scanning.  
 
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Participant s will be asked to maintain their lifestyle  over the course of their involvement in this study 
(i.e., no changes in medication ; levels or type s of exercise;  amounts , types, or frequency of alcohol 
intake, etc.) . 
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 Screen failures will only be allowed in exceptional circumstances .  Potential participants who screen -
failed based on the Inclusion Criteria will not be allowed to re -screen.  Only potential participants who 
screen -failed based on the Exclusion Criteria  4, 5 or 6 will be allowed to re -screen if they no longer meet 
the Exclusion Criteria.   
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Achieving target en rollment . It is not anticipate d that there will be difficulty screening e nough 
participant s to meet the enro llment target of a total of 40 participant s in this study . The goal will be  to 
enroll approximately equal numbers of m ales and females , and to enroll a participant  population 
representative of the sex, racial and ethnic mix of patients with NAFLD at the two clinical sites 
participating in this stud y. No special stratification will be done based on sex or race.  Our effective 
screen -fail rate is expected to be up to about 25%, taking int o account failure to satisfy inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, loss o f participant s due to possible uneven filling of our three enrollment categories, 
dropout , and technical failure . Thus , we expect to need to screen [ADDRESS_142346] to be able to complete enrollment in about 40  weeks.  
 
Number of sites . There will be  two clinical sites in this study (MGH and UCSD), and both have agreed to 
participate.  
 
Source of participants . Participant s at MGH will be recruit ed from  EMR review and the Fatty Liver 
Disease Clinic . Participant s at UCSD will be r ecruited from the UCSD NAFLD Research  Center . 
 
Methods of identification  and approach for potential participant s. At both sites, recruitment may  be by 
[CONTACT_126454]/or by [CONTACT_126455] s.  Patients identified through EMR review 
may  be approached via opt -out mailing sent on behalf of their primary physician.  If subjects do not opt -
out they will be contact[CONTACT_66696].   
 
Recruitment strategies . It is not anticipated that additional recruitment methods or strategies will be 
needed to achieve o ur planned target enrollment  within one year.  
 
NIMBLE Study 1.1 Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol Version number: 4.[ADDRESS_142347]  2021  
 
  12 Participant  retention . Given  the short particip ation period for  each participant  (i.e., about a week or less 
to complete both imaging visits), it is not anticipated that participant  retention will be a problem in this 
study.  
 
Recruitment and r etention of participant s from historically under -represented populations . Given the 
expected strong ability to recruit fairly  from the outpatient clinic populations at both sites, the 
disproportionate prevalence of NAFLD in Latino minorities, and the short duration of participant  
involvement in this study, we do not expect that recruitment or retention of participant s from 
historically under -represented populations will be a problem for this study.  
 
Vulnerable populations . No subjects from vulnerable populations will be recruited for this study.  
 
Participant  compen sation . Participant s will be given  up to $50 per hour  for their participation in this 
study to compensate them for their time, any inconvenience, and parking. Compensation will be made 
upon completion of all study procedures  or after completion of screening if participant screen fails . 
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION   
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 Study interventions will include questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, blood collection, and  
non-invasive ultrasound -based imaging  exams. All ultrasound -based devices  use ene rgies below FDA 
limits for diagnostic ultrasound.   
6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 Study participants will not be randomized to individual treatment groups or be blinded. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of scanner combinations, participants will follow a block -randomization 
pattern with different scanner combinations for different participants, however, patients and operators will not be blinded to ultrasound scanners being used.  
 
All efforts will be made to keep ultrasound operators blinded to clinical and laboratory data, however, it 
is not believed that this will significantly affect the ultrasound acquisition.  The Visit 2 operator will be 
asked to not review the Visit 1 exam results.   
 Central analysts will be blinded to key clinical and laboratory findings to minimize potential bias .  
Blinding of the central analysts will be outlined in a separate Image Review Charter.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
 
Acquisition and analysis of ultrasound exams will be captured in a separate Acquisition Manual and Image Review  Charter. These documen ts will outline the acquisition procedures and ultrasound analysis 
procedures.  
 
Participant weight will be measured and interim medical history, medication use, alcohol use, physical 
activity will be ascertained at each visit to assess compliance by [CONTACT_126456] -state weight,  exercise, alcohol  use, and medications . 
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY

  14 7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
 
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from  the study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], there have been significant lifestyle changes  or other factors  that could affect study re sults.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_142352] to follow -up if he or she fails  to return  for Visit 1 and/or Visit 2,  and 
is unable to be contact[CONTACT_126457].  
 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_126458] a scertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. 
 
If a participant is los t to follow -up and has only completed one study visit, they may or may not be 
replaced as part of the targeted enrollment. This decision will be based on the number of subjects who have completed the study to date.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 An AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a  human subject, including any abnormal 
physical exam or certain unexpected abnormal laboratory finding, symptom , or disease, temporally 
associated with a subject 's participation in the research.  
 In this clinical study, we anticipate only minimal risk of  adverse events because the investigational 
procedure is limited to noninvasive diagnostic ultrasound imaging of the abdomen using the vendor specific investigational liver fat quantification and shear wave elastography/ VCTE  software. All 
ultrasound system s that will be used in this clinical trial use ultrasound energies below FDA limits for 
diagnostic ultrasound . At these energies,  these ultrasound systems and software have no known 
bioeffects and are not expected to cause risk to participant s.  
 Anticipat ed nonserious AEs may include;  
• Potential discomfort during the ultrasound scans due to body positioning , and  
NIMBLE Study 1.1 Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol Version number: 4.[ADDRESS_142358]  2021  
 
  17 • Potential discomfort during the ultrasound scans due to ultrasound transducer pressure.  
•        Potential discomfort related to IV stick  following blood draw at screening  
 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
A SAE is any AE that:  
1. Results in death, or  
2. Is life -threatening, or  
3. Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacitation, or  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
6. May jeopardize the participant 's health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
 
No S AEs are anticipate d in this clinical trial.   
 
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events (AEs), the following guidelines are used to describe severity.  
Mild  - Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant 's daily 
activities.  
Moderate  - Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe - Events interrupt a participant 's usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or o ther treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life- threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term ' severe'  does not necessarily equate to ' serious '. 
 AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_126461]. Site PIs are responsible fo r reporting 
and managing AEs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
All AEs will have their relationship to study procedures assessed by [CONTACT_16541]. The 
following criteria will be used to identify causality; (0) Not related, (1) Unlikely to be related, (2) 
Potentially related, (3) Potentially related, (4) Probably related, (5) Definitely related.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 Site PIs will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected in this NIMBLE clinical trial. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with known ultrasound risks and complications , which are very limited.  
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
NIMBLE Study 1.1 Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol Version number: 4.[ADDRESS_142359]  2021  
 
  18  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during ultrasound scans or screening visits. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as a n AE. However, if the study participant 's condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
 
Different -day, different -operator reproducibility coefficient of ultrasound measures  
 • Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
 
Same -day, same -operator repeatability coefficient of ultrasound measures;  
Different -scanner, same -day reproducibility coefficient of ultrasound measures;  
Precision and other metrics measured by [CONTACT_126464]; an d 
Vendor - or device -specific metrics of ultrasound measures  
 
9.2 SAM PLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
The following assumptions were made in determining sample size for the primary study objective:  
 
1. Repeat measurements on the same participant  follow a normal distribution.  
2. RDC diff-day, diff -operator  is in the range of 20 -30% (wCV  of 7.2- 10.8%).  
3. A balanced design is planned (i.e. equal number of participant s per scanner) where the following 
scenarios describe the possible RDCs across the five  scanners:  
• 25, 25, 25, 25, 25%  
• 24, 25, 25, 26, 27%  
• 23, 25, 25, 27, 29%  
• 23, 25, 25, 27, 30%  
4. A study with 80% power is desired.  
 
The null hypothesis for the primary study objective is H o: RDC diff-day, diff -operator  >35%, versus the alternative 
hypothesis that RDC diff-day, diff -operator  <35%, where RDC is the reproducibility coefficient for different day 
and different operator. The upper 95% confidence bound for the RDC will be constructed.  
NIMBLE Study 1.1 Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol Version number: 4.[ADDRESS_142366]  2021  
 
  21 A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to determine the sample size needed. For each 
simulated participant , two observations were generated from a normal distribution with the specified 
variance. Samples of varying size were simulated. From each sample RDC diff-day, diff -operator  was estimated, 
along with its 95% CI. This process was repeated 10,000 times.  
In the table below the sample size is reported such that 80% of the samples of that size met the 
precision qualification (i.e.  upper 95% confidence bound for RDC <35%). The results suggest that by 
[CONTACT_126465], up to [ADDRESS_142367] (r=0.25) , we consider the design effect to account for the clustering 
of the dat a (i.e. 3  observations/subjec t).  The design effect is 1+(s -1)r, where r=correlation and s=# 
of observation/subject, i.e. 1+(3 -1)0.25=1.5. Thus, (55 x 1.5)/3=27.5 so a study with 28  total participant s 
would provide 8 0% power.  
For estimating the RDC diff-day, diff -operator  of VCTE , assuming an RDC diff-day, diff -operator  of 25%, 32 subjects 
provides 80% power to show that the RDC<35%.  Taking into consideration the possibility of a drop -out 
or technical failure rate of no more than 25%, a study with 4 0 total participant s (20 per site)  is proposed.

  24 Consent forms describing in detail the ultrasound scans, blood sampling, and risks will be  given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent will be  required prior to starting ultrasound 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed c onsent forms will be MGH and UCSD IRB approved  for each institution , and the participant 
will be asked to read and review the document  at the start of the Screening visit. The investigators , or 
their designees (e.g., coordinators),  will explain the research study to the participant and answer any 
questions that may arise.  This explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participan t’s 
comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rig hts as 
research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the ICF  and ask 
questions prior to signing .  The participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study with their 
family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  
 The participant will sign the ICF  prior to any procedures being done specifically for the NIMBLE 1.1 
study. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any ti me, without prejudice. Both investigator and study participant will sign the informed 
consent form  (ICF) . A copy of the signed informed consent form  will be given to participants for their 
records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documen ted in the source document 
(including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific 
procedures.  
 The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693]. Appropriate efforts will be made at an institutional level to provide adequate interpretative services for participant s 
who are not English speaking. Children or other vulnerabl e population will not be included in the study.

 NIMBLE 1.1 study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided to study participants, investigators, site I RBs, the NIMBLE consortium , and FNIH. Study 
participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to ultrasound scan visit schedule.  
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination of futility

Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526148] Background: Pros tate cancer is the leading male cancer. One in three men with prostate cancer is 
chemically castra ted at some point wit h long-acting injectable drugs  (i.e., androgen deprivation therapy or 
ADT). This i mpact s the well -being of  thousands of men annually. Alt hough some patients benefit in term s of 
survival and symptom improvement, chemical castration with ADT is also commonly  performed when t here 
are litt le to no health benefits to patients raising questions of  low value care. A growing awareness of 
castration harms (e.g. , heart attack, ost eoporosis, loss of sexual function) creates patient safety concerns . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], ADT use i n low valu e cases, such as  for localized prostate cancer treatment and biochem ical 
recurrence in non-m etastatic disease persists.  
 
Ineffective and harmful practices  such as chemical castration of prostate cancer patients with ADT outs ide 
of the evidenc e base are ide al targets for d e-implementation. De -implementation, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417116], has th e potential to improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcar e costs. For example, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417117], limit s pending, and m aintain survival. However, 
provider preferences regarding de- impleme ntation are not well understood, and possible de- implem entation 
interventions range fr om b lunt formulary restriction policie s to shared decision- making. Blunt policy 
intervention s such as formulary restri ction of ADT (e.g., pre- authorization, order templat es) m ight seem 
warranted  given patient safety concerns,  yet could result in significant pr ovider resistance and work -
arounds  if introduced poorly. More nuanced, patient -centered interventi ons such as shar ed decision-
making (e.g., decision aid, talking points) l ikely involve ext ra clinical time. Both interventi on strategies need 
tailoring based on provider input for acceptability and feasibility in clinical  practice, including pi[INVESTIGATOR_417118]. As  many medical practices lack evidence and cause harm , robust, behavioral t heory -based 
methods for incorpora ting provider preferences into de -implementation strategy development  will advance 
both implementa tion research and practic e. 
 
Project O bjectives: This study will compare two different de -implementation str ategies that vary  in 
delivery, impact, and expected results for reducing low value AD T use.  
 
Research Plan/Methods: Com pare t wo tailored de- implemen tation strategies to reduce chemica l 
castration as localized prostate  cancer treatment and treatment fo r non -metastatic biochem ical recurrence 
with low PSA le vels.  
Our s pecific Aim is to e valuate the implementation of an ADT order check (Or) versus a prov ider script (Sc) on 
decreased low -value ADT use aft er six months. We will first examine low -value ADT use for up to 6 months of  
early pi[INVESTIGATOR_417119] 4 VA sites, as wel l as refine our proposed RE- AIM implementation outcomes and ascertainment, 
study of moderators (e. g., fidelity) and causal mechanisms underlying implementation interventions. The work 
will infor m the subsequent 4 site pi[INVESTIGATOR_417120]. Based on the early  pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we will ref ine our site engagement strategies and study 
protocol me thods and materials for the trial. This work will advance de -implementation science for low v alue 
cancer care.

NARRATIVE  
 
Introduction  
A1. Evidence for castration as prostate cancer treatment 
Because prostate cancer cells ar e dependent on androgens,  i.e., 
testo sterone, depriving them of this hormone through castration  
can improve clinical outcomes, for some pati ents.1 The hi ghes t 
levels of evid ence for  chemical castration with androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) inject ions to t reat prostate cancer occ ur 
in two sc enarios: 1) high risk localized disease in combination with 
radiation therapy, and 2) metastatic cancer  with spread to bones or 
other  organs causing symptoms.2-4 However, a significant amount 
of castration in Medicare a nd integrated delivery sy stems ( e.g., 
VA), occurs outside scenarios where high levels of benefit exist.5,[ADDRESS_526150] ate cancer is likely  ineffective and harmful, yet remains 
common in VA with  five-fold variation across faci lities (Figure 1).  
Neither long- term studies nor current guidelines support castration 
as primary treatment for localized prost ate cancer.1,3,[ADDRESS_526151] to 
think  about trea ting the disease tha t continues to fuel treatment 
approaches today.  However , surgical castration via orchiectomy  
(i.e., testicular removal) fell by [CONTACT_357163] 1990s  as 
long- acting injectable approaches to androgen depriv ation 
(GnRH agoni sts) became  available, and even lucrative, leading 
to dramatic increases in us e across all stages of the diseas e 
(Figure 2) .9-11 This phenomenon essentially lowered the 
threshold for treatment with ADT injections due to ease of us e, 
patient ac ceptability a s they no longer needed their t esticles  
removed, biological plausibility, and l ow appr eciation for side effects  of chemical  castration among the 
surgical specialists prescribing ADT (i.e., urologists) with little training in p rimary care.  
A2.[ADDRESS_526152] 
medi cal overuse.9 In short, Medicare reimbursed providers at 95% of the average wholes ale price f or these 
injections throughout the 1990s making it profitable s ince many provi ders acq uired the drug at 82% or l ess 
of the average wholesale price.12 Up to 40% of urology practice revenues were derived from this business 
pract ice in some c ases .13 Orchiecto my was driv en out of practice, and thresholds for castration were 
lowered such that nea rly half of prostate cancer patients  received ADT by 2000.10 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a stabl e 
evidence- base, more patients were getting injections in cases  where there was no evidence t o support use 
(e.g., primary treatment) alongside a growing awareness of harms . When t he Medicare Part B tab for ADT 
inject ions reached $[ADDRESS_526153] reduced paym ents by [CONTACT_3450] 50% leading to significant reductions in 
inappropriate use as pub lished in the New England Journal of  Medicine by [CONTACT_15957] -Investigator [CONTACT_417370].9,15 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a decrease in what was termed ‘inappropriate us e’ of ADT for  localized prosta te cancer through this 

 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526154] a hos t of physiologic mec hanisms 
that rely on the male hormone testoster one.16 Castration results not onl y phenotypic  changes due to 
feminization, but also osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, loss of se xual func tion, 
and decrements  to over all quality of life.17 Evidence also suggests the risks of diabetes ,18 cataracts,19 
deep vein thr ombosis,20,21 stroke22 and even acute cardiac death23 all increase for men receiving ADT. 
This led the American Cancer  Society and Amer ican Heart As sociation t o issue a 2010 consensus 
statement on the importance of secondary p reventat ive measures for men t reated with ADT .24 
A2.4 Reasons castration harms overlooked by [CONTACT_357164], a  biomarke r of prostate cancer  activit y, falsely reassuring people 
there is a ‘remission’ of the prostate  cancer.  This is potentially harm ful in at le ast [ADDRESS_526155], depriving 
prostate cancer cells of testosterone too early in the disease process may  foster castr ation resistance,  
limiting e ffects when it is ac tually needed (e.g., metastatic setting).25,[ADDRESS_526156], acquiring the skill of unlearning can increase flexibility and willingness to adapt to 
evidence more proactively.33 We believe unlearning is captured in the Behavioral Regulation domain of the 
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), our behav ior change fr amework, for which there  are evidence- 
based behavior change techniques to consider. This novel TDF  connection to a limited unlearning l iterature 
may play a significant role in advancing de -implementation science.  
 A3. Strategies to stop c hemi cal cas tration as prostate  cancer treatment are sorely needed  
De-implementation, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417121] t hat are n ot evidence- based, has tremendous po tential to improve 
patient outcomes and mitigate rising healthcare costs.
29,[ADDRESS_526157] been proposed when deciding what and how  to de -implement: 1) contradicted, 
established, 2) unproven, and 3) novel medical practices.[ADDRESS_526158], harms and ubiquity in other low value settings (e.g., non -metastatic biochemical recurrence), 
understanding how  best t o de-implement low  value init ial and ongoing castration could yield significant 
benefits. De- implementa tion strategies for unlearning castration practices will need to be tailored to 
provider preferences, facilitators, and barriers to maximize effectiveness.31,39 -44 Even t hough we ha ve 
identified two very different strategies for de-i mplementation ( i.e., or der check, informed decis ion-making),  
these are broad strategies, with considerable space in each for tailoring. In this study, we are using the term 
“tailoring ,” often u sed to desc ribe approaches to fitting implementation interventions to local con text or  site 
characteristics, to  mean designing specific aspects of each strategy to  increase acceptability and likelihood 
of effectiveness.45 Barriers and pref erences, includin g facilitat ors, for operationalization of two different de- 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526159]: This  innovative approach to de- implementation strategy development is directly aligned with state -
of- the-art complex i mplementation intervention dev elopment and implementation science. We believe this study 
will transform how a nd why chemical castration is performed for men with prostate cancer through combini ng 
trans - disciplinary expertise, rigorous assessment of provider pr eferenc es, and de- impleme ntation str ategy 
tailoring. This work will broadly advance de-i mplementation s cience f or low value cancer care,  and foster 
participation in our de -implementation evaluation trial by [CONTACT_417270], facilitators, and concerns t hrough 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_417122].  Our proposal  has implications for the following cancer care stak eholders:  
•Implic ations for patients: Due to the large population of prostate cancer patients, enhanc ing safety by
[CONTACT_417271]- based use of chemical castrati on pr omotes q uality care and qual ity of  life.
•Implications fo r providers: Understanding how providers unlear n ineffec tive clinical behaviors is a
critica l step towards optimizing prostate cancer care and de- implementation of low value services.
•Implication s for  low value cancer care po licy: This proposal will address important issues
surrounding provider behavior change  and serve as a model to decrease overtreatment more broadly.
This is especially relevant given Choosing Wisely and a growing need for effec tive de-imple ment ation.
A5. In novation: Our focus on understanding barriers and facilitators to and prioriti es for d e-implementation 
of low v alue services is highly innovative. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_417123] a better understanding of how to de -implement 
practices sh own to have m ore harm than ben efit (inclu ding many cancer -related services such as 
mammograph y, lung cancer a nd PSA screening), little applied research has been conducted to inform 
tailoring of  strategies to be most acceptable and effective for stakeholder s. In addition to the topic, t his 
proposal is innovative in t hat it advances cancer care and implementation science by: 
•Building the evidence base for de -implementing medical interventions with unclear or no benefits. This is
novel and critical given our i ncreasing healthc are costs and the harms of  overtreatment.29,30
•Using a systematic, theory -based approach to tailor effective, reliable de- implementation interventions
and strategies. Our prior  work linking the TDF to behavior change techniques is especial ly innovative
and has enhanced the tailor ing of interventions  significantly.46,[ADDRESS_526160] will enhance o ur abil ity to
map causal relationships to professional behavior change and advance i mplementation science.
•Better understanding acceptable ways to stop aggressi ve, low value cancer  care. T his is necessary
across disease types to maximize pa tient welfare an d contr ol spending.
B. PREL
IMINARY  STUDIES
Our multi -disci plinary team is exceedingly well- positioned to successfully carry out the proposed work . We
have col laborat ed previously . We have extensive expertis e in clinical prostate cancer care, implementat ion
resea rch, survey methods, qualitative & q uantitative analyses, decision- making, i nformatics tools,
pharmacy applications, and theory -based inter venti on design and t ailoring.
B1. Var
iation in low value castration rates indicate the need for ADT de- implementati on 
In our prior work in p reparation f or the pi[INVESTIGATOR_417124] (cRCT), we identified 
trends in ADT use  as primary  treatment fo r localized prost ate cancer (Figure 1) and for t reatment of non -
metastatic biochemical recurrence. We f ound persistent low value ADT and marked variation in facility level 
rates. W hile some might argue relatively low numbers of patients are unneces sarily t reated, patients are  
routinely committed to life long ADT injections once the treatment decision is made . Better understanding 
de-implementat ion of ADT also opens the door to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417125] (e.g., duration of 
great er than 18 month s of adj uvant A DT with ra diation therapy in high risk prostate cancer).[ADDRESS_526161]. Skolarus  (Co-PI) led a team to develop clinical follow- up care 
guidelines for  primary care  clinicians. The harms of castration were stressed as they i mpact m ost long-
term effect domains. In addition, Drs. Skola rus (Co-PI), Caram (Co -I), Shahi nian (Co- I) co-authored a 
manuscript on ADT- associated bone disease emphasi zing res triction of castration to evidence -based 
settings to limit unnecessary harms.51 Drs. Sk olarus  (Co- PI) and Hawley (Co- I) have also work closely on 
a randomized trial of tailored self -management strategies to address prostate cancer treatment side 
effects inclu ding those of ADT .

B3. De -implementa tion of cancer care: the case of bilateral mast ectomy ov eruse  
The growing rate of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy among women with breast cancer raises 
concerns about overtreatment driven by [CONTACT_417272] a-scien tific facto rs su ch as payment p olicy and media c overage 
akin to the ADT castration story. As hi ghlighted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hawley (Co -I) in peer-reviewed and media outlets,52 
and reinforced by [CONTACT_417273] & Graham’s Implementation Science paper on de -implementation of en trenched 
practices,30 contextualizing provider perceptions is critical to any de -implementation strateg y. 
 
B4. Extensive prior collaborations to understand prostate cancer provider  behavior  
Drs. Skolarus  (Co-PI), Hollenbeck (Co- I) and Shahinian (Co -I) have  characterized pr ostate canc er care 
delivery ove r the last decade including castration with ADT in the Medicare population.10,28,53 -55 They found 
urologists prescribed 95% of ADT a s initial treatment,[ADDRESS_526162]. Sales (Co -I) has conducted several implementation research studies within and outside VA. She has 
develope d numero us tools  to guide theory -based implementation, including reminders,  provider led clinics, 
and feedback reports.58-61 [CONTACT_60579] (Co -I) also has extensiv e experience with theory -based cancer 
decision- making interventions and clinical trials.62-[ADDRESS_526163] important 
for limiting ADT -base d castr ation?  
Currently, priori ty setting for which barriers and facilitators to 
address during implementation strategy development is many 
times a matter of convenience, gestalt  and ignorance as  to 
which are the most common barriers versus most 
importan t.31,40, 47,61,[ADDRESS_526164] 
development of an instrument that could readily identify hand - 
hygiene barriers and link them to evidence-ba sed behavior 
change techniques.31 While this advanced theory -based barrier 
assessment exists, t here are  no current tools to guide tailoring 
of (de- ) implementation interven tions to the most important 
barriers, stakeholder preferences, and facilitators. In our prior work, w e asked  local urologis ts who tr eat 
prostate cancer to identify potential barrie rs to s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_417126]. We identified barriers and mapped 
them to TDF domains and candidate evidence- based behavior change techniques (Table 1). Conducting 
qualitative work acro ss facilities an d using a quantitative discrete choice technique to priorit ize barr iers in 
our prior work has informed tailoring of our two intervention strategies. 
 B7. Informatics tools to de- implement low value prostate cancer clini cal practices  
[CONTACT_357186] (Co-PI) collaborat es with [CONTACT_417371] (Consultant) and his informatic s team at the Greater Los  
Angeles  VA Medical Center. They recently developed and impl emented a highly -specific computerized 
clinical decision support alert to remind providers, at t he mome nt of PSA screeni ng order entry, of current 
guidelines against scree ning elde rly men for pros tate cancer – essentially de-implementation of PSA 
screening. In a prospective study involving over 30,000 patients published in Journal  of Gen eral Inter nal 
Medici ne, the screening rate decreased by [CONTACT_46431] 30%.
71 [CONTACT_417371] and his t eam are  fully supportive of 
development of an EMR- based intervention for de -implemen tation of low value ADT (Appendix I).  
 
B8. D

This team has t remendous clinical and research expertise in decisi on-makin g for cancer care. [CONTACT_417372] olarus 
(Co-PI) updates an evidence- and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_21677]-based shared decision- making tool for prostate cancer 
decision making endorsed by [CONTACT_417274]. In  additi on, [CONTACT_60579] (Co -I) has led

To compar e the interventions, providers who prescr ibe ADT (urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation 
oncologists) at participating s ites will see order checks and/or a note template in CPRS for their patients 
identified as receiving ADT as pri mary treatmen t for localized prostate cancer or for non- metastatic  
biochemical recurrence wit h low PSA levels.  Prio r to implementation of the interventions, study staff will 
send providers an email with an attached Information Sheet infor ming them of thei r ability to opt out as well 
as information on the Implement ation Education Session (IES). (See protocol section bel ow for detailed 
descriptions of inter ventions and study protocol procedures). 
We will administer a survey to assess feas ibility and  acceptability  of the inte rvention, determine

Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526168]. The purpose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_417130]/Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_417131]. During  the cRCT , selected providers and stakeholders at the [ADDRESS_526169] intervention categories require t ailored design: Formulary restriction  & decision -making 
There are several potential implementation interventions t o de-implem ent low value c astra tion within each 
broad intervention category we  identified for this st udy. We focus on an order check and physician 
communications during the informed decision- making because of their difference in key attributes, including 
likelihood of quick su ccess vs. long- term su stainment and effort required by [CONTACT_417275] . We describe s ome 
possible intervention design features  briefly fo r each intervention type in Table 2. While several options 
exist, there is no existing evidence to info rm which is  the best approach from the prov ider perspective. Our 
early work has inform ed which of these specific approaches is likely to be most acceptable to clinicians, and 
provided data needed to tailor these broad interventions. For 
example, we do not kno w how a blunt form ulary  restriction can 
be implemented at a national level.  Nuances  around order 
restriction need to  be addressed and order  checks programmed 
to only trigger when a patient meets certain criteria based on their medical r ecord data without b urdening providers  with 
additional steps  even when prescribing ADT within guid eline s. 
Whil
e formulary restriction of ADT for localized prostate canc er 
seems warranted, we may  find that it is widely considered 
unacceptable to providers . Nor do we know how  informed 
decision- making c an be effici ently operationalized in a clinical  
setting for providers considering castration for localized disease 
or for non-metastatic biochemical  recurrence. By [CONTACT_417276], we believe we have 
designed strategies that will be accepted by [CONTACT_39487], but still 
allow us  to test differences in the widely varying mechanisms of 
action. We have refined these approaches through robust e fforts 
in our p rior work and the  expertise of our trans -disciplinar y, multi -
site investigative team, and will continue to refine these approac hes based on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_39400]. 
C2.[ADDRESS_526170] ion interventions available in th e integrated deliver y system  
The VA Ph armacy Benefits Management Services uses several tools to encourage optimal use of 
medications including: 1) National Formulary, 2) Prior Authorizat ion, 3) Cr iteria for Use, and 4)  VA Center 
for Medication Safety. A DT is currently listed on the VA National  Formulary as a standard pharmacy benefit 
to eligible patients. No prior authorization is necessary to ensure ADT use is  appropriate. For  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , we 
plan to test im plementation of a CPRS order check at the facil ity level. An order check was selected 
because it will flag prescribers that ADT may not be guideline supported for the Veteran, but it will not be a 
hard stop – providers can move through the order restr iction to order A DT without additional delays upon 
entering the indication (or any text) into  a text field. To reduce burden on providers as much as poss ible, 
this flag will on ly be triggered for Veterans with loc alized prostate c ancer getti ng primary  ADT or Veterans 
getting ADT for non -metastatic biochemic al recur rence with a low PSA level. We no te that this approach 
makes this a  benign intervention: providers are not required to cross administrative hurdles to be able to 
order ADT i f they feel they have good r eason to do so.

 We used the taxonomy outlined by [CONTACT_139296].84 to describe the decision support content and the Template 
for Intervent ion Description and Replicat ion (TIDieR)  checklist guided the refinem ent an d tailoring.85 For 
example, when an ADT injection is ordered, a bri ef interruptive message tailored to our pri oritized barriers 
TDF themes and behavior change techniques (e. g., persuasion , training, education ) based on our p rior 
work, will be shown  on the ordering screen. This will allow the prov ider the option of proceeding or 
cancelling the order, with or without justification. To ensure this formulary restriction approach is ‘smart’ we 
will use the foll owing  criteria as  we begin and explore options  during refinement: 1) injectable ADT order in 
pharmacy claims (e.g., leuprolide J9217), 2) prostate cancer  diagnosis (ICD -9 185, ICD -10 C61), and 3) low 
PSA l evel (e.g., level s <2 ng/mL are consis tent with non- metastatic disease4). We will continue to r efine 
these criteria th roughout the pi[INVESTIGATOR_417132]. We w ill vary alert criteria (e.g., prior ADT 
injection, PSA level) to ensure the number of  triggers are acc eptable to providers as done previ ously . We 
will pi[INVESTIGATOR_417133] -based messagin g, presentation, and approach, at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,

facilitate imple mentation and assessment. 
C2.1.[ADDRESS_526173], increased adherence to a treatment plan, 
empowerment, higher satisfaction with care, and more realistic expectations.73 One relevant exa mple is a 
randomized trial of shared decision making leading to an absolute 25 % decrea se in antibioti c use for 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y illness.[ADDRESS_526174] cases. There are numerous treatment options in the case of localized disease: 
observat ion (i.e., watchful w aiting, active surveillance), surgery, and different types o f radiation therapy —
each with different risks and benefits (e.g., oncological “cure” vs. potential urinary  or sexual dysfunction). 
We plan to explore provider  factors associat ed with the decision to continue or stop ADT for localized 
prostate cancer and fo r non -metastatic bio chemical recurrence, and believe ADT prescribing is a prime 
candidate for at least [ADDRESS_526175] cases for loca lized and 
non-metasta tic recurrent disease. Second,  there are significant harm s that m ay be under appreciated 
prior to using our decision- making approach  therefore decreasing ADT use through our interventions. 
Therefore, our interventions to de -implement l ow-value ADT include:  1) Brief provider training in 
communication and values elicitati on, 2) talking points for providers embedded into a CPRS note 
templ ate, and 3) clinic handout entitled “Living well with prostate cancer – is hormone therapy still right 
for you?” (Appendix I I). Most  of these are not routinely used in practice but could de crease ADT use.  We 
include information about the harms of ADT with a focus on  alternative treatment options in the clinic 
handout. Decision aids are one approach to help communicati on about treatment options thereby 
[CONTACT_417277]- making, and in some cases decreasing overtreatment es pecially when risks 
outwei gh benefit s.73   
As with the formulary restriction, we argue that this is a benign intervention focused  on the pro vider. 
Education is a common event in health care settings, and thi s is des igned to be brief, non- intrusive, and 
focused on a well -accepted practice of sharing elements of decision -making with patients.  
C2.1.4 Tailoring the decision -maki ng strat egy to de-implement l ow value ADT  
We are tailoring our intervention for castrati on with ADT as primar y treatment in localized disease and for 
non-metasta tic biochemical recurrence. Our extensive experience with the University of Michigan C enter for 
Health Communications Resear ch and its tailored approaches  to health care behavior chang e for Drs. 
Skolarus’  and Hawley’s prostate can cer survivorship trial, so cial marke ting in health literatur e,90-[ADDRESS_526176]. Makarov

Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526177] that is acceptable to the clinicians who treat these  patients. 
We are purposely choosing intervention strategies from opposite ends of the behavior change continuum 
because of their evidence- based potential to change provider behavio r. Speci fically,  we are selecting one 
approach (formulary res triction polic y – order check) that operates at the site level and is widely  perceived 
as a forcing function, asking providers to provide a reason regarding their clinical dec ision. The other,  
physician communicat ion during the informed decision- making process, operates  at an individual and 
dyadic level, and is perceived as maximizing the opportunity for clinical discussions. The first approach 
requires little to no learning on the part of prov iders, while t he seco nd requires c onsiderable upfront learning 
(“cost” to the pr ovider ). This approach sets up a testable hypothesis for our  comparative effectiveness trial, 
that a blunt de- implementation policy may be effective in the sho rt term but that it will los e its effects as 
providers learn work -arounds. Conversely, an infor med decision-making approach to de -implementation 
might take longer to observe measurable decreases in castration rates, b ut its effects will create 
sustainable change as providers internal ize and routinize this clinical practice.94

Though participat ion in the research study may not directly benefit parti cipan ts, the data c ollected will benef it 
future provider s and patients by [CONTACT_417283] -based interventions to reduce low value cancer care. Due to the expanding population of aging 
men with pros tate cancer, enhancing safety by [CONTACT_417284]- based use of chemical castration promotes 
quali ty car e and likely will improve qualit y of life. It is possible  that providers taking part in the interventions will 
gain knowledge about be tter use of chemi cal castration for prostate cancer pat ients, particularly with respect to 
localized disease and non- metas tatic biochemical recurrence. M oreover, understanding how  providers unlearn 
ineffective clinical behaviors is a critical step towards opt imizing cancer  care and de -implem entation of low 
value services. Unlearning clinical behaviors such as prescribing ADT in low evidence settings can have 
substantial benefits. First, pa tients are no longer subjected to treatment harms with little to no  bene fit. Second, 
unlear ning misaligned castration pract ices can provide opportunity for more efficient, higher value use of  
specialty care providers. Last , acquiring the skill of unlearning can increase flexibility and willingness to adapt 
to evidence mor e proactively. The risk s posed to research participants a re minimal, consisting of potential

D4. Importan ce of knowledge  to be gained  
Many  men with prostate cancer are castrated with long- acting injec table drugs (i.e., androgen deprivati on 
therapy or ADT). Although some patients benefit, it is also used in patients with little or nothing to gain. The 
best ways to stop, or de- implement, low v alue cancer care are unknown. A significant scientific and cli nical 
knowledge gap remains in priori tizing which barriers to s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_417154]-im plementation. We w ill compare two  different approac hes for reducing low value 
ADT use. In doing so, this study wi ll add ress important issues surroundin g provider behavior change and se rve 
as a model to decrease overtreatment more broadly. This is especiall y important gi ven Choosing Wisely  and 
the need for e ffective de -implementation strategies. Throughout this study, we will keep  a broad  focus  so that 
our work  lays a  foundation for transforming  how and why castration is performed for prostate cancer tr eatment 
across the globe . This work will address provide r preferences and concerns through pi[INVESTIGATOR_417155]-implementation science for low val ue care through our subsequent de -implementa tion evaluation trial.  
 
D5. Data Safety and Monitoring P lan 
Drs. Saini (PI) and Skolarus  (Co-PI) will be  responsi ble for reporting all adverse events that might arise 
during the course of the study to the  Ann Ar bor Veterans Affairs Healt h System  IRB as well as to the I SSO 
and PO as appropriate. Adverse events dur ing this study would likely consist only of breaches in 
confidentiality. As outlined above, precautions have been taken to prevent this. However, should such 
breaches occur, Dr s. Saini  (PI) and Skolarus (Co-PI) will report t hese occurrences to the overseei ng IRBs as 
well as th e ISSO and PO within 48 hours of discovery. 
 
D6. Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
For provider  recruitment, no exclusions will be m ade on the basis of gender , race o r ethnicity. The only 
eligibility r equirement is that participants be providers with experience caring for prostate cancer patients 
on ADT.

 PROTOCO L 
 
STUDY  OVERVIEW  
We are using theory -based, mixed methods to approach de -implementation of low -value an drogen 
deprivation t herapy (ADT). Based on our prior w ork (DeADT  RDC-2017 -1070/  IRB-2017 -1047) involv ing 
behavioral  theory -based qualitative analyses and national provider survey  and dis crete choice experiment 
(DCE), we sel ected competing de -implementatio n strategies for multi- site pi[INVESTIGATOR_417162] 4-site pi[INVESTIGATOR_417163]-value cancer care. This study is 
funded by [CONTACT_417287], 
an HSR&D Center of Inn ovation, providi ng all necessary resources, space, and support for conducti ng this 
researc h. 
 
During  our development work, we en gaged our team to identify and create the compet ing de -
implementation stra tegies based on our prior qualitative research eliciting stakeholder input. W e chose an 
ADT order check attestation (Or)  versus a n ADT provider script ( Sc) as a co mmunication aid to be used and 
documented as a n accounta ble justification in the electronic medical record. Sites receiving the Sc  
intervention wil l also receive  an educational handout that providers may elect to share with patients during 
clinic visits. B oth strategies have a strong evidence- base for changing provi der behavior and are tailored 
based on the COM -B and DCE survey. The work  from p ilot testing  will play a critical role to help us 
understand the acceptability, feasibi lity, a nd scalability of these  strategies  in order to conduc t the full -scale 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_417164]. We will co nduc t pi[INVESTIGATOR_417165] [ADDRESS_526196] tha t is acceptable to the clinicians who treat these patients. From a 
scientific perspective, we are purposely choosing to trial strategies from opposite end s of the behavior 
chang e continuum  because of their evidence -based potential to change provid er behavi or. Specifically, we 
are selecting one approach (Or)  that operates as an organizational constraint and  a competi ng approach 
(Sc) that operates at a n indiv idual and dyadic level  to build individual capacity, perceived to maximize 
ability of pr ovide rs to com municate effectively. The first approach requires little to no learning on the part 
of provid ers, whil e the second requires upfront learning (“cost ” to pr ovider). 
 As illustrat ed in Figure  2, this approach sets up a testable hypothesi s: 
that a blu nt de -implementation organizatio nal approach may be 
effective in the short -term, but that it will lose  its effe cts as providers 
learn work -arounds. Conversely, an i ndividual capacity bu ilding 
appro ach to de -implement ation using a script might take lon ger to 
observe measurable decreases in castration rates, but its effects will 
create sustainable change as providers internali ze and routinize this 
clinical prac tice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/[ADDRESS_526197] the fol lowing specific aim:  
 Aim 1 : To evaluate the implem entation of an ADT order check  (Or) versus a provider s cript (Sc) on 
decreased low -value ADT use  after  six months.  We will first examine low -value ADT use during 6 months 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_417166] 3 VA sites, as well as refine our propos ed RE -AIM implementation outco mes and 
ascertainment, study o f moderators (e.g., fid elity) an d causal mechanisms underl ying implementation 
interventions. This work will inform the subsequent 4- site pi[INVESTIGATOR_417167]. Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], w e will 
refine our site engagement str ategies and study meth ods and materials for the trial.  
 
Data collection  
All [ADDRESS_526198] er to further refine the intervention plan, information will be 
collected regarding the process of ADT ordering at each site, including who is involved, thr ough 
conversati ons wit h the Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (who is also a project consultant ) or their designee. Addi tionally, 
information regarding imple mentation status as  well as any changes in site processes around prescribing 
ADT will be discussed at regular team meetings with the project consultants (including Si te Champi [INVESTIGATOR_5458]). For 
both the p ilot and implementation trial, outcomes will be collected fro m VA CDW/Cancer Registry/Vital 
Status/CMS records and CPRS/Capri/JLV /WebVRAM  for all clinic visits documented as providi ng low -value 
ADT at ba seline, [ADDRESS_526199] -intervention through VA Qua ltrics (Appendix VI).  
 
Outcomes Analyses  
Primary analyses: Comparing the effectiveness of two de- implementati on strategies, Or vs. Sc, on 
continued lo w-value ADT use a fter six  months. Our pr imary outco me is stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417168], which wi ll 
likely be evaluated through a combination of chart reviews and informatics data generated through the ordering process. We will also explore the feasibility and im pact of six -month outcome s during pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t testin g 
to increase study effici ency and timelines s. 
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 25 of 88   
  
Secondary outcomes: RE -AIM implementation outcomes, changes from baseline measures, total ADT 
injections per arm a t [ADDRESS_526200]  implementation. (Table 4). We will examine m oderators o f strategy 
effec tiveness (e.g., fidelity) and cau sal mechanisms un derlying the strategies through content analysis from 
study team and pi[INVESTIGATOR_417169] o n our organizational assessment.

IDENTIF YING LOW-VALUE  ADT  IN PI[INVESTIGATOR_417193]/CENTRAL  CANCER  REGISTRY/VI TAL  STATUS/CMS   
 
• We will collect data using CDW/Cancer Registry/Vital Status/CMS data fro m Octo ber 1 , 1999 to  June 30,  2024  
 
• Study Data Man ager will identify  the low-value ADT  coho rt using 20 20 - 2022 VA CDW/Central Cancer 
Registry/Vital Status /CMS data.  
o Real SSNs will be  necessary in order to link data across databases and to conduct chart r eviews . 
 
• Target clinic visits  appropri ate for low -value ADT de- impleme ntatio n will be identi fied using CD W/Cancer 
Registry/Vital Status/CMS data based on pa tient diagn osis, PC treatment, and treatment dates. 
 
• We developed real -time ‘smart’ criteria to supp ort st reamlined implementatio n including:  
1.  Injectable ADT order  within 14 m onths of the cur rent date ( e.g., leuprolide J9217)  
2.  Prostate cancer diagnosis (I CD-9 185, I CD-10 C61)  
3.  Low and non- rising PSA levels consistent with l ocaliz ed disease or treated non -metast atic biochemically -
recurrent prostate cancer ( <2 ng/mL ) 
 
• Clinic visits identified as  appropriate for ADT de -implementation will include all those with patients  undergoing 
ADT monotherapy as well as those with non -metastatic prostate cancer after definitive treatment, and those 
receivi ng con tinuous ADT for biochemica l recurrence .  
 
o ADT mon otherapy/pr imary ADT i s defined by:  
1. Never had  evidence of metast atic di sease (including bones and lymph nodes)  
2. No treatment with castration -resistant prost ate cancer (CRPC) medications (e.g.,  abirateron e, 
enzalutami de)  
3. No definitive  treatment with radiatio n (+/- adjuvant ADT),  RP, or cryotherapy, and has no immediate 
plan f or defin itive treatment  
4. Receiving ongoing ADT  at the VA  
5. Current PSA ≤2 and not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_3408]  (no P SADT <10 month s) 
 
o Biochemical recurrence is defined by:  
1. Never had evi dence of metast atic disease  (including bones and lymph nodes)  
2. No treatment with CRPC  medications (e. g., abiraterone, enzalutamide)  in the last two years  
3. Has comp leted  definitive treatment with radiation (+/ - adjuvant ADT) , RP, or cryotherapy  
 The course of adjuv ant ADT no t within 3 y ears of definit ive trea tment   
4. Rise in PSA level  after definit ive tr eatment  
 2 ng/mL over nadir for  those with histor y of radiation  treatment  
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 30 of 88

5. No rise in PSA level  after definit ive tr eatment  
 Current PSA ≤2 and not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_3408]  (no P SADT <10 month s) 
 
• Throughout the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], t he data manager will complete data pulls at different time int ervals (e.g., weekly, bi -weekly, 
monthly, et c.) to determine how often the data may  need to be refreshed duri ng the RCT.  Data such as patient 
appointment cancellations, changes in PSA scores, new dr ug names, variations of a ppointments/ treatments, etc.  
are important to keep updated as they can impact  patient eligibility.  
MPCA  NATURAL  LANGUAG E PROCESSING  (NLP)  TOOL USE IN VINCI  
• We will use a validated NLP tool developed by [CONTACT_417292] m etastat ic prostate cancer (mPCa) in real time.  This will enable us to further refine our cohort by 
[CONTACT_417293].  
o The Prostate Core has provided a data d ictionary for definitions of the va riables . 
o We will inform the Prostate Core if any of our defi nitions are different (e.g., prostate canc er, mPCa, etc.) .  
o In the event we find mPCa  patients after we co mplete chart reviews, we will i nform the P rostate Core team.  
o Study staff will view the NL P data output in a VINCI worksheet . 
 
• The PCa Data Core table /list is updated monthl y by [CONTACT_92532] (we should receive email notifications from VINCI w hen 
the list has been u pdated).  
CHART  REVIEWS  
• Study staff will also conduct chart reviews using CPRS/Capri/J LV/WebVRAM  to confirm target ADT orders  
and clinic visits . 
o Study staff will apply for  local CPRS access at participating sites  through WebVRAM , though Capri/JLV may 
also be used to conduct chart reviews  
 
• As the ADT injections occur serially at 1, 3, or [ADDRESS_526202] multiple 
opportunities to be exposed to the interventi on during the 6 -month study period.  
 
• Low-value ADT injections mu st have occurred within 14 months  prior to data pull .  
 
• In consultation with Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. S kolarus, a fellowship- trained urologi c onc ologist, and Co -I [CONTACT_417374], an  expert 
prostate cancer medic al oncologist, and Co-I [CONTACT_263020], Chief of  Radiation Oncology  at AAVA, we will provide 
multi- disciplinary review for questionable low -value ADT use.  
 
• Clinic visits identified during chart  reviews or multi -disciplinary review as involving proper justifi cation for ADT use 
will not be considered appropriate for ADT de -implementation.  
 
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 31 of 88   
 • When identifying clinic visits as appropriate for the ADT de-implementa tion interventions, no interventions will be 
triggered on any clinic visit s for providers who opted out of the study.  
 
• We will track numbers of identified low -value A DT injections each week per site.  
 
• Paper records created for chart review purposes will be  labeled with a study ID only and stored i n locked filing 
cabinets in the locked 3rd floor CCMR suite in VA-rented space at NCRC. Once data is digi tized, the paper co pi[INVESTIGATOR_417194]’s secure shredder bin.  
PATIENT  DASHBOARD  IN CPRS  
• See Appendix IV for screenshots of an exa mple d ashboard . 
 
• We will wo rk with Yehuda Bechar, MBA, ou r consultant  technology developer and study team member, to create a 
patient dashbo ard accessible through AAVA  CPRS.  
 
• The dashboard will enable the study team to:  
o View upcoming clinic visits identifie d as appropriate for ADT d e-implementation . 
o Know when w e can assig n the progress note template to providers who have an upcoming cl inic visit 
identified as appropria te for ADT de -implementation . 
o Determine when a patient ha s an order for ADT in CPRS. 
o Comple te qua lity checks (e.g., t o know whi ch patient records  to look at to  confirm the order check was 
generated) . 
 
• Once a site is randomized,  the Data Manager will run a new data pull for that site. She will create  a file  with the list 
of potentially eligib le patients from CDW  to upload to the dashboard. A separate Excel spreadsheet will be created 
for each site.  The data files will be save d here: I:\Skolarus 2017 \DeA DT\5. Identifiable Data \RCT Data \Files for 
Upload . Data files will be upl oade d to the dashboard.  
 
• Dashboard administ rators  will download exp ort data files from the dashboard  and save here: I:\Skolarus 
2017 \DeADT \5. Identifiable Data \RCT Data \Dashboard Export Files. These data will the n be im ported into the 
database. This will a lso need to be done when changes to the dashboard data fields are mad e, as the export fields 
need to match the database import  fields.  
 
• Prio
r to chart review screening, t he study team will ask Yehuda to run the program that looks for the most recent  
clinic visits  – these will be ad ded to the “ next screen date ” column.   
 
• Study team will ask site CHIO and/or CAC’s to add the dashboard link to their CPRS tools menu. The FID in the 
URL will need to be updated for each site.  Quotation marks are required at the beg inning and end of the 
link when being  programmed.  The link should not include any additio nal spaces or characters – this can cause a  
user access error. Dashboard l ink:

PI[INVESTIGATOR_417198]  (OR) 
• Prior to launc h, we will pull a cohor t from each facility to identify tar get A DT orders for the Or intervention.  
 
• Due to the delay in Cancer Reg istry data availability, we will need to pu ll data for an 18 -month period to build  our 
sample  (e.g., for January 2022 launch, w e will pull from Janua ry 2020  to July 2021).  
 
• Study staff will conduct chart rev iews usi ng CPRS/Capri/JLV /WebVRAM  to confirm all ADT orders qualifying as

he loc al CAC is  ready, study sta ff will put them in c ontact with Joye ( joye.al [EMAIL_7966] ), who will send th em 
a VISTA file with the CROC to ins tall and update ac cording to the coding guid e. In the event Joye isn’t  availab le, 
Erica Montressor ( erica.montressor@va.g ov) o r Cindy Shepler  (mary.sh [EMAIL_7967] ) can send the V I STA file if we 
provide them w ith the lo cal CACs VISTA ema il. 
 
• Study st
aff will request CAC to change the CROC to live mode when the intervention is set to  start.  
 
• Once the CROC  has been swit ched to live mode, s tudy staff will place a “Living Wel l ADT” health  factor in th e EMR 
of pati ents whose  clinic visits stu dy staff have confirmed to be ta rgets for ADT de- implementation.  We will enter  
health factors as we identify eligible pa tients. This health factor combined with a low PS A level ( most rec ent PSA < 
2ng/ mL) will trigger the ADT Order  Check Attestation Interventi on (Or) when  the provider places an order f or ADT  
(Lupron, Eli gard, Viadur,  Goserilin, and Z olodex) . 
 
• Providers may ove rride the CRO C by [CONTACT_45342] a number from the order check text that corresponds t o the reason 
they are overri ding the order check. Provide rs are also able to  enter text if a numbere d reason is not lis ted.  
 
• If pro viders opt -out af ter the health factor was p laced for one of their patients, study staff wi ll remove the hea lth 
factor in CP RS. For a provider who opt s-out, the Study Data Manage r will run a query in our Access tracking 
database to pull a list of his/her pat ients. The Stud y Team will not place a h ealth factor  in the EMR of patients 
whose provider has opted out.  
 
• Study staff wil l do periodic quality cont rol checks to ensure the int erventi on is wo rking a s expected and work wit h 
the site CAC’s to make adjustme nts as necessary.   
 
• Appropriate use of the i ndication will be tracked for fidelity. We will track comments  entered by [CONTACT_417295]. The Study Data Manager w ill periodically pull comments from order che cks (there are data 
tables for orde r checks that c ontain text for open fiel d that are s tored in CDW).  
o Using a combination o f progress notes and  other CPRS d ata, study staff will chec k to determine whether 
the pati ent received  the injection.  
• Deimplementing Or – study staff will remove HFs for intervention patients. W e’ll ask site to remove st udy HF from 
their CPRS .

PROVIDER  SCRIPT  (SC) INTERVENTION 
• The pi[INVESTIGATOR_417202], a s need ed. 
 
• The purpose of th e script is to enable providers to:  
o Improve i nterpersonal skills 
o Increase confi dence in the evidence base and comm unication s urrounding low -value ca re 
 
• It is up to the dis cretion of the provider whether/how to inc orporate the s cript into the c linic visit d iscussion. 
PROGRESS  NOTE  
• We will work with Er ica Mons tressor ([EMAIL_7968] ), or another,  AAVA CAC , to develop the progress 
note template. We will also creat e an instruction gui de for CAC s at oth er sites to upload the note templa te file in 
CPRS .  
 
• Eri
ca, or an other AAVA  CAC will send the note template via VISTA emai l to local CACs wi th direction s to install. In 
the event Erica is n ot available,  Joye Allen ( joye.allen @va.gov ), or Cindy Shepl er ([EMAIL_7969] ) can send 
the VISTA f ile if w e pro vide them with the local CAC ’s VISTA email.  
• This is t he exact entry  for the reminder d ialog  they would need unless we make any updates to it between now 
and then.  
 
 
  
 
Versio n 6, 10/ 04/2023   Page 37 of 88   
 • Study  staff will ente r a CPR S progress note approximately  one busines s day prior to a target low-value ADT cl inic 
visit. Notes will not be assigned  for ADT in jection -only visits. The note includes talking point s for the provider t o 
help with a discussion with t he Veteran.    
o The note can be edited and signed by [CONTACT_417299], givin g a quick and simple w ay to document the 
discussion.  The prog ress note will prompt providers  to indicate whether  patient prefers t o con tinue or 
discontinue ADT.   
 
• The progress not e will include links to  the clinic handout which will be po sted on CCMR ’s external website (outs ide 
VA firewall) .  
 
• Providers  may mo dify, ignore, or delete the progress  note.   
 
• Appropriate use of the indica tion will be tracked for fidelity.  We will track how man y notes are placed. We will also 
be able to run a report of all signed  and unsigned  progr ess notes.  
 
• At the end of the intervention period, Ann Arbor CAC’s will delete/remove all unsigned pro gress no tes. Unsig ned 
notes will need to be reassigned at the end of  the stu dy. Erica, or another AAVA CAC will run a report of unsigne d 
notes  by [CONTACT_417300] e title for An n Arb or. The CAC will change t he note author back to a member of the st udy team, 
which we  can then rem ove from CPRS. We will ask the Data Manager to reas sign the not e in CDW  for other sites or 
ask the site CAC if necessary.  
o If provide rs delet e an unsigned not e, it’s unlikely to  appea r in a TIU progress note report .  
CLINIC HANDOUT  
• The clinic h andout will be tailored to each i ndividual facility,  e.g., with site  name (Appendix V). 
 
• Prior to each site’s scheduled IES , study sta ff will provide clinic  handouts  to the clinic  point per son identified by [CONTACT_417301][INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (the clinic  point person may al so be the Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] ). We may use one or more of the following 
approaches:  
o By [CONTACT_2319]: hardco pi[INVESTIGATOR_417203] n (as requested ). Each clinic will 
receive 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_417204].  
o By [CONTACT_6968]: copi[INVESTIGATOR_417205] ( this may hap pen when  we send Site 
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] t he em ail templates or in a separate email) . Each clinic  will be instructed to print 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_417206].  
o By [INVESTIGATOR_182409]:  a copy of  the handout will be accessible on CC MR’s  websit e (outsi de the VA firew all). A lin k to 
the w ebsite will be in cluded in the progres s note.  
 
• If requested by [CONTACT_417302], the study  will provide suppli es to sites to disp lay the clinic handouts. Stu dy staff will check in 
to ensure handouts were received and are b eing dis played and/or m ade accessi ble to providers and to  address 
any issues tha t come up.  
 
• It is up to the discret ion of th e provider whether/how to incorporate t he handout into the clini c visit discussion.

Dear << Insert Medic al Ce nter Direc tor nam e>>, 
 
The p urpose of this ema il is to re quest  your support for participation i n a rese arch proj ect funded by [CONTACT_153518] H 
National Cancer Institute and coor dinated b y the VA An n Arbor Healthcare System .  The overall ob jective o f this 
project, e ntitled “Li ving W ell with Pr ostate Cancer”, is to encoura ge de- implementation of l ow-value Andr ogen 
Deprivation Ther apy (ADT) in a w ay that is accepta ble to the clinici ans treat ing these p atients.   Low-value ADT ( not 
supported by  [CONTACT_21401]) includes prima ry treatme nt for localized p rostate cancer and non-metast atic biochemi cally 
recurr ent prostate cancer w ith low P SA levels.  I will b e acting as  site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] t o support the A nn Ar bor VA 
study team by [CONTACT_417311] h with the  appropriate  clinic staff a t our s ite.   
 
The g oal of this proj ect is to  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] <<insert  for NY Harb or and WLA: o ne of>> two tools  to supp ort provider s in potent ial 
de-implementation of low -value care.   Our partici pation will last f or 6 months. At  the << insert site  name>> V A we will b e 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_417227] o rder-check (only  triggered when orders m eet criteria for low -value care.)  <<insert  for Ann Arbor: 
Additionally, we will p ilot a CPRS note templat e for cl inic vis its m eeting criteria f or low- value c are. The not e includes 
talking points f or the provider to  help with a de-implementat ion dis cussion with the Vet eran. It can be edited and 
acknowledged by [CONTACT_417312], giving a qui ck and simple way  to doc ument a discussi on. Handouts for patients about 
ADT use will be supplied for  providers to u se at t heir discre tion.>>  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_417228] -imple mentation st rategi es will allow t he study team  to tes t acceptab ility, feasibility , and 
scalability  for a su bseque nt randomized  controlled trial  to determine wh ich de -implementation strategy  is mos t effec tive 
in reducing low-value AD T use. 
 
Provider s are no t required t o change thei r prescr ibing habits and will still b e able to order ADT.  We will simply  be 
provi ding a light-touch intervention to e ncourage provide rs to follow standard of care and provide a quic k and eas y 
mechanis m for d ocumenti ng treatment decisions. << insert for Ann Arbor : Providers  are not required to  use the CPRS 
note template, it can be edit ed/signed, delet ed, or ignored. The  Ann Arbor  study te am will de lete any unsigned ve rsions 
of the template at  the en d of the st udy perio d.>> 
 
The VA An n Arbor IRB h as determined that o ur projec t meets federal crit eria for exempt minimal risk researc h under  
categor ies 2  (survey  procedures), 3 (benign behav ioral interven tions), and 4 (secondary research) .  I do not  believe our  
VA to  be engaged  in research for  the foll owing reasons : 
• The [ site] VA will not b e interveni ng or interactin g with research subj ects fo r resear ch pu rposes, including obtainin g 
informed cons ent. 
• The [ site] V A will not have access to s tudy data. 
• Please note that Th e Office  for Human Researc h Protect ions (OHRP) s tipulate s that permit ting investigators f rom 
another institution to use y our fac ility to  conduct  research does not con stitute  engageme nt. 
(https://www. hhs.gov/ohr p/regulat ions-and-policy/guidance/guidance- on-engageme nt-of-institut ions/index.html ). 
 
Therefore , we do n ot believe there is a need for  local RDC/IRB  approval. Howeve r, I think t his study  will be of val ue to 
our si te and I hope you will support  this effort.   
 Please reply  to thi s email to confirm your sup port, or  to let me know if you have an y concerns.   If you would like 
additional information  on the  project, t he intervention, or the inf ormed c onsent p rocedures that the Ann Arbor team  will

This email is to  let you k now that our  VA will be par ticipat ing in a pr oject funded by [CONTACT_417313] C ancer Institute and 
coordinated b y the VA  Ann Arbor He althcare System.  The overal l objective of this project, e ntitled, “Living Well with 
Prostate Canc er,” is to encou rage de -implementation of low -value A ndrogen Deprivatio n Ther apy (ADT) in  a way that  is 
acceptabl e to the cli nicians that treat th ese patients.  Low-value ADT ( not support ed by  [CONTACT_21401]) includes prima ry 
treatment for localized prostate can cer and non- metastatic bi ochemical re currence  with lo w PSA leve ls. I will be  acting as 
site champio n, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_417233] t eam by [CONTACT_417314].   
 
Goals of t
his project include:  
1. Provide education to provi ders on the benefits  vs. ha rms of ADT as prim ary treatment for prostate cancer and non-
metastatic bi ochemical recurrence . 
2. Provide a tool in CPRS to s upport providers  in potential de- implemen tation of low-valu e car e. The tools have  been 
informed by [CONTACT_417315] c hoice experiment s with V A 
urologists . Our site will receive:  
• An ADT o rder-check (only  triggered for V eterans meeting crit eria for low-value c are). 
3. To pi[INVESTIGATOR_417234]- implementation strategies (including an orde r check) for accep tabilit y, feasibility, an d 
scalabi lity. 
4. To determine which of  two de- imple mentation strateg ies (an order check or a CPRS  note template) is most 
effective in reduc ing low-value ADT use.  
 
An exam ple of the propo sed de- implementation tool (order ch eck) is attached. Providers are not r equired to change their  
prescribing habits and w ill still be able to order ADT. We ar e simply providing a tool to encoura ge ev idence- based ca re, 
and to provide a quic k and easy mechan ism to do cument if there is a  reason 1) they ar e deviati ng from guidelin es 
(example  – patient pr eference/anx iety), or 2) that they are fol lowing guid elines (t hat this is not in fact low -value ca re).

Good morning  <<insert name [CONTACT_417361]( s)>>, 
 
We are working on a pro ject wit h Dr( s). <<insert  name( s) of site champi[INVESTIGATOR_417244] t eam m embers/leadership who hav e

metastatic  biochemical recurrence, where  it is not supported  by [CONTACT_417320].  A DT does , howeve r, have 
significant side eff ects. 
 
We hope to d ecrease use of low -value ADT (or lear n why  it is still being prescribed i n these cases) by [CONTACT_417321]. The goal i s to not ify the provider tha t they ma y want to consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417245], a nd to provide a

minimize th e burden to pro vider s, we o nly want the order che ck to be tri ggered for  Veterans who are getting l ow-value

Dear << Insert Med ical Center Director na me>>, 
The purpose of th is em ail is to request  your support f or partici pation i n a research projec t funded by [CONTACT_417325]. The overall objectiv e of this 
project, entitled “Living Well with Pr ostat e Cancer ”, is to support decreased use of low-value Andr ogen Depri vation 
Therapy ( ADT) in a  way that is acceptable to  the clinicia ns treat ing these patients. Low-value ADT (not s upported  by 
[CONTACT_21401]) i ncludes p rimary  treatment for localize d prostate  canc er and non- metastatic biochemi cally re current  
prostate cancer w ith low PSA levels.  I will b e acting as site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394],  helpi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] s upport t he Ann Ar bor VA study team 
by [CONTACT_417326] e clinic staff at our site.  
 
The g oal of t his p roject is to test one of two tools to support  providers  in decr easing low-value car e. Our participation  
will last for up to 12 months. At our site we will be testing < <insert for  Or site: an ADT  order -check (o nly triggered when 
orders meet cr iteria for  low-value care.)>> or <<insert fo r SC sit e:  a CPRS note te mplate for clinic v isits m eeting

Testi ng th
ese strateg ies will allow the study  team to determine which  strategy  is most effective in reducing low -value 
ADT use.  
 
Providers are not  requi red to change t heir pr escribing habi ts and will still be able  to orde r ADT. We will s imply be 
providing a lig ht-touch interve ntion to encour age provi ders to follow standard of  care and pro vide a quick and eas y

The V A Ann A rbor IRB has  determ ined that  our project meets federal  criteria for  exempt minimal r isk research under 
categories  2 (survey  procedures),  3 (benign  behavioral  interventions),  and 4 (secondar y resear ch). I do not believe our 
VA to be  engaged in resear ch for the following reaso ns: 
• Our VA will not be intervening or interactin g with rese arch subje cts for research purposes,  includin g 
obtaining informed con sent. 
• Our VA will not have  acces s to study  data 
• Please note that The Office for Huma n Resea rch Protect ions (O HRP)  stipul ates tha t permit ting investigat ors 
from another institut ion to use your f acility  to conduct r esea rch does not  constitute engagement 
(https: //www.hh s.gov/ohrp/regulations -and-policy/guidance/guidance- on-engagement- of-institut ions/index.html ). 
 
Therefore,  we do not believe there is a need for local RDC/IRB  approval.  Howe ver, I think this study will be of value to 
our site an d I hope you will s upport t his effort.  
 
Please reply  to this email  to confi rm your  support,  or to let me know if you have a ny concerns.  If you would like 
additional information on  the proje ct, the interventi on, or the informed consent procedures that the A nn Arbor team will 
follow when contact[CONTACT_417328], p lease do not hesitate to ask m e. You can also reac h the Ann A rbor study team at

This email  is to let you know  that ou r VA will be pa rticipating in a project funded by [CONTACT_417329] . The overall obj ective of this proje ct, entitled, “Living Well 
with Prost ate Cancer, ” is to support decreased us e of low-value  Androgen  Deprivation Therapy  (ADT) in a way that  is

as sit e champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], h elpi[INVESTIGATOR_417253] t the Ann A rbor VA study team by [CONTACT_417331] s ite. 
 
Goal s of t
his project  include:  
1. Provide education  to provider s on the benefi ts vs. harms  of ADT as prima ry treatment  for prostate cancer  and 
non-metastati c biochemic al recurrence.  
2. Provide a tool in CPRS to supp ort providers  in potential de-implementat ion of low-value care. The tools  have  
been informed by [CONTACT_417332] s of V A providers who prescribe  ADT and discrete choic e experiments  
with VA urologi sts. Our si te wil l receive:  
• An ADT order-check (only triggered for Veterans  meeting criteria  for low-value care).  
3. To de termine  which  of two de-implement ation strat egies  (an order  check or a CPRS  note templa te) is most 
effective  in reduc ing low-value ADT us e. 
 
An example o f the proposed de- implement ation tool ( order check) is atta ched. Providers are not required to change 
their prescribin g habits and will still be able to or der ADT . We are sim ply providing a tool to encourage evi dence- based 
care, and to provide a quick  and e asy mechanism  to docume nt if there is a reason 1) they are deviating from guidel ines 
(exam ple – patie nt prefer ence/anxiety), or 2) that  they are following  guidel ines (that t his is not in fa ct low -value care).  
 
If you h ave any concerns  or would like addit ional information,  please do not hesita te to ask. You can also reach  the

Dear Dr. <<Insert name >>, 
 
I’m writing to re quest your parti cipation as Site Cham pi[INVESTIGATOR_401914] a study that aims to decrease the  use of  low-value 
androgen deprivation therapy (A DT). Our targets of low- value ADT in clude primary  treatment  for prostate cancer and  
non-metasta tic biochemically r ecurrent prostate ca ncer. I be lieve that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33096] s caling back  low-value ADT use i s 
an integral s tep in  improving prostate cancer care qual ity. Therefore, I am leading a NIH N ational Cancer Ins titute 
funded trial to test tw o intervent ions to decrease low-va lue ADT fo r pros tate cancer in a way that supports  clinic ians.  
 
Given its significa nt long-term effec ts on  cardiovascular,  sexual, and bo ne heal th, ADT should only be used w hen 
there is evidence i ts benefits outweigh its  side effect s. As you know, the use of ADT fo r loca lized pros tate cancer and 
non-m etastatic biochemica lly recurrent disease goes aga inst the s tandard of care guidelines publ ished b y the 
Ameri can Urolog ical Ass ociation and Natio nal Comprehensive Cancer Network. Our goal is  to help the medi cal 
professi on foc us on incr easing the use of standard  of care and de crease harms  to pat ients. Yo ur service a s Site 
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_417259]-value ADT an d contin ue to support  the missi on of the VHA .  
 
We under
stand that wi th competing  demands,  time is p reciou s. This st udy wi ll be conducted from Ann Arbo r, whi ch 
means we will im plement the study intervention and manage regulatory appr ovals . I’m asking you to act as  Site 
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_417260] A nn Arbor VA study team by g etting the m in to uch with the appropri ate cli nic 
staff at your sit e, and to help assur e the interv ention is tailor ed to fit we ll with your sit e’s existing workflo w. 
 Participating site s will be  randomized t o one  of two interventions:  
 
1) ADT Or der Check Arm : Providers will see an order check w hen placin g an order for ADT as  notification that 
the Veteran m ay not be getting guideline -concordant care.   Providers may cont inue wi th the order by  [CONTACT_20683] 
a reason fo r con tinuing. The order  check will be triggered only for Veterans  identi fied by  [CONTACT_941] A nn Arbor s tudy 
team as potentially  getting low-value ADT. Cases  that are not clear will be dec ided upon by a multidisciplinary 
team in cluding a urologist,  a medical oncologist,  and a radiation oncologist.  
 
2) Provider Scri pt Arm: Providers  will be assigned a progress n ote in CPRS just ahead of a Vet eran’s vis it only 
when V eteran h as been i dentified by [CONTACT_417341] -value ADT. This note 
can be used b y the provider as a quick  way to docum ent either the indi cation for prescribin g ADT o r the 
decision to stop A DT. The  note can al so be ignore d or del eted.  A patient h ando ut “Living w ell with prostate 
cancer – is hormone ther apy still right for you?” t o sup port providers in these discussions will be linked in t he 
note template.  
 If you are  int
erested in serving as a Site Ch ampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], I will ask  that you work w ith the Ann Arbor project team 
to: 
1) Notify your f acility ’s Leadership t eam a bout the study (e mail templ ates will be provided)  
2) Promote the study  among your depar tment’s clin icians  (email te mplates will be provi ded) 
3) Assist in  the s cheduling of  an educat ion se ssion w ith providers and staff involved with prescribin g of ADT  
4) Provid e a list  of clinician s and staff involved wi th prescribi ng of ADT so that the project team may reach out to 
them as n eeded 
5) Consider taking a  brief survey regar ding ADT p ractices at your site 
 
This study is operationalized in such a w ay to avoid res earch “e ngagemen t” by [CONTACT_417342]. All study 
activities will be p erformed by [CONTACT_417343] y staf f under AA VA RDC oversight. No l ocal VA p ersonnel w ill have 
access to identifiab le data. As  such, we feel t hat no local oversight is necessary . Please see the a ttached memo fro m 
the A AVA RDC and  let us kn ow if you would l ike to discuss further. 
 
Please rep ly to this  email if you have any q uestions ab out the research project, or to let  us know your interest

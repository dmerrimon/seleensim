STUDY ENDPOINTS  The primary study endpoint is the  change  in the average 24 hour 
pain score  (change from baseline to the 6-month follow -up). The 
difference in the mean of the change in the average [ADDRESS_645389] .  The average pain 
score s will be obtained from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference 
Diary  (recorded daily by [CONTACT_172739] [ADDRESS_645390] round of injections and again, before the 6 month 
follow -up).   
 
SAFETY  Any subject  who receives study drug ( VM202  or placebo)  will be 
included in the safety analysis population.   Adverse events 
(including serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to 
treatment discontinuation) throughout the 9 month s follow -up will 
be de scribed according to severity and to their relationship with the 
study drug and injection  procedure. Descriptive statistics (N, mean, 
median, SD, minimum and maximum values, where applicable) will be used to characterize safety parameters.  
 All subject s will all undergo testing as presented in the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Screening Guidelines as part of their baseline testing to rule out cancer.  
 
PHARMACOKINETICS  Determination of HGF serum levels will be determined 
immediately pre -treatment on Day 0,  immediately pre -treatment on 
Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  The number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_501112]202 in whole blood will be determined at Day 0 (pre -injection, 
and 2 hours  [± 1 hour]  post injection), at Day 14 (pre -injection, and 
2 hours [± 1 hour]  post inj ection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 60 and Day

factors, and is associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality.  The total 
estimated cost of diabetes in 2007 was $174 billion, including $116 billion in excess 
medical expenditures and $58 billion in reduced national productivity.1 
 
1.1.1.  DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY  
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most commonly encountered 
neuropathic pain syndromes in clinical practice, and is a particularly debilitating 
complication of diabetes.  When symptomatic, it is associated with continuous or 
paroxysmal pain described by [CONTACT_501131], stabbing, or electric in nature.[ADDRESS_645398] of DPN 
and its complications in the U.S. is estimated to be between $4.6 and $13.[ADDRESS_645399] categories: sensory, motor and autonomic.  The most 
prevalent form is somatic or sensorimotor neuropathy.  Symptoms often exhibit a distal symmetric pattern, beginning distally at the base of the toes and ascending 
proximally up the lower leg as the disease progresses.  Symptoms are described as 
burning, tingling, stabbing and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] -and-needles sensation in a stocking and glove 
distribution.  Patients may also display muscle weakness, lack of coordination and ataxia, and loss of pain perception.  Loss of protective sensation can lead to the 
formation of foot ulcerations, infections, and amputations.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_501113], the sequence of physiological events that 
result in this condition is poorly understood.  The pathogenesis of diabetic 
neuropathy likely involves the interplay of hyperglycemia, ischemia, and oxidative

 Oxidative Stress.  Hyperglycemia induces an increased presence of markers of

Modifiable risk factors.  The incidence of neuropathy is also associated with 
potentia lly modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including an elevated triglyceride 
level, a high body mass index, smoking, and hypertension.19   
 Foot care.  Patients  with diabetes also need to be educated about foot care and 
footwear, and about protection of hyposensitive areas and pressure points, to prevent 
the occurrence of ulcers and to decrease the risk of bone infection.

1.2.2.  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
There are only two drugs approved by [CONTACT_374567]: Cymbalta – (duloxetine), a serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_501114]; and Lyrica - (pregabalin), an anticonvulsant drug.  Both are 
prescribed for the management of pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

α-lipoic acid . α-lipoic acid is a naturally occurring antioxidant compound that can be 
purchased as a dietary supplement.  It is synthesized in small amounts by [CONTACT_501132][INVESTIGATOR_501117].  α-lipoic acid was recently 
studied in a multicenter placebo -controlled trial of subject s with type 2 diabetes and 
symptomatic neuropathy.  One hundred eighty one (181) subject s were given once a 
daily oral doses of [ADDRESS_645406] to minimize the risk of occurrence.  Clearly, it would be desirable to prevent, impede, or reverse the disrupting and often life- threatening

  Page 20 of 103 1.3. HGF  FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY  
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be a potent angiogenic growth 
factor, stimulating the growth of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth 
muscle cells.24,25  It is a multi- functional mesenchyme -derived cytokine with potent 
angiogenic and anti -apoptotic effects  24-27  HGF stimulates DNA, RNA and protein 
synthesis by [CONTACT_374569] a dose -dependent manner and attenuates high D -
glucose -induced endothelial cell de ath.  HGF has also been shown to upregulate 
vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression, and has demonstrated greater 
mitogenic activity than that of VEGF alone in human aortic endothelial cells in 
vitro .28,29  Recently, HGF gene transfer  has been shown to produce significant 
augmentation of collateral formation in the rabbit hind limb ischemia model.25  
Furthermore, a significant increase in blood flow was achieved by [CONTACT_501134]- diabetic  hind limb ischemia models.27,30   
 Recent research also indicates that HGF can function as a neurotrophic factor.
31  
Sympathetic neurons co -express bioactive HGF , its cognate receptor  (the Met 
receptor ), and localized exogenous HGF has been shown to promote the growth (but 
not surv ival) of sympathetic neurons.32-36  It is proposed that administration of HGF 
may promote axonal growth and regeneration.  As loss of microvasculature in 
diabe tic neuropathy has also been implicated in acceleration of neuronal loss and 
pain symptoms,37 HGF may be an ideally suited candidate for the treatment this 
condit ion.  Exogenous VEGF has been studied in this patient population, but with 
limited success.38-41 
 
The challenge associated with delivering a targeted sustained dose of exogenous 
HGF is in overcoming the instability of HGF in blood circulation and its rapid clearance by [CONTACT_4852]; HGF has an in vivo  half-life of less than [ADDRESS_645407] that it is associated with limited persistence and no propensity for genomic 
integration, (particularly in skeletal muscle tissue) makes it an attractive option for 
local targeted deli very.  
  
1.4. VM202 
The investigational agent being studied in this protocol is VM202.  VM202 is a 
DNA plasmid that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid human hepatocyte growth 
factor (HGF) coding sequence (HGF -X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF 
[ADDRESS_645408] the ability to decrease neuropathic pain, and 
improve quality of life and exercise capacity.  
 
 
1.5. PRECLINICAL DATA 
The non- clinical safety of VM202 has been evaluated for general toxicity following 
single intramuscular and intra venous doses in rats.  In addition, the general toxicity 
of VM202 following multiple intermittent (weekly or monthly) intramuscular doses has been evaluated in rabbits and rats, respectively.  The potential for genomic 
integration at the injection site as well as the potential for distribution to and 
persistence of VM202 in reproductive tissues was evaluated in rats. The ability of VM202 to induce humoral immune responses was evaluated following intramuscular 
administration with or without adjuvant in mice.   All species utilized for these 
studies (mouse, rat, and rabbit) were shown in in vivo  experiments to be able to 
express the plasmid following intramuscular injection.

histologically ident ifiable capi[INVESTIGATOR_501119]202 (versus pCK and pCK -VEGF165; p< 0.001).  
 
Collectively, VM202 has been well -tolerated in all studies conducted to date, with 
the only evidence of toxicity consisting of mild, transient injection site irritation in rats at a dose level 11 times the clinical dose of 8 mg / leg (0.11 mg/kg for a [ADDRESS_645409] ).  There has been no evidence of systemic toxicity in any study and human 
HGF has not been detected in the sera of rats or rabb its following intramuscular 
injection [lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) = 125 pg/mL].  There is no evidence of genomic integration, potential germ cell transmission, or immunostimulatory 
effects following intramuscular administration of VM202 to animals.   
 
Therefore, the nonclinical efficacy and safety studies support the clinical 
investigation of VM202 in subject s with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.   
 
 
1.6. CLINICAL DATA 
VM202 was/is being evaluated in three clinical trials.  
 
1.6.1.  PHASE I STUDY IN CRITIC AL LIMB ISCHEMIA  
VM202was evaluated for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a prospective, 
dose-escalation Phase I study .  The study consist ed of four (4) cohorts of three (3) 
‘no-option’ CLI subject s.  Subject s received 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg VM202.  
For each dose cohort, VM202 was administered as local intramuscular injection s 
with half of the dose administered at Day 0 of the study and the second half 
administered 2 weeks later .  Preliminary efficacy (hemodynamic assessments), 
safety and tol erability were evaluated at Baseline (screening) and at designated time 
points throughout the study.  Clinical evaluations were to be conducted at baseline, 
Days 15, 28, 59, 91, 180, and 365.  All dose cohorts were followed for a year from 
the time of the first dose of study drug administration.  
 Between March of 2007 and October of 2008, twelve  (12) subject s participated in 
the study (median age, 72 years, 53% male and 75% were a current or former smoker).  No deaths occurred during the [ADDRESS_645410]  
underwent a major amputation.  Median ABI and TBI significantly increased from 
0.35 to 0.52 ( P=0.005) and 0.15 to 0.24 ( P=0.01) at 12 months follow -up.  TCPO

showed a n improvement  trend  (increase) .  A significant reduction in pain was 
reported by [CONTACT_501135] s, with median VAS decreasing from 58 to 16 
(P=0.03) at 6 months follow -up. VAS score reduction tracked well with the 
hemodynamic data.

  Page 23 of 103 In general, there was more improvement over baseline in Cohort II (4 mg VM202) 
than in any other cohort.  Cohort I (2 mg of VM202) also experienced a significant 
reduction in pain and modest improvement in hemodynamic measurement.  Interestingly, [ADDRESS_645411] on the therapeutic activity of VM202.   
 
VM202 appears to be well tolerated at doses as high as 16 mg.  There were no 
unexpected adverse events in the study.  None of the  serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
were directly attributable to VM202 (eight SAEs in five subjects, 5/12, 41. 7%).

 1.6.2.  P
HASE II STUDY IN CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA  
VM202 is being eva luated for treatment of CLI in a prospective,  double- blind, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter Phase II study.  Eligible subjects are randomized to a 
low dose of VM202 (8mg, n=20), high dose of VM202 (16mg, n=20) or placebo (n=10) .  Subject s are receiving a final dose of 8 mg  VM202, 16 mg VM202 or 
placebo by [CONTACT_501137], unilateral calf on Days 0, 14, 28, and 42.  
As of July 29, 2011, 33 thirty-three (33) subjects  have been enrolled into the study.  
All [ADDRESS_645412] one round of injections; [ADDRESS_645413] completed all four 
rounds of inje ctions.  Twenty -four (24) completed the 90 day follow -up evaluation; 
14 completed the six months follow -up; [ADDRESS_645414] been discontinued or withdrawn early from the 
study.  One patient withdrew after completing all rounds of injections but prior to the 
90-day follow - prior to clinical hold.   
 As of July 29, 2011, fourteen (14) subjects experienced 20 serious adverse events , 
none of which were considered related to the study medication .  Ten (10) patients 
experienced one SAE to date, three (3) patients have experienced 2 SAEs, and one 
(1) patient has experienced 4 SAEs.  There were eleven (11) incidents of ‘worsening 
of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)’, which included increased pain, acute- on-
chronic critical limb ischemia, increased ulceration requiring skin grafting, or the development of gangrene/infection requiring amputation.  There were two (2) 
incident s of femo ral artery thrombosis , two (2) gastrointestinal bleeds, and one each  
of arr hythmia resulting in pacemaker implantation, acute renal failure, chest pain, , 
worsening of COPD, and pancreatitis.   
  1.6.3.  P
HASE I/II STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH PAINFUL DPN  
VM202 was evaluated for treatment of DPN in an ongoing  prospective, dose-
escalation Phase I study.  The study consist ed of three  (3) cohorts of four (4) 
subject s.  Subject s received 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg VM202 unilaterally in a calf .  For 
each dose cohort, VM202 was admi nistered as local intramuscular injections  with 
half of the dose administered at Day 0 of the study and the second half administered

throughout the study.  All [ADDRESS_645415] dose of study drug administration.  Between June 2010 and March 2011, 
twelve (12) subjects were enrolled in the study, and enr ollment  and follow -up are  
complete.   
 
Ten out of 12 subjects (10/12, 83%) experienced a reduction in pain at their 6 month 
visit.  One patient each in Cohort I and Cohort II did not experience a reduction in 
pain.  At 6 month, mean change in VAS was -8.2 in Cohort I, -31.6 in Cohort II and 
-25 in Cohort III.   
 
At 12 month, 9  out of 12 subjects ( 9/12, 75%) experienced a reduction in pain.  The 
same 2 patients, one each in Cohort I and Cohort II did not experience a reduction in 
pain, and one patient in Cohort III returned to baseline levels at 12 month .  At 12 
month, mean change in VAS was -12.0 in Cohort I, -32.8 in Cohort II and -18.5 in 
Cohort III.  VAS scores also tracked well with other quality of life measures (BPI -
DPN).   
Intramuscular injections of VM202 appear to be well tolerated at doses as high as 16 
mg in patients with DPN.  There were no incidents of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).  
There have been no serious or unexpected adverse events in the study.   The level of 
VM202 DNA was below the LLOQ in all [ADDRESS_645416] s with CLI and DPN is warranted.    
 
 
1.7. STUDY AND DOSE RATIONALE  
DPN,  by [CONTACT_108], is a bilateral neuropathy.  Treating only one leg may confound 
patient -reported pain levels and quality of life measures.  Based on the excellent 
safety profile  of VM202 seen thus far in the phase I CLI study, the ongoing phase II 
CLI study  and the safety and preliminary efficacy data from the phase I/II study of 
VM202 injections in patients with DPN, we propose bilateral treatment in this phase 
II study.   
 Two doses of VM202 will be tested against placebo (normal saline).  The dose of 
VM20 2 per leg will remain within the dosing scheme of the phase I/II study (8 mg / 
leg and 16 mg /leg), and the same dosing schedule used in the DPN phase I study 
will be followed in this study (namely, intramuscular injections in the calf will be

  Page 25 of 103 given on Day  0, and Day 14 ).  As in all three prior studies, VM202 will be delivered 
in a solution of 0.5 mg VM202 / mL.  Subject s will be treated with an overall  final 
dose of 16 mg VM202, 32 mg VM202 or placebo , dosages well within those 
supported by [CONTACT_501138]202.  
Safety studies in rabbit, rat and mouse models demonstrate that doses approximately 
2½ (80mg/70kg) to 30 (960mg/70kg)  times  the maximum clinical dose (3 2 mg) 
proposed in this study  are safe and  resulted in  no tox icities .

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 
3.1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety of IM administration o f 
VM202 in subject s with painful DPN in lower extremities .  In addition, the potential 
bioactivity of IM administration of VM202 in subjects with painful DPN, when compared with placebo, on pain will be assessed .

This is a phase II, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, [ADDRESS_645418] s with painful DPN will be screened for study eligibility after 
giving informed consent.   
 
Initial Screening  Activities . Prior to full screening, subjects will give informed 
consent and then be initially screened using the VAS , the S ymptoms portion of the 
BPNS and the MNSI.   Only s ubjects with a VAS score of ≥ 40 mm , a ≤ 5 point 
difference in symptom of BPNS between legs and MNSI score of ≥ [ADDRESS_645419] will be washed out of prohibited me dications.   During medication wash -out,

childbearing potential only) . 
 
If applicable, the subject will be washed out of prohibited medications [ADDRESS_645421] injections . 
Subjects  will be asked to rate their 24-hour average daily pain intensity score using 
an 11 point numerical scale with 0 = no pa in – 10 = worst pain possible , and to 
evaluate how much the ir pain interferes with sleep (also an 11 point numerical rating 
scale from 0 (did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interfered  with sleep ; 
patient was not able to sleep due to pain).   The subject must record at least five 
assessments of the [ADDRESS_645422] be ≥ [ADDRESS_645423] deviation ≤ 2 in order to be eligible for study 
participation.    
 Data from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference D iary at screening and BPI-DPN on 
Day 0 will represent the baseline reference values.   
 
All screening  assessments should occur within the 60 days prior to Day 0 (day of 
first injection s). 
 
Randomization.   Subject s who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned 
in a 2:2:1 fashion to one of the three treatment arms:  Low Dose (16 mg VM202 total 
dose, 8 mg / leg ), High Dose (32 mg VM202 total dose, 16 mg / leg), or placebo, 
respectively.  Assignment to a treatment arm will be centralized, using an  
independent predetermined randomization scheme in a double-blinded fashion .  
Blinding  will be achieved by [CONTACT_501139] y medication (test and control products)

Prior to recruitment of any subject s into the study, written approval of the protocol 
and informed consent must be obtained from the IRB  and IBC (if applicable) . 
 
3.4.1.  INFORMED CONSENT  
The investigator will explain the study purpose, procedures, and subject ’s 
responsibilities to the potential participant.  The subject 's willingness and abi lity to 
meet the follow -up requirements will be determined and written informed consent 
will be obtained ( Appendix 2 ).  The subject  will sign and date the informed consent 
form.  The investigator will also sign and  date the consent form.  The original 
informed consent form will be retained with the subject  records ; a copy  will be 
provided to the subject .   
 
Following is a detailed list of study visits from screening to final follow -up and the 
required procedures/tests.  Methodologies for specific tests/ procedures are described in Section 4. 
 
3.4.2.  S
UBJECT IDENTIFICATION  
To maintain confidentiality, the subject ’s name [CONTACT_501164] b e recorded on any study 
document other than the informed consent form.  All subject s that give informed 
consent (sign the informed consent form) will be assigned a unique identifier  in the 
following format: XX -YY-ZZZ.   XX is the [ADDRESS_645428] initials (initials of first 
name/middle name  (if applicable )/last name).  For example, the first subject named 
John Simon Doe at site 11 will be assigned 11 -01-JSD.    
   
3.4.3.  SCREENING  (DAY -60 TO DAY 0)

3.4.4.  PROHIBITED CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  MEDICATION THAT MAY I NTERFERE WITH VM202  BIOACTIVITY  
COX -1 and COX -2 inhibiting drugs will interfere with the bioactivity of VM202, 
and are therefore prohibited from use during the study.  Other than the maximal 81 
mg daily dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (acetylsalicylic acid), subjects  must  agree to not take any of 
these drugs until completion of the 9 month follow -up visit .  The patient needs to be  
advised that c ommon over the counter medications excluded include: Bayer (> 
81mg), Excedrin, Aleve, Advil (motrin, ibuprofen).   A full list of the excluded 
medications, including the washout period, can be found in Appendix 3 . 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  M
EDICATIONS THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH ASSES SMENT OF VM202  
EFFECT  ON PAIN  
Subjects may not take new drugs for DPN  symptoms  during the study and must be 
on the same medication for at least one month prior to screening .  However, subjects 
are all owed to stop the existing  medication during the study. 
 Subjects must discontinue use of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_501120] 9 month follow -up visit.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  S
CREEN FAILURES  
Subject s not meeting all study entry criteria will be designated as a screen failures.   
End of study procedures will not be performed for these subject s, but their reason for 
discontinuation will be recorded on  Screening Log.  Screen failures will be replaced.  
 
3.4.5.  TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION  
After providing written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo 
Screening assessments.  The site will complete a Treatment Authorization Form  
(TAF) for subject s determined to be eligible for study participation .  The TAF  
includes the subject  identification number, demographic information (gender, date of 
birth ) and indication  that the subject  meets all in clusion and exclusion criteria.   The 
completed TAF  and comp leted Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  will be 
faxed to the Sponsor or its designee.   The Sponsor  or its designee will confirm 
whether  the subject  can be treated , and return the TAF to the investigational site  and 
a copy to the drug depot .  Upon rec eipt, the Investigator  will schedule the subject  to 
undergo the study treatment.   Note: adherence to this process is mandatory  to track 
enrollment and to assure proper randomization . 
 
3.4.6.  RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
A randomization schedule with subjects allocated to high dose, low dose or control 
in a 2:2:[ADDRESS_645434] and treatment authorization is granted, the Sponsor  
or its designee  will notify the drug depot.  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 33 of 103 The drug depot will : 
 
1. Ship the next kit in sequence to the study pharmacist at the site, labeled with the 
subject identification  number.   
2. Record which kit was assigned to which site/subject and the date.  
3. Include in the kit, a sealed envelope that identifies the subject identification 
number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be opened by [CONTACT_501141] a medical emergency.  
4. Send another sealed envelope to the Sponsor with the subject identification 
number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be opened by [CONTACT_501142] a medical emergency.   
 Blinding will be achieved by [CONTACT_374577] (VM202) prepared by [CONTACT_438984].  Reconstituted VM202 is indistinguishable from saline solution . 
The site pharmacist prepares the vials according to the instructions in the kit (which 
vials to reconstitute with water for injection  [WFI].  The drug depot, site pharmacist 
and select individuals at  (but not including study monitors  and 
study manager ) will be unblinded to the treatment assignments.  The subject and 
study personnel, including core lab,  principal investigator , co-investigators and study 
coordinators, will remain blinded until all data has been entered into the database 
and the database is locked.  
 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY ONLY, i.e. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
AND ONLY WHEN THIS INFORMATION INFLUENCES THE  SUBJECT 'S 
MANAGEMENT, the Investigator may open the sealed envelope to unblind the study medication assignment . 
 For each opened envelope, the Investigator will provide the name [CONTACT_501165], reason, date, and signature [CONTACT_439017].  At the end of the 
study, all (opened and unopened) envelopes will be returned to the Sponsor.

4.2.7.  VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS ) SCORE  
Pain will be recorded during site visits  at Screening,  Day 0 before the treatment 
(injection), on Day 30, Day 60,  Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months using the visual 
analog scale (VAS) .  The VAS scoring instrument is a 10 0mm line, oriented 
horizontally , with the left  end indicating “no pain” and the right end  representing 

 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 43 of 103 “very severe pain ”.  The patient  is asked to mark a place on the line corresponding to 
the current pain intensity.  The distance along the scale is then converted into a 
numeric reading by [CONTACT_501147] (the 0 mark).  The VAS is i llustrated in Appendix 8 . 
 
4.2.8.  DAILY PAIN AND SLEEP INTERFERENCE DIARY  
Subjects will be asked to keep a Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  (see 
Appendix 9) .  Subjects will be asked to rate their 24 -hour average daily pain 
intensity score 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible 
pain) .  The effect of pain on the subject’s ability to sleep will be assessed using the 
sleep interference score.  Like the pain intensity score , the sleep interference score is 
an 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (pain did not interfere with sleep) to 10 
(pain completely interfered; patient was not able to sleep due to pain).   
 The diary will be completed  at Screen ing following washout of prohibited 
medications  and within [ADDRESS_645449]’s source 
documents.  Ten days prior to the scheduled visit, the  study coordinator at each site 
will call the subject s to remind them of their upcoming visit  at Day 90, [ADDRESS_645450] arrives at the clinic without the completed diary, the visit will be 
rescheduled as soon as possible.   
 Optionally at the Day 90, Month 6 and Months 9 visits only  (not at Screening): if the 
subject states  that the Diary was completed and it is a hardship for the subject to 
reschedule the visit (e.g., distance or transportation issues), the site may provide a 
completed FedEx shippi[INVESTIGATOR_501122] e using FedEx.   
 Upon completion of the Diary, the study coordinator will check the Dairy for 
completeness.  Any omissions or ambiguous answers will be clarified by [CONTACT_501148].

ATIENT ’S GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE  (PGIC ) 
The patient’s global impression of change  after treatment will be measured using the 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC ) questionnaire.54  This questionnaire 
takes measures a patients perception of how treatment has affected their level of 
activity, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life.  Each descriptor is ranked 
on an intensity scale of 1 = Very Much Improved ; 2 = Much Improved ; 3 = 
Minimally Improv ed; 4 = No Change ; 5 = Minimally Worse ; 6 = Much Worse  7 = 
Very Much Worse .  This test will be self-administered during study visits  on Day 30, 
Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months .

5. E
VALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. DEFINITIONS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or 
the deterioration of a pre- existing medical condition following or during expos ure to 
an investigational product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.   
 
An untoward medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 46 of 103 An adverse reaction  means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused  the event.  
 Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward  medical occurrence which:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a stay > 24 hours) or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240953];  
• Result s in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure; or  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240954].  Examples of such medical events include: allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4794].  Medical and s cientific judgment 
must be exercised when classifying events as serious.  
 
Life-threatening  means that the subject  is, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE which, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.   
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  means that the event resulted in 
permanent or significant and substantial disruption of the subject s’ ability to carry 
out normal life functions.   
 An unex pected AE  is an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information (e.g. , Investigator Brochure for an unapproved 
product).  Expected means that the event has been previously observed with the test 
article and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information.  It 
does not mean that the event is expected with the underlying disease(s) or concomitant medications.  It is expected that certain disease states will have 
reoccurring adverse events some of which may be considered expected over time.  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page [ADDRESS_645455] be 
recorded on the AE form provided w ith the CRF.  This will include the following 
information:  
 
• Description of the AE  
• Date of onset  
• Duration  
• Frequency 
• Severity  
• Seriousness (yes/no)  
• Treatment  
• Outcome  
• Relationship to study medication, injection procedure  and/or  underlying disease  
 
All AEs a nd SAEs must be followed until resolution, or the condition stabilizes .  The 
Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as possible the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  The Sponsor  or its designee may request that the Investigator perform 
or arrange for  the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  
 
5.2.1.  AE
 CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The study investigator will determine whether an AE is related or unrelated to study 
medication, the procedure (intramuscular injection) and / or the underlying disease 
using the following criteria:  
 Not related:  An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure.   
 
Possibly related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure. An alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant study 
product(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   
 
Probably related: An adverse event that might be due to the use o f the test article or 
administration procedure. The relationship in time is suggestive. An alternative 
explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
Definitely related : An AE that is due to the use of the test article or administration 
procedure. The event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867] – 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 48 of 103 5.2.2.  AE INTENSITY  
The intensity of the AE/SAE will be defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
 
Mild : The AE is noti ceable to the subject  but does not interfere with 
routine activity.  
Moderate : The AE is discomforting and interferes with routine activity.  
Severe: The AE significantly limits the subject ’s ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795].  
 
 
5.3. REPORTING /RECORDING OF AES 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by [CONTACT_241002].  The first concern will be the safety of the subject , and 
for providing appropriate medical intervention.  The p eriod of observation for 
collection of AEs starts during the first intramuscular injection procedure (Day 0) 
until the 9 month follow -up visit.  Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF page(s).  
 
 5.4. R
EPORTING / RECORDING OF SAE S 
 
5.4.1.  INVESTIGATOR ’S RESPO NSIBILITY  
SAE s will be recorded following the first study drug administration through the [ADDRESS_645456] be reported immediately (within 72 hours) to the Sponsor and  MedTech Consultants, Inc., the  
designated CRO.   
 
Each SAE must be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved or 
assessed as chronic or stable regardless of whether or not, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_192285], the event is thought to be related to the study medication.   
 The Investigator will be required to provide complete information concerning each 
SAE to the CRO and Sponsor within [ADDRESS_645457] ’s medical record and then transcribed onto the SAE 
Form.  The completed SAE Form (including the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_374536]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_4797]/reports, 
consultant report(s), and other relevant information will be faxed and mailed to the 
CRO.  
 In the event of an SAE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], every effort will be made by [CONTACT_4870], including a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4798].  In the event of a fatal A E, documentation of any available postmortem 
findings, including autopsy, will be provided to the Sponsor  or their designee.  In 
any event, the Investigator will provide a narrative summary of circumstances, 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page [ADDRESS_645458] (IRB), and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)  if applicable .  
Upon receipt from the Sponsor of an initial or follow -up IND Safety Report or other 
safety information, the Investigator must promptly notify his or her IRB, and IBC (if 
applicable) . 
 
5.4.2.  SPONSOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported on an annual basis to FDA in accordance with 
the IND regulation (21 CFR Part 312).  Per the 2010 FDA Guidance Document for Industry and Investigators “Safety Reporting Requirements for IN Ds and BA/BE 
Studies,” events categorized as ‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related will be treated as 
‘suspected adverse reactions.’  Events categorized as ‘definitely’ related will be 
treated as an ‘adverse reaction.’  
 All serious, unexpected adverse reactions  and suspected adverse reactions will be 
reported to FDA and to all participating investigators as an IND Safety Report within 15 calendar days of the event  after the sponsor determines that the suspected 
adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR §3 12.32).  Any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening AEs will be reported to the Agency within 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
 
The Sponsor  will notify all participating investigators of any new safety information 
that alters the current risk -benefit assessment of the study medication or that would 
be sufficient to consider changes in VM202 administration or in the overall conduct of the trial.  
 
 
 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate th e safety of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with painful DPN in lower extremities ; and, to evaluate the potential 
bioactivity of IM administration of VM202 in subjects with painful DPN, when compared 
to placebo, on rest pain (as assessed by [CONTACT_249615] y of pain, pain medication use history, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_379352], and intensity of pain) and sensory perception . 
 
6.1. GENERAL METHODS  
Means, standard deviations (SD), medians and minimum and maximums will be 
presented for continuous variables, the number and percentag e of patients in each

6.3.3.  SAFETY  
Any patient who receives injections ( study drug or placebo) will be included in the 
safety analysis population.  Adverse events (including serious adverse events, and 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation) throughout the 9 month follow -
up will be described according to severity and to their relationship with the study drug and injection procedure.  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD, 
minimum and maximum values, where applicable) will be used to characterize safety parameters.  
 
6.3.4.  PHARMACODYNAMICS  
HGF serum levels will be determined  immediately pre -treatment on Day 0, 
immediately pre -treatment on Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_501112]202 in whole blood will be determined at Day 0 (pre -injection and [ADDRESS_645461] 
injecti on), at Day 14 (pre-injection and [ADDRESS_645462] injection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 
60 and Day 90.  
 
6.3.5.  DATA SAFETY MONITORING AND INTERIM ANALYSES  
For ethical reasons, and to ensure study integrity, an interim examination of key 
safety data will be performed when approximately 50% of the patients (n= 50) have 
Day [ADDRESS_645463] 
(DSMB) will perform the review.   
 
The DSMB Chair will review a limited set of unblinded tables and listings, including all reported AEs and SAEs, every three months through to the full DSMB interim 
analysis and  continue the revi ew every six months thereafter.  The DSMB chair may 
request additional data for review and/or additional meetings of the committee as he

medical condition.   
 
Why is this study being done?  
You are being considered to participate in this research study because you have type I or II  
diabetes with current treatment control and, you are experiencing painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy (DPN) in both lower extremities.   
 
The specific events that result in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy are not well understood, 
but high blood sugar, reduced blood flow in the limbs, and changes in the blood vessels are 
thought to result in damage to the nerves in the affected areas.  Stimulating the growth of new blood vessels may stimulate growth or regeneration of nerves and may reduce pain. R esearchers 
have discovered that a protein called hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF)  that your body naturally 
produces in small amounts can cause the growth of new blood vessels  and protect nerves.  
Unfortunately, your body only makes a small amount of this protein and not always in the areas where you need it.  Researchers have found a way to increase the amount of HGF in your legs.  
They have isolated the genes responsible for directing the production of HGF, and have designed 
a product that can be injected in to your leg.  
 In the research study the HGF gene will be injected into your calf muscle cells to evaluate if it 
changes your pain related to diabetic neuropathy.  The product being used in this study is called 
VM202.  VM202 is an experimental drug that is not yet approved by [CONTACT_12721] (the 
US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  VM202 is a plasmid (a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4808]), which 
includes the HGF gene s.  VM202 has been used in a small feasibility study in the [LOCATION_002] 
in subject s with painful diabetic neuropathy; in a study in Korea in subject s with coronary artery 
disease and in another study in the [LOCATION_002] in subject s with critical limb ischemia 
(decreased blood flow to the legs).  VM202 has also been tested in people undergoing coron ary 
by[CONTACT_4897].  It is hoped that VM202 injected into your calf muscle will reduce pain related to 
diabetic neuropathy.  This study is intended to help determine:  
 
• The safety and efficacy of a low and high dose of VM202.  
• If there are any effects of VM2 02 on your symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy.  
 
VM202 will be injected into both your calf muscle s using a syringe with a fine needle.

How many people will take part in this research study? 
A total of 100 patients  will take part in this study at up t o 20 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374548] .   
 
 What happens if I agree to be in this research study? 
After you sign this consent form indicating you want to participate in this study, you will need to undergo some tests done to see if you qualify for t he study.  If you do not meet all of the study 
entry criteria, you will not be able to participate in the study and your doctor will discuss with you other options that you may have for treatment of your medical condition.  The study doctor 
will tell you w hether you are able to participate in this study after the initial test results are 
received and reviewed.   
 
This study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized clinical study.  If you agree and are 
eligible to participate you will be “ randomly ” assigned (like drawing numbers out of a hat or 
flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of three groups as listed below.  “ Double- blind ” means that you and your 
doctor will not know the treatment you are getting during the study.  However, your doctor can 
find out if neede d for safety reasons .  “Placebo controlled” means not all participants will be 
assigned to a treatment group that will receive the study drug.  Some participants may only 
receive saline injections.  What group you are assigned to is done by a computer and is not 
known by [CONTACT_501155].   
 You will be randomly assigned to one of three possible study groups.  In each study group, you 
will receive 32 injections in each calf at the Day 0  and Day 14 visits.  The contents of the 
injecti ons depend on your study group:  
  
• Low Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this group, you will receive 16 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the two injection visits ( 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 0 visit 
and 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 14 visit  in each leg ).  At each of these two injection visits, 
you will receive 16 injections of 0.5 mL of VM202 in each leg  and 16 injecti ons of 0.5 mL 
saline in each leg .  The total volume of all of the injections is about 3 teaspoon s of fluid .  
Approximately forty p ercent  of patients will be selected for this group.   
 
 
• High Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this group, you will receive 32 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the two injection visits ( 16mg of VM202 at the Day 0 visit  
and, 16mg of VM202 a t the Day14 visit) .  At both injection visits, you will receive [ADDRESS_645480] INFORMATION SHEET / INFORMED CONSENT FORM

You will only receive injections of saline.   At both injection visits, you will receive [ADDRESS_645481] treatment, you will be asked to fill out a daily questionnaire for a week (7 days).  
You will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 0 -10 (with 0 = no pain, and 10 = worst possible 
pain) every day.  You will also be asked to describe if your pain interfered with your sleep on a 
scale of 0 -10 (with 0 = pain did not interfere with sleep, and 10 = pain completely interfered; I 
was not able to sleep due to pain).  You will not be able to receive injections if you do not complete this diary.  A small skin sample will be taken from your left ankle, calf and left upper 
thigh, for a total of three samples.  .  These samples  will be very small (about the size of a half of 
a grain of rice) and will be taken using local anesthetic.  These samples will be taken again at the 
6 month visit and will used to track the progress of your neuropathy.  
 
What tests, procedures, and diagnos tic studies will be done during this study?

Visit # 1: Screening/Baseline Evaluations  
Screening is a process of evaluating your initial health status and assessing the status of your 
pain related to diabetic neuropathy.  Screening is usually completed within two month s before 
the first study injections if you qualify for this study.  If you agree to take part in this research study, you will first sign this consent form, and then undergo sc reening.  Screening will involve 
the following procedures:  medical history, physical exam, vital signs, medication review, 
completion of questionnaires , assessment of neuropathy, cancer screening, retinal fundoscopy; 
blood tests including a viral screen; urine test, urine pregnancy test (if you are a female of 
childbearing age), 12 lead E KG, and completion of a pain and sleep interference diary . 
 
Please note:   If any of your viral test results are positive you may need to have a second test done 
to make sure the results are the same.  The doctor or his/her nurse will tell you how to find medical help and counseling as needed, and you will not be able to take part in this study.  The 
study sponsor will not pay for the cost of the repeat tests, or any other f ollow -up medical care, or 
counseling for a positive or abnormal test result.   
 
It takes approximately one to two weeks to get all of the initial test results.  After your doctor has 
reviewed the results of these tests he/she will determine whether you are eligible for participation 
in the study.  If you are eligible for the study and you do wish to continue, you will be assigned 
by [CONTACT_3364] (randomly) to either one of the groups to receive VM202 (low or high dose) or the 
placebo control group.  You will then  be scheduled for the first set of injections  which will be 
done at your next visit (Visit #2).   Prior to  that time, you will be reminded to fill out the daily 
questionnaire for a week (7 days).

What about my rights to decline participation or withdraw from the study?  
You may choose not to be in the study, or, if you agree to be in the study, you may withdraw 
from the study at any time.  If you withdraw from the study, no new data about you will be collected for stu dy purposes unless the data pertain to a side effect related to the study.  If such 
an event occurs, we may need to review your entire medical record.   
 
Your decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study will not involve any penalty or 
loss of  benefits to which you are entitled, and will not affect your access to health care.  If you do 
decide to stop your participation in the study, you should talk to your doctor immediately so he/she can advise you of any additional tests that may be needed f or your safety.  Your doctor 
may decide to take you off this study if your condition gets worse, if you have serious side effects, or if he/she determines that it is no longer in your best interest to continue.  The Sponsor 
or regulatory agencies may stop this study at anytime without your consent.  If this occurs, you 
will be notified and your study doctor will discuss with you other options you may have.   
 What are the risks of this research study?  
There are known risks and discomforts involved in some of the tests and evaluations.  There are 
also unknown risks.  Below is a description of these risks.   Your doctor will discuss the risks 
and procedures with you before you start in the study.   
 
Risks from Injection Procedures  
VM202 will be injected into t he calf muscles using a fine needle.  There may be some pain at the 
injection site at the time of injection.   There may be swelling, bruising or inflammation near the 
injection site.   You may experience an increase in the level of pain in the treated leg.  There may 
be a risk of an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), fever or tissue damage from the injection 
(ulceration, necrosis).  Because HGF has the potential to create new blood vessels 
(angiogenesis), there may be risk of promoting tumor growth (cancer) or  of increasing the 
number of blood vessels in the back of your eye and damaging your retina (retinopathy).   
 Risks to women who can get pregnant or are breastfeeding 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risk s.  
Therefore, pregnant women cannot take part in this study.  If you are a woman who can get 
pregnant, a urine pregnancy test will be done and it must show that you are not pregnant before 
you can participate in this study.  You must also agree not to become pregnant during this study.  
You may not take part in this study if you are breastfeeding.  If sexually active and with 
childbearing potential , you must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control for the whole 
study.   
 The following birth cont rol measures are acceptable:

inform your study doctor immediately .  If this happens, the study doctor will discuss with you 
what you should do.  If you get pregnant, you will be asked to stop taking part in the study and you will be asked for information about the pregnancy and the baby.   
 
Risks from taking a blood sam ple 
You will have routine blood samples taken from a vein in your arm by a needle stick.  Risks 
associated with drawing blood from your arm include slight discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.  The number of 
times that you will have a blood sample drawn for this study totals about 1 0 times over 
approximately 1 1 months.  Each time your blood is drawn roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood 
will be taken.   
 
Risks from taking a skin biopsy  
A small skin sample will be taken from the back of each of your calves and from  each of  your 
upper thighs ( 3samples in total)  before the first injections and again at [ADDRESS_645495] 12 months 
(females only); PSA within past 3 months (males ≥ 50 years  only); for subject s ≥[ADDRESS_645496] 10 years; for subject s with family history of colon cancer in any first 
degree relative, colonoscopy within past 12 months; and X-ray or CT scan of chest.  Possible 
risks include a small amount of radiation exposure from  a chest X-ray (or chest CT scan, if you 
have a history of smoking) and mammogram (if you are female), discomfort associated with pap 
smear and mammography (if you are female), and risks associated with taking a blood sample 
(as described above).  Possible risks from colonoscopy may include:  bowel perforation (a hole 
or tear in the wall of the colon) requiring a repair operation (fewer than 1 out of 1,000 tests), heavy or persistent bleeding from biopsy or polyp- removal sites (1 out of 1,000 tests), advers e 
reaction to sedative medication causing breathing problems or low blood pressure (4 out of 10,000 tests), infection requiring antibiotic therapy (very rare), and nausea, vomiting, bloating, or 
rectal irritation caused by [CONTACT_501158].

  Page [ADDRESS_645497] itself involves no risk.  If dilating eye drops are used, they may produce a brief stinging 
sensation when put in the eyes and a medicinal taste in the mouth caused by [CONTACT_439011].  Dilating eye drops rarely produce nausea, vomiting, 
dryness of the mouth, flushing, dizziness, or an attack of narrow -angle glaucoma.  If glaucoma is 
suspected, drops generally are not used.  
 Risks from Fluorescein Angiography  (if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1964])   
Side effects associated with injection of fluorescein dye into a vein in the arm include nausea and/or vomiting (approximately 5% of subject s) hives and itching (approximately 0.5% of 
subject s) and rarely, a life threatening allergic reaction, consisting of possible seizures and 
difficulty in breathing (less than 0.01%).  There may be a local temporary discomfort at the si te 
of injection.  
 
Risks from E KG  
In rare circumstances, a rash or irritation at the location of the electrocardiogram electrode 
placement can occur due to the adhesive.  If this should occur it will be assessed and treated 
using clinical standards of care with appropriate medication(s) and/or compresses.  
 
Unknown risks  
In addition to the risks  already described, there may be other discomforts or risks from this study 
drug and/or procedures that we do not know about.  You will be watched for signs and symptoms of any side effects and you should tell your doctor if you do not feel well or experie nce any 
unusual symptoms.   
 Are there benefits to taking part in this research study?  
There may be no direct benefit to you by [CONTACT_4907].  However, it is possible that 
the pain related to your diabetic neuropathy will improve.    
 Knowle dge from this study may help us better understand how to treat people with painful 
diabetic neuropathy.     
 
What if new information becomes available? 
If additional data regarding potential safety risks become available during the study, your 
research doc tor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the 
study.  If you decide to withdraw from the study, your research doctor will make arrangements for your care to continue.  If you decide to continue in the study you may be asked to sign an 
updated consent form which will explain the new information clearly.   
 
Also, on receiving new information your research doctor might consider it to be in your best 
interests to withdraw you from the study.  He/she will explain the reasons  and arrange for your 
care to continue.

What alternatives are there to participation in this study?   
Currently, there are no approved drugs or treatment strategies known to stop or reverse the 
progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  Treatments goals are to reduce pain, improve 
physical function, reduce psychological distress, and improve quality of life.  Good glycemic 
control is the only factor shown to slow the progress of neuropathy symptoms.  Lowering your 
triglyceride level, l osing weight (if you are overweight), stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60115] (smokers only) and 
reducing blood pressure have also shown to reduce diabetic neuropathy symptoms.

obtain the total score.  Responses of “yes” to items 1 -3, 5-6, 8-9, 11- 12, 14- 15 are each counted 
as one point.  A “no” response on items 7 and 13 counts as 1 point.  Item #4 is a measure of 
impaired circulation and item #[ADDRESS_645504] version.    
 Physical Assessment.   For all ass essments, the foot should be warm (>30°C).   
 
Foot Inspection:   The feet are inspected for evidence of excessively dry skin, callous formation, 
fissures, frank ulceration or deformities.  Deformities include flat feet, hammer toes, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_149180], halux valgus, joint subluxation, prominent metatarsal heads, medial convexity (Charcot 
foot) and amputation.    
 
Vibration Sensation:   Vibration sensation should be performed with the great toe unsupported.  
Vibration sensation will be tested bilaterally using a [ADDRESS_645505]  can at the great toe (e.g. examiner’s 
DIP joint of the first finger versus subject ’s toe).  If the examiner feels vibration for [ADDRESS_645506]  is responding to vibration and 
not pressure or some other clue.  Vibration is scored as 1) present if the examiner senses the vibration on his or her finger for < 10 seconds, 2) reduced if sensed for ≥ 10 or 3) absent (no 
vibration detection.)   
 
Muscle Stretch Reflexes:  The ankle reflexes will be examined using an approp riate reflex 
hammer (e.g. Trommer or Queen square).  The ankle reflexes should be elicited in the sitting position with the foot dependent and the subject  relaxed.  For the reflex, the foot should be 
passively positioned and the foot dorsiflexed slightly t o obtain optimal stretch of the muscle.  
The Achilles tendon should be percussed directly.  If the reflex is obtained, it is graded as 
present.  If the reflex is absent, the subject  is asked to perform the Jendrassic maneuver (i.e., 
hooking the fingers together and pulling).  Reflexes elicited with the Jendrassic maneuver alone are designated “present with reinforcement.”  If there flex is absent, even in the face of the 
Jendrassic maneuver, the reflex is considered absent.  
 
Monofilament Testing:   For this examination, it is important that the subject ’s foot be supported 
(i.e., allow the sole of the foot to rest on a flat, warm surface).  The filament should initially be prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger).  The 
filament is then applied to the dorsum of the great toe midway between the nail fold and the DIP joint.  Do not hold the toe directly.  The filament is applied perpendicularly and briefly, (<1 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 90 of 103 second) with an even pressure.  When the filament bends, the force of [ADDRESS_645507] , whose eyes are closed, is asked to respond yes if he/she feels the filament.   
Eight correct responses out of 10 applications is considered normal: one to seven correct  
responses indicates reduced sensation and no correct answers translates into absent sensation.

(WFI) for a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be 
used for one subject.  For subjects randomized to the Low Dose or High Dose arms of the 
study, t he final doses of VM202 will be divided evenly between the Day 0 administration 
and the Day 14 administration.  Every i ndividual injection will be 0.5 mL.  All injections 
administered by [CONTACT_501160].  
 
Placebo  - Patients assigned to either the placebo arm or the Low Dose arm will receive 
normal saline injections.  The placebo group will receive only normal saline injections; the Low Dose arm will receive 16 injections of VM202 and 16 injections of normal saline in 
each leg at both injection visits.  Visually, normal saline is indistinguishable from 
reconstituted VM202.

Both calves will be treated with [ADDRESS_645511] the entire amount of the drug per each injection in about 3-5 seconds.  Immediately 
after completion of injection, lightly press the injection site with the finger head in order to prevent reflux.  Do not massage the injection site.  An indeli ble marker should be used to 
identify each injection site.  
 
4. Subsequent  administration s – Subsequent administrations should also be distributed evenly 
over the calf, and, as much as is possible, at different injection sites.  If marks made to 
identify previ ous injection sites are visible, every effort should be made to inject at alternate 
locations.

  Page [ADDRESS_645513] should be asked: “ How do you 
currently rate your pain  in your leg s (below the knee – this includes pain in your feet)?”   
 
The subject should be instructed to indicate his or her current level of pain in their legs by 
[CONTACT_1299] a single vertical line perpendicular to the horizontal line of the scale ensuring that the 
two lines intersect.  Additionally, the subject should b e instructed to not use a check mark, “x” or 
circle that would intersect the horizontal line of the scale multiple times.  Ensure the subject understands that the mark must be only one line that is perpendicular to and intersects the scale 
line.  The subje ct should complete the VAS with a fine or medium point pen; felt tip pens and 
pencils should not be used.   
 
 
The VAS should be checked for accuracy and completeness immediately after it is completed by 
[CONTACT_423].  If the subject’s mark does not intersect the line or intersects the line more than once, 
reinstruct the subject to modify his or her mark so it meets the appropriate criteria.  Any 
corrections should be accompanied by [CONTACT_423]’s initial and date.  For Day [ADDRESS_645514] be completed prior to injections; do NOT have the subject correct the scale after 
injections.  Instead, use the data collected prior to dosing.  
 The VAS score (0 to 100mm) will be calculated by [CONTACT_501161] (“No Pain”) along the scale to the mark made by [CONTACT_423].  If the mark made by [CONTACT_501162], measure 
to the middle point between the two marks.  If the mark made by [CONTACT_501163], project the location of the mark vertically to a point on the line of the scale for the measurement.

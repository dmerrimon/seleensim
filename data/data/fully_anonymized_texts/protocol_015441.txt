would benefit from continued treatment with tildrakizumab.  I n circumstances where the LTE study site activation 
has not occurred at the time the subject reaches the end of Part 2, they may enter from Part 3  if the required  
eligibility conditions are met.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_146275] -tumor -necrosis factor (TNF) use and Baseli ne body weight 
  Subjects with prior anti -TNF use will be  of the total number of 
subjects.  
Subjects who fail to show minimal response to treatment  
 may have their background medications adjusted according to the 
maximum permitted daily dose  and continue in the study.  Any subject requiring 
these adjustments will be counted as a non- responder for the primary analysis .  Criteria for other endpoints are 
included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
Subjects who show clinical  response to treatment  
 
  Subjects receiving tildrakizumab  
during Part  1 who fail to show clinical  response to treatment at  will be 
discontinued from the study drug and will enter Part  3 to receive treatment according to the Investigators ’ discretion .  
Subjects receiving  who fail to show clinical response to treatment at

Subjects discontinued from IMP at any time (a part from withdrawal of informed consent) will be required to 
complete the  assessment a  and e  
  Subjects who withdraw from the study during Part 3 will undergo the  
assessments . 
The primary endpoint is the ACR  response rate at   Secondary efficacy endpoints will include ACR , 
ACR  response rates, and the components of ACR response; propor tion of subjects who require adjustment of 
background therapy; proportion of subjects who achieve a DAS28- CRP  proportion of subjects who achieve 
MDA criteria; LDI and LEI change from Baseline; and HAQ -DI change from Baseline.  The PK and 
immunogenic ity of tildrakizumab will also be evaluated.  
All sites will have a n independent assessor to conduct the tender and swollen joint count, LDI, LEI and PASI 
assessments.  The independent assessor would not be involved in the care of subjects and would not dis cuss disease 
activity or the treatment with subjects or the Principal Investigator (PI)/designee responsible for performing other 
efficacy and safety evaluations. 
Following the last subject’s

 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background 
Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting approximately  of 
people worldwide.1  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has been defined as a unique inflammatory arthritis 
associated with PsO .  The precise prevalence is unknown, but estimates vary from 0.3% to 1% of 
the population; among patients with PsO  the observed prevalence of inflammatory arthritis varies 
from   The clini cal features typi[INVESTIGATOR_882639].  
However, with time PsA becomes polyarticular, and it is a severe disease in at least of 
patients.2  Symptoms include tenderness, pain and stiffness in and around the joints, dactylitis, 
spondylitis, pain and swelling in the heels, nail disfiguration (dis coloration, splitting , or pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940] ), 
and generaliz ed fatigue   Patients with PsA who present with polyarticular disease are at risk 
f
or disease progression.  In addition to progression of clinical and radiological damage, health 
related quality of life is reduced among pat ients with PsA  
P
sA is classified with the s pondyloarthropathies because of the presence of spondylitis in up to 
, the occurrence of extra- articular features common to the  spondyloarthropathies 
(mucous membrane lesions, iritis,  urethritis, diarrhea, aortic root dilatation), and association with 
human leucocyte antigen [ HLA ]-B27.  PsA may be distinguished from the other  
spondyloarthropathies by [CONTACT_882652], asymme trical distribution of  the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_786777] (both sacroiliac joints and syndesmophytes), lower level of pain, and 
limitation of movement.   Several clinical features help distinguish PsA from rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).  Although RA is more common in women, PsA occurs just as frequently in both sexes.  
The specific clinical features of PsA include the involve ment of distal joints.  Joint distribution  
tends to occur in a ray pattern so that all the joints of a single digit are more likely to get affected 
than the same joints on both sides (which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_882640]).  The deformities that result from PsA lead to shortening of digits because of sever e joint or bone lysis, with the most severe form being 
the telescopi[INVESTIGATOR_882641].
2 
Current treatment choices for PsA include non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs ), 
corticosteroids, topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]  (for skin), light therapy  (for skin), physiotherapy, and 
disease -modifying anti-rheumatic  drug (DMARDs ).3,5   
 
 
 
 ethotrexate (MTX) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. F ood 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the skin condition PsO , but it is frequently used off -label for 
PsA.  M ethotrexate has been reported as providing  symptomatic relief to some patients with 
multiple joint involvement and PsO  but there is little scientif ic evidence to support the use as a 
disease-modifying agent for PsA.5

on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling. 
Data from Phase 1 studies and the Phase 2b study in PsO patients were incorporated into a

first-order absorption and elimination.  Significant covariates were an effect of weight on 
clearance and volume of distribution and an age effect on clearance. Usi ng the individual 
Bayesian estimates, the simulated mean plasma concentrations of tildrakizumab at the proposed 
doses were determined.  From t hese simulated profiles, a dose -dependent relationship with 
tildrakizumab exposure is anticipated.  Therefore, the  separation between each of 
the doses is anticipated to result in appropriate separation of the observed exposures. 
A PK- PD model was subsequently developed, incorporating an indirect -effect maximum drug 
effect ( Emax) model.  Sequential PK -PD analysis of the clinical response data from  
 yielded estimates of the PD parameters including the effective concentration at

  The 
longitudinal model of PASI reduction utilized an exposure -related suppression of plaque 
formation in an indirect -effect model, together with a placebo -effect on plaque degradation that 
represented the healing process.   
  The simulations incorporated PK variability, within - and 
between -subject variability in PASI response, and model uncertainty.  Per ar m, the percentage of 
PASI75 responders was tabulated.

7.2.2 Rationale for Study 
The IL -23/IL- [ADDRESS_1234898] study conducted with tildrakizumab exclusively in subjects with PsA.  As 
tildrakizumab is in development (Phase 3 ongoing) for the related PsO indication, substantial PK 
and PD data exist that can inform dose selection in PsA, as described.  Under these 
circumstances, the next step for development is to confirm efficacy in the PsA population and 
understand the relationship between dose and clinical response.  Therefore, this Phase 2b study 
will .  The tildrakizumab arms and a placebo arm will be 
analyzed at  for the primary endpoint  (the proportion of subjects achieving a  
reduction from Baseline in American College of Rheumatology response criteria ).

9.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -dose, P hase 2b study  to 
evaluate the ef ficacy of 4 dose groups of tildrakizumab administered by [CONTACT_882655].  The study has been developed based on design features used in the  completed 
 as well as  
  The primary efficacy endpoint is based on the proportion of subjects achieving ACR  
response criteria at  which has been well established for the evaluation of clinical 
outcome.  Secondary efficacy endpoints are based on evaluation of other measures of ACR  
(ACR  and ACR ) , the proportion of subjects requiring adjustment of background 
medication, DAS28 -CRP, MDA , dactylitis and en thesitis, and HAQ -DI, which are all accepted 
measures for the evaluation of clinical outcome.  
The st udy has been designed with [ADDRESS_1234900] phases ( Screening, double -blind treatment period, 
double- blind follow -up, and a wash-out period).  This enables scientific evaluation of efficacy at 
 longer term evaluation of efficacy and safety through   and ensures subject 
safety  via a monitored wash-out period for subjects who do not enter the LTE study.  All safety 
measures are consistent with evaluations used in clinical studie s and previous studies with 
tildrakizumab.  
9.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Asses sment  
Given that efficacy benefits were reported for subjects with concurrent PsA in the completed 
Phase 2b study in  there is an expectation that subjects treated with 
tildrakizumab  will improve PsA disease activity  and measures of q uality of life (HAQ)  at 
  However, the study design allows early identification of subjects who have not 
received a minimum level of improvement at  to enable the Investigator to remove IMP 
and initiate other treatment at their discretion.  
The study has also been designed to minimize potential risks to subjects; all subjects will 
undergo S creening procedures aimed at reducing the likelihood and impact of any such risks.  In 
addition, regular safety monitoring during the treatment period for a ll subjects will ensure that 
any unanticipated effects of study participation are identified promptly and managed 
appropriately.  In view of the long half -life (T1/2) of tildrakizumab at doses previously studied, 
subjects who do not enter the LTE study wil l continue  to be monitored throughout a  
following the EoT visit, during which no active IMP will be administered.

 In addition, an independent DSMB  will review selected dat a across the study.  The DSMB in 
conjunction with the Sponsor is empowered to make recommendations regarding continuation, 
termination or modification of the stud y, as appropriate.  
Overall, based on data from non- clinical and clinical studies of tildrakizumab  to date and the risk 
minimiz ation strategies discussed ab ove, the risk:benefit profile of the current study is 
considered acceptable.

immediate unblinding via the I VRS  without the need for communicat ion with the Sponsor.  This 
can only occur in emerg ency situations (  
Blinding of study medication and dose regimens will be maintained by [CONTACT_2329] a double -dummy

 To ensure validity of assessments, the following assessments will be performed by a n 
independent assessor: 
• Joint count 
• PASI  
• LDI/LEI  
The PGA of disease activity will be assessed  by [CONTACT_1963]  (using the full 68/66

All other assessments will be administered  by [CONTACT_408591] -ordinator or  PI/desi gnee  
  For the DAS28- CRP score   the subset of 28 joints (from the full 
counts) will be transcribed to the appropriate page of the eCRF by [CONTACT_6624], and the score will be 
calculated during data reporting using the eCRF data and the central CRP laboratory result. 
At the time of the IA , a specified team of personnel will be unblinded to allow reporting of the 
primary objective at  
10.[ADDRESS_1234913] completion of the  visit (or earlier withdrawal from study 
treatment), an IA  using unblinded data  will be performed for the placebo -controlled double -blind 
treatment period  
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject safely and efficaciously.  Most often, IMP  discontinuation and knowledge of the possi ble 
treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency 
condition.  Emergency code breaks are performed using the  IVRS .  When the Investigator  
contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must  provide the requested 
subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the subject.  The Investigator  will then receive details of the IMP for the specified subject and a fax 
or email confirming this information.  The system will automatically inform the  
the medical monitor, and the r that the code has been broken, but 
no treatment assignment will be communicated.  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that there is a  procedure in place to allow access to 
the IVRS  in case of emergency.  The Investigator  will inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event/Reaction  
An AE is defined as “any untowa rd medical occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigation) product, 
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product”. 
Any relevant observations made at the Screening and Baseline visit (including Screening 
laboratory test results , and until the first dose of IMP ) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF , but 
will not be considered treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) and will be reported separately from 
TEAEs .  Any relevant observations following the first dose of IMP  will be recorded as an AE in 
the subject’s AE eCRF ; this includes physical examination findings, clinically relevant abnormal 
vital signs, clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, and clinically relevant ECG findings .  An 
AE relating to a pre ‑existing condition will only be recorded if there is a worsening of the 
pre-existing condition during study conduct with regard to nature, severity or frequency. 
An adverse drug reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose 
administered”.  
All AEs  judged by [CONTACT_882665] a reasonable causal 
relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions.  The expression of 
“reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are f acts or arguments 
which suggest a causal relationship. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, an event that: 
1. Results in death  
Death is not an AE in itself, but an outcome.  The cause of the death is the AE which resulted 
in deat h. 
2. Is life -threatening

[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose  
A drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine or an 
administration error in an amount that is higher than is normally used.  Every overdose must be reported to  within , 
irrespective of whether the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE.  
Overdose in this study is specifically defined as any dose greater than the intended protocol dose

[IP_ADDRESS] Product Quality Complaint  
A product quality complaint ( PQC ) is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, 
release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the product or delivery system.  In addition, it includes any reports in which a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_882649]/tampering exists.  It is important to note that not all PQCs involve a subject.  A PQC

A device- related incident is any product complaint that led to or might have led to death or 
serious deterioration of health/serious injury/serious illness for the user of the product or any 
other person. Note that "device" refers to the PFS  for this study.  The incident should be reported

12.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
Any relevant observations made before the end of the Screening and Baseline visit (prior to first 
dose of IMP) are to be recorded on the AE  eCRF , but will not be considered TEAEs and will be 
reported separately from TEAEs .  Any relevant observa tions made after the first dose of IMP  
will be recorded as an AE in the subject’s AE eCRF (  
In view of the l ong T

The following variables will be recorded for each AE: verbatim/AE description and date for AE 
start and stop, severity, seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the subject to discontinue, and the outcome.  A new AE must be recorded if the severity of the AE changes . 
All AEs/SAEs have to be repo rted to the Sponsor, whether or not considered causally related to 
the IMP or to the study procedure(s). 
All ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution or stabilization  or the last visit if

not become pregnant  during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of 
IRB/IECs or if  required by [CONTACT_427]. 
12.4 Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Subjects will be assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior at Screening using the Baseline 
(Lifetime) C -SSRS, and each subsequent visit using the C -SSRS Since Last Visit version.  There 
are 5 questions relating to levels of suicidal ideation which prompt questioning about suicidal 
behavior or intensity of ideation, depending on response.  Subjects acknowledging active 
thoughts of self -harm but lacking an articulated plan for doing so are classified at the 
intermediate risk level; those presenting  a defined self -harm plan or lacking needed impulse 
control are judged to be at the high risk level.  Subjects who have high risk of suicidality at the 
Screening assessment based on Investigator’s judgment or, if appropriate, as indicated by a 
response of  in the suicidal ideation section, or 
any positive response in the behavioral section of the C -SSRS, should not be enrolled in the 
study.  Those who develop suicidal ideation during the study rated as high risk according to the 
above classification  must be temporarily discontinued from receiving IMP and referred promptly 
for psychiatric evaluation.  Subjects rated as displaying the intermediate level of suicidal ideation should receive psychological support  and be assessed on an individual basis.  All individuals 
assessed as exhibiting suicidal behavior, except preparatory acts, must discontinue IMP  
permanently .  The presence of non- suicidal self -injurious behavior should be assessed on an 
individual basis.

size is based on an assumed active treatment effect in ACR  of up to  (ACR  response 
rate under placebo , and  in each of the remaining groups); 
a , and a  dropout rate.  Results are based on simulations 
incorporating the use of the Simes method for testing the composite hypothesis that the response rate for all active treatment groups is not significantly different from placebo versus the 
alternative hypothesis that at least one of the active treatment groups has a response rate 
significantly greater than that of placebo.  This is the primary hypothesis test for this study.  Note that  per group also yields  power for t esting that an individual treatment group 
response rate exceeds that of the placebo group assuming the true ACR  rate is  for the active group and  for placebo. 
13.2 Randomization 
A randomization schedule will be computer -generated before the start of th e study.  After all

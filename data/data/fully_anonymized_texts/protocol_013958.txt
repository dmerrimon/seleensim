 Protocol Summary  
Caregivers of children age < 6 years old who speak English or Spanish and are discharged home from the 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901987]. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901988] a new liquid 
medication will be potentially eligible for the study. Caregivers will be randomized at the time of enrollment to 
receive usual care for discharge medication teaching or receive enhanc ed discharge medication teaching 
which is a health literacy -informed communication intervention including a written medication sheet, teach-
back, provision of an oral dosing syringe and show- back of proper liquid medication administration. Caregivers 
will be enrolled in person prior to their child’s discharge home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A follow -up survey conducted 
via myCap  will be completed [ADDRESS_1265182] recruitment and enrollment  starting 
July 1, 2021.  
1.0 B ackground  
One out -of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901989] 8 minutes among children < 6 years of age.1 Medication 
errors are particularly common in infants and young children, likely due to the near universal use of liquid medications in this population. As compared to pi[INVESTIGATOR_901990], oral liquid medications present unique 
challenges (e.g., varying concentrations, dose measurement, and the frequent use of non- standardized dosing 
instruments) and account for the majority of pediatric dosing errors. Prior studies estimate that liquid 
medication dosing errors in children are very common with over 50% of caregivers measuring an incorrect 
dose or reporting giving a dose outside of the recommended range.2–6 Poor medication adherence (e.g. missed 
doses) further compounds the problem of medication errors in children with potential implications for treatment 
failure and, in the case of antibiotics, development of drug resistance.7,[ADDRESS_1265183] children receive multiple medications during 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].10 Many of these medicati ons are new and many are continued at home. This raises the risk for 
errors as the responsibility of medication administration shifts from trained health care providers to caregivers, many of whom experience increased stress and exhaustion during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901991] .   
Health literacy,  or the ability to understand health information to make appropriate health decisions, is a 
key driver of effective communication, especially when discussing medication administration.
11 Low health 
literacy is common, present in 29% of US parents, and  is associated with increased risk of medication errors.[ADDRESS_1265184] demonstrated the usefulness of health literacy -informed communication strategies (written instructions, 
teach- back, show -back) for reducing medication errors.
12–14 Evaluations of  health literacy -informed 
communication intervent ions calibrated to the unique complexities and needs of caregivers in the transition 
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104], however, are lacking.  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aim  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901992] c hildren, 
actual caregiver health literacy has been assessed in only 5 emergency department  studies and no inpatient 
studies which examined medication errors.13,15– 18 Addressing health literacy is integral to any proposed solution 
seeking to eliminate out -of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901993]. Given 
the exhaustion and stress of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], all caregivers are at risk to perform below their normal level of 
health literacy. Therefore, healthy literacy “universal precautions” should be followed by [CONTACT_902017].
[ADDRESS_1265185] identify and meet patient’s oral and written communication needs.
[ADDRESS_1265186] Revision: 4/21/[ADDRESS_1265187] -discharge care for children safer and more 
effective . Our objective is to 1) design and test the eff icacy of a health literacy -informed discharge medication 
counseling intervention in t he inpatient setting to reduce medication dosing errors by [CONTACT_902018] a liquid medication. The specific aim of this study is: 
 
Specific Aim  In a randomized controlled trial, we will test the  efficacy  of a health literacy- informed 
communication intervention on caregiver discharge medication dosing accuracy, adherence, and 
comprehension . We hypothesize that a useable, health literacy -informed medication counseling intervention 
will be e fficacious in reducing liquid medication dosing errors and improve adherence and medication 
comprehension among caregivers following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901994].   
The primary outcome is observed dosing accuracy assessed via pi[INVESTIGATOR_901995] 
a caregiver 48 -72 hours following discharge and compared to the prescribed dose in the chart. The primary 
outcome will be a continuous measure of percent difference of the caregiver s ubmitted photo compared to the 
prescribed dose (in mL). The primary measure will also be assessed as a dichotomous variable as +/ - 20% 
from the prescribed dose. Secondary outcomes include caregiver medication adherence and medication 
comprehension assessed via caregiver follow -up survey.  
3.[ADDRESS_1265188] a randomized controlled trial  
(RCT)  over a period of 12  months among English- 
and Spanish- speaking caregivers of children age 
birth to < [ADDRESS_1265189] already obtained their child’s medicine from the Vanderbilt Children’s Outpatient Pharmacy  and are 
willing to download and use an application on their phone called myCap to complete the follow -up survey . 
3.2 Screening and Enrollment  
Caregivers will be screened for eligibility Monday through Friday from 7 am to 6 pm. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_447892](s) will review currently admitted patients on the general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901996] . For patients nearing discharge, caregivers will be approached to discuss the study  and 
confirm eligibility  (see Interest in Participation Script) . An eligibility script will be used to standardize this 
process (see included document)  Patient -level r andomization will occur at the time of enrollment. Allocation to 
intervention or usual care will done by [CONTACT_902019] e 
determined to be eligible based on the eligibility script. Due to the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to blind study staff or caregivers to the assigned study arm (intervention or usual care) .  

Last Revision: 4/21/2022  
 At the time of enrollment (i.e., either  the day prior to  discharge , if possible , or the day of discharge ), 
caregivers in both groups will complete a demographics questionnaire via a secure web platform called 
REDCap  (Research Electronic Data Capture).26  Questions will include patient (child) age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
whether they were receiving any liquid medication prior to admission, number of previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 
number  of previous daily medications. Demographic questions about caregivers will include age, gender , 
race/ethnicity, education level, caregiver relationship to patient, marital status of caregiver, education level of 
caregiver,  employment status , difficulties 
paying bills (proxy for financial stress) , 
country of origin,  and preferred language. 
The following information will be extracted 
from the electronic health record: child 
discharge diagnosis, medication(s) name, 
number, frequency, dose and duration of 
discharge medication(s) , patient insurance 
status, and number of chronic conditions .[ADDRESS_1265190] Vital Sign ( see inclu ded 
document ).[ADDRESS_1265191] Vital Sign has 
been translated into Spanish by [CONTACT_902020].  See Figure 1 for study flow.  
3.3 Intervention  
Intervention:  The design of the medication instruction sheet 
was guided by [CONTACT_346171], our previous qualitative study (IRB#201452 ), and work by [CONTACT_902021] .
[ADDRESS_1265192] 
common medication side effects  (see example medication 
instruction sheet). The medication instruction sheets will be 
customized for each patient  based on the discharge 
medicine, printed and used to facilitate discharge medication 
counseling which will include demonstration of accurate dosing with a standardized instrument  (i.e., dosing syringe)  
by [CONTACT_902022] “show -back” of how 
they plan to administer the medication at home and “teach- back” regarding dosing amounts, times and end 
dates of medications  and common side effects . This will be standardized within an intervention script (see 
included document) and will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_901997] . A clear dosing syringe will be provided to the 
family prior to discharge. The syringe will be the smallest syringe that would allow administrati on of the 
appropriate dose. Caregivers will be given the instruction sheet  to use at home . If children receive more than 
one liquid discharge medication, the intervention will be completed for only one randomly selected medication. 
We anticipate the interv ention will take approximately 10 minutes . We anticipate that the eligibility screening, 
initial survey and intervention will take approximately 25 minutes to complete.   
Usual Care:  C
 aregivers in the usual care group will receive standard of care discharge communications per 
unit routine,  including counseling regar ding prescribed medications and post -discharge instructions, return 
precautions, and follow -up appointments by [CONTACT_902023] . At our institution, children discharged 
with a liquid medication from our outpatient pharmacy  are provided with a dosing syringe as part of routine 
care. All communications about discharge medication instructions  will be  at the discretion of the clinical team 
as part of routine care.  An additional dosing syringe will be supplied in a sealed envelope to be used at the 
discharge follow -up visit in order to standardize the assess ment of  the primary outcome of observed dosing 
accuracy.  
 

Last Revision: 4/21/2022  
 3.4 Assessment of Outcomes  
Follow -up Survey via myCap: The follow -up survey will be completed 48  to 72 hours following discharge to 
assess study outcomes.  This will be done via myCap. myCap is an application that research participants will 
be asked to download on their phones (application is free and available on i Phone and Android phones ). 
myCap leverages REDCap to capture participant/patient reported outcomes via mobile devices. myCap is 
HIPPA- compliant and secure. All data collected via myCap converts results into a format compatible with 
REDCap. The primary outcome of  dosing accuracy will be assessed along with secondary outcomes 
(medication adherence and medication comprehension) via surveys in myCap. Caregivers will also be asked 
who administered the medication, what kind of teaching they received in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901998] (i.e., 
did teach- back, show -back occur), whether any serious medication errors  occurred with the patient or other 
children in the home and/or if there were unplanned visits to a health care provider  (see included follow -up 
survey). Caregiv er self -efficacy for administering medicines to their children will be assessed using a 
standardized scale called the Medication Understanding and Use Self -Efficacy Scale (MUSE). See included 
document for RCT follow -up survey. We anticipate that the caregi ver follow- up survey  this will take <15 
minutes to complete.  
Primary Outcome :  Dosing accuracy will be the primary outcome  and will be assessed through self -report 
(reported dose) and through observation (observed dose) at follow -up. The primary outcome will be observed 
dosing accuracy . For observed dosing accuracy , caregivers will be asked to draw up a dose of their child’s 
medication using the provided oral dosing syringe and send a secure pi[INVESTIGATOR_901999]  (see Figure 2  as an example). The primary outcome will be 
assessed as a continuous percent difference from the prescribed dose  (in milliliters). 
For reported dose , caregivers will be asked to report the prescribed volume (in 
milliliters) of medication to be given with each dose during the follow- up myCap 
survey . This will be compared to the prescribed dose in the electronic medical 
record . For both measures, dosing accuracy will also be assessed as a dichotomous 
outcome and considered accurate if it is within 20% of the prescribed dose similar to 
prior studies.
5,15  
Safety Monitoring Plan:  I f any dosing errors are detected via the myCap pi[INVESTIGATOR_902000]/or myCap follow -up survey, the research team will provide additional education 
about proper medication dosing, refer caregivers to the prescribed dose on the medication bottle and refer the caregiver back to their child’s health care provider for 
further questions . 
Secondary Outcomes:  S
 econdary efficacy o utcomes will include discharge 
medication adherence and caregiver medication comprehension assessed during 
the myCap follow -up survey . Adherence  will be calculated based on caregiver report of first and last dose of 
medication (compared to documentation in electronic medical record)  and if there were any missed doses  or if 
the medication was never obtained from the pharmacy . Caregiver medication comprehension will be assessed 
using survey questions as was done in a previous  study.[ADDRESS_1265193] Revision: 4/21/2022  
  
3.5 Data Analysis and Sample Size  
Data analysis:  Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups will be compared using t  tests 
and χ2 tests or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used if the data does not 
appear to be normally distributed. These tests will be performed to also compare those who did and did not 
complete the follow -up assessment.  
Randomization will be done using block permutation at the time of enrollment. Study staff enrolling caregivers 
will not be blinded to group allocation. Caregivers will not 
explicitly be told what group they have been assigned. Study 
staff will be blinded to group allocation when assessing the dose in the syringe in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_902001] -up in order to 
determine the primary outcome of observed dosing accuracy. 
Two independent study staff will assess the pi[INVESTIGATOR_902002]. Any disagreement will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_9154].  
The primary outcome will be the percent difference in the 
observed dose measured as the difference in millimeters (mL) between the dose of medication in the caregiver submitted pi[INVESTIGATOR_902003]- up assessment compared to the prescribed 
dose in the electronic health record divided by [CONTACT_342581]. For example, if the observed dose in the caregiver submitted pi[INVESTIGATOR_902004] 4.[ADDRESS_1265194] was 3 mL then this would be a 50% 
overdosing error. The observed dosing percent difference will be compared between the intervention and control groups as medians with interquartile ranges. Table 3. Outcomes and measures obtained during  myCap follow -up survey

Review of EHR [ADDRESS_1265195] Revision: 4/21/[ADDRESS_1265196] an adjusted analysis. Proposed covariates to include in the model are: caregiver health literacy, caregiver age, caregiver gender, caregiver race/ethnicity, and caregiver primary 
language. These covariates are likely to have the biggest impact on the primary outcome. The other covariates 
includes caregiver country of origin, socioeconomic status (i.e., binary outcome of do you have difficulty paying bills), employment status, education status, and martial status. Patient level covariates include child age, gender race/ethnicity, medical complexity, number of previous medications and previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_902006].  
We will display our findings for the continuous outcome of observed  medication dosing error using either box 
plots or violin plots for the intervention and control groups.  
Given that prior literature in this area has examined medication dose error as a dichotomous variable using +/ - 
20% from the prescribed dose (this was  felt to be a clinically meaningful dosing error), we will also examine 
and display our primary outcome in this way to allow for comparison to other studies. We will report relative risk 
reduction, absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat along with 95% confidence intervals for the 
primary outcome of both observed dosing accuracy and reported dosing accuracy.  
 
Sample Size:  Sample size estimates are based on the outcome of medication dosing accuracy. Using a 
conservative dosing error prevalence of  30% in the control arm,2,4–6,15 and an expected dosing error prevalence 
of 10% in the intervention arm, we will need to enroll [ADDRESS_1265197] the null 
hypothesis that the dosing error prevalence in the control and intervention  arms are equal with 80% power (2 -
sided alpha of 0.05). Accounting for 25 -30% loss to follow -up, we plan to enroll a total of 200 subjects.  From 
July 2018- June 2019, the pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_902007] 1,742 children <[ADDRESS_1265198] 50% of whom were discharged home on 1 or more medications (approximately 75 children per 
month) , ensuring ample opportunities to achieve our required sample size  (see Table 4) . 
 
3.6 Potential Limitations and Alternative Approaches for Aim 1  
A potential challenge is slower than anticipated enrollment. If this occurs, we will extend our enrollment period 
and/or  consider expanding our enrollment catchment to  other clinical teams or older children (e.g. school age 
children) . Although our study is powered to detect differences similar to what has been observed in prior 
studies, these assumptions may be inaccurate. Nonetheless, the study would still be very useful in measuring 
potential effect size estimates for future study.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1265199] of care for discharge medication counseling. Study subjects in the 
intervention group will receive additional and enhanced discharge medication counseling. This poses no 
greater than minimal risk to study participants.  The potential benefit of this study would come be the 
development and implementation of more ef ficacious discharge medication counseling which will, hopefully, 
lead to a reduction in medication dosing errors and a decrease in patient harm.  
 
5.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
Privacy and confidentiality is of the highest priority, and all efforts will be made to keep personal information 
and research records private throughout these studies.  Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study will be kept in HIPPA -compliant, secure, password protected databases  (i.e., myCap and REDCap)  
or in locked files accessible only by a limited number of study personnel. All patient data will be coded using a unique study ID. No PHI will be shared outside of the key study personnel at each institution and no PHI will be shared between institutions.  The information from the research study may be published using aggregate 
results; however, no individual subject will be identified.

6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Participants  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_902008] (with PI [INVESTIGATOR_113863])  are responsible for ensuring protocol compliance, data 
integrity, and participant safety. This protocol presents minimal risks to participants and adverse events or 
other problems are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events  occur, unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others will be reported immediately to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_902009] 5 
days to the IRB and any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. Annual reports will be submitted to the 
responsible IRBs summarizing study progress, adverse events, complaints about the research or withdrawals, 
and any protocol violations.

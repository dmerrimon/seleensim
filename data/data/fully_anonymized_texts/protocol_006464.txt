Endpoints Primary  Endpoint: Plasma   AOC3 activity  relative to baseline in %, at 
[ADDRESS_754457] dose ,after 12 weeks of treatment
Secondary  endpoint s:
number (%) of subjects with adverse reactions
Relative ALT change from baseline after 12 weeks of 
treatment
Relative AST change from baseline after 12 weeks of 
treatment
Relative AP change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment
Relative -GTchange from baseline after 12 weeks of 
treatment
Relative caspase cleaved cy tokeratin 18 (M30) change from 
baseline after 12 weeks of treatment
Relative total cy tokeratin 18 (M65) change from baseline 
after 12 weeks of treatment
Safety criteria : Adverse event reporting, vital signs and standard laboratory tests
Statistical m ethods: For dose -response relationship analy sis a non-linear 3-parametric 
model is used to fit the primary  endpoint AOC3 activity  relative to
baseline , at [ADDRESS_754458] dose, after 12 weeks of treatment with either BI 
1467335 or placebo. The dose will be estimated where the fitted 
mean curve dropsbelow 10% .The secondary  biomarker endpoint s
including ALT, AST, AP ,-GT,caspase cleaved and total CK18 
are 
evaluated using a mixed effect model for repeated measurements 
(MMRM). The estimated dose effects at week [ADDRESS_754459] if there is a non -flat 
dose response relationship between the different doses of BI 1467335 
and placebo.

is performed to close out the patient (Termination of medication) .
 
 
 
 
or 
DNA banking ,blood sample swill be collected at visit 2and EOT/ED (for details please refer to section 5.5.4).
6Also to be completed for patients who are withdrawn or who have discontinued the trial early: in case of early termination ,
the EOT /EDVisit will be completed instead of the planned treatment period visit . This earl y discontinuation (ED)
visit will include the same procedures as the normal EOT visit except PK, PG and PD sampling. Visit FU should be 
performed 28days after the last study drug intake .
For patients who discontinue IMP but are willing to attend scheduled trial visits, only one PK sample and one PD 
blood sample for measurement of AOC3 activity should be taken and the actual time of the blood draw recorded. 
Please refer to section 6.2.2 .
8PD blood samples for measurement of AOC3 activity and concentration . Please see Flow Charts 2, 3,4and table 10.1 :1for 
timing .
For patients who discontinue IMP but are willing to attend scheduled trial visits, only one PD blood sample for 
measurement of AOC3 activity should be taken and the actual time of the blood draw recorded. Please refer to section 
6.2.2.
 
10Pregnancy Testing: Xs =serum testing; Xu= onsite urine testing; Serum pregnancy is done at screening and as a reflex 
when urine testing is positive.
11All patients will complete a study drug diary during the treatment phase to document drug intake and treatment 
compliance. The diary will be dispensed to the patients at Visit [ADDRESS_754462] 5 
minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. The ECG at the screening visit is regarded as baseline. Please refer to section 5.3.4
13Confirm eligibility from Screening visit.
14Only symptom -derived physical examination required .
15At dosing visits: The respective procedure is to be performed and completed prior to study drug administration.
 
 
17Waist and hip circumference only at screening and EOT/ED. For detailed instruction how to meas ure waist and hip
circumference see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
18For the timing of this blood sample please refer to table 10.1 :1.Not applicable in case of early discontinuation.
 
20If the historic ALT > 1.[ADDRESS_754463] value is older than 3 months prior to screening, the ALT > 1.5xULN  must be confirmed 
via two measurements at least 1 week apart within the screening period . Please refer to sections 3.3.2 and 6.2.1
21Clinical imaging (optional): only applicable for patients who don’t have the required clinical imaging results suggestive of 
NASH yet(no more than 3 years prior to screening ,according to Inclusion criterion #1 ). Not required if histological

MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_574850] 1467335 (formerl y Pharmaxis PXS -4728A), an 
oral, small -molecule inhibitor of semi -carbazide -sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) also known 
as vascular adhesion protein -1 (VAP -1) and amine oxidase copper -containing 3 (AOC3) for 
the indication non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH is characterized histologically  by a high level of steatosis, ballooning of hepatocy tes, 
and necroinflammation. AOC3 in l iver sinusoidal endothelial cells is responsible for the firm 
adhesion and transmigration of leukocy tes and for the propagation of the inflammatory  
environment in steatohepatitis. Fibrotic regions of NASH liver sections are strongl y positive 
for AOC3 immun e reactivity  [R15-5697]. The associated generation of peroxide during the 
course of amine oxidation is known to activate quiescent stellate cells supporting the 
differentiation into my ofibroblasts and fibrotic tissue generation. Recent findings with AOC3 
knockout mice or animals treated with anti -AOC3 antibody  display ed reduced hepatic 
inflammation and fibrosis development in several disease -related models of liver injury  [R15 
5365 ] and are supportive of this therapeutic concept. Therefore, targeting inhibiting AOC3 
enzy matic activity  might be beneficial for patients with steatohepatitis and fibrosis in order to 
reduce the recruitment of leukocy tes into the liver and reduce cy tokine and oxy gen stress 
dependent hepatocy te damage and activation of hepatic stellate cells.
With a prevalence of about 20–30% in the general population of Western countries, Non-
Alcoholic -
Fatty-Liver Disease (NAFLD) is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_574851] [ R15-5365]. While simple hepatic steatosis can have a benign non- progressive 
course, about 40% of patients with NASH progress [R16-5301]. As the disease progresses, 
significant fibrosis develops in 37 -41% of subjects within [ADDRESS_754478] common cause of liver cirrhosis [R15 -6070], which is 
estimated to be the 12th leading cause of death in the US, according to the National Institute 
of Health [ R15-6057]. Patients with NASH are also at increased risk of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), even in the absence of cirrhosis [ R15-5365]. By  2023, about [ADDRESS_754479] NASH with advanced stages (i.e. ≥ stage 3) of fibrosis (of 
those, 2.9 million in the US, 3.5 million in EU5, 5 million in China). The risk of liver -related 
death in Western patients with NASH ranges from 10% over 13.7 years to 18% over 18.5 
years [P13-[ZIP_CODE]].
To date, no approved therapy  for liver fibrosis or effective disease modify ing regimen for 
NASH is available . The current standard of care for NASH is weight loss through diet and 
exercise to improve insulin resistance and lower fat mass, which is a clinically  challen ging 
goal to achieve and therefore onl y affects a minor proportion of the patients [R15-6044].
Persistent inflammation in response to liver injury is the critical factor that drives progression 
to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [ R15-5365]. I nflammation at any  site, 
including the liver, is the result of an accumulation of leukocy tes organized into an 
inflammatory  infiltrate. For this to occur, leukocy tes must be recruited from the circulation 
by [CONTACT_574861] [ R15-6046]. A key  
protein in promoting the recruitment of leukocytes in liver tissue is AOC3, which is 
constitutively  expressed on human hepatic endothelium. BI 1467335 is an irreversible AOC3 
inhibitor with anti -inflammatory  and anti -oxidative stress activities that is currentl y under

ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
Increased plasma levels of ALT in NASH patients are a consequence of the lipotoxicity -
induced necroinflammation of the parench ymal liver tissue. Soluble plasma AOC3 (sAOC3) 
activity  is positively  correlated with a variet y of diseases including atherosclerosis, liver and 
kidney  fibrosis, and septic shock, thereby  [CONTACT_124439] a potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_574852] ( R15-5801, R15 -5774, R15 -5773, R15 -5766, R15 -5767, P15 -
[ZIP_CODE], R15 -
5771 , R15-5772, R15 -5802) . Inhibition of AOC3, therefore, has the potential to reduce 
oxidative stress and hepatic inflammation in steatohepatitis, and to improve fibrosis 
resolution in patients w ith NASH and ultimately  resulting in reduced liver cell damage, 
thereb y reducing elevated plasma ALT levels. This first study  in NASH patients is performed
to support the proof of mechanism and to allow further insights in tothe dose -response
relationship of BI 1467335.
TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2
The primary  objective of this study  is the proof of mechanism and support of dose finding, 
together with the safety  evaluation in patients with clinical evidence of NASH .
This proof ofmechanism study  will explore the inhibition of AOC3 activity  (% of baseline) 
after [ADDRESS_754485] of BI 1467335 on reductio n of secondary  biomarker endpoint s (AL T, AST, 
AP,  -GT and CK18 fragments) .
Safety  will be assessed throughout the stud y to provide key  information regarding the us e of
BI 1467335 in patients with NASH. 
The proof of clinical mechanism will be achieved through primary  endpoint comparison 
(inhibition of AOC3 activity  (% of baseline)) of the four BI 1467335 d oses (1mg QD, 3mg 
QD, 6mg QD, 10mg QD) and placebo. To this end, the dose -response relationship of the 
primary  endpoint will be anal ysed by [CONTACT_238713]- linear regression . 
For the secondary  endpoint sALT, AST,  -GT, AP , caspase cleaved cy tokeratin 18 and total 
cytokeratin 18 a non -flat dose response relationship between the BI doses and placebo will be 
tested using the multiple comparison procedures and modelling (MCPmod) approach [ R10-
1424 ].

OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
This is a 12- week, multi -centre, randomised, double blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
comparison in patients with NASH. I n total, 108patients who meet the entry  criteria are 
planned to be randomised in this trial. All eligible patients will be instructed at every visit 
(including screening) to adhere to their normal dietary  and exercise regimen from screening 
until safety  follow -up visit (see inclusion criterion #5for details) . Eligible patients will be 
randomised to the 12 week double-blind treatment period at Visit 2and will be assigned to 
one of the 5 treatment groups (placebo QD, BI 1467335 1 mg QD, BI 1467335 3 mg QD, BI 
1467335 6 mg QDor BI 1467335 10 mg QD; each patient will receive one active treatment 
and/orplacebos to match the alternative active treatment ). The randomised treatment will be 
double blind. After the end of the double -blind treatment period, patients will be followed up 
for additional 4 we eks without study  medication. Safet y will be evaluated at each visit until 
end of the observational period which is 28 day s after end of treatment or for an appropriatel y 
longer time in case of unresolved adverse events.

will be monitored closely until resolution or stabilization in the following 
cases:
AST is normal at baseline and:
If AST is 3x – 8 x UL NAND total bilirubin is> 2mg/dL
If AST is 3x –8x UL N OR total bilirubin is> 2mg/dL 
AND the patient is presenting clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  as e.g.

If a patient becomes pregnant during thetrial, the study  medication needs to be discontinued, 
and the patient will complete EOT -and Follow -up Visit procedures. The patient will be 
followed up until birth or otherwise termination of the pregnancy .
If a patient develops QTc > 500 ms during the trial, the study  medication needs to be 
discontinued, and the patient will complete EOT- and F ollow -up Visit procedures.
For all patients the reason for withdrawal (e.g. adverse events) must be recorded in the CRF . 
These data will be included in the trial database and reported.
Patients who discontinue the trial after receiving the first dose of study  medication at visit 2
will not be replaced.
Discontinuation of the trial by  [CONTACT_941] s ponsor [IP_ADDRESS]
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial 
site at any  time for the following reasons:
1.Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site
2.Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating the earlier positive benefit -
risk-assessment that could significantl y affect the continuation of the trial
3.Violation of GCP, the CTP, o r the contract disturbing the a ppropriate conduct of the trial
The Investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

Blinding [IP_ADDRESS]
Patients, investigators and every one involved in trial conduct or analy sis or with any  other 
interest in this double -blind ed trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomized 
treatment assignments until after database lock. Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for rules of 
breaking the code for patients in emergency  situations.
The randomization code will be kept secret by  [CONTACT_21637]. The 
randomization codes will be provided to bioanal ytics prior to last patient out to allow for the 
exclusion from the analyses of PK samples taken from placebo patients and to a member of 
the unblinded team in p reparation of a possible interim PK/PD analy sis
. Bioanal ytics will not 
disclose the randomization code or the results of their measurements until the trial is 
officiall y unblind ed.
A possible interim PK/PD anal ysis will be performed by  [CONTACT_574865] y. Results of the interim 
analysis will onl y be presented as aggregated data and not on subject level to maintain 
blinding. The logistical aspects of conducting the inte rim PK / PD analy sis, and the plan to 
access of interim results will be described in the Interim Analy sis Logistics Plan and Results 
Access Plan.
Unblinding and breaking the code [IP_ADDRESS]
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the Investigator / Pharmacist / in vestigational drug 
storage manager via IRT. It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of 
the trial drug must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial participants . The reason for unblinding must be 
documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page along with the date and 
the initials of the person who bro ke the code.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from Boehringer Ingelheim’ s
Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation  code for individual patients during 
trial conduct. The access to the code will only  be given to authorised P harmacovigilance 
representatives and not be shared further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling , and re -supply
The investigational products will be provided by  [CONTACT_23292] a designated CRO . They  will be
packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP). Re-supply  to thesites will be managed via an I RT s ystem, which will also monitor 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_88790] s.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.

5.3.1 Physical examination
A full phy sical examination will be performed at the visits indicated in the Flow Chart . This 
should be performed according to medical standards and usually  includes (but is not 
necessarily  limited to) a review of the following organ s ystems: General appearance 
(including Skin), Head -Eyes-Ears-Nose -Throat (HEENT), Chest (including Pulmonary  and 
Heart), Abdomen, Extremities, Urogenital  and neurological assessment (basic mental status, 
cranial nerves, motor s ystem, sensation, cerebellum/coordination). Clinically  relevant 
abnormal findings noticed after randomisation will be reported as (S)AEs. At all other visits 
according to the Flow Chart a symptom -derived phy sical examination should be performed.
This includes vital sign assessment as well as an evaluation of the organ s ystems associated 
with AE(s) s ymptoms or laboratory  abnormalities.
Clinically  significant abnormal findings will be reported as baseline conditions or AE’s.
Waist and hip circumference [IP_ADDRESS]
Waist and hip circumference will be measured at screening and EOT/ED visit. 
Waist circumference measurements should be made around a pa tient’s bare midriff, after the 
patient exhales while standing without shoes and with both feet touching and arms hanging 
freely. The measuring tape should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the bod y and 
horizontal to the floor and applied with suffici ent tension to conform to the measurement 
surface. Waist circumference should be determined by  [CONTACT_574866].
Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks.
Bodyweight [IP_ADDRESS]
The scale used to capture body  weight for each patient should remain consistent during the 
trial. I n order to get comparable body  weight values, it should be performed in the following 
way:
- Fasting (except for the screening visit);
-After the u rine sampling (bod y weight after bladder voiding);
-Shoes and coat/jackets should be taken off; and
-Pockets should be emptied of heavy objects (i.e. keys, coins etc.)
5.3.2 Vital Signs
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_574856]  (RF) and pulse rate (PR) 
will be measured after the patient has rested for at least 5 min in the sitting position.

5.3.5 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AEs [IP_ADDRESS]
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adve rse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might h ave 
caused death if more severe.
-requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23235] 
-prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15537],
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
or
-isto be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
theabove definitions.
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148829]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574858] 12Sep 2018
BI Trial No.: 1386-0004

an infectious agent is also conside red a serious adverse reaction.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbat ions of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontin uation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection” and AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines ”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the EDC sy stem . A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described 
above .
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compou nds in the same class. 
AESI  need to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, please see above .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_574867] b y the removal and sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_246456] [IP_ADDRESS].1 and section
10.3.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (e.g. encephalopathy , nausea, vomiting, 
pruritus, severe fatigue , icterus, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, 
the Investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary  in an 
unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the
procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .

-06 Trial Protocol Page 45of 101
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_754535]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015Intensity of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the (e)CRF 
according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 
dated 14 June 2010 [ R10-4848].
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event . An adverse 
reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all rele vant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibil ity of a causal relationship 
could be :
1.The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug 
2.The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
3. A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
4. Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
5.No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -existing
or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
6.The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
7.An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that ther e is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
1. No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
2.Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may  not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
3.
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
4.Disappearance of the event even though the study  drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

AE Collection
The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  [CONTACT_3786]:
From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect Period 
(REP), until individual patient’s end of trial:
oall AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
However, if an individual patient discontinues trial medication prematurel y but stay s 
in the trial (i.e. if further visits incl. telephone visits , or vital status assessments are 
planned) from then on and until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
Investigator must report related SAEs and related AESI s.
After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the Investigator does not need to activel y monitor the pat ient for AEs but should only  
report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the Investigator may become 
aware of.
As the REP is to be explored in this trial, it is considered as the entire FU period from last 
dose administration of trial medication until individual patient’s end of trial. 
All AEs which occurred through the treatment phase until entire Follow -up perio d will be 
considered as on treatment, please see section 7.3.[ADDRESS_754537] report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the B I SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) t o the 
sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up informa tion the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_754538]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
CRF pages and the BI SAE form. The Investigator should determine the causal r elationship 
to the trial medication .
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and SAE form (if applicable):
-Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
-Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  character ised, or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare case s pregnancy  mayoccur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into
this clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the Investigator must report immediately  
(within 24 hours) a potential drug exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) to the sponsor ’s 
unique entry point (country -specific contact [CONTACT_15626]). The 
Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the s ponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitori ng 
Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form 
is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE 
form must be completed in addition.

SAMPLE SIZE
STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
See Section 3.1for details on the design of the study .
See Section 2.2for details on the objective of the study .
Primary  endpoint is the plasma AOC3 activity relative to baseline in %, 24hours post dose,
after [ADDRESS_754563] dose where the mea n plasma AOC3 activity curve drops below 
10% (D10). This corresponds to:
D10 = min {  ∈ [0,10]|  (
 )  ≤10% }
where d is the dose and  () is the fitted dose -response curve described in Section 7.3.1.
The anal yses of the secondary  biomarker endpoint sALTAST, AP, -GT and CK18 
fragments will follow the MCPmod approach allowing for the simultaneous evaluation of 
different potential dose response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probability  of type I 
error (one -sided alpha of 0.05).
NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 7.[ADDRESS_754564], AP, -GT and CK18 
fragments contain h ypotheses testing. The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response 
pattern across placebo and any  dose of BI 1467335 within the tested dose range (0 -10mg).
The alternative hy pothesis is tha t there is a non -flat dose respon se pattern indicating a benefit 
of BI 1467335 compared to placebo .

The following patient analysis sets are defined for this trial:
Treated Set (TS): includes all patients who signed informed consent and were treated 
with at least one dose of the trial medication. Patients in TS are anal yzed under the 
actual trial medication received at randomisation . The TS is used for safet y anal yses
as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS): includes all patients in treated set who had non- missing 
baseline and at least one non-missing post-baseline and on- treatment measurement on 
any biomarker endpoint. Patients in FAS are anal yzed according to the intent -to-treat 
principle, i.e., patients in FAS are anal yzed under the randomized trial medication. 
Perprotocol set (PPS): includes all patients from the FAS without important protocol 
violations (I PV) leading to exclusion. This includes :

Note that the dose -response relationship is assumed to asy mptoticall y approach 0% at high

Asit is expected to see a higher variabilit y in AOC3 activity  measurements in placebo treated 
patients then in patients treated with BI 1467335 the model fit will use power of mean 
variance estimates (POM) to account for heterogeneity .
In case of the 24h value after drug administration at week 12 is missed, the - 0:30 values at 
week 12 can be used instead. In case of other missing AOC3 activity  values, except of 
missing baseline where no imputation is done , multiple imputation will be used. After 
exploring t he missing data mechanism and observed measurements on the blinded data the 
variable AOC3 activity  relative to baseline in % will be in cluded in the imputation model.
If the data is monotone missing, a regression model will be used for imputation including
baseline AOC3 activity , and AOC3 activity  relative to baseline measurements predose ( -
0:30h relative to drug administration) at Visit 4 and 6 and 24h relative to drug administration 
at visit 3,5 and EOT by [CONTACT_3148].
In the case of non- monotone missing, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) step will be 
used to create monotone missing data in multiple datasets. The regression method will then 
be used to complete the imputation in each dataset. For each imputed complete dataset, the 
decreasing 3- parameter curve model willbe used for the anal ysis. The results will be pooled 
following the standard multiple imputation procedure.
The dose where the model fit drops below 10% and the 95% confidence interval will be 
determined (D10) .The fitted curve will be graphically  display ed.

The number (% )subjects with adverse reactions will be evaluated descriptively on the TS . 
For more details see Section 7.3.4.
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  biomarker endpoint swill be first analy sed using a 
repeated measurement analy sis (MMRM) on the PPS . The relative ALT (AST, AP, -GT and 
CK18 fragments respectively ) changes from baseline at visit 3,4,5,6 and EOT will be 
evaluated on log scale using an MMRM 
accounting for the following sources of variation: 
‘baseline’, ‘visit’, ‘treatment’ ,‘visit*treatment’ and‘visit*baseline’ interaction as fixed effect 
as well as the random ‘subject’ effect. The unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within patient measurements. To estimate denominator degrees of freedom the 
Kenward -Roger approximation will be used .
The dose -response relationship of the week 12 estimates from MMRM will then be anal ysed 
using MCPMod. A set of plausible dose response patterns is considered with pre -specified 
parameters define:
The following model assumptions have been selected to cover a plausible and diverse range 
of dose response patterns when having matching Placebo and active BI 1467335 doses of 1 
mg, 3 mg, 6 mg and 10 mg:
Linear: no assumptions needed
Linear logistic no assumptions needed
Quadratic: 90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at 7 mg
Exponential: 90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at 7 mg
Emax: 90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at 7 mg
Sigmoidal Emax: 30 % of the maximum effect is achieved at 3 mg and 90 % of 
the maximum effect is achieved at 7 mg
Logistic: 30 % of the maximum effect is achieved at 3 mg and 90 % of the 
maximum effect is achieved at 7 mg
Betamod: 90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at [ADDRESS_754569] is 
achieved at 4 mg and maxi mal dose is 10 mg

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA ) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and individual patient’s end of trial
will be assigned to the treatment period for evaluation.
The anal ysis will be d
one by  ‘treatment at onset’.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis (anal ysis on TS). In general, safety  
analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hy pothesis 
testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and 
individual patient’s end of trial will be considered ‘treatment- emergent’. Adverse events that 
start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as 
‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA). Frequency  tables for all adverse 
events, protocol -specified AESI , serious adverse event (SAE), adverse event leading to death, 
adverse event le ading to discontinuation, investigator assessed drug- related adverse event and 
serious adverse event will be generated for treatment- emergent adverse events.
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
bedone via comparison of laboratory  data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distr ibution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the co urse of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

An interim PK/PD analysis may  be performed for model development purposes of the 
population PK and PK/PD anal ysis and to support dose decision for future trials. The interim 
analysis will focus on PK and AOC3 inhibition; other secondary  biomarker endpoints may  be 
evaluated in addition. The exact time point for data cut -off will be aligned with other studies 
investigating BI [ADDRESS_754574] planning. Details of this analy sis will be 
defined in the interim PK/PD analy sis plan.
The resul t of the interim anal ysis will not be used to make any  adaptions of the trial like 
sample size adjustments.

HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.[ADDRESS_754575] to safet y evaluations, it is not planned to impute missing values.
 
RANDOMISATION 7.6
Patients will be randomised in blocks to double -blind treatment in a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio (Placebo, 
1 mg, 3 mg, 6mg and 10 mg respectivel y).The randomisation of patients to the treatment 
groups will be performed via an interactive response technology  (IRT). 
BI will arrange for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The 
randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -
random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predicta ble. The block size will be documented in the CTR. Access to the codes will be 
controlled and documented.

Under the assumptions given in detail below, a sample size of 98 with an allocation ratio of 
2:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_754578] (Placebo) 
and highest (10 mg BI 1467335) dose groups will have the highest impact on the anal ysis. 
Due to the nature of the dose- response -relationship, the biggest difference is anticipated 
between Placebo and the 10 mg gro up. The power anal ysis and simulation via MCPMod 
supported the 2:1:1:1:2 allocation ratio instead of equal allocations (see also Table 7.7:1).
ALT
Sample size is based on four assumptions:
an assumed maximum effect size of BI 1467335 vs. placebo of 30% for relative 
change from baseline in AL T after 12 weeks of treatment
a target dose of 20% difference to placebo can be estimated
the target dose lies within the tested dose range
MCPMod shapes and guesstimates as described below
The defined response patterns and model assumptions from section 7.3.2 are used.
Further a ssumptions are a mean baseline ALT of 80 U/L , a placebo effect at week 12 of -10 
U/Land an effect of active treatment at week 12 of -34 U/L, i.e. the true difference between 
the relative change from baseline between placebo and active treatment at week 12 is 
assumed to be 30%. Further on, it is assumed to have a constant coefficient of v ariation over 
the whole ALT range of 40/80 = 0.5. This assumption is based on external data from 
CENTAUER, GOLDEN and ARAMCHOL (R16-5489; R18-2779; R18-2781; mean baseline 
ALT of 63 -78 and respective SD of 31-44) and on blinded estimated SD for baseline ALT 
from 61 patients from this study .
On log scale this corresponds to a change from baseline in the placebo group of - 0.14 and in 
the active treatment group of - 0.56, i.e. a difference of 0.42. 
An autoregressive correlation structure is assumed with constant variability of ALT on log 
scale regardless of visit and exponentially  declining correlation with distance. The correlation 
between measurements at visits four weeks a part are assumed to be 0.7. Consequently , 
correlation between baseline and week 12 is 0.34

investigated if (i) the MCPMod testing step rejects the null hy pothesis of no dose -response 
relationship at one -sided alpha = 0.05, and (ii) a target dose of 20% difference to placebo, 
corresponding to a Delta on log -scale of 0.26, can be estimated and lies within the tested dose 
range.
Simulations show that under the assumptions given above and assuming a true effect of 30%

Simulation shows that a 10% drop out rate does not decrease the precision of D10 estimation 
to an unacceptable degree.
The calculations have been performed using R version 3.3.2 as well as SAS Version 9.4. The 
R and SAS codes for the sample size calculations will be documented in a separate file and

PROTECTION, PUBLICATION POLICY
The trial will be carried out in complianc e with the protocol, the ethical principles laid down 
in the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the I CH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), relevant BI Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the EU 
regulation 536/[ADDRESS_754585] medical care (prophy lactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains in the 
responsibility  of the treating phy sician of the patient.
The Investigator will inform the sponsor immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures taken to 
protect the trialsubjects against any  immediate hazard, and also of an y serious breaches of 
the protocol or of ICH GCP*.
The Boehringer Ingelheim transparency  and publication policy  can be found on the following 
web page: trials.boehringer -ingelheim.com. The rights of the Investigator and of the sponsor
with regard to publication of the results of this trial are described in the Investigator contract. 
As a rule , no trial results should be published prior to finalization of the Clinical Trial Report.
TRIAL APPROVAL, PATIENT IN FORMATION, INFORMED 8.[ADDRESS_754586] (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and competent authority  (CA) according to national and international regulations. The 
same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by  [CONTACT_15635].
Prior to patient participation in the trial, written informed consent must be obtained from each 
patient (or the patient’s legally accepted representative) according to ICH / GCP and to the 
regulatory  and legal requirements of the participating country . Each signature [CONTACT_15649] y dated b y each signatory  and the informed consent and any  additional patient-
information form retained by  [CONTACT_21651]. A signed copy  of the 
informed consent and any  additional patient information must be gi ven to each patient or the 
patient’s legall y accepted representative.
The Investigator must give a full explanation to trial patients based on thepatient information 
form . A language understandable to the patient should be chosen, t echnical terms and 
expressions avoided, if possible . The patient must be given sufficient time to consider 
participation in the trial. The Investigator obtains written consent of the patient’s own free 
will with the informed consent form after confirming that the patient und erstands the contents. 
The Investigator must sign (or place a seal on) and date the informed consent form. If a trial 
collaborator has given a supplementary  explanation, the trial collaborator also signs (or 
places a seal on) and dates the informed consent.
Re-consenting may become necessary  when new relevant information becomes available and 
should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions.

DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 8.2
A quality  assurance audit/inspection of this trial may  be conducted by  [CONTACT_456] ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by [CONTACT_1744] /IECor by  [CONTACT_10200]. The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the Investigator ’s trial -related files and correspondence, 
and the informed consent docume ntation of this clinical trial.
RECORDS 8.3
Case Report Forms ( CRF )for individual patients will be provided by  [CONTACT_456] .See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for rules about emergency  code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to 
Section 4.1.8.
8.3.[ADDRESS_754588]. Source data as well as reported 
data should follow good documentation practices and be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, o riginal and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medical history  of the subject may  not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trial and the Investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case the Investigator must make three documented attempts to retrieve 
previous medical records. If this fails a ve rbal history  from the patient, documented in their 
medical records, would be acceptable.
Before providing an y copy  of patients’ source documents to the sponsor the investigator must 
ensure that all patient identifiers (e .g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social 
securit y number) have properly been removed or redacted to ensure patient confidentiality.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)
Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, da te 
patient was informed)
Dates of Patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
Medical history  (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if 
applicable)
Medication history

Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial 
participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any  exclusion criteria.
The absence of records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of 
the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support 
inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical 
trial.
8.3.[ADDRESS_754590] of the trial by [CONTACT_23348]- site monitoring visits and in-
house data qualit y review. The frequency  of on -site monitoring will be determined by  
[CONTACT_23349], including its nature, objective, methodology  and the 
degree of an y deviations of the intervention from normal clinical practice.
The Investigator /institution will allow on- site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source 
documents/data, including progress notes, copi[INVESTIGATOR_15587], which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor and regulatory  inspector

of the data will be verified by  [CONTACT_574871] 8.3.1. The sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and I CH GCP.
An adaptive approach to clinical trial monitoring will be utilised. The sponsor will perform a 
risk assessment of the trial to determine the extent and nature of monitoring required in order 
toensure the reliability  and robustness of the results. Regular review of risk reports will 
provide sponsor oversight during trial conduct and direct monitoring activities to the areas of 
greatest risk which have the most potential impact to subject safet y and data quality .
The Investigator /institution will allow on- site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review and regulatory  inspections. Direct access should be granted to all source documents 
(paper and e -records) including progress notes, copi[INVESTIGATOR_181955].

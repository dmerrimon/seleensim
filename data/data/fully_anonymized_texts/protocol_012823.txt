 2    INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
The vaccine targeting oncogenic strains of the huma n papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) can prevent commonly 
occurring cancers if given to girls and boys before sexual debut. Yet, in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.), more 
than 10 years after introduction of the vaccine, fewer than half of the target population are vaccinated,
1,2 a far cry from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% coverage.3 Even though vaccination 
coverage has been increasing among 13 -17 year old females, 40% report receiving the vaccine after 
sexual debut, when vaccination benefit is less certain.[ADDRESS_681179] a future cervical cancer.4 Innovative strategies are urgently 
needed to increase optimal use of this effective, safe vaccine.  
National recommendations from the Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention (CDC) are to complete 
the 2 -dose HPV vaccine series by [CONTACT_654] 13.5 Uptake of the tetanus -diphtheria -pertussis booster (Tdap) and 
the meningococcal vaccine (MCV), two other vaccines required by [CONTACT_654] 13 for school attendance, are 
over  80% across the country.2 Yet, vaccination of HPV vaccine remains low (~39% in 2017), with little 
year- to-year improvement in this age -group.1,[ADDRESS_681180], 
increased vaccine initiation by 10% with no impact on v accine completion by [CONTACT_654] 13 and no evidence of 
sustained benefit.  
Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a promising, innovative intervention to make significant 
improvements in optimal HPV vaccine use. The multi -component intervention is based on the 
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) theory of behavior- change and uses practice facilitation to 
support practice change. It includes strategies to increase provider communication skills and their belief in their capabilities to deliver HPV vaccine b y age [ADDRESS_681181] -intervention 
(62% to 81%), reaching the target for Healthy People 2020.
[ADDRESS_681182]. Louis metropolitan area , where only 40% of 13-  [ADDRESS_681183] common sexually transmitted virus in the U.S. with a prevalence of 33% among

 vaccine prior to sexual debut as recommended by [CONTACT_6750].1,6 Yet, uptake of this c ancer -preventing 
vaccine has been slow and in 2017, only 49% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 had completed the HPV 
vaccine series (53% of females, 44% of males) .2 Self-reported data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest t hat although vaccination has significantly increased in 
the past 10 years among females in this age - group, 40% will not get the full benefit of the vaccine as 
they received the vaccine after initiating sexual activity.1 Coverage by [CONTACT_654] 13 (i.e., before th eir 13th 
birthday), the age targeted by [CONTACT_524955] a HEDIS quality measure, is lower for both 
girls and boys, although data for this age -group are not routinely reported. In 2017, uptake of HPV 
vaccine in 13 -year- olds was 39% and previous studies have shown little year -to-year improvement in 11 -
12 year -olds.1,6 There is an obvious disparity in uptake when compared with Tdap (88%) and MCV4 
(82%), vaccines that are required by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_681185] of 
preventing and treating vaccine -preventable HPV -related disease is estimated to be $8.[ADDRESS_681186] had mixed results. Educational interventions 
targeting parent s’ belief that their child is not at risk for HPV infection have not been effective,[ADDRESS_681187] had inconsistent results for increasing HPV vaccination.12 -14 When used 
concurrently, HPV vaccination increased by 5 -10%,12,13,[ADDRESS_681188] tried to improve 
provider communication skills. One study compared presumptive announcements, in which providers assume parent readiness to vaccinate, with conversational, explanatory approaches, and found presumptive announcements were more effective.
15 A recent randomized trial by [CONTACT_524956] a l. 
showed that a 5 -component communication intervention to support a presumptive recommendation 
for HPV increased initiation for 11 -17 year -olds by 9%, with most improvement occurring at well -child 
visits.[ADDRESS_681189] of this intervention on vaccination rates was not assessed.  
  
Primary care providers face considerable barriers when trying to implement the CDC recommendations 
for HPV vaccine.22, 23  Over 60% of office -based primary care physicians, including pediatricians, work in 
practices with [ADDRESS_681190] themselves be sustained (~2years) and

tailored to the unique value s, structures and processes for each practice. 28 -32 External motivators for 
improvement can be important.28, 33, 34 Our formative work suggests two important external motivators 
that could encourage increased optimal use of the HPV vaccine: the requireme nt for active participation 
in an approved quality improvement (QI) activity for The American B oard of Pediatrics (ABP) 
maintenance of certification (MOC); and financial incentives for “meaningful use of data” for practices 
designated as a patient -centered  medical home. However, even those who are motivated to address 
this gap in care likely need help to change their clinical practice.  
  
Practice facilitators support change in primary care practices by [CONTACT_524957]. Using participatory methods, practice facilitators 
help demystify improvement methods and support data -driven decision -making, tailoring their 
approach to meet practice needs. External facilitation has been used successfull y in a wide range of 
primary care practice settings to increase preventive care for adults and children.29, 35- [ADDRESS_681191] 10%. 36-38, 40, [ADDRESS_681192] to improve diabetes care, annual influenza vaccine increased by 
15%.32  
 
There is a critical need for theory -based implementation interventions to improve the use of HPV 
vaccine and sustain benefit. Improving use of evidence -based practices requires behavior change, and in 
order to design effective interventions and allow purpo seful improvements when interventions fail, it is 
necessary to understand these behaviors in context. Models and theories of behavior and behavior 
change can be used to determine who and what needs to change and to identify behavior change 
strategies. To this end, Damschroder and colleagues developed the Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research (CFIR) to consolidate and unify key constructs from 19 published 
implementation theories.42  The  CFIR  identifies  five major  domains  that influence  successf ul 
implementation: characteristics  of the intervention, the inner  setting  (the context through  which  
implementation  will proceed), the outer setting  (the context in  which  the organization resides),  
implementer’s  characteristics,  and the processes  of implementation.42 Michie  and colleagues  
consolidated  33 theories  of behavior  and behavior  change  in order  to develop  a theoretical  framework  
for understanding  behavior  change  among  health  professionals.  43-45 Using  consensus  among  experts, 
they  identified  a framework  with  14 theoretical  domains  covering  the main  factors influencing  provider’s  
clinical behaviors  and behavior  change  (Theoretical  Domain Framework,  TDF).  43, 45,[ADDRESS_681193]  used  the 
CFIR  and TDF to inform development of  our intervention  as indicated  in Figure  1.

 Guided by [CONTACT_524958] ,42 we conducted semi -structured interviews with 16 providers from 10 practices to 
systematically identify barriers to HPV vaccination in pediatric practices 47 This in vestigation revealed 
that all providers were  aware of the CDC recommendations for HPV vaccination and universally assumed 
responsibility for vaccine delivery. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], for both girls and boys, providers recommended the HPV 
vaccine at the 11 -12-year- old c heck -up visit. All but one provider used an explanatory style for this 
discussion, and the strength of their recommendation varied. All reported that persuading hesitant 
parents to vaccinate was difficult and time consuming; some delayed these discussions until the child 
was older and the parents were more accepting. Teamwork to deliver the vaccine series was uncommon, and no providers were aware of their partners’ approach to HPV vaccination or monitored 
vaccine coverage.  
Using 2014 data, we found that vac cine initiation and completion by [CONTACT_654] 13 varied among providers 
from 2% to 26%, and 1% to 26%, respectively, and varied [ADDRESS_681194] 
distinguishing factors related to provider characteristics –  their lack of buy -in to vaccination by [CONTACT_654] 13, 
their lack of confidence to address parental hesitancy, and poor communication skills to promote timely HPV vaccine use. Coverage was higher in practices with coordination between the provider and staff to 
ensure opportunities for vaccination were not missed. As describ ed in our recent publication,
 47 we 
crafted an implementation strategy (the intervention) to address these factors, guided by [CONTACT_386895].43, [ADDRESS_681195],  described  below.  
  
For ~15- months, a practice facilitator has worked with 6 practices (20 providers) to implement the 
intervention, first targeting initiation of HPV vaccine by [CONTACT_654] 13. All practices were provided with their 
baseline data and received education about the potential bene fit for patients and the practice for 
following CDC recommendations, a communication strategy, and patient education materials. They 
identified a QI team and worked with the facilitator towards the practice’s goals for improvement. Each 
practice completed Plan -Do-Study -Act (PDSA) cycles, testing different strategies to improve care. PDSA 
cycles are small cycles of change that involve reviewing data to assess gaps in performance, identifying 
possible changes to improve care, selecting and testing an improvem ent strategy, and monitoring and 
adjusting new processes for care delivery. To date, the number of team meetings with the facilitator varied from 7 to 11, 10% were by [CONTACT_648], and each visit lasted < 1 hour.  
 
For each provider, HPV initiation was assessed on  a randomly selected sample of ~[ADDRESS_681196] one practice visit (well- child or acute care visit) between June 1st and 
September 30th in the measurement period. These included 2016, 2017, and 2018. Overall, there was a 
19-percentage point increase in HPV vaccine initiation in the [ADDRESS_681197] -intervention 
(62% to 81%), reaching the target for Healthy People 2020.[ADDRESS_681198] etion by [CONTACT_654] 13 were initiated in March 2018, and after only 7 months, 
we observed a 12% increase. The majority (>80%) of providers felt the following features of the 
intervention were very important in the change process: access to the practice facilitato r, the QI practice 
team, help with measurement and review of vaccination data, and the communication strategy, and all 
would strongly recommend the program to their colleagues  
  
These findings suggest that the proposed [ADDRESS_681199] 
and sustained benefits.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASS ESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIA L RISKS  
 
There are no  immediate or long term  physical or p sychological risks associated with study participation. 
There are no study products. The intervention promotes national recommendations for use of HPV vaccine, a safe, effective vaccine for cancer prevention.  
 
There is a possibility that during routine cha rt audits , confidentiality could be compromised.   
  
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIA L BENEFITS  
 A long -term benefit to s ociety could be  the identification of an effective intervention to increase optimal 
use of the canc er preventing HPV vaccine. Immediate and long -term benefits for p articipating practices 
and providers include develop ment of  effective and efficient vaccine delivery systems and increased  
capability to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine and address the con cerns of hesitant parents. Also, 
their experience in the change process may encourage them to identify and address other care gaps in 
HPV Vaccine Use in Primary Care                       Version 1.10

13 
 their practice. An immediate benefit for p reteens attending study practices could be receipt of HPV 
vaccine before sexual debut, allowing maximum benefit from this safe vaccine.    
2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
There are essentially no significant  immediate or long -term risks  in study participation. Th e potential 
benefits to society and children from an effective intervention to reduce HPV -related cancers far 
outweigh the potential risks .

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
 
We will complete a single site,  cluster -randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi -
component implementation strategy (the intervention) to increase use of the HPV vaccine according to 
CDC guidelines.  Randomization will occur after baseline assessment and the unit of rand omization is a 
community -based, primary care pediatric practice.  The randomization schema will be generated and 
implemented by [CONTACT_4305]. Twenty practices will be randomized into two groups, the 2 -year 
intervention group (n=10) or a wait -list control group (n=10).  The intervention includes: 1) an 
educational video to increase the provider’s knowledge about guideline recommendations and patient and practice benefits of vaccination by [CONTACT_654] 13; 2) audit and feedback of vaccine coverage to increas e 
motivation to engage in practice change; 3) a communication strategy to improve the provider’s 
communication skills and their self -efficacy to address parental hesitation; and 4) practice facilitation to 
support practice change to develop a sustainable H PV vaccine delivery system. The intervention will be 
delivered through a series of brief practice visits  with the facilitator that occur every 1 -4 weeks over 2 
years.  Vaccine use will be assessed at the practice  level using 12 -months of routinely collected  clinical 
data to allow for seasonal variation in care delivery patterns. Vaccine use will be assessed at baseline, at 
12 and 24 months to assess effectiveness, and at 36 months to assess if change is sustained.  Due to the 
2020 pandemic and overall concer ns for safety, we will use ZOOM video conferencing for research 
activities, including obtaining measures and implantation of the intervention  
 
The study hypotheses are : 1) The [ADDRESS_681201] 13 percentage points, and benefits will be 
sustained at 36 months. 2) The intervention will increase on -time HPV vaccination by [CONTACT_524960]’ capability (communication skills) and their motivation (confidence in their capabilities) to 
deliver  on-time HPV vaccination . 
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIO NALE FOR STUDY DESIG N 
 
A rigorous evaluation such as the prop osed cluster randomized controlled trial is needed to establish the 
effectiveness of the intervention in a generalizable sample prior to scaling for widespread use. 
Randomization will be at the level of the practice for two reasons: 1) the intervention is designed to 
change the system for adolescent vaccine delivery at the practice level, and 2) to prevent contamination 
of provider behavior within the same practice. The [ADDRESS_681202]. Louis metropolitan area and are 
representative  of independent practices where vaccination typi[INVESTIGATOR_14923]. Our sample size of 20 
practices (~80 providers) allows us to test the primary hypothesis and provide interpretable results.   All 
providers (intervention and control groups) will receive informat ion provided by [CONTACT_524961] “usual care.” These will include the current recommendations, background information and the CDC’s patient 
educational materials and web site.  The wait- list control group will be offered the intervention after the 
evaluative study is completed. Initiation of HPV vaccine by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_681203] difficult barrier to overcome to achieve op timal use of this effective 
vaccine. Vaccine outcomes will be assessed at the clinic level using 12 -months of routinely collected 
clinical data to allow for seasonal variation in care delivery patterns (the majority of check -up visits 
occur in the summer).  This measurement approach is characteristic of quality metrics and is needed to 
show change in vaccine coverage over time, as the guidelines are age- specific. The outcome assessor 
will be blinded to study group allocation to minimize measurement bias.

5.2 EXCLUSION CRITER IA 
 
Practices, providers and parent/caregivers may be excluded at the discretion of the PI .  Our plan is to 
exclude practices that are solo -practitioners and that have paper records. If we have difficulty recruiting, 
we may include these practices.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR R ECRUITMENT AND RETEN TION  
 
Practices : We will invite all potentially eligible practices that are affiliated with WU PAARC and 
Community Outpatient Practice Experience (COPE) to participate. The first 20 practices that agree to 
participate will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group using an allocation ratio 1:1.              
 
Practices may be contact[CONTACT_19904], f ax, letter, phone, or in -person to invite participation.  All 
providers in the practice will be invited to participate. [CONTACT_524980] and/ or a member of the study team 
will meet with those who are interested in learning more about the study to explain the d etails of study 
participation and answer any questions. These meetings will be held at the provider’s office. If we experience difficulty with recruitment, we may expand our criteria to include solo practitioners and 
practices who still maintain paper reco rds, as well as practices in the community that are not affiliated 
with WU PAARC or COPE.   
 We anticipate that we will recruit ~80 primary care pediatricians from the  20 participating practices. We 
estimate the racial/ethnic breakdown of participating physicians based on surveys completed by [CONTACT_524962], the available study population. We estimate that 27% of participating physicians 
will be male, ~84% will be Caucasian, 6% African American , 7% Asian. About 6% will be Hispanic.  
Due to the [ADDRESS_681205] information inaccessible, therefore the electronic paren t survey has 
been completely eliminated from the study.  The goal of this survey, to assess if parental satisfaction 
with HPV vaccine care differed between study groups, will be met by [CONTACT_524963]. Specifically, to assess provide r experiences with patient complaints and loss to the practice 
related to HPV vaccine delivery, repeating the measure from the baseline provider survey.  
 
 
Incentives:   We will provide financial compensation for time taken to participate in the study 
including  $500/year for the business entity of each participating practice for administrative expenses 
(obtaining the lists of eligible patients, allowing study team access to medical records, etc.). We will also 
provide $[ADDRESS_681206] of Pediatrics (ABP) Maintenance of Certification (MOC)  Part-[ADDRESS_681207] be up to date in four areas including professional standing (part 1), lifelong learning (part 2), cognitive expertise (part 3) and improving professional practice (pa rt 4). Every

practitioners and parents) to receive their advice about strategies to increase recruitment and retention 
of practices.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTI ON(S) OR EXPERIMENTA L MANIPULATION(S) AD MINISTRATION  
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVEN TION OR EXPERIMENTAL  MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION  
The intervention occurs at the level of the practice.  
 
All providers (intervention and control groups) will receive information provided by [CONTACT_3433] e CDC to assist 
providers to improve use of HPV vaccine  including  the current recommendations, background 
information about the vaccine, and  patient educational materials . The CDC  website will be distributed.  
Baseline HPV vaccination rates will also be giv en to all providers.  
 
The intervention:  
The theory -based, multicomponent intervention includes: 1) an educational video to increase the 
provider’s knowledge about guideline recommend ations and patient and practice benefits of 
vaccination by [CONTACT_654] 13; 2) audit and feedback of vaccine coverage to increase motivation to engage in 
practice change; 3) a communication strategy to improve the provider’s communication skills and their 
self-efficacy to address parental hesitation; and 4) practice facilitation to support practice change to 
develop a sustainable HPV vaccine delivery system. The intervention is based on CDC guidelines, 
addresses specific barriers to HPV vaccine use in primary care p ractices, and has multiple components. It 
is informed by [CONTACT_524965], a behavioral change theory specific for primary care providers, and has been refined by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_48124].  We anticipate that the intervention will increase on -
time HPV vaccination by [CONTACT_118130]’ capability (communication skills) and their motivation 
(confidence in their capabilities) to deliver  on-time HPV vaccination . 
 
The intervention  is designed for sustainability, using practice facilitation to support lasting practice 
change.  It will  be delivered through a series of brief practice visits with the facilitator that occur every 1 -
4 weeks over 2 years.    The usual care control group will be offered the intervention after the evaluative 
study is completed.   Visits will be completed either in -person or through  zoom video conferencing if 
face -face visits are not possible.   
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
 
Practice facilitation comprises on -site visits by [CONTACT_524966]/or staff.  The 
schedule of visits is tailored to the practice but generally  visits  occur  twice in the first month (to make a 
practice assessment) and then weekly to monthly thereafter (to effect practice change, provide 
education etc), with the goal of practice provi ders and staff working together to enhance their ability to 
deliver on -time HPV vaccination and encouraging persistence in the change process. Additional support 
via telephone and/or email will be available. Our own experience and reports in the literature31, [ADDRESS_681210] access to 
the practice facilitator and intervention components for 2 years, including two “well -child” seasons, a

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE  BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Bias:  Although most providers will be from St Louis me tropolitan area, they will be drawn from the bi -
state area. We will gather information to describe participants and eligible non -participants to assess 
selection bias and allow others to assess the relevance of our findings to their situation.   
  
Randomiza tion: We will stratify  practices into 2 -groups by [CONTACT_172184].  (< 4 and >  5) We 
will randomize within the strata using a block design.  
  
Blinding:  It is not possible to blind investigators or practices from group assignment. The RA and the 
data analyst will be blinded to group  assignment and are responsible for assessment of the primary and 
secondary outcome measures of HPV  vaccine use. Blinding is not necessary for baseline measurements 
as this will occur prior to randomizati on. Thus, baseline measures may be completed by [CONTACT_524973]. In addition, measurement bias will be minimized for the assessment of these 
outcomes by [CONTACT_2329] a  standardized approach for data collection and analysis, as well as quality chec ks. 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTI ON/EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION ADHERENCE 
 
The facilitators will record the number and duration of visits to the practice, number of QI team

To supplement these measures, guide the intervention and assess the intensity of the facilitation 
process, the facilitator will keep detailed field notes about practice observations and interactions that 
will be reviewed at weekly meetings.  Quality of delivery : score 1 (poor) to 10 (excelle nt) Score

extract routinely collected and previously recorded data, surveys, and field note s. The study team will 
follow the same measurement procedures for both study groups.  
 
The primary and secondary outcomes  (vaccine initiation and completion by [CONTACT_654] 13, respectively) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_524974], completed by [CONTACT_17033] (RA) and/or a member of the study 
team . To assess variation among providers in the same practice, we will sample records from each 
participating provider.  Measurement will be completed over four 12 -month time periods (baseline, 12 , 
24, and 36 months). For  each measurement period, the physician’s office will provide an electronic list 
of eligible patients with an office visit with each participating provider. For each practice , a member of 
the study team will randomly select a sample of [ADDRESS_681216] will include date and type of index visit (well child , 
acute care , and other e.g.,  immunization ), date of birth, date of vaccination for HPV vaccine, Tdap, and 
MCV, sex, race/ethnicity and insurance status. Records will be de -identified for patient, provider and 
practice identifiers, and given a unique subject ID number.  
Providers:  At baseline and at [ADDRESS_681217] intervention success and are needed to describe the study 
sample. The practice facilitator will keep detailed field notes about practice observations, contextual 
factors  and practice change components, and will monitor the implementation process.  
Practices: At baseline, the project coordinator  and/or a member of the study team  will meet with the 
practice manager to complete a brief practice survey to describe the practice and current HPV 
vaccination procedures. HPV vaccination procedures will be reassessed in a similar manner at 12 - and 
24- months.  
 
Following the conclusion of the intervention, int ervention practices will be invited to participate in an 
exit interview with the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_524933]’s experiences in participating in the 
HPV vaccine intervention, and to get input fro m participants about potential improvements in the 
intervention.  These i nterviews will be audio recorded, consent for recording will be verbal.

 9 STATISTICAL CONSID ERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPO THESES  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
We hypothesize that t he 2-year  intervention  will increase  the percentage  of preteens  who  receive 
HPV  vaccine  before  their 13th birthday  by [CONTACT_2669]  13 percentage  points  at 24 months compared to 
control , and benefits  will be sustained  at 36  months.  
 
Alternatively, our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in HPV vaccine use between the 
intervention and control groups.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETE RMINATIONS  
 
AIM 1 : We will use a cluster randomized design. Study outcomes will be measured at the level of the 
patient using a cross -sectional design. The sample size determination is based on the primary outcom e - 
initiation of HPV vaccination by [CONTACT_654] 13. Effectiveness is derived from the difference in the proportion of 
eligible preteens in the intervention and control groups [ADDRESS_681218] is          𝐻𝐻
0: 𝑝𝑝=0.4 vs. 𝐻𝐻 1: 𝑝𝑝=0.53.  
Our study has a three level hierarchica l structure: children are clustered within providers which are 
clustered within practices. Thus, there exists correlations for children seen by [CONTACT_524976], as well 
as providers working in the same practice. We use random effects to capture the intra -class correlation 
at the provider and the practice levels. From our preliminary data, the estimate for random effect variance at the practice level is very close to 0, and that at the provider level is 0.75
2 (corresponding to 
an ICC of 0.15). This suggest s very little heterogeneity at the practice level, but significant heterogeneity 
at the provider level. Since there is no ready -to-use software for power calculation for clustered trial in 
the three level hierarchical structure, we conduct the power calcul ation by [CONTACT_167889].  
In the simulation study, we set 𝜎𝜎𝑎𝑎2=.[ADDRESS_681219] at the practice level and 𝜎𝜎𝑏𝑏2=.[ADDRESS_681220] at the provider level. We choose the value of 𝛽𝛽  so that the proportion of HPV vaccine 
rate is 0.4 for control and 0.53 for the intervention. We assume there are 4 physicians in each practice, each physician sees 30 children, resulting a total of 120 patients in each practice. The sample size to calculate is the number of practices. The simulation study is carried out in R, using function glmer() in 
the mle4  package for estimation of the generalized linear mixed effects model (1) below.  
Our original simulation results showed that 10 practices in the control arm and 10 practices in the 
intervention arm (a total of 1 20*20=2,400 children) would achieve a power over 0.80, to reject the null 
hypothesis under the significance level of 0.05. To address variation in the number of providers/practice, 
and to account for inclusion of more providers than anticipated (95 vs 80),  we have chosen to increase 
HPV Vaccine Use in Primary Care                       Version 1.10  
Protocol  6 February,2023  
 
 
33 
 the sample size to 60 patients/provider, to ensure adequate power to detect a meaningful difference 
between the control group and the intervention group .  
We also considered different baseline initiation rates in the control group in the range of 0.[ADDRESS_681221] a difference in the rate of 0.12 when the baseline rate is 0.5 (i.e., 𝐻𝐻
0: 𝑝𝑝=0.5 vs. 𝐻𝐻1: 𝑝𝑝=0.62), and 0 .12 when the baseline rate is 0.6 
(i.e., 𝐻𝐻0: 𝑝𝑝=0.6 vs. 𝐻𝐻1: 𝑝𝑝=0.72). In summary, the sample size of [ADDRESS_681222] a 13% or larger effect.  
To date, the literature suggests increased vaccination in [ADDRESS_681223] assumed no change in control group outcomes 
for our calculations. Finally, we considered the unlikely event of a 5% increase in vaccine initiation in the 
target group. In th is case, our calculations suggest that a sample of 10/group would provide over 80% 
power to detect an 18% increase in the intervention group.  
 
AIM 2 : The joint significance test79 will be used to test if the mediation effect is significant. The p -value 
from the joint significance test is the maximum of the p -values in testing 𝛼𝛼 1=0 and 𝛾𝛾 =0 separately, that 
is, it requires that both 𝛼𝛼 1 and 𝛾𝛾  are significant simultaneously. We thus use a Bonferroni ’s correction to 
set the significance level to be 0.05/2=0. [ADDRESS_681224] the power in testing 𝛾𝛾 =[ADDRESS_681225] a 14% or larger effect.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
 Data  analyses  will adhere  to the intention -to-treat principle,  allowing  12-months  grace  period  to 
implement practice  changes.  The primary analysis  will compare  the overall  proportion  of eligible  
preteens  who  initiated  and completed  HPV  vaccination  in the intervention  and control practices  at 24 
months,  using  Year  2 measurements  for vaccine  use.  Maintenance  of change  will be assessed  using  Year  
3 measurements.   
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANAL YSES  
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROA CH 
 All main data analyses will adhere to the intention -to-treat principle, and a probability of P < 0.05 will be 
used to establish statistical significance ([ADDRESS_681226]).   Before we perform complic ated statistical 
modeling, we will conduct exploratory data analysis. For continuous variables, we will examine their 
distribution, and summarize them with mean/standard deviation if data are reasonably normally

 distributed, or with median/interquartile ra nge if data are skewed. We will use Rosner’s outlier 
detection routine. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_119938]. Simple comparison of 
continuous variables between intervention and control group will be performed using two sample t test 
or non -parametric Wilcoxon test.  Simple comparison of categorical variable will be performed using chi -
square test or fisher exact test where appropriate.  
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF TH E PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S ) 
 
Data  analyses  will adhere  to the intention -to-treat principle,  allowing  12-months  grace  period  to 
implement practice  changes.  The primary analysis  will compare  the overall  proportion  of eligible  
preteens  who  initiated  and completed  HPV  vaccination  in the intervention  and control practices  at 24 
months,  using  Year  2 measurements  for vaccine  use. Maintenance  of change  will be assessed  using  Year  
3 measurements.  The analytic  approach  is to use a multi -level random  effects  logistic  model  to account 
for the hierarchical structure:  children  clustered  within  providers  clustered  within  practices.  
 
Define by 𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as the binary variable of HPV vaccine for the 𝑖𝑖 th child of provider 𝑖𝑖  of practice 𝑖𝑖 . There are 
3 hierarchical levels: children c lustered within providers clustered within practices. We use random 
effects to capture the intra -class correlation at the provider and the practice levels. We assume a multi -
level random effects logistic model (a generalized linear mixed model):  
    logit  𝑃𝑃(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1)=𝛽𝛽0+𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽1+𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                         (1)         
 
where 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the treatment indicator for practice 𝑖𝑖 , and 𝛽𝛽 [ADDRESS_681227]. We use random 
effects 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 and 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to describe heterogeneity in the practice level and provider level, and assume 
𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖∼(0,𝜎𝜎𝑎𝑎2) and 𝑏𝑏 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∼𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝑏𝑏2) are independent. The practice level random intercept is used to 
accommodate extra- variation in outcome measurements due to clustering of pr oviders in a practice, 
and the provider level random intercept is used to accommodate extra -variation in outcome 
measurements due to clustering of individual patients within a provider.  
As secondary analysis, we can add other covariates in the model, e.g.,  gender, category of practice 
(urban vs. rural), vaccine rate at baseline for a provider or practice, etc. Interaction of treatment and 
these covariates can be included in the model to study the moderating effect of these risk factors. The 
interaction of random effects (both at the practice and provider levels) and covariates can be added in 
the model as well.  
 
Missing Data:  As in any other study, we expect some missing data in our stud y. If missing data affects 
the validity of statistical inference, we will follow Little and Rubin to deal with this problem.78 If the 
assumption of “missing at random” holds, this approach will avoid bias and preserves the study power. 
Specifically, multiple imputed completed datasets, say 5, will be generated through parametric (or 
nonparametric) Bayesian models. For each imputed dataset, the standard statistical method is applied 
to obtain the parameter estimates with the estimated variance and covariance. Then, these parameter 
estimates w ith their variance and covariance estimates can be used to generate overall parameter 
estimates and their standard errors.

9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF TH E SECONDAR Y END POINT(S ) 
 
 We will use mediation analysis to test whether the provider’s capability and provider’s beliefs about 
their capabilities mediate the intervention’s effect on vaccination outcomes.  
  
 
  
 
       
  
 
 
Define the provider’s beliefs about their capabilities by 𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, we can write the model as  
             𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼0+𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛼𝛼1+𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖+𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                                                     (2) 
                                                     logit 𝑃𝑃(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1)=𝛽𝛽0+𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽1+𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛾𝛾+𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖      (3) 
 
We are interested in testing the hypothesis 𝐻𝐻 𝑜𝑜:𝛼𝛼1𝛾𝛾 = 0 vs. 𝐻𝐻 1:𝛼𝛼1𝛾𝛾 ≠ 0. The joint significance tes t79 can be 
used to test the significance of the mediation effect. We include random effect 𝑐𝑐 𝑖𝑖 to capture the 
correlation of the provider’ s capabilities within the same practice. The indirect effect, i.e., the effect of 
intervention to the outcome through the mediator is specified as the product of 𝛼𝛼 [ADDRESS_681228] of treatment on outcome is denoted by 𝛽𝛽 1.  We can use a similar model for provider ’s capability.  
 
Finally, we can also include the interaction of treatment and mediator in Model (3), to test whether the 
mediator is also a moderator of treatment in the “mediator moderator” model.  
 
We will use mediation analysis to tes t whether the intervention effect on vaccination outcomes is 
mediated by [CONTACT_524977] 18 -item HPV vaccine delivery score.   
 
For implementation outcomes (fidelity, acceptability, appropriateness), we will complete a descr iptive 
analysis.  Parental satisfaction will be modeled in a three -level (practice, provider, and child’s parent) 
linear mixed effects model .  Descriptive statistics will be given on implementat ion fidelity, the 
acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention for providers, parental satisfaction with care, and 
cost. Of note, f idelity score is measured at the practice level every [ADDRESS_681229]: 𝛼𝛼1

 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡+𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,      (4) 
 
Where 𝛽𝛽1 is the slope for the temporal change in the fidelity score, 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 is the random intercept for 
practice  𝑖𝑖, and 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term. By [CONTACT_6310] 𝛽𝛽1=0, we can see if there is a significant increase in the 
fidelity score over time in the intervention group. We can add a random slope of time in this model to 
capture the heterogeneity in such a temporal change.  
 As another example, parental satisfaction wi ll be modeled in a three -level (practice, provider, and child’s 
parent) linear mixed effects model:

For cost, it is beyond the scope of this project to complete a cost -effectiveness analysis that includes all 
long -term related social costs and benefits (e.g., prevention of cancer, reducing costs of secondary 
prevention activities). Rather, we will prospectively as sess the cost to replicate the intervention in

 1.02  
   12/20/2019  
   Section 6.3: Blinding not needed for 
assessment of baseline measures  Baseline measures are completed 
prior to randomization.   
Section 10.1.6 :  PI [INVESTIGATOR_524937] r than a safety 
monitoring committee  The study is assessed as low risk 
and a safety monitoring 
committee is not required by [CONTACT_137656].  
 
 1.03  1/10/2020   Sections 5.5 and 8.1: Removed #[ADDRESS_681235] for parent 
surveys.   To obtain 30  parents/practice, we 
will need to invite a larger list of eligible parents.  
 
 1.04  
   2/10/2020  
  Sections 1.1 and 6.11: Added, all 
providers will receive baseline HPV 
vaccination rates.  In order to allow all providers to 
know the results of chart audits .  
Section 6.3: Added stratification to the 
block design for randomization.  To balance the randomization 
process for number of providers 
in the practice.   
    
1.05  3/24/2020  Section 5.5 and 8.1: Clarified who will 
send an email or text invitation for study participation to parents.  The email or text invitation will 
come from the study team, providers have the option to send  
an email or text to the parents.  
1.05  3/24/2020   Section 1.2: Study Sch ema to reflect 
measurement for 160 preteens per practice  To maintain power and address 
the variability in the recruited practices (2 -8 providers), we

(2-8 providers).  
 
    
1.06      5/13/2020                  Eliminated the parent survey at baseline.  Due to the 2020 outbreak of 
Covid -19, it is not possible to 
obtain the necessary information 
for a parent survey at this time.  The survey asks parents to recall 
their  
well -child visit for 2019, which 
would not be useful data at this 
time, and could add stress  on to

               patients/provider   Due to the participation of more 
providers than anticipated (95 vs 80) 
and because of variation among 
providers, our statistician has 
suggested to increase the sample size 
to [ADDRESS_681237] a meaningful difference bet

2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, 
accounting for over 56,000 deaths annually [2].  For patients with advanced colon cancer, 
oxaliplatin (trans-L-1, 2-diamino cyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) has been approved for therapy as 
a
 front line agent [3].  The platinum drugs include the prototype cisplatin, and its analogs, 
carboplatin and oxaliplatin, and have been the mainstay of therapy for lung, ovarian, breast, 
cervical, head and neck, and testicular cancer.  These drugs exert their anti cancer activity by 
[CONTACT_490421]-, and intra- (DNA) strand platinum adducts thereby [CONTACT_598606]: 07-10-376

ERCC-1 CRC study 5 inhibiting cell replication.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_598593], the benefits that patients derive remain 
dismal with response rates in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the range of 
15-20%, and median survival of [ADDRESS_791806] [4].  For patients with metastatic colon cancer, 
with 
the incorporation of new agents, including oxaliplatin, the median survival has improved to 
24 months with response rates of 50-60% [5].   
DNA damaging agents depend on irreversibly damaging the cell’s DNA in order to exert an anti 
cancer effect.  Successful anti cancer therapy is limited by [CONTACT_598607]’s ability to by[CONTACT_598608].  In the case of the platinum 
compounds, the resistance of the cancer cell to the chemotherapy is multifactorial [6,7,8] and 
includes: reduction in drug entry and subsequent accumulation within the cell [6,8]; enhanced 
detoxification by [CONTACT_598609] [6,9,10,11]; altered patterns of platinum-DNA adduct 
formation [12,13]; prevention of DNA damage after the formation of the DNA-platinum adducts 
by [CONTACT_598610][INVESTIGATOR_598594] [3,4,5,11], or by [CONTACT_598611] [12,13].  The repair of DNA damage is made possible by [CONTACT_598612] (NER) pathway.  Two major genes involved in this pathway are the excision 
repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC-1) and the ERCC-2 (xeroderma pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] - 
XPD) gene.  It has been well established that expression levels of the ERCC-[ADDRESS_791807] the ability of the drug to influence survival in patients with colon cancer [14].  
The NER reaction is carried out by a multienzyme complex and undergoes a stepwise process of 
recognition, incision, excision, repair synthesis and ligation [15,16].  The ERCC-[ADDRESS_791808], which leads to development of endonuclease activity [15].  
This then excises DNA-platinum adduct at the 5’ end of the damaged strand [17,18].  Thus far, 
NER is the only known mechanism for the removal and subsequent repair of the damage 
produced by [CONTACT_598613] [19].   
Studies on ovarian and colon cancer cell lines have demonstrated that there is up regulation of 
gene transcription with a rise in both mRNA and protein levels on exposure to cisplatin and 
oxaliplatin, respectively.  We therefore hypothesize that up regulation of ERCC gene expression 
in colorectal cancer cell lines is a reason for the different sensitivity patterns among the [ADDRESS_791809] demonstrated that the extent of DNA damage repair as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_598614]-1 expression levels is 30-50 times higher in resistant cells as compared to 
hypersensitive cells [20].  Other studies have also proven that in addition to colon cancer, the 
expression of the ERCC-1 gene also predicts for survival and cisplatin resistance in patients with 
lung [21], gastric [22] and ovarian [23] cancer.  Enhanced ERCC expression is directly linked to 
clinical response to cisplatin in ovarian cancer patients [23,24].  It has been clearly established 
that cells that are defective in this pathway are hypersensitive to the platinum [25,26], and those 
overactive in this pathway are resistant [8,27,28].  In a study involving 4 cancer cell lines, 
ovarian and an inherently cisplatin resistant colon (HT-29) cell lines were used.  ERCC-1 mRNA 
levels were measured after exposure to oxaliplatin for 20 hours and were higher than in the 
control, the A2780 (ovarian) cell line [29].  Another group studied the combination of irinotecan 
and oxaliplatin in HCT-[ADDRESS_791810], with the potential for synergy between the two drugs by [CONTACT_598615] [30]. 
Investigating ERCC-1 gene polymorphisms, DNA was collected from a clinical study evaluating 
the use of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and the C→T single nucleotide 
polymorphism in exon 118 was studied.  Patients with the C/C genotype had the most favorable 
survival.  The homozygous TT and the heterozygous CT patients had a relative risk of dying of

bears an association with response.  Similar findings have been observed in lung cancer [32,33].  
In a group of cisplatin treated patients, the C/C homozygous genotype was associated with a 
median survival of 486 days and was significantly (p=0.0058) greater than the T/T genotype with 
a median survival of [ADDRESS_791811] demonstrated that in certain circumstances, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
could serve as a reliable surrogate marker for cancer tissue.  Smoking induced carcinogen- DNA 
a
dducts were compared and levels from PBMC were found to be a reliable surrogate for levels in 
lung cancer specimens [34].  Patients with renal cancer were treated with the mTOR inhibitor 
CCI-779, and the gene expression profiles from their PBMC reliably identified the expression 
profile with a higher likelihood of a response [35].  Another mTOR inhibitor RAD 0001, was 
looked at in a syngeneic rat pancreatic tumor model, and it was found that long term monitoring 
of PBMC derived S6K1 activity levels could be used for assessing RAD 001 treatment schedules 
in patients with cancer [36].  The PBMC may reflect the events in the cancer cell and it is 
important to make this determination and derive a relationship between the gene expressions in 
the two sources of cells.  The study will look at ERCC-[ADDRESS_791812] indicated that among patients with colorectal cancer, the survival of 
African Americans is lower than that for Caucasians.  Possible explanations for this disparity is 
lower socio-economic status, lack of screening, delayed diagnoses, and genetic differences that 
possibly render one population to derive less benefit from the available therapy [37,38,39].  
Retrospective data suggests that baseline ERCC-[ADDRESS_791813] for sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs [40].  
The laboratory of Drs. Leonard Augenlicht and John Mariadason has identified the gene 
expression profile in a panel of 30 colon cancer cell lines and that could determine sensitivity 
and resistance patterns to the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan [41].  They have 
found that the selection of 50 genes correlated with 5-FU responsiveness, but not a random set of 
50 genes.  Also found was that this gene expression was a better predictor of 5-FU response than 
the previous well-established predictors of response, namely, thymidylate synthase, thymidine 
phosphorylase, p53 and mismatch repair status.

The cell biology department at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center has studied a panel of 30 colon 
cancer cell lines and determined a sensitivity pattern to various drugs used in the clinic as a 
therapeutic option for patients with advanced disease [55].  The laboratory of [CONTACT_598629] has studied a panel of [ADDRESS_791814]

apoptosis) to highly resistant (GI 50 of 11, 10% apoptosis) to oxaliplatin [54].  This pattern is 
hereby [CONTACT_598616] [fig 1].  As is evident, cell lines have been arranged in order of 
increasing sensitivity to oxaliplatin from least sensitive to the most sensitive.  It is this cell lines

6.0  TREATMENT PLAN AND STUDY DESIGN 
The 30 colon cancer cell lines panel that has been described in the preliminary data section of the 
protocol will be used.  Total ERCC-1 mRNA will be extracted using the RNeasy RNA extraction 
kit from Qiagen and converted to cDNA using an anchored oligo dT primer and reverse 
transcriptase.  Quantitative real time PCR will be used to quantify ERCC1 mRNA and results 
expressed relative to GAPDH levels.  Total cellular protein will be extracted and ERCC-1 
protein level quantified by [CONTACT_598618]-1 antibody.   
Forty patients (20 patients/year) will be enrolled to collect four tubes of [ADDRESS_791821] cells for ERCC expression.  mRNA will be measured by 
[CONTACT_956] [22,44] and protein by [CONTACT_598619] [45].  This tube of blood will be drawn 
before commencement of any chemotherapy (0 hours/baseline), at the end of infusion (2 hours) , 
and at 48 hours (this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_598596] 5-FU 
infusional pump).  Another tube will be collected when the patient returns on the first day of the 
next cycle.  The PBMC samples will be processed within [ADDRESS_791822] performing the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_598597], of which one 
specimen will be formalin fixed and sent to pathology for the establishment of a diagnosis.  The 
second will be handed to me my designee and this will be immediately placed in dry ice in the 
operating/procedure room.  The sample will be transported out of the procedure room 
immediately and then placed in liquid nitrogen.  This tissue will be studied for ERCC-1 mRNA 
e
xpression.  For patients from whom we will be unable to obtain fresh tumor samples, only the 
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue block will be used to estimate ERCC-1 protein content 
in a semi-quantitative manner using the immune-histochemistry (IHC) analysis using a 
c
ommercially available antibody to the protein [42].  The IHC staining will be performed using 
antibodies from biomeda, and analyses using standard techniques described previously [43].  
Appropriate positive and negative controls will be used.  The IHC will be graded as positive or 
negative and will be independently verified by a pathologist blinded to the identity of the sample.  
It is estimated that close to 22%, of patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer are 
able to undergo curative resection of the metastases after therapy with the FOLFOX regimen [5].  
The surgeon performing the liver resection will hand over a pi[INVESTIGATOR_598598] a manner described previously.  This will facilitate 
gene expression study over time after a 2-hour exposure to oxaliplatin.  Both, the fresh tissue and 
the PBMC will be analyzed for semi-quantitative ERCC-1 by [CONTACT_88304], and by [CONTACT_598620].  Analyses to estimate the degree of correlation between the 
magnitude of change in the ERCC-1 gene expression in PBMC and the fresh tumor samples will 
be performed.

10 or 100 mM oxaliplatin for 9 hours, following which time the drug will be removed, cells 
trypsinized, and reseeded in fresh medium at a density of 500 cells per well.  Colony formation 
will be monitored over the following 2 weeks and visualized by [CONTACT_598623].   
From the panel of 30 colon cancer cell lines, genomic DNA will be extracted and studied for 
germline polymorphisms as described below.  Similarly, from the baseline PBMC from all 
patients, DNA will be extracted to determine germline polymorphisms.  The genomic DNA will 
be prepared from PBMC using the Puregene blood DNA kit (Gentra Inc.) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol.  The ERCC-1 C→T polymorphism will be detected using modified 
PCR-RFLP methods, using primer sequences described previously [33].  It is well established 
that certain germline polymorphisms in the ERCC-[ADDRESS_791825] oxaliplatin-sensitive (LS174T, SW403, RW7213, HCC2998, SW948) and [ADDRESS_791826] oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines (KM12, SW1116, LoVo, Caco-2, 16E) for further analysis 
(10 cell lines in total).  Each of these cell lines will be treated with 10 μM oxaliplatin for 24 
hours.  Total RNA will be isolated from treated and untreated cells using the RNeasy kit 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  For microarray hybridizations, 50 μg of RNA from oxaliplatin treated 
cells will be labeled with Cy5 dUTP, and 50 μg of RNA from untreated cells labeled with Cy3 
dUTP.  Probe preparation, hybridization conditions, and array scanning procedure were as 
previously described and as routinely performed in our laboratory [47,48].  Labeled probes will 
be hybridized to 27,000 feature cDNA microarrays generated by [CONTACT_598624] [49].  Images will be analyzed using Genepix Pro software (Axon 
Instruments, Union City, CA), and lowess normalized.  For each cell line, two independent 
oxaliplatin treatment experiments will be performed, and the mean value (ratio) for each gene 
computed.

envision obtaining between 2-5 micrograms of total RNA from patient biopsies [50].  RNA will 
be linearly amplified by T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase driven in vitro transcription 
(Arcturus, KIT 0201).  For colon cancer cell lines, this procedure typi[INVESTIGATOR_598599] 
30 μg of polyU mRNA from 5 μg of total starting RNA.  5 μg of polyU/polyA mRNA from pre 
and post treatment specimens will be labeled with Cy5 dUTP and compared to 5 μg of Cy3 
dUTP-labeled reference RNA routinely utilized in the Augenlicht laboratory [55].  Comparison 
of the pre and post treatment samples to a reference RNA will enable additional analyses to be 
performed in the future, including the identification of genes / signatures whose basal level of 
expression may be predictive of oxaliplatin response.  Patient with good and bad response to 
oxaliplatin will be separated and genes differentially expressed in response to oxaliplatin 
identified as described in previously.  In addition, genes altered in expression in response to 
oxaliplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo will be identified.   
 
Oxaliplatin and other chemotherapy will be delivered as is standard of care.  However, doses 
may be modified per treating physician and patient tolerance

10.0 DRUG FORMULATION 
 
Ox
aliplatin is available in two different dose vials containing 50 mg and 100 mg of active 
drug at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.  It is stored at 25*C.  It must be diluted prior to 
infusion in 250-500 ml of 5% dextrose [under no circumstance should 0.9% sodium 
chloride (NS) be used].   
 
The drug will be prepared and infused, as is standard practice.

(2000) will be followed.  
 
11.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  
 
Elig
ibility 
 
 
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter >20 mm using conventional techniques or >[ADDRESS_791834] scan. 
 
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_791835] scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
[CONTACT_15218]; and. 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow-up.  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  
 
Methods of Measurement -  
 
CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 
[ADDRESS_791836] should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  
 
Baseline documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" lesions 
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by [CONTACT_62441]. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these

up. 
 
R
esponse Criteria 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions 
2. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD 
3. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 
one or more new lesions 
4. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
1.Com
plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level 
2.Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
3.Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesion.  
 
(1) Although a clear progression of "non target" lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62419] (or study chair). 
 
Evaluation of best overall response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria  
 
Target lesions  Non-target lesions  Evaluation of NTL  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete Resp./ SD  No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD

Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
"symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to document the objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
I
n some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that

status.  
 
Duration of overall response 
 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively 
documented, taking as reference for PD the measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
Duration of stable disease 
 
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, 
taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
 
11.2 Time to Disease Progression - From date of registration to date of progressive 
disease. 
 
11.3   Duration of Response - Time from documentation of complete or partial response 
to documentation of disease progression. 
 
11.4   Time to Death - From date of registration to date of death.

Sulopenem is an investigational thio penem antibiotic being developed for treatment of uUTI,  
complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) , and complicated intra -abdominal infections 
(cIAI). Sulopenem etzadroxil is an oral pro- drug of sulopenem. Upon oral absorption, 
sulopenem etzadroxil  is expected to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_259473], the active 
moiety .   
Sulopenem possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacter ales including those 
that encode Extended Spectrum β -lactamase ( ESBL ) or AmpC -type β -lactamases that confer 
resistance to third generation cephalosporins. Sulopenem etzadroxil is expected to be the first 
oral penem for uUTI on the market in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe and will offer the option 
of treatment in the outpatient setting as well as intravenous ( IV) to oral switch therapy for 
early discharge of patients hospit alized with serious , complicated infections.  Probenecid, co -
administered with the oral prodrug, in a bilayer tablet formulation, will reduce renal clearance 
and increase systemic exposure of the active moiety, sulopenem  (CP-70,429) .   
 
This trial is a prospective Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double -blind, double dummy, 
controlled study to compare oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid (oral sulopenem) to oral 
amoxicillin/clavulanate  for the treatment of patients with uUTI .  Approximately 1966 adult 
women with uUTI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a bilayer tablet with  IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

The primary outcome measure for efficacy evaluation will be the overall success (combined 
clinical  and microbiologic success) on Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in the micro -MITT, micro -
MITTS and micro -MITTR populations .  
The micro -MITT population will be comprised of all randomized patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug and had ≥105 CFU/mL of a baseline pathogen (Enterobacterales 
or Staphylococcus saprophyticus  only) isolated from a urine culture specimen taken at 
baseline, prior to initiation of study drug therapy.  
 The primary comparison of the study is in the micro- MITT population (the combined 
population of patients with a positive baseline culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility). These outcomes are most relevant to the practicing 
clinician who must choose empi[INVESTIGATOR_266486]. 
From a regulatory perspective, these results will help put into context the outcomes in the 
culture and susceptibility - driven subpopulations.  
The primary comparisons for regulatory approval are in two mutually exclusive sub -
populations of the micro -MITT population defined by a baseline characteristic, the micro -
MITTS and micro -MITTR populations:  
 
• The micro -MITTS population: the subset of patients whose baseline pathogens are 
determined to be susceptible (MIC ≤ 8/4 mg/L) to the comparator study drug, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate.  
• The micro -MITTR population : the subset of patients whose baseline pathogen is 
determined to be non- susceptible  [intermediate (MIC 16/8 mg/L) or resistant (MIC ≥ 
32/16 mg/L)]  to the comparator study drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate . 
Amoxicillin/clavulanate breakpoints as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 
(M100 Performance Standards for Antimi crobial Susceptibility Testing, 32

Study Population:  
A total enrollment of approximately 1966 patients is  planned.   
Patients will be randomized using an Interactive Web Randomization System ( IWRS ) into the 
study, provided they have satisfied all patient selection criteria.

amoxicillin /clavulanate 875 mg/[ADDRESS_324391] pathogens isolated from urine cultures that are resistant to 
amoxicillin/clavulanate or carbapenems may be allowed to continue on study drug therapy to 
complete the 5- day duration of treatment based on clinical response and investigator 
judgement and are not required to receive alternative antibiotic therapy.  
Adjunctive Systemic Antibiotics (Rescue Therapy)  
In general, adjunctive systemic antibiotics are not allowed  for patients  enrolled in the study.   
At any time during the study period, and at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI), 
additional antibiotics —oral or IV, as appropriate —can be prescribed as rescue therapy, e.g., in 
the event of worsening signs and symptoms of uUTI, or if the patient develops fever and/or flank pain suggestive of upper urinary tract involvement. In the event that rescue therapy is 
prescribed, patient symptoms will be collected as an unscheduled event ; such patients will be 
considered as treatment failures and  will be asked to still complete all protocol -specified 
assessments through the F inal Visit. Use of adjunctive antibiotics without clinical symptoms is 
strongly discouraged.  
Other Systemic Antibiotics:  
For Clostridioides  difficile  infections, metronidazole (IV or oral), vancomycin (oral or rectal) , 
or fidaxomicin (oral) may be used in both treatment groups. Patients with a co- infection with a 
gram -positive uropathogen known or suspected to be resistant to study drugs are allowed to 
receive agents with narrow spectrum gram -positive coverage (such as oral linezolid) at the 
discretion of  the investigator .

Confidential Page 9 of 84 Preparation and Dispensing : 
Each patient will receive a treatment kit containing one 5- day treatment course of either 
sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid and placebo amoxicillin/clavulanate  or placebo sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid and amoxicillin/clavulanate . 
Administration : 
Patients  randomized to the sulopenem treatment group will take one sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid tablet and one  placebo capsule twice daily for 5 days and those 
randomized to the amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment group  will take one over- encapsulated 
amoxicillin/clavulanate tablet and  one placebo tablet  twice daily  for 5 days (10 doses total  
over a 5 -day period; if Dose 1 is taken in the evening of Day 1, Dose 10 will  be taken in t he 
morning of Day 6) . The first dose of each medication will be administered under the 
supervision of study site personnel  to help ensure compliance with dosing directions . 
Dosing with food:  
Food significantly increases bioavailability of sulopenem and consequently results in 
decreased rates of diarrhea. Therefore, dosing of oral sulopenem with food whenever possible 
is recommended.  Since adequate target attainment appears to be achieved in t he fasted state, 
an inability to administer the dose with food should not preclude dosing.  
Amoxicillin and clavulanate are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral 
administration. Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the  pharmacokinetics of 
amoxicillin. While amoxicillin/clavulanate can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. Therefore, dosing of 
oral amoxicillin/clavulanate with food whenev er possible is also recommended.  
Efficacy Assessments: 
 
The assessment of clinical response includes a review of the following symptoms  at the 
Baseline, Day 5 ( +1 day) /End of Treatment ( EOT ) visits , and the Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC , and 
Day 28 (± 2 days)  visits or at P remature Discontinuation : urinary frequency, urinary urgency, 
pain or burning on micturition, and suprapubic pain.  
Microbiologic response assessments will be made based on quantitative cultures performed on collected urine specimens  at the Baseline, Day 5 ( +1 day) , Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC , and Day 28 
(± 2 days)  visits or at Premature Discontinuation. 
Results of susceptibility testing to differentiate between pathogens isolated at baseline and follow- up visits will be used in a sensitivity analysis to be specified in the statistical analysis 
plan ( SAP); whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be performed if needed and results will be 
used in a sensitivity analysis to be specified in the  SAP.

Statistical  Methods:  
Sample Size Considerations:   
Study IT001-310 is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem is non- inferior  to oral 
amoxicillin/clavulanate for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and 
microbiologic success) at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in both the micro -MITT and micro -MITTS 
populations and whether oral sulopenem is superior to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for overall 
success at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in the micro -MITTR population.  The primary outcome 
measure of overall success (combined clinical and microbiologic success) is defined as 
resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry with  no new symptoms, and the 
demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at trial entry is reduced to <103 CFU/mL on 
urine culture.  
The proposed sample size in the micro- MITTS population is 505 patients per arm (total 
sample size of 1010 patients)  based o n the method of Farrington and Manning. This assumes a 
non-inferiority margin of 10.0%, a power of 90%, a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 , 60% 
overall  success rate with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 6 0% overall success rate with sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid. Assuming that 21 % of the patients will have non -susceptible pathogens 
to amoxicillin/clavulanate and assuming 85% power to show superiority in the micro- MITTR 
population ( micro -MITT= 1278 patients ), 67% of the randomized patients will meet criteria for 
inclusion into the micro- MITT population ( MITT= 1907 patients)  and allowing for a dropout 
rate of 3%, the sample size for the ITT population is 1966. With [ADDRESS_324392] 85% power to show superiority at the 
one-sided 2.5% alpha level given a 51% and 33% overall success rate in the oral sulopenem 
and amoxicillin/clavulanate groups, respectively.  With [ADDRESS_324393] 95% power to show non- inferiority (non- inferiority margin of 
10.0%) at the one -sided alpha level of 0.025 with the treatment success rates of the oral 
sulopenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate  groups assumed to be 58% in this population . 
To ensure that the point estimate of overall success (combined clinical and microbiologic 
success) used in the estimation of sample size, and the estimated eligibility rate, 
susceptibility rate, and rate of post -treatmen t asymptomatic bacteriuria is valid for this study, 
an interim analysis for sample size re -estimation will be performed when clinical and 
microbiologic response data at Day 12 (± 1 day)/TOC are available for approximately 50% 
of the patients ( approximately  983 patients ) (see Section 9.7). The FDA Guidance “Non -IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Confidential Page 11 of 84 inferiority Clinical Trials” [ FDA Guidance 2016 ] notes that such a sample size re -estimatio n 
if based on the blinded overall response rates is not only acceptable but is advisable.  The 
interim analysis will involve a sample size re -estimation to either confirm the initial sample 
size estimate is adequate or increase the sample size (number of r andomized patients) to 
ensure the study has adequate power. The sample size of the study will be computed to 
ensure that there is sufficient power for determining whether oral sulopenem is NI to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for the primary outcome measure in the micro -MITTS population. 
This will ensure that the study is sufficiently powered to test the primary endpoint in the micro -MITT and micro -MITTR populations as well. The sample size will not be decreased  
after the interim analysis .  In addition, the s ample size may be increased based on a lower -
than-expected evaluability rate (i.e., percentage of the ITT population in the micro- MITT 
population), higher - than-expected rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria or lower than expected 
percentage of patients with a susceptible pathogen. The sample size re- estimation will be 
based on the blinded overall (not by [CONTACT_1570]) pooled data.  If the aggregated overall 
success rate in the micro -MITTS population is higher than 70%, or if the aggregated rate of 
asymptomatic bacteriuria  is significantly lower than anticipated, then a futility analysis may 
be conducted by [CONTACT_266510]. Further details of how the 
DMC will decide to do the futility analysis, how the sponsor will be involved and how the 
analysis will be conducted will be provided in the SAP and the DMC charter .

Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure:  
The study is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem is NI to oral 
amoxicillin/clavulanate for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and 
microbiologic success ) at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in the micro -MITT and micro -MITTS 
populations and whether oral sulopenem is superior to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  for overall 
success  at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in the micro -MITTR popula tion.  
A patient will be defined as an overall success  if the following criteria are met:  
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other reasons, then 
the patient will be considered indeterminate  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI 
symptoms (based on the Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire)  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  demonstrates <103 CFU/mL of the baseline 
uropathogen based on results of quantitative cultures performed on collected urine 
specimens.   
All other patients will be considered as failures  unless data are unavailable to determine if 
the patient is a success  or a failure. In this case, the patient will be considered as having an 
indeterminate response. Patients with an indeterminate response are included in the denominator for determination of the  overall  success  rate. 
 
The number and percentage of patients with s uccess , failure  and indeterminate  outcomes will 
be determined in each treatment group in the micro -MITT, micro -MITTS and micro -MITTR 
populations . For each analysis population, the obs erved difference in the percentage of 
patients with success  at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  (oral sulopenem group minus the 
amoxicillin/clavulanate  group) will be determined and a two -sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the observed difference will be computed using the method proposed without 
stratification by [CONTACT_240865].  
The framework for the statistical hypothesis testing of the primary efficacy outcome, overall 
success  (combined clinical and microbiological success ) at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC , is d efined 
below.  
The primary comparison of the study is in the micro- MITT population ( the combined 
population of patients with a positive baseline culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility). These outcomes are most relevant to the practicing 
clinician who must choose empi[INVESTIGATOR_266486]. 
From a regulatory perspective, these results will help put into context the outcomes in the 
culture and susceptibility - driven subpopulations.  
The primary comparisons for regulatory approval are in two mutually exclusive sub -
populations  of the micro -MITT population defined by a baseline characteristic :  1) the micro -IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

is determined to be susceptible to the comparator study drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate ); and 2) 
the micro -MITTR population (the subset of the micro- MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be non-susceptible [intermediate (MIC 16/8 mg/L) or resistant 
(MIC ≥ 32/16 mg/L)] to the comparator study drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate).  
To control for inflation of the  overall type I error rate, the hierarchical testing procedure of 
Westfall and Krishen (Westfall 2001) will be used to test the hypotheses of the primary 
efficacy outcome in these populations in the sequential order described below. Testing will 
proceed to the next comparison, only in the case where the null hypothesis in the previous 
comparison was rejected. When testing in a sequential manner with pre- planned testing, no 
adjustment to the alpha level is required  
(1) NI in the micro -MITT population.  For this population, a NI test of the overall success rate 
will be conducted.  The null and alternative hypotheses are the following:  
∆ − ≤ −2 1 0 : p p H  and ∆ − > −2 1 : p p HA , 
where p 1 is the primary efficacy outcome rate in the oral sulopenem group, p 2 is the primary 
efficacy outcome rate in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group, and Δ is the non- inferiority margin 
of 10.0 %. 
The NI hypothesis test is a 1- sided hypothesis test performed at the 2.5% level of significance.  
This is based on the lower limit of the 2- sided 95% CI for the observed difference in the 
overall success rate (oral sulopenem group minus amoxicillin/clavulanate group).  The 
primary analysis is based on the CI computed using the method proposed without stratification 
by [CONTACT_240865], which corresponds to the p- value approach of the Farrington-
Manning test.  If the lower limit of the 95% CI for difference in success rates in the micro -
MITT population is greater th an -10.0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the NI of oral 
sulopenem to amoxicillin/clavulanate will be concluded.  
 (2) NI in the micro -MITTS population OR superiority in the micro- MITTR population as 
described below : 
Micro-MITTS population: the su bset of the micro -MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be susceptible to the comparator study drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate. For this population, a NI test of the o verall success rate will be 
conducted. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:  
∆ − ≤ −2 1 0 : p p H  and ∆ − > −2 1 : p p HA  
A 2-sided 95% CI for the o bserved treatment difference in success rates will be determined. If 
the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than - 10.0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and 
the NI of oral sulopenem to amoxicillin/clavulanate in the micro -MITTS population will be 
concluded. 
Micro-MITTR population: the subset of the micro- MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be non-susceptible to the comparator study drug, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate . For this population, a superiority test will be conducted.  The null and 
alternative hypotheses are as follows:  IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

using the method without stratification of Miettinen and Nurminen.  If the lower bound of the 
95% CI is greater than 0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and superiority of oral 
sulopenem to amoxicillin/clavulanate will be concluded in the micro -MITTR population.  
Each of the 2 null hypotheses in this step will be tested at the 2.5% level and if either hypothesis is rejected, then testing will proceed to the next step.

Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measure:  
The number and percentage of patients in each treatment group with a clinical response of 
success, failure and indeterminate at Day 12 (±1 day) /TOC will be presented for the MITT,

1.1 Indication 
Sulopenem and/or sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (oral sulopenem) are being studied for the 
treatment of the following indications:  
- Uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
- Complicated urinary tract infections 
- Complicated intra -abdominal infections  
1.[ADDRESS_324402] 50  years has resulted in the 
development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically important bacteria.   This 
resistance commonly takes the form of β -lactamase producti on, expression of porins in the 
bacterial outer membrane or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs).   Such mechanisms 
have reduced the clinical utility of frequently prescribed β -lactams such as amoxicillin, 
amoxicillin plus clavulanate (a β -lactamase inhibitor), and cephalosporins.  The issue of 
resistance continues to drive the search for new compounds with increased stability and efficacy 
against resistant pathogens.  
The prevalence of infections caused by [CONTACT_89927]- spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) producing 
Enterobacterales  has been increasing worldwide and includes both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired and 
community onset infections. An analysis of data reported from 2011 to 2014 to the N ational 
Healthcare Safety Network performed by [CONTACT_104545] 2016 
revealed that the proportion of E. coli resistant to extended- spectrum cephalosporins causing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- acquired infection was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% reported in some 
Northeastern, Southern , and Western states.  The same analysis also demonstrated that over a 
third of E.  coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to quinolones. Data reported by [CONTACT_259485] (EARS -NET) in Europe demonstrate that the 
prevalence of quinolone resistant E.  coli and E. coli resistant to third generation  cephalosporins 
is > 25% and E.  coli resistant to third  generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and 
quinolones has increased to >10% in some southern and eastern European countries.  
Oral antibiotic treatment options are extremely limited for patients with these multi-drug 
resistant infections, resulting in  lengthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259475], even for those with uncomplicated infections. The currently available oral antibiotics with activity against ESBL producing organisms include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, quinolones, 
and trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are only approved for the 
treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the [LOCATION_002], have rising rates of resistance and are associated with inferior efficacy  [Munoz- Davila 2014; Schito 2009] . 
Resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole is uniformly above 20% in the US.  Increasing 
prevalence of resistance to quinolones and their propensity to cause collateral damage resulted in 
relegation of quinolones to second- line ther apy by [CONTACT_266512]001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

million urinary Enterobacterales isolates from ambulatory patients in the [LOCATION_002] (2011 -
2020), resistance rates were 57.5%, 23.1%, 20.6%, and 20.2% for β -lactams, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin, respectively, and 6.9% had an ESBL -
producing phenotype [ Dunne 2022].  Efficacy outcomes for patients treated with antibiotics  for 
uUTI caused by [CONTACT_105]- susceptible pathogens are not known, though a recent  analysis of 4,792 
patients with 5,395 evaluable outpatient UTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 22% of patients received an antibiotic to 
which the pathogen was resistant in vitro , and those patients were almost twice as likely to 
require a second prescription (34% versus 19%) or be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (15% versus 8%) within 28 days of the initial prescription fill compared to patients who received an ant ibiotic to which the 
pathogen was susceptible [ Dunne 2022] .  
 
The currently proposed study will compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral 
sulopenem versus oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  for the treatment of uUTI  in women.  Sulopenem 
(CP-70,429) i s a broad -spectrum thiopenem β -lactam antibiotic which is being developed for the 
treatment of infections caused by [CONTACT_7163] -drug resistant bacteria. Sulopenem possesses potent 
activity against species of the Enterobacterales  that encode ESBLs or AmpC -type β -lactamases 
that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. The targeted g ram-negative spectrum of 
sulopenem is balanced by [CONTACT_266513], which is 
similar to that of imipenem.  
 
An in vitro susceptibility study of sulopenem was conducted in April 2016 utilizing 
contemporary clinical bacterial isolates from patients in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sulopenem and [ADDRESS_324403] 
1,122 recent (2013- 2015) clinical isolates following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
(CLSI) guidelines.   The study collection included 872 aerobes (811 g ram-negative, 61 gram -
positive) and 250 anaerobes.  Isolates were chosen randomly from the IHM A (International 
Health Management Associates, Inc., Schaumburg, IL) repository, which is a global collection of 
single patient clinical isolates.    For this study, the selection of isolates focused on infection

Sulopenem (CP-70,429) is available as an intravenous formulation. Intravenous sulopenem was 
previously evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in Japan in approximately 1478 
subjects, at doses up to 1g BID administered intravenously over 3 -14 days in the early 1990s. 
Safety data collected from these trials regarding both adverse events as well as laboratory examinations provides support for the safety and tolerability of sulopenem in patients and its further development.   
Sulopenem etzadroxil, the oral pro- drug of sulopenem,  has minimal in vitro  antibacterial activity . 
Upon oral absorption, sulopenem etzadroxil  yields the active moiety sulopenem ( CP-70,429) in 
addition to the non- active moieties formate and 2- ethylbutyric acid (2- EBA).   
Sulopenem etzadroxil  has been studied in single and multiple dose Phase 1 studies, with and 
without co- administration of probenecid. One small Phase 2 study in patients with community 
acquired pneumonia was conducted, in which 35 adult patients were randomized to one of three 
treatment groups to receive either: a single loading dose of intravenous (IV) sulopenem with 
switch to oral sulopenem etzadroxil , 4 dose minimum of IV sulopenem with switch to oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil, or ceftriaxone (IV) for a minimum of 2 doses, with step down to amoxicillin/clavulanate. The cure rates in the clinically evaluable patients  in this study at TOC 
were 90%, 88% and 63% in the single IV dose sulopenem, multiple IV dose sulopenem and ceftri axone (IV) groups, respectively. While these efficacy results were not statistically 
significant due to the small numbers enrolled, they provide encouraging support for further 
clinical testing in this indication.   IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Confidential Page 26 of 84 Sulopenem (IV) has been studied in Phase  3 studies in patients with cUTI, and cIAI, and oral 
sulopenem has been studied in a Phase 3 study in patients with uUTI, as well as step -down 
therapy in patients in the cUTI and cIAI studies. These studies were conducted in the United 
States  and Eastern E urope. 
Study IT001-301: 
Study IT001-301 was a  prospective, Phase  3, randomized,  multi- center,  double-blind, double -
dummy study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral sulopenem versus  oral ciprofloxacin 
for treatment of uUTI in adult  women. A tot al of 1,671 adult women with uUTI were  
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a bilayer tablet with sulopenem 
etzadroxil/probenecid 500     mg/500 mg twice  daily  for 5 days or  oral ciprofloxacin  250 mg twice  
daily  for 3 days .  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the population of patients with organisms non- susceptible to 
quinolones ( micro -MITTR population ) was overall response at the Day 12 (±1 day) /TOC  Visit. 
Overall success was seen in 62.6% of patients in the sulopenem group and 36% of patients in the 
ciprofloxacin group (treatment difference 26.6%, 95% CI [15.1, 37.4]). The study demonstrated 
superiority of sulopenem to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of uUTI in the micro- MITTR 
population.  
In a second population of patients with organisms susceptible to quinolones (micro- MITTS 
population), oral sulopenem was not noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the primary endpoint of 
overall response .  The difference in overall success between the treatment groups in this 
population of patients was driven primarily by [CONTACT_266514] -
treatment  which was lower for patients receiving ciprofloxacin relative to those receiving 
sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid.  
Overall response in the combined population of patients with a positive baseline culture and 
without regard to quinolone susceptibility, did not demonstrate a difference in treatment outcome.  
Overall, the safety profile for oral sulopenem  compared with ciprofloxacin was consistent across 
patient populations. The most common a dverse event seen in patients receiving oral sulopenem 
was diarrhea, which was mild  and self-limited.  The rates of discontinuations from study drug 
and SAEs were low on both regimens and similar between the two groups.  
Study IT001-302: 
Study IT001- 302 was a prospective, Phase 3, randomized, multi -center, double -blind, double -
dummy study of the efficacy, tolerability and safety of sulopenem IV followed by [CONTACT_266515]/clavulanate for 
treatment of cUTI in adults. A  total of 1395 patients  were enrolled  in the study, randomly 
assigned  in a 1:1 ratio to sulopenem 1000 mg IV once daily for 5 days followed by [CONTACT_266516] 500 mg/500 mg twice daily to complete 7 -10 total days of treatment (N  = 697) 
or ertapenem  1000 mg IV once daily for 5 days followed by [CONTACT_266517] 500 mg 
twice daily to complete 7 -10 total days of treatment  (N = 698). Patients with a baseline 
pathogen non- susceptible to ciprofloxacin, but susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, and who 
met criteria for oral step -down took amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg  twice daily instead 
of ciprofloxacin to complete the 7- 10 total days of treatment.  IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

margin of  -10, the study did not demonstrate noninferiority of  sulopenem to ertapenem  in the 
treatment of  cUTI.  
Sulopenem was well -tolerated, with both the rate of discontinuations and the incidence of 
TEAEs similar to those of ertapenem. The rate of SAEs for patients on sulopenem was similar to 
that for patients on ertapenem.  
Study IT001-303: 
Study IT001- 303 was a prospective Phase 3, double -blind, multicenter, randomized study of the 
efficacy and safety of sulopenem IV followed by [CONTACT_266518]/clavulanate for treatment of cIAI in adults.  A

5 days followed by [CONTACT_266517] 500 mg twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg four 
times daily to complete 7 -10 total days of treatment  (N = 336). Patients with a baseline 
pathogen non- susceptible to ciprofloxacin, but susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, and who 
met criteria for oral step -down took amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg  twice daily instead 
of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to complete the 7 -10 total days of treatment.  
Clinical success was seen in 85.5% of patients in the sulopenem group and 90.2% of patients in 
the ertapenem group in the micro- MITT population (treatment difference - 4.7%, 95% CI [ -10.3,

sulopenem to ertapenem in the treatment of cIAI. In all other study populations —ITT, MITT,

Rationale for amoxicillin/clavulanate as the comparator:  
Amoxicillin /clavulanate was chosen as the comparator because it is an approved antibiotic for 
the indication of UT I [Augmentin USPI], it is  listed as a treatment option in the IDSA Treatment 
Guideline [Gupta 2011], and as a β -lactam antibiotic, it is likely to have a similar effect to 
sulopenem on the urogenital microbiome, thus allowing for a fair comparison of effic acy.  The 
dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg PO twice daily) was chosen to justify the use of 
amoxicillin/clavulanate CLSI breakpoints for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (M100 
Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 32nd edition ). See Appendix 1  
for further details on the rationale for using amoxicillin/clavulanate as the comparator.  
1.2.1 Safety data  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sulopenem etzadroxil (PF-03709270; oral prodrug)  
Pre-clinical data  
The non- clinical program to assess toxicity of sulopenem etzadroxil  consisted of acute oral and 
repeat -dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, genetic toxicity assessments, and 
reproductive development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits.  Fol lowing oral administration of 
sulopenem etzadroxil  in rats and monkeys, circulating concentrations of sulopenem etzadroxil  
were variable and minimal or below limits of quantitation, whereas significant levels of 
sulopenem and 2- EBA were present in whole blood. Effects observed in rats and monkeys from 
the repeat dose toxicology studies were generally consistent with those expected from the active moiety sulopenem. The No -Observed -Adverse- Effect -Level ( NOAEL ) in the rat is 100 
mg/kg with a C
max of 1.90 µg/mL and AUC of 7.24 µg•h/mL for sulopenem, and the NOAEL in 
the monkey is 50 mg/kg with a C max of 4.63 µg/mL and an AUC of 11.1 µg•h/mL for 
sulopenem, respectively. Sulopenem etzadroxil  was negative in mutagenicity and in vivo 
clastogenicity tests but po sitive for clastogenic activity in human lymphocytes. Sulopenem 
etzadroxil  had no effects on male and female rat fertility and early embryonic development and 
was not teratogenic to rats or rabbits. Developmental toxicity was observed in both rats and 
rabbits with the NOAEL being 100 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, at doses where maternal 
toxicity was also observed.  
Previous human experience  
The sulopenem etzadroxil  studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
tolerabi lity of single oral doses ranging from [ADDRESS_324406] also been investigated.  
Single doses of sulopenem etzadroxil  of 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000 mg produced an 
approximately linear increase in sulopenem mean exposure. The apparent terminal half -life of 
sulopenem was generally dose independent and ranged from 0.76 hours to 1.10 hours.  
Mean time to observed maximum concentration (T max) was on average 1 hour for all doses. 
Neither sulopenem etzadroxil  nor formic acid has been detected in either plasma or whole 
blood following dosing with sulopenem etzadroxil . In addition, the levels of 2- EBA were 
much lower (~1/20) than sulopenem concentrations. During the administration of multiple IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

The concentrations of radioactivity in plasma and whole blood, the excretion of radioactivity 
and the metabolic pathways of [14C] sulopenem etz adroxil have been determined in healthy 
male volunteers (N = 4) following single oral solution (2000 mg) administration. The majority of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and feces (40.8 and 44.3% respectively). Total mean recovery of radioactivi ty ranged from 80.2 to 95%.  
Overall sulopenem etzadroxil  was well tolerated in the P hase [ADDRESS_324408] common 
adverse events occurring in the program were diarrhea and abnormal urine odor.  Of note, the 
incidence of loose stools/diarrhea was significantly lower in patients dosed with food.  
Oral sulopenem was safe and well -tolerated across the Phase 3 program in patients with uUTI 
(Study IT001- 301), cUTI (Study IT001- 302), and cIAI (IT001- 303) (see details for individual 
studies above).

Preclinical data  
In non- clinical evaluations of intravenous administration of sulopenem , the NOAEL in the 
2-week toxicity study in rats was 200  mg/kg with extrapolated AUC (0-tlast)  of 50 µg•h/mL.  The 
NOAEL was based on increases in kidney and liver weights, erythema, and salivation at 800 mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in the 4 -week toxicity studies in rats and monkeys were both 60 mg/kg.  In rats, 
the NOAEL was based on a slight decrease in RBC parameters and increases in liver, kidney, 
and cecum weights at ≥ 60 mg/kg.  In monkeys, the NOAEL was based on a decrease in RBC 
parameters and increased bilirubin at 200  mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in the 3 -month studies were 120 mg/kg in the rat; AUC
(0-tlast)  of 29.2  ug•hr/mL 
(AUC (0-tlast)  represents 0 -2 h), and 60  mg/kg in the monkey; AUC (0-tlast)  of 49.2  ug•hr/mL; 
(AUC (0-tlast)  represents 0 -8 h).  The NOAEL in rats was based on adverse effects on body weight 
and food consumption, and slight decreases in RBC parameters at 600 mg/k g.  The NOAEL in 
monkeys was based on a positive Direct Coombs test result, decreases in RBC parameters, 
increased bilirubin, moribundity in 2 animals, bone marrow hyperplasia, and soft stools at 
200 mg/kg.  
No change in heart rate or QTc was observed in a single -dose cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in anesthetized dogs up to 300 mg/kg, yielding an average blood level of 
258 µg/mL (total). Similarly, no change in heart rate or QTc was observed in the cardiovascular 
study in telemetry -implanted monkeys at 1000  mg/kg, yielding a blood concentration of 
2270 µg/mL (total).    IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Previou s human experience 
In healthy adults, intravenous sulopenem doses up to 1000 mg BID were studied in 3 small 
Phase  1 studies (two in Japan and one in the US) [ Foulds 1991] in the early 1990’s; sulopenem 
was well tolerated.  The mean C max and AUC inf were 61.5  µg/mL and 51.9 µg•h/mL, 
respectively for a single 1000 mg dose infused over 30 minutes in the Japanese study.  The mean 
Cmax and AUC inf were 69.8  µg/mL and 54.1  µg•h/mL, respectively, for a single 1000 mg dose 
infused over 10  minutes in the US study.  
Doses of 400 mg, 800 mg,  1600 mg, 2400 mg and 2800 mg of IV sulopenem  were evaluated in a 
single dose ascending study, and doses of 800 mg infused over 3 hours, 1200 mg infused over 1 
hour, 1200 mg infused over 2.5 hours, 1600 mg infused over 1.5 hours for 14 days and 2000 mg 
infused over 1.5 hours for 7 days were evaluated in a multiple dose study in healthy volunteers (8 
subjects in each dose group). There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) in either study. One subject who received 1200 mg IV BID was discontinued on Day 4 from study drug 
therapy due to an adverse event (AE) of mildly increased troponin (0.107 ng/mL [normal limit <0.04 ng/mL]); the AE was reported to be resolved on Day 8. The most frequently reported AEs 
were gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting) . Severe AEs included nausea and vomiting and 
were reported only in the highest dose groups (>2000 mg), indicating that MTD had been 
reached. All AEs in the lower dose groups (<2000 mg) were considered mild to moderate in 
severity. No clinical laboratory abnormalities occurred that were considered to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093]. There were no vital signs or ECG changes (including QTc 
interval changes) of clinical concern.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose proportional increase in C
max and AUC last. The mean 
t ½ remained constant over the dose range. Following a 1-hour intravenous infusion, all doses 
higher than 400 mg produced mean concentrations above 1.0 μg/mL for > 3.3 hours, allowing for a twice daily dosing and potentially a single daily dose with a longer infusion duration.

importance of resistance more evident than among agents of the ß- lactam  family.  
For Escherichia coli , ampi[INVESTIGATOR_104514] ≥50% in high -risk populations, and 
resistance to third generation ceph alosporins is now being seen in certain  areas. Only through the 
recognition of factors associated with increasing resistance and the  mechanisms responsible can 
strategies be designed for minimizing ß- lactam resistance. Quinolone resistance and resistance t o 
trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole among Escherichia coli  is now > 20% in the [LOCATION_002] ; 
likewise, nitrofurantoin resistance among Enterobacterales is near or above 20% .   
As antibiotic resistance leads to increased costs of treatment, increased morbidity as well as  
increased mortality, there is an unmet urgent medical need for antimicrobial agents that can  be 
utilized in serious hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104515], especially agents that can be delivered 
orally. 
The penems are considered to exhibit  advantages to the ß- lactam class as they possess good  
antibacterial activity against pneumococci and G ram-negative pathogens commonly responsible 
for a wide range of community and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266490]  ß-lactamases.  
Sulopenem has in v itro activity against many common hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104517], including  extended 
spectrum ß -lactamase (ESBL) producing , and/or quinolone non-susceptible gram -negative 
pathogens (except  Pseudomonas spp., and some other non- lactose fermenting gram -negat ive 
rods), and anaerobes.  
Rationale for probenecid  
Probenecid is known to increase plasma levels of weak organic acids such as penicillins, 
cephalosporins, and other β -lactam antibiotics, including penems, by [CONTACT_259489].   Probenecid has been used safely with other β -lactam antibiotics, to 
either reduce dose or dosing frequency of β beta- lactams when used to treat infectious diseases in 
human beings.   
Probenecid has been shown in an animal dog model to increase the systemic exposure of a 
penem CP -65,207 ( sulopenem is the S -isomer of CP -65,207) by [CONTACT_2902] 2- fold, suggesting a role 
of active renal tubular secretion in drug elimination. Findings from a previous clinical pharmacokinetic study indicate that renal clearance accounts for a significant proportion 
(approximately 50%) of total clearance of sulopenem in healthy volunteers suggesting that 
probenecid could increase exposure and thus time over MIC for sulopenem .    
In a previous Phase 1 study (A8811007), the use of  [ADDRESS_324412] on the PK of sulopenem.   While the sulopenem AUC was significantly 
higher for the 1000 mg probenecid administration, the %T
free >MIC was very similar, as 
anticipated, suggesting that the 500 mg of probenecid may provide sufficient extension of 
circulating sulopenem to achieve the PKPD objectives.  The combination of  oral sulopenem 
etzadro xil 500 mg and probenecid 500 mg was evaluated in a  recently completed  study, IT001-
101. R esults from this study were consistent with those observed in previous studies.  
Thus, probenecid has the potential to be used as a PK booster with sulopenem etzadroxil , 
optimizing the time over MIC for any given sulopenem dose while minimizing the 
gastrointestinal exposure  of the parent compound and subsequent gastrointestinal adverse events 
such as diarrhea.   IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Rationale for dosing with food  
In a multiple dose (A8811003) study, at higher doses of oral sulopenem etzadroxil , there was  a 
higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms especially diarrhea in a fasted state.  It has therefore 
been postulated that if the fraction of sulopenem etzadroxil  absorbed and bioavailability of 
sulopenem ( CP-70,429, the active moiety) can be increased, the gastrointestinal toleration and 
pharmacokinetics of the compound can be improved.  
In Study A8811008 there was an increase in relative bioavailability of sulopenem when oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil  was administered in the fed state (~82% increase in mean AUC).  In Study 
IT001-101, oral sulopenem etzadroxil  was evaluated in a fasted and fed state at a dose of 500 mg 
BID. Results from this study indicate that food signif icantly increases bioavailability of 
sulopenem and consequently results in decreased rates of diarrhea.  Therefore, dosing of oral 
sulopenem- etzadroxil with food whenever possible is recommended.  Since adequate target 
attainment appears to be achieved in t he fasted state, an inability to administer the dose with food 
should not preclude dosing.  
1.2.3 Dose Rationale  
Sulopenem etzadroxil  
Doses of oral sulopenem etzadroxil  were chosen by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling using a combination of ( 1) 
modeling (Naïve Pool analysis) of t he sulopenem effect on net change in colony forming units 
(CFU) over 24 hours of clinically relevant organisms in an immunocompetent mouse thigh infection model , (2) defining targets of percent time above the MIC (T>MIC) for sulopenem 
from this mouse model , and ( 3) population PK modeling using nonlinear mixed effects models , 
generated from  clinical data in  multiple oral sulopenem etzadroxil  Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers.  
Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the human population PK parameters for 
sulopenem etzadroxil  and mean pharmacodynamic parameters from murine thigh infection 
model to determine % target achievement (TA) for the selected doses. A %TA of ≥90% was deemed desirable for selecting particular doses. The 500 mg dose of oral sulopenem etzadroxil  
co-administered with 500 mg of probenecid administered twice daily meets the criteria of

5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Allocation to Treatment 
This is a randomized , double-blind, double dummy, controlled study comparing oral sulopenem 
with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  in the treatment of uUTI.  Approxima tely 1966 patients will be 
randomized to receive either oral sulopenem twice daily for 5 days or oral 
amoxicillin/clavulanate  twice daily for 5 days in a 1:[ADDRESS_324422] the IWRS  to obtain the 
study treatment assignment and dispense therapy accordingly. The IWRS will associate that patient with the next available treatment on the randomization schedule.  The IWRS will then 
give the investigative site information which corresponds to study medication tha t has been 
previously shipped to the site and is in the site’s inventory ready to be dispensed. A patient is considered randomized when the site personnel  receive the treatment assignment associated with 
the patient entered into the IWRS.

All supplies packed and labeled will be formally released in accordance with both Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
5.2.2 Preparation and Dispensing 
All kits  of study drug will be pr ovided to the study site by [CONTACT_266522]. Dispensing of 
study medication will be done and documented in accordance with the treatment schedule as 
outlined in the study protocol.  Written dispensing instructions will be provided to each study site 
in a study pharmacy manual.     
5.2.3 Administration  
Patients  randomized to the sulopenem treatment group will take one sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid tablet  and one  placebo capsule twice daily for 5 days and those 
randomized to the amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment group  will take one over -encapsulated 
amoxicillin/clavulanate tablet and  one placebo tablet  twice daily  for 5 days  (10 doses total over a 
5-day period; if Dose 1 is taken in the evening of Day 1, Dose 10 will be taken in the morning of 
Day 6) . The first dose of  each medication will be administered under the supervision of study 
site personnel  to help ensure compliance with dosing directions . 
Study drug administration will be documented in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual.  
Dosing with food:   
Food significantly increases bioavailability of sulopenem and consequently results in decreased 
rates of diarrhea. Therefore, dosing of oral sulopenem  with food whenever possible is 
recommended.  Since adequate target attainment appears to be achieved in the fasted state, an 
inability to administer the dose with food should not preclude dosing.  
Amoxicillin and clavulanate are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral 
administration. Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics  of 
amoxicillin. While amoxicillin/clavulanate can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. Therefore, dosing of oral 
amoxicillin/clavulanate with food whenever possible is al so recommended.  
5.2.4 Compliance 
All patients  should be informed that compliance with taking all oral medication as instructed is 
imperative.  
Patients  will be asked to bring all study medication containers  (used and unused) to the next 
scheduled study visit for drug accountability. The total amount of oral dosing completed 
(determined by [CONTACT_266523] ) will be recorded in the 
IWRS /EDC systems .  
A study- specific diary will be provided to every patient to capture compliance with study 
medications.  
A urine sample will be collected and frozen at the Day 5 visit which can be used to confi rm 
compliance, safety , or efficacy asses sments . IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Concomitant Medication(s), Adjunctive Therapy, and Non -drug Therapy  
5.4.1 Concomitant Medications  
Any medication taken by [CONTACT_266524], other than study drug, is considered 
concomitant medication.  All concomitant medications from Baseline (Day  1) through the Fina l 
Visit must be recorded in the patient's source record and on the C ase Report F orm (CRF) . 
At each visit, the investigator/site designee  will obtain information on any therapeutic 
interventions (e.g.,  drug therapy, surgery, etc .) provided.  The use of any other investigational 
drug is prohibited, and patients may not participate in any other studies involving marketed 
products concomitantly while in this study.   
The use of other (non- antibacterial) medications should be limited to those essential for the care 
of the patient.  All medications required by [CONTACT_104564] , and any 
drugs that may be required for emergency treatments , must be recorded on the CRF .  Of note, the 
use of medications to alleviate UTI symptoms (such as analgesics  [e.g., non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], paracetamol  etc.], phenazopyridine or cranberry products) is 
prohibited until after the Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  visit. 
5.4.2 Adjunctive Systemic Antibiotics (Rescue  Therapy) 
In general, adjunctive systemic antibiotics are not allowed  for patients  enrolled in the study.  At 
any time during the study period, and at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI), 
additional antibiotics —oral or IV, as appropriate —can be prescribed as rescue therapy, e.g., in 
the event of worsening signs and symptoms of uUTI, or if the patient develops fever and/or flank pain suggestive of upper urinary tract involvement.  In the event that rescue therapy is prescribed, 
patient symptoms will be collected as an unscheduled event; such patients will be considered as failures  and will be asked to still complete all  protocol- specified assessments  through the F inal 
Visit.  Use of adjunctive antibiotics without clinical symptoms is strongly discouraged.  
5.4.3 Additional Non- Study Therapy Antibiotics  
Concomitant systemic antibacterials are prohibited durin g the study, up to the Day 28 (± 2 days) 
visit, with the following exceptions:  IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

7.1.1 Physical Examination  
A targeted physical examination will be performed at Baseline (including general appearance, 
examination of heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities).  A targeted physical exam may be 
conducted at any visit to address patient’s symptoms if needed  (as determined by [CONTACT_1275]). 
7.1.2 Vital Signs ( Temperature, Blood Pressure, Pulse  Rate, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_259477])  
Vital signs are performed at Baseline, Day 5 (+ 1 day) , Day 1 2 (± 1 day)/TOC , or P remature 
Discontinuation. Blood pressure will be measured and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  All blood pressure 
measurements should be taken at rest .  The same size blood pressure cuff should be used to 
measure blood pressure each time.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate are to be obtained first.  Temperature may  be 
measured as an oral, rectal, tympanic (ear) or temporal temperature.

For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious AE  
(SAE) requiring immediate notification to Iterum Therapeutics ’ designated pharmacovigilance

8.2 
Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be collected from the time that the patient provides informed consent 
through the Day  28 (± 2 days) ( Final Visit) .  
For SAEs, the reporti ng period to Iterum Therapeutics ’ designated pharmacovigilance provider 
(Medpace Safety)  begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., prior to undergoing any study-
related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through the Final Visit.  Any SAE 
occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship 
to investigational product is suspected.  
All AEs should be recorded on the CRF if they occur from the time the patient provides 
informed consent through Final Visit.

the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.   
An event would be considered as adequately captured in the study endpoint if it is accurately and 
fully represented by a protocol -defined reason for clinical failure (other than mortality) or 
relapse.  Such an event should not be reported as an adverse event unless it is a serious adverse 
event as defined in this protocol.   
Events represented by [CONTACT_1758] e ndpoints, which would not be considered AEs,  include all of 
the following:

Such medically important events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.

• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work- up of persistent pre -

• Social admission (e.g., patient has no place to sleep);

Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as an AE.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if i t meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting

Confidential Page 51 of 84 8.7 Severity Assessment  
The investigator will  use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the 
maximum intensity of the AE.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as 
follows: 
• MILD :  Does not interfere with the patient's usual function.  
• MODERATE :  Interferes to so me extent with the patient's usual function.  
• SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with the patient's usual function.   
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with patient 's usual function) but would not be classifi ed as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.  
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that  the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by 
[CONTACT_1034] (see Section  8.12 on Reporting Requirements).  If the investigator's causality 
assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly documented on study records.  Specifically, the investigator will choose whether the AE is unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related or probably related to the investigational product.  
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and r eport such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, 
if applicable.  
The Investigator will assess causal ity of the event in relation to study drugs  based on the 
following defined criteria:  
• UNRELATED: No relationship between the event  and medicinal product  
• UNLIKELY: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible); Disease or other drugs provide plausible 
explanations 
• POSSIBLY : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake; Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]; Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
• PROBABLY : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intak e; Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs; Response to withdrawal clinically 
reasonable; Rechallenge not required  IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Confidential Page 52 of 84 8.9 Exposure during Pregnancy  
For investigational products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (also 
referred to as exposure in-utero [EIU]) occurs if:  
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly 
exposed to (e.g., environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the female becomes, 
or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to the 
investigational product (maternal exposure);  
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental exposure, to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of his partner’s conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure).  
If any study patient or study patient’s partner becomes  or is found to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product,  no further study drugs  should be 
given, and the investigator must  submit this information to Iterum Therapeutics ’ designated 
pharmacovigilance provider (Medpace Safety)  on a Pregnancy Form.   
This reporting must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hour s of 
awareness of the pregnancy.  The in formation submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
Follow- up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Pregnancy  reports with 
an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until reporting of birth or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then notify Iterum  of the outcome.  The 
investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Pregnancy  Form.  The 
reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  A  Pregnancy report is not created when 
an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable.  Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
(i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before a 
Pregnancy  Form can be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by 
[CONTACT_4692], unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontane ous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_324434] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the investigator  assesses 
as possibly related to the exposure during pregnancy to the investigational medication should be reported.  
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by [CONTACT_093].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes w ill be handled on a case-by- case basis IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

exposure, the investigator must obtain permission from the patient’s partner in order to conduct 
any follow -up or collect  any information.  
8.10 Discontinuation from Study Drug Due to AEs (See also Patient Withdrawal, 
Section 6.5) 
Discontinuation from study drug due to an AE should be distinguished from discontinuation due 
to insufficient response, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate AE CRF page.   
When a patient discontinues study drug due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.

expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.  
8.12.1  SAE Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE or exposure during pregnancy occurs, Iterum Therapeutics ’ designated 
pharmacovigilance provider  (Medpace Safety ) is to be notified within 24  hours of awareness of 
the event by [CONTACT_266529]. When the form in 
EDC is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified electronically by [CONTACT_266530]. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the 
EDC system, send an email to Medpace Safety at  medpace- [EMAIL_5161]  or 
call the Medpace SAE reporting line (phone number listed below), and fax/email the completed 
paper SAE form to Medpace within [ADDRESS_324436] be made 
immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event  information.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE repor ts as well 
as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Pregnancy cases.   
In the rare instance that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hour s after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs and  pregnancies , the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to 
Iterum in accordance w ith the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The study is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem is NI to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  
for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and microbiol ogic success) at 
Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  in both the micro -MITT and micro -MITTS populations and whether oral 
sulopenem is superior to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  for overall success at Day 12 (± 1 
day)/TOC  in the micro -MITTR population.  The primary outcome m easure of overall success 
(combined clinical  and microbiologic success) is defined as resolution of the symptoms of uUTI 
present at trial entry (and no new symptoms), and the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen 
found at trial entry is reduced to <103 CFU/mL on urine culture (microbiological success 
[eradication] ). 
The proposed sample size  in the micro -MITTS population is 505 patients per arm  (total of 1010 
patients)  based on the method of Farrington and Manning. This assumes a non- inferiority margin 
of 10.0 %, a power of 90%, a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 , 60% overall  success  rate with 
amoxicillin/clavulanate and 6 0% overall rate with sulopenem etzadroxil/probeneci d.  Assuming 
that 21% of the patients will have non-susceptible pathogens and assuming 85% power to show 
superiority in the micro -MITTR population (micro -MITT=1278 patients ), 67% of the 
randomized patients will meet criteria for inclusion into the micro -MITT population 
(MITT= 1907 patients) and allowing for a dropout rate of 3%, the sample size for the ITT 
population is 1966. With [ADDRESS_324437] 85% power to show superiority at the one- sided 2.5% alpha level  given a 51% and 
33% overall success rate in the oral sulopenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate  groups, respectively.

9.2 Definition of Analysis Populations  
1. Intent -to-Treat ( ITT): all randomized patients  regardless of whether or not the patient 
received study drug  
2. Modified ITT (MITT) : randomized patients who received at least a single  dose of study 
medication . Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized. 
3. Safety : randomized patients who received at least a single  dose of study medication . 
Patients will be analyzed accordin g to the treatment that they received.  
4. Micro -MITT : All MITT patients with a positive study entry urine culture defined as 
≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen (Enterobacterales  or Staphylococcus saprophyticus only) 
and no more than 2 species of microorganisms identified in the study entry urine culture, 
regardless of colony count.  
5. Micro- MITTS : All micro -MITT patients with a baseline uropathogen susceptible 
(defined as MIC < 8/4 mg/L) to the comparator drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate , and no 
baseline pathogen non- susceptible  to amoxicillin/clavulanate . 
6. Micro -MITTR : All micro -MITT patients with a baseline uropathogen non-susceptible

amoxicillin/clavulanate . 
7. Clinically Evaluable: Clinically E valuable (CE) at the Day 5 (+1 day) , Day 12 (±1 
day)/TOC , and Day 28  (±2 days)  visits population :  
All patients who were included in the MITT population and:  
a) Received a minimum number of days of study drug (to be defined in the SAP)

and the Day 5 (+1 day)  or Day 12 (±1 day) /TOC  culture, respectively.  This excludes 
the protocol defined study therapy and patients who were considered clinical failures 
and required additional rescue antibiotic therapy.  Patients with a coinfection with a 
gram -positive uropathogen resistant to study drugs are allowed to receive agents with 
narrow spectrum g ram-positive coverage ( i.e., such as oral linezolid) .

Enrollment, protocol deviations, discontinuations from the study drug and w ithdrawal from the 
study will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Demographics (age, race, sex), medical history , 
baseline assessment of the symptoms of uUTI , microbiological assessment of the urine , and 
study drug administration will also be summarized.   
9.5 Efficacy Analysis  
For all efficacy analyses, patient data will be analyzed in the treatment group to which the patient 
was randomized.   
9.5.1 Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary efficacy outcome is overall success  (combined clinical and microbiologi c success ) 
at Day 12 ( ± 1 day) /TOC  in the micro -MITT, micro -MITTS and micro- MITTR populations .  
Patients will be programmatically categorized as a success , failure , or indeterminate based on 
data in the eCRF and from the microbiology lab.  Patients with missing data or who are lost to 
follow- up are defined as indet erminate for the primary analyses and are included in the 
denominator for the calculation of the success  rate. The number and percentage of patients with 
success , failure  and indeterminate  response will be determined in each treatment group  in the 
micro -MITT, micro -MITTS and micro- MITTR populations .  
The primary comparison of the study is in the micro- MITT population ( the combined population 
of patients with a positive bas eline culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate 
susceptibility). These outcomes are most relevant to the practicing clinician who must choose empi[INVESTIGATOR_266486]. From a regulatory 
perspective, thes e results will help put into context the outcomes in the culture and susceptibility- 
driven subpopulations.  
The primary comparisons for regulatory approval are in two mutually exclusive sub -populations 
of the micro -MITT population defined by a baseline characteristic , the micro -MITTS and micro -
MITTR populations.  
To control for inflation of the  overall type I error rate, the hierarchical testing procedure of 
Westfall and Krishen (Westfall 2001) will be used to test the hypotheses of the primary efficacy IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

next comparison, only in the case where the null hypothesis in the previous comparison was 
rejected. When testing in a sequential manner with pre- planned testing,  no adjustment to the 
alpha level is required : 
(1) NI in the micro -MITT population .  For this population, a NI test of the overall success rate 
will be conducted.  The null and alternative hypotheses are the following:  
∆ − ≤ −2 1 0 : p p H  and ∆ − > −2 1 : p p HA , 
where p 1 is the primary efficacy outcome rate in the oral sulopenem group, p 2 is the primary 
efficacy outcome rate in the amoxicillin/clavulanate  group, and Δ is the non- inferiority margin of 
10.0%.  
The NI hypothesis test is a 1- sided hypothesis test performed at the 2.5% level of significance.  
This is based on the lower limit of the 2- sided 95% CI for the observed difference in the overall 
success rate ( oral sulopenem group minus amoxicillin/clavulanate  group).  The primary analysis  
is based on the CI computed using the method proposed without stratification by [CONTACT_240865], which corresponds to the p- value approach of the Farrington- Manning test.  If the 
lower limit of the 95% CI for difference in success rates in the micr o-MITT population is greater 
than -10.0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the NI of oral sulopenem to 
amoxicillin/clavulanate  will be concluded.  
 (2) NI the micro -MITTS population OR superiority in the micro- MITTR population as 
described below: 
Micro-MITTS population: the subset of the micro- MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be susceptible to the comparator study drug, amoxicillin/clavulanate. For this population, a NI test of the overall success rate will be conducted. The null and 
alternative hypotheses are as follows:  
∆ − ≤ −2 1 0 : p p H  and ∆ − > −2 1 : p p HA  
A 2-sided 95% CI for the o bserved treatment difference in success rates will be determined. If 
the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than - 10.0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and 
the NI of oral sulopenem to amoxicillin/clavulanate in the micro -MITTS population will be 
concluded. 
Micro-MITTR population: the subset of the micro- MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be non-susceptible to the comparator study drug, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate . For this population, a superiority test will be conducted.  The null and 
alternative hypotheses are as follows:  
2 1 0 : p p H= and 2 1 : p p HA≠ 
A 2-sided 95% CI for the o bserved treatment difference in success rates will be determined using 
the method without stratification of Miettinen and Nurminen.  If the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than 0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and super iority of oral sulopenem to 
amoxicillin/clavulanate  will be concluded in the micro -MITTR population. IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Confidential Page 61 of 84 response data at Day 12 (± 1 day) /TOC  are available for approximately 50 % of the patients 
(approximately 983 patients ).  The FDA Guidance “Non -inferiority Clinical Trials” [ FDA 
Guidance 2016] notes that such a sample size re- estimation if based on the blinded overall 
response rates is not only acceptable but is advisable.  The interim analysis will involve a 
sample size re- estimatio n to either confirm the initial sample size estimate is adequate or 
increase the sample size (number of randomized patients) to ensure the study has adequate power . The sample size of the study will be computed to ensure that there is sufficient power 
for determining whether oral sulopenem is NI to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  for the primary 
outcome measure in the micro -MITTS population. This will ensure that the study is sufficiently 
powered to test the primary endpoint in the micro- MITT and micro -MITTR p opulations as 
well. The sample size will not be decreased.   In addition, the sample size may be increased 
based on a lower -than-expected  evaluability rate  (i.e., percentage of the ITT population in the 
micro -MITT population) , higher- than-expected  rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria  or lower than 
expected percentage of patient s with a susceptible pathogen. The sample size re- estimation will 
be based on the blinded overall (not by [CONTACT_1570]) pooled data . 
The blinded interim analys is will proceed as follow s: 
1. Determine the percentage of patients with a baseline pathogen (micro -MITT population)  
2. Determine the percentage of patients with a susceptible (to comparator study drug , 
amoxicillin/clavulanate ) pathogen (micro- MITTS population) and a non-susceptible (to 
amoxicillin/clavulanate ) pathogen (micro -MITTR population)  
3. Determine the overall success rate and overall rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria 
aggregated across treatment groups in the micro -MITTS population  
4. Determine if there is sufficient power (80 -90%) in the micro- MITTS to show NI with 
the planned sample size based on the observed aggregated (across treatment groups) 
overall success rate and overall rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria  
a. If NO, then increase the sample size in the micro -MITTS population to have 
sufficient power, up to a maximum number of 2500 patients.  
5.  If the aggregated overall success rate in the micro -MITTS population is higher than 
70%, or if the aggregated rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria  is significantly lower than 
anticipated, then a futility analysis may be conducted by [CONTACT_266535]. Further details of how the DMC will decide to do the futility analysis, 
how the sponsor will be involved and how the analysis will be conducted will be 
provided in the SAP and the DMC charter .

and microbiological response (secondary) is missing at the Day 12 (±1 day) /TOC  (primary) and 
Day 28 (±2 days)  (secondary) visit, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response. 
By [CONTACT_108], patients with an indeterminate r esponse are included in the denominator in the

and secondary analyses. Additional sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be

Confidential Page 69 of 84 APPENDIX 1     RATIONALE FOR AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANATE AS 
COMPARATOR IN UNCOMPLICATED UTI TRIAL  
Amoxicillin/clavulanate is an oral antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic 
antibiotic amoxicillin and the β -lactamase inhibitor, clavulanate ( the potassium salt of clavulanic 
acid). The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid protects amoxicillin from degradation 
by β-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include 
many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other β -lactam antibiotics. 
Amoxicillin/clavulanate has activity against gram- positive and gram -negative aerobes and 
anaerobes, including the following Enterobacterales responsible for the majority of cases of uUTI: E. coli , Klebsiella species, and Proteus  mirabilis . FDA- approved indications for 
amoxicillin/clavulanate include treatment of urinary tract infections, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], otitis media, sinusitis, and skin and skin structure infections  [Augmentin USPI] . 
Amoxicillin/clavulanate is also approved in Europe for the treatment of UTI and is still the most prescribed antimicrobial (in 26.5% of the cases) to treat community -onset UTI  in some European 
countries [ Martinez- Casanova 2021].  
Amoxicillin/clavulanate  was chosen as the comparator for Study IT001-[ADDRESS_324459] infection [Augmentin USPI],  it is 
considered as a treatment option for acute uUTI in the IDSA Treatment Guideline [ Gupta 2011 ], 
and as a β -lactam antibiotic, it is likely to have a similar effect to sulopenem on the female 
urogenital microbiome, thus allowing for a fair comparison of efficacy.  The dose of 
amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg PO twice daily) was chosen to justify the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate CLSI breakpoints  for uncomplicated urinary tract infection ( M100 
Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 32
nd edition ).    
1. Per the approved label [Augmentin USPI], amoxicillin/clavulanate is an approved antibiotic 
for the indication of urinary t ract infection.  
‘Indication:  
Urinary Tract Infections – caused by β -lactamase–producing strains of E. coli, 
Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp.  
While AUGMENTIN is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by [CONTACT_266540][INVESTIGATOR_10312] -susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with AUGMENTIN 
due to its amoxicillin content; therefore, mixed infections caused by [CONTACT_266540][INVESTIGATOR_10312] -
susceptible organisms and β -lactamase–producing organisms susceptible to 
AUGMENTIN should not require the addition of another antibiotic.’  
 
‘Dosage Adults: The usual adult dose is one [ADDRESS_324460], the dose should be one 875 -mg tablet of 
AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500 -mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.’   
 Based on the Guidance for “Non- inferiority clinical trials to establish effectiveness” 
amoxicillin/clavulanate is therefore an approved agent to use as a comparator in a noninferiority 
trial for patients with urinary tract infection.  
2. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is listed as a treatment option in the IDSA Treatment Guidelines

Confidential Page 70 of 84 ‘β-Lactam agents, including amoxicillin/clavulanate , cefdinir, Cefaclor, and 
cefpodoxime- proxetil, in 3 -7-day regimens are appropriate choices for therapy when 
other recommended agents cannot be used (B - 1). Other β-lactams, such as cephalexin, 
are less well  studied but may also be appropriate in certain settings (B -III).’  
It is important to understand that the IDSA Treatment Guidelines were last updated in 2010 
(published in 2011). At that time, the authors aimed to balance issues of in vitro  resistance and 
collateral damage (a term describing ecological adverse effects of  antimicrobial therapy, such as 
the selection of drug- resistant  organisms and colonization or infection with multidrug -resistant  
organisms ) when making their recommendations for optimal and alternative treatment options.  
At that time, rising rates of resistance to quinolones and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP -
SMX) had been shown for outpatient urinary isolates 2000-2010 [ Sanchez 2012], and increased 
collateral damage was found to be associated with broad -spectrum  cephalosporins and 
quinolones [ Paterson 2004; Ramphal 2006 ]. As shown in the Table below, pi[INVESTIGATOR_266497], a β -
lactam, had the lowest estimated clinical and microbiological efficacy of all the optimal and 
alternativ e treatment agents in the IDSA Guideline, yet it was listed as an optimal choice given 
its low resistance rates and low propensity to cause collateral damage.  Other β -lactams were 
listed as alternative agents, yet their estimated clinical and microbiologic efficacy was higher 
than pi[INVESTIGATOR_266498], both listed as optimal agents.  High 
resistance rates were noted for β -lactams, specifically ampi[INVESTIGATOR_266499], and high 
propensity to cause collateral damage was noted, specif ically for broad- spectrum cephalosporins.  
Ciprofloxacin had one of the highest efficacy rates observed, an estimated clinical and 
microbiological efficacy of 90% and 91%, respectively, but was listed as an alternative agent due 
to rising resistance rates and its high propensity to cause collateral damage.

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -[ADDRESS_324461] the empi[INVESTIGATOR_266501] -SMX for 
acute cystitis if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis 
exceeded 20%. Due to the resistance rates at the time, a similar recommend ation was not 
made for other agents, but it has since become a common clinical practice to apply this 20% threshold to local resistance data in order to guide empi[INVESTIGATOR_266502].   
 Since the [ADDRESS_324462] exceeded or 
approached the 20% threshold for quinolones and nitrofurantoin, respectively. For  
nitrofurantoin, resistance to E. coli  is approximately 4%, but nitrofurantoin resistance rates 
for Enterobacterales  other than E. coli  are markedly elevated (88 -100% for Proteus mirabilis , 
58-63.0% for Klebsiella  pneumoniae , and approximately 57% for all other Enterobacterales) 
making the empi[INVESTIGATOR_266503] [ Huttner 2018, Zhanel  2021, Dunne 
2022].  
 Rising nitrofurantoin resistance rates are likely a direct consequence of increased 
nitrofurantoin utilization in response to high TMP -SMX and quinolone  resistance rates.  In 
one [LOCATION_008] location, the authors believe that incre ased exposure of E. coli  to 
nitrofurantoin resulted in the emergence of a mutated version of the ESBL CTX -M-14 
enzyme. When this mutated CTX -M-14 enzyme was recombinantly overexpressed in a 
laboratory strain of E. coli , a strain emerged that was hyper -resistant to nitrofurantoin while 
retaining β -lactam resistance [Edowik 2021].  Given that globally CTX -M-14 is one of the 
predominant ESBL types  [Banerjee 2014 ], over time  with continued E. coli  exposure to 
nitrofurantoin , select ion for this nitrofurantoin -resistant mutant is likely [ Le 2021].   
 To add to the complexity, there has been a rapid increase in both the rate of ESBL -producing 
pathogens, and the rate of co- resistance to two or more standard agents [ Critchley 2019, 
Kaye 2021, Dunne 2022 ].   
 Resistanc e rates for amoxicillin/clavulanate are not provided in the IDSA Guidelines.  As 
shown in Table 3 below, based on the results of Study IT001- 301, the expected rate of 
resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate is less than to quinolones and TMP -SMX, and 
comparable to nitrofurantoin. These findings, in conjunction with what is known about clinical response, microbiologic response, and propensity to cause collateral damage for 
uUTI patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate, support the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate 
as a safe and effective comparator in a non -inferiority uUTI trial.

While amoxicillin/clavulanate is listed as a treatment option in the 2011 IDSA Guidelines , 
and the document provides useful historical information to help guide the management of 
patients with suspected and confirm ed acute uncomplicated cystitis, the  Guidelines are 
outdated, not based on efficacy alone,  and cannot be relied upon  to steer  the choice of a 
comparator agent for a non- inferiority trial in uUTI in 2022.     
 A more recent antimicrobial prescribing guideline for lower UTI from the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence published in October 2018 indicates that the efficacy of β -
lactams is not significantly different than that compared to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim -
sulfamethoxa zole or quinolones based on a large meta -analysis of randomized controlled 
trials [ NICE Guideline 2018].  
 
3. Availability of data regarding the degree of asymptomatic bacteriuria:  
 In Study IT001- 301, sulopenem was not non -inferior to ciprofloxacin in patients whose 
baseline uropathogen was susceptible to ciprofloxacin.  The difference in response rates was driven almost exclusively by a greater proportion of asymptomatic patients with the baseline 
uropathogen isolated at the test of cure visit in patients who received sulopenem. The 
presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria a week or more after completing therapy was not 
associated with a higher rate of clinical relapse, making it likely that the presence of 
pathogens in the urine culture was not a reflection of  incomplete eradication of the offending 
baseline organism and more likely due to recolonization of the bladder.   
A possible explanation why asymptomatic bacteriuria would occur sooner post -treatment for 
patients receiving sulopenem than for those receiving ciprofloxacin is that ciprofloxacin has a more significant impact on the vaginal flora than a β-lactam such as sulopenem, and that this 
effect on the vaginal flora affects the rate at which women recolonize the bladder. Similar observations have been made in two previous studies of the treatment of uncomplicated 
urinary tract infection and recently in a mouse model of urinary tract infection [ Hooton 2005, 
Hooton 2012, Brannon 2020]. The area under the curve (AUC) of ciprofloxacin in plasma over 24 hours after a 250 mg bid dose is approximately 9.6 μg • h/mL [Cipro USPI]. An 
AUC
24/MIC of approximately 125 is the ratio required for achieving clinical and 
microbiologic success with ciprofloxacin [ Forrest 1993] and this ratio would be achieved for IT001-310 Protocol Amendment 1 12-5-2022 | VV-TMF-165994 | 1.0

Confidential Page 75 of 84 organisms with an MIC of <0.06 µ g/mL. Consistent with this potential effect, and assuming 
tissue concentrations are equal to plasma, a lower rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria was only 
seen in those ciprofloxacin- treated patients whose baseline uropathogen had an MIC of <0.06 
mg/mL. This effect would be relevant not for organisms residing in the urine as the urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin are significantly higher than plasma, but rather for those 
organisms in the colonizing flora of the perineum and vaginal mucos a, a potential source of 
organisms for recolonization of the bladder [ Thomas- White 2018, Brannon 2020 ].  
 
This concentration dependent effect of ciprofloxacin on the vaginal flora would also carry 
with it the potential for selection of increasingly more re sistant pathogens in the post -
treatment flora. In Study IT001- 301, 35/415 (8.4%) patients without culture evidence of a 
ciprofloxacin resistant pathogen at baseline had a ciprofloxacin resistant pathogen in their 
urine culture post -treatment. More worrisome was that many of these ciprofloxacin resistant 
isolates also carried the blaCTX -M-15 extended spectrum β -lactamase resistance gene, a 
commonly circulating plasmid among E. coli  [Banerjee 2014], making treatment in the future 
with either a quinolone or a β -lactam other than a penem less likely to be successful.  
 
While the antibiotic effect on a woman’s vaginal flora, and subsequently the rate of bladder 
recolonization, is likely a class effect, other host factors and mechanisms may be at play, and 
the association between specific antibiotics and post -treatment asy mptomatic bacteriuria is 
not known. This makes it challenging to confidently choose a comparator in a noninferiority trail, as long as microbiologic outcome remains part of the primary endpoint.  It is reasonable 
to assume that a β -lactam comparator such as amoxicillin/clavulanate will have a similar 
effect to sulopenem on the urogenital microbiome, thus allowing for a fair comparison of efficacy.  Additional data from Study IT001- 302 supports using amoxicillin/clavulanate as 
the comparator.  As shown in  Table 4 below, in Study IT001- 302, a higher incidence of 
asymptomatic bacteriuria was observed in complicated UTI patients receiving sulopenem.  
This difference in the proportion of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria was observed primarily among the patients who had ciprofloxacin- susceptible uropathogens and, per 
protocol, received ciprofloxacin as step -down treatment.  Of the patients who received IV 
sulopenem and stepped down to oral sulopenem, 21.8% failed due to asymptomatic 
bacteriuria at TOC compared to just 4.7% of those who received IV ertapenem and stepped 
down to oral ciprofloxacin.  Of the patients with ciprofloxacin- nonsusceptible uropathogens, 
those in the ertapenem group, depending on their clinical status, either received their entire 
treatment course IV or were stepped down to amoxicillin/ clavulanate.  The rate of 
asymptomatic bacteriuria as the reason for failure among these patients was similar to that of sulopenem patients, supporting the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate as the comparator in our 
planned uncomplicated UTI noninferiority trial.

Source: IT001-[ADDRESS_324463] that efficacy rates for sulopenem in IT001 -302 are consistent with 
those seen for other IV penems in recent cUTI trials where step -down to an oral agent was 
not allowed [ Wagenlehner 2016, Kaye 2018, Wagenlehner 2019]. These approved penems 
have proven to be effective life -saving drugs.  
 In conclusion, amoxicillin/clavulanate is an appropriate comparator for our proposed non-

Method of Collection of Urine Specimens:  
To obtain a clean catch sample of urine from a female patient  and avoid specimen 
contamination , a thorough cleansing of the periurethral area is essential before specimen 
collection. Clean the area with a disinfectant and  make all efforts to avoid any contact [CONTACT_266543]. Urine samples should be collected by [CONTACT_222304]- catch midstream . Details 
of appropriate methodology for urine sample collection, handling, and storage  will be 
provided in the laboratory manual.  
All patients should void the first part of the specimen into the toilet, then collect the 
remainder of the specimen in a sterile  container. Urine samples for routine culture must be 
transported in the urine transport tubes provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
If feasible, urine specimens  should be collected [ADDRESS_324466] void. 
Culture and Susceptibility testing  
All gram -negative path ogens and S. saprophyticus  will be tested by [CONTACT_266544].  
The Central laboratory should retain all isolates until the end of the study, if possible. 
Additional samples for culture may  be requested if the Central laboratory does not receive a 
viable culture.  
Susceptibility results of pathogens to amoxicillin /clavulanate and carbapenems from cultures 
obtained at Screening, EOT, and TOC should not be reported to sites/investigators until after 
the TOC visit, unless requested by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_266493], so as 
not to influence the investigator’s decision to prescribe a rescue antibiotic in the case of presence of a non -susceptible pathogen.  
Organisms considered as pathogens  
For the purpose of this study protocol, the following organisms will always be considered a 
pathogen when isolated from an acceptable urine culture specimen:  
• Monomicrobial or polymicrobial infections caused by:  
• Enterobacterales  
• Enterococci  
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
• S. saprophyticus  
The micro -MITT population for this study will only include patients with uUTI 
caused by [CONTACT_266545]/or S. saprophyticus . 
• Even if the organism was isolated from an acceptable urine culture specimen, the 
following are never a pathogen  for this study: 
• Corynebacterium  spp. 
• S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353]  
• S. aureus

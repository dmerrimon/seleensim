Page 3 of 321.0 Objectives
We will leverage  increasingly available technologies to impart a Universal Medication 
Schedule (UMS) in primary care to help patients living with diabetes safely use and adhere 
to complex drug regimens.  We will conduct a 3-arm, multi-site trial to:
1.1 Specific  Aims:
1. Test  the effectiveness of the UMS, and UMS + SMS text reminder strategies 
compared to usual care.
2. Determine if the effects of these UMS strategies vary by [CONTACT_1962]’ literacy 
skills and language.
3. Using  mixed methods, Evaluate the fidelity of the two strategies and explore 
patient, staff, physician, and health system factors influencing the 
interventions.
4. Assess  the costs required to deliver either intervention from a health system 
perspective.
1.2 Hypotheses: 
1. Compared  to usual care, patients receiving the UMS or UMS+SMS text 
reminder strategies will demonstrate a better understanding of how to safely 
dose their Rx regimen 
2. Compared  to usual care, patients receiving the UMS or UMS+SMS text 
reminder strategies will when possible, take their Rx regimen fewer times per 
day
3. Compared  to usual care, patients receiving the UMS or UMS+SMS text 
reminder strategies will have greater adherence to their Rx regimen
4. Compared  to the UMS only arm, patients receiving the UMS+SMS strategy 
will have greater adherence to their Rx regimen.
5. The  intervention effects will be greater among those with limited literacy and 
English proficiency.
2.0 Background
2.1 The  Challenge of Managing Complex Drug Regimens:
         In ambulatory  care, patients assume primary responsibility for safely and 
appropriately administering R x regimens. Yet the expectations placed on patients by 
[CONTACT_71681]-related tasks are considerable. In order for 
patients to gain the benefits of drug therapy while minimizing risks of adverse drug 
events (ADEs), they must: 1) have a functional understanding of medications and 
their proper dosing, 2) consolidate their regimen to the most efficient daily schedule, 
3) problem-solve around regimen use as changes occur, and 4) continue the behaviors

Page [ADDRESS_77884] decade, the percentage of 
Americans taking ≥ 5 R x drugs daily has doubled to nearly 40% of older adults. While 
long-term adherence is essential to reap health benefits, all forms of non-adherence - 
failure to fill new prescriptions, incomplete use, and premature discontinuation - are 
common.  Non-adherence has been linked to greater morbidity and mortality from 
chronic conditions. Complex drug regimens also raise the risk for errors and ADEs, 
many of which are preventable or ameliorable. Nearly 10 million outpatient physician 
visits and 4 million emergency department admissions are attributed to ADEs or side 
effects annually. These are more likely to occur in primary vs. specialty care, among 
older patients, and those with multi-morbidity. 
The Case  of Type 2 Diabetes. The increasing number of individuals living with type 
2 diabetes (estimated at 10% of the U.S. adult population) must contend with 
extended duration, multi-drug regimens to manage the disease. These regimens often 
require frequent dosage changes and have formidable potential side effects (e.g. 
hypoglycemia) that may intentionally – or unintentionally – distract one from proper 
medication use. Yet these patients are also likely to have comorbid conditions, such 
as hypertension and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_71662], further 
complicating daily R x regimen schedules. In a study of 13,365 type 2 diabetic adults, 
Chen et al. classified 38% as having moderate to major polypharmacy concerns. A 
significant, gradient association was found between increasing polypharmacy and 
higher rates of non-adherence to oral anti-diabetic drugs (measured via refill, 
proportion of days covered).    
Age, Literacy,  and Language as Risk Factors. Older age poses a significant risk 
for medication  safety and adherence concerns. The prevalence of multi-morbidity 
increases with  age; approximately 17% of younger adults ages 20-[ADDRESS_77885] of middle-aged adults (40-59), and 
nearly two  thirds of individuals over [ADDRESS_77886] found limited literacy skills to be significantly associated 
with patients’ poorer recall of medication names and indications, inadequate 
understanding and demonstrated use of R x instructions and precautions.5,6,32-37 Our 
team also  found that patients, especially those with lower literacy, may 
overcomplicate multi-drug regimens by [CONTACT_71682] a day than 
necessary.4 While studies are inconclusive as to whether lower literacy is associated 
with non- adherence,38-41 evidence clearly suggests lower literate patients are more 
likely to misunderstand R x instructions, putting them at greater risk.7,42 
         In addition,  limited English proficiency (LEP) presents a formidable barrier in 
healthcare.43-48  Interpreters are rarely available to aid physicians and pharmacists in

Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page [ADDRESS_77887] on LEP patients’ R x use.53-55 
Wilson et  al. found among 1200 LEP adults, half had difficulties interpreting R x 
instructions and 16% reported an ADE.55 Similarly, Sleath et al. found that 58% of 
LEP adults misinterpret English R x instructions.[ADDRESS_77888] shown 
physicians often  fail to discuss with patients basic information around the safe use of 
prescribed medicines, let alone other relevant concerns (i.e. cost of medications).58-62 
Furthermore, print R x information is  rarely distributed at the point of prescribing. 
Evidence also suggests that pharmacists equally fail to counsel patients on safe and 
appropriate R x use.58,60,61 While print materials (R x labels, warning stickers, 
Medication Guides,  patient leaflets) are provided by [CONTACT_71683], most are poorly 
written and confusing.63-66 In addition, considerable variability has been identified 
across this process.67-69 Bailey  et al. found R x instructions written by [CONTACT_71684];68 Wolf  et al. reviewed R x instructions printed by [CONTACT_71685]’ 
instructions.69 Variable, poor quality physician prescriptions and pharmacy 
translations and  lack of appropriate counseling complicate the task of organizing 
and properly dosing multi-drug regimens.
2.2 An  Evidence-Based Solution: A Universal Medication Schedule:
         The IOM  2008 report Standardizing Medication Labels recognized the need to set 
standards for prescribing and dispensing practices to promote safe and accurate 
medication use.70 Members of our research 
team (Wolf,  Wood) presented the UMS concept 
in this report. As nearly 90% of prescriptions 
are taken [ADDRESS_77889] 
time intervals (morning, noon, evening, 
bedtime) for the prescribing and dispensing of 
medicine. This would remove current 
variability in the way prescriptions are written 
by [CONTACT_71686].67-[ADDRESS_77890] patients to  take their medicine at one or 
more of these specified times; this would be described in a single, standardized 
fashion (Figure 1). UMS instructions also use health literacy best practices, like 
simplified text, numeric characters instead of words to detail dose (1 instead of ‘one’), 
and carriage returns (placing each dose on a separate line) to clearly identify every 
time a medicine is to be taken.4

Page [ADDRESS_77891] were 33% more likely to accurately interpret R x instructions.[ADDRESS_77892] 
in pharmacy practice [R01HS017687; R01HS016435]. [ADDRESS_77893] modeled after a leading national pharmacy chain (no orientation to 
UMS provided). Over 9 months, English and Spanish-speaking patients improved 
their proper use of multi-drug regimens (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.02-3.85) and had a near 
2-fold increased adherence rate measured by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692] (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.98). 
Exploratory analyses found a non-significant trend for glycemic control (tight control 
(HbA1c <7.0%: 56% (UMS) vs. 46% (Standard), p=0.15). As with prior studies, 
these benefits were greatest for lower literate adults and those taking >5 R x drugs. 
The IOM has repeatedly highlighted the UMS; the US Pharmacopeia, American 
College of Physicians and National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
recommend it as a standard; and [LOCATION_004] passed legislation in [ADDRESS_77894] of 
Pharmacy.70,80,81 
2.3 Shifting  Upstream: Implementing the UMS at Prescribing vs. Dispensing 
Medication:
The above  AHRQ/NIH-funded trials revealed several obstacles: 1) over half of 
patients routinely use multiple pharmacies resulting in their continued receipt of 
variable R x label instructions, 2) imparting the UMS only on drug labels was not a 
sufficient signal to patients to consolidate multi-drug regimens, 3) patients need 
comprehensive views of the UMS applied to their entire R x regimen vs. individual R x 
labels only, and 4) additional reminders may be beneficial to reinforce UMS 
prescribing after medical encounters, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_71663], and support adherence. Both pharmacy and patients expressed a need for 
improved, plain language R x information that provides general knowledge to support 
safe R x use. Our proposal is based on evidence from the field, extensive experience 
with EHRs, mobile technology, and funded development work [R18HS17220, 
R21CA132771, R01NR011300, R01NR012745, U19HS021093, [LOCATION_004] 
Endowment, [LOCATION_004] Healthcare Foundation]. We will shift the implementation of 
the UMS to primary care, leveraging technologies that are increasingly prevalent per 
federal mandates (Health  Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health

Page 7 of 32(HITECH) Act), particularly  among community health centers.82 We respond to the 
Office of the  National Coordinator ‘Meaningful Use’ criteria by [CONTACT_71687], patient-centered information supporting safe R x use.83 
2.4 Leveraging  Increasingly Available Technologies to Support Medication Use:
Technological solutions  are increasingly available that can be leveraged to help 
patients learn how to safely and appropriately take prescribed drugs that are not cost-
prohibitive, such as EHRs and SMS text messaging.82,84-86
‘Meaningful Use’  of EHRs. Now in the second stage of the Office of the National 
Coordinator (ONC) ‘Meaningful Use’ criteria that establishes incentives and 
directives for leveraging EHRs in practice, the proposed UMS interventions are 
directly responsive to the upcoming third stage criteria (2016) that seek ways that 
physician practices  can use their EHR to improve: 1) quality, safety, and efficiency 
leading to improved health outcomes, and 2) patient access to self-management tools.83  
Our team  has successfully field tested the UMS strategy at two academic centers 
using different EHR platforms (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457]: R18HS17220, R21CA132771; Cerner: 
U19HS021093).84 This included: 1) UMS-mapped standard physician instructions 
(a.k.a. ‘sigs’)  that were e-prescribed to pharmacies (Epic only), 2) plain language 
medication information sheets (‘MedSheets’) incorporating the UMS sig given to 
patients upon checkout, and 3) a redesigned EHR medication list (‘MedList’) that 
organized a patient’s entire R x regimen according to UMS intervals (Cerner only). 
All of these tools were co-developed by [CONTACT_13922], nurse practitioners, nurses, and 
clinic administrative staff to ensure all would not negatively impact clinic workflow 
and efficiency. The intervention includes UMS sigs and decision support tools for 
asthma, which have been developed, vetted by [CONTACT_39487], and successfully pi[INVESTIGATOR_71664]. Sinai.
Mobile Technologies  to Promote Health Behavior Change. While EHRs can be 
leveraged to provide tools to support appropriate medication use in primary care, 
additional measures may be necessary to promote safe medication use outside of 
healthcare settings.84,[ADDRESS_77895] 
been used  to provide health-centered messages to patients in their daily lives.88-91 
Recent estimates  indicate mobile technologies are useful tools for reaching low-
income populations and racial/ethnic minorities; 92% of African-American and 
Latino adults own cell phones.92 Text messaging capabilities are also commonly 
used; 81%  of cell phone users send or receive text messages.92 While use of this 
technology is  more common among younger adults, the number of older adult cell 
phone (even smart phone and tablet) users is increasing exponentially (89% ages 50-
64; 77% ≥65),  including those who actively receive and send text messages.[ADDRESS_77896] evaluated text messaging as a means to change behavior.87,88,93 
Cole-Lewis &  Kershaw evaluated 12 interventions that utilized text messaging as a 
platform for disease management or prevention.88 Eight studies reported positive 
changes in  among individuals receiving text messages for outcomes including weight

Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page 9 of 325.1 Both Mount  Sinai and Northwestern will follow similar recruitment methods.  The 
general strategy for recruitment is described here, and a more detailed description of 
the recruitment methods specific to Northwestern are detailed in section 22.0.  
At both sites, potential  participants will be identified through reports generated by 
[CONTACT_71691] (EDW).  Study staff will review the charts of 
identified patients to confirm eligibility that cannot be ascertained via the EDW.  
Among the remaining eligible patients, physician consent will be obtained to contact 
[CONTACT_71692].  Research staff will mail patients a letter 
informing them of the study with the option to opt out via a toll-free number (see 
Recruitment Letter).  Seven days after the initial mailing, a Research Coordinator will 
contact [CONTACT_66919].  Eligibility of patients will be determined from 
screening questions administered at this time (see Screener).  
6.[ADDRESS_77899].  Mt. Sinai is the second 
site of this study (Mt. Sinai Medical Center (MSMC)).  Study personnel (specific 
names and training discussed in sections 9.4 and 20.1) will follow identical 
procedures to those described in the Northwestern protocol and in-person recruitment 
procedure in section 22.1.  The Mt. Sinai approval letter is included in the IRB 
application.  
6.[ADDRESS_77900] manager will email any modifications to the IRB protocol to the 
Mt. Sinai PI [INVESTIGATOR_71665].  
Following approval at the Mt. Sinai site, the research coordinator will email a copy 
of the amendment approval letter. The Mt. Sinai PI [INVESTIGATOR_71666]’s 
policies.  Additionally, the project manager will hold weekly meetings with project 
staff to ensure that the protocol is being followed.

Clean and  analyze data
Study Duration:
1. The  anticipated duration of participation will be [ADDRESS_77903] allotted 36 months to recruit and enroll all participants.
3. We anticipate  9 additional months to finish preliminary analysis.  The estimated 
date to complete analysis is the end of July 2022. 
8.0 Study Endpoints
8.1 The  primary study endpoint will be the completion of all analyses of the Aims.  A 
secondary study endpoint will be when all enrolled and retained participants in the 
trial (n=900) complete up to [ADDRESS_77904] in the Primary Care, Family Medicine or 
General Internal Medicine clinics at Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC), 
Northwestern Medical Group and Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group.  
Recruitment will also be done at Mt. Sinai Medical Center (MSMC), which will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_11577].  Northwestern, as the lead site, will also be overseeing 
recruitment at both sites.  
9.2 Intervention-related  Aspects:
9.2.1 Randomization.  As the UMS EHR Strategy includes changes to healthcare 
delivery, the  intervention itself is diffuse and individual patient randomization is not 
feasible. Therefore, randomization will occur at the provider level (N=500 eligible 
clinicians; ~250 per site). This is possible with Epic; we can ‘turn on’ or off these 
UMS functions via physician preferences, preventing usual care physicians from 
having access. All consented providers will subsequently be randomized to one of 
the 3 study arms: usual care, EHR, or EHR+SMS. This process will result in a 
trickle down of some components of the intervention being given to patients seen by 
[CONTACT_71693], but not enrolled in the study for follow-up purposes (EHR 
tools, but not SMS). To address this, prescribers will be consented with the 
understanding that the care of the patients may be altered, although any risk is 
minimal given the educational nature of the EHR tools. This ‘turning on’ an EHR 
intervention with physician randomization has been previously approved by [CONTACT_71694] 3 other AHRQ grants [P01HS021141-01, 
IRB #: STU00203777-MOD0052 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/1/2021
Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page 11 of 321U19HS021093-01 &  1R18HS017220-01].  All providers in the study will be 
approached prior to study initiation to provide informed consent. In all 3 studies, 
100% of  providers agreed to participate. To optimize the likelihood of obtaining 
similar populations  in each study arm, physicians will be placed into four groups 
based on workload (full vs. part time) and health center (NMHC, NM RMG, or 
MSMC).  [CONTACT_71728], blinded to physician identity, will assign physicians per strata 
using a random number generator. 
9.[ADDRESS_77905] Spanish versions. 
However, we will use a modified committee approach to translate remaining 
components (introduction prompts, item probes, etc.), consent and recruitment 
materials to Spanish. Three bilingual, bicultural translators will independently 
translate a third of each document to Spanish. They will then discuss the resulting 
texts and reach an agreement on best words and phrases for a final product. The 
strength of this approach has been recognized by [CONTACT_71695].125 An 
experienced moderator  ([CONTACT_71729]-Glusberg) will guide discussions and answer any 
questions about the study. We have used these methods previously in translating 
UMS tools.

the study battery, protocol and patient materials among English and Spanish-speaking 
patients at NMHC and MSMC. Cognitive interviews will be conducted among a 
convenience sample of 30 patients (n=15 per language) that meet eligibility criteria 
to refine and standardize the study materials. We will obtain average interview 
completion times, 2) elicit patient comprehension and acceptability of the battery and 
materials. If problems are identified, root causes will be analyzed and modifications 
made as appropriate prior to full-scale implementation
9.6 EHR UMS Interventions 
EHR UMS Tools . Patients in all intervention arms will receive UMS-related tools at 
their primary care visit along with a brief UMS orientation (by [CONTACT_14687]) to support Rx 
use. These materials have previously been successfully pi[INVESTIGATOR_71667]-
funded studies.
1. UMS Rx Instructions (‘Sigs’). 
2. MedSheets. Patients  will receive single-page, plain language Rx 
information sheets following health literacy best practices with content 
appropriately sequenced from a patient’s perspective (drug name, 
indication, purpose/benefit, how to take, for how long, when to call your 
IRB #: STU00203777-MOD0052 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/1/2021
Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page 12 of 32doctor, when  to stop taking and call your doctor, important information). 
These sheets pull in the UMS sig to tailor content and serve as a tangible, 
‘patient-friendly’ addition to the after-visit summary.
9.7 SMS  Text Reminders. For those patients receiving text reminders (EHR+SMS), 
daily text reminders will be sent for [ADDRESS_77907] baseline interview and following any 
new prescription or significant change to their regimen. The premise for the week 
timeframe is to help patients develop a routine for weekdays as well as weekends, 
when schedules may be less regimented. Continuing the SMS text reminders 
indefinitely runs the risk of being ignored, irritating patients, and/or adding an 
unwelcome expense for patients (challenging sustainability for those without 
unlimited texting plans). We will use an affordable, safe, premium internet SMS text 
service plan (EzText) to program and schedule discrete UMS-centered text messages 
at standard intervals for all patients based on their regimen (i.e. 1, 2, 3, or 4 times 
daily); patients can alter the default time points of 7:00am, 12:00pm, 5:00pm, and 
10:00pm.  Generic reminders are used, as the SMS text message itself is a memory 
support sent around the general time of the behavior. The premium plan ensures 
patients do not receive promotional messages with the text, and a toll-free number 
will be provided to patients in this study arm where they can contact [CONTACT_71696], or even extend it to a daily service. An RA will orient 
and confirm patients can retrieve text messages, and instruct them to abstain from 
reading texts while driving.  See Appendix for more examples of texts with common 
mobile phones.
9.8 Usual  Care. For this arm, current usual care includes variable physician prescribing 
and/or nurse counseling, no standard distribution of Rx information or use of UMS, 
variable or limited distribution of Rx information in corresponding pharmacies, and 
no active SMS or surveillance of medication use post-visits. 
9.9 Research-related  Activities: Research related activities will include both face-to-
face and telephone interviews, as well as medical chart extraction.    Specific details 
about each research activity follow below.  Data collected from face-to-face and 
telephone interviews will be collected using REDCap, a secure, web-based 
application for data collection for research studies.  
Baseline Interview: 
At the  first interview we will ask questions about the participant’s diabetes history, 
and self-management behaviors related to their diabetes and medication related 
behaviors. We will also collect standard sociodemographic information.  Participants 
will also complete a cognitive assessment if the interview is completed in-person. 
The cognitive assessment will not be completed if the baseline interview is completed 
over the phone.
If the  baseline is completed in-person, research coordinators will also perform 
standardized measurements of blood pressures and pulse using an automated device 
(validated Omron HEM-907XL or a device with comparable accuracy). Three 
recordings will be performed at each visit and the mean of the second and third 
readings will be used to indicate the blood pressure for that visit. Patient positioning, 
arm selection, cuff size selection and other techniques will follow the procedures for

Page 13 of 32blood pressure  measurement of the National Health Examination and Nutrition 
Survey. Blood pressure readings will not be performed if the baseline is completed 
over the phone. 
During the  interview the research coordinator will also look at how the participant is 
taking his or her medications.  The research coordinator will count the number of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_71668]’ medicine bottles using a standardized protocol.  Prior to 
beginning, the RC will put on gloves and will sanitize the automatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_71669].  While wearing gloves, the coordinator will pour the entire bottle onto 
the automatic counter.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_71670].  Once the pi[INVESTIGATOR_71671], the coordinator will return the pi[INVESTIGATOR_71672].  The coordinator will place the cap on the bottle, making sure the cap is 
securely in place.  For phone interviews, RCs will read a standardized script to ask 
patients to count study pi[INVESTIGATOR_71673] a standardized procedure. If able, participants will 
be asked to join a video call so the RC can take a screen shot of the patient’s 
remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]-per bottle. The RC will save the screen shot/photograph to the study 
project folder within the secure GIM server only using the patient’s studyid to 
identify the photograph. No PHI will be captured in the photograph. If the participant 
does not have video capabilities, the RC will proceed to explain how the patient can 
count their pi[INVESTIGATOR_71674]. This script is outlined in the 
interview script. 
This interview  will take place in-person in a private room in the clinical offices of the 
Family Medicine, Primary Care, or General Internal Medicine of NMHC, 
Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group, Northwestern Medical Group, 
Northwestern Medicine Grayslake, Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest, Delnor 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Northwestern Medicine affiliated clinics, or in community sites in the 
participant’s neighborhood (i.e. private study rooms in libraries). For interviews that 
are not able to be completed in-person, the RC will complete the interview over the 
phone from a closed office/private room. The interview will take about 90 minutes to 
complete.

pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]. The RC will ask the participant to provide verbal consent to allow the 
study team to take a screen shot/photograph of the patient’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_71676] a video call 
in order for the RC to count the pi[INVESTIGATOR_71677]. The patient will be notified 
that no PHI will be captured in the photograph. 
At the  [ADDRESS_77909] during the 
3 month interview, patients from the intervention arm will also be asked additional, 
semi-structured questions to explore 1) personal challenges with regimen adherence, 
2) perceived value of the EHR and SMS tools, 3) unmet needs and acceptability of 
other tools and approaches to support medication use. 
Clinic Staff Feedback
Among consenting  physicians, we will ask physicians to complete a brief survey 
about their experience using the tools.  (See Provider feedback survey)  
Medical Record Extraction:
Additional chart  data will be abstracted via an additional EDW report including 
patient medications, chronic conditions, COVID-19 diagnosis an/or results of 
antibody test, and healthcare utilization (ED, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], primary care 
appointments) as well as hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol clinical values.  
Furthermore, we will extract whether patients received prescription orders in UMS 
format (with after-visit summaries) and the corresponding.  We will also note when 
(days post visit) the Medication reconciliation sheet was incorporated into the EHR.  
Field Notes: 
The project  manager will meet monthly with clinic administrators to document any 
changes that might have occurred and when.  This will include relevant change to 
clinic staffing, workflow, EHR, or any significant event that could potentially alter 
the delivery and subsequent effectiveness of intervention.  The project manager will 
keep a document of this.  
Retention Activities:
In order  to maintain high retention of enrolled participants we will mail holiday cards 
to participants annually.  In addition, if we are unable to contact [CONTACT_71697] “Trying to Reach You” letters to re-engage participants.  Data 
sources for this study will include in-person and telephone interviews with 
participants (see attached surveys), and medical record data extraction via the EDW.    
For patients that complete COVID-19 Waves 5-9:
 Patient  Interviews.  Participants will complete up to five telephone interviews 
in total, with one interview taking place every 4 months. New, supplement-specific 
data collection related to COVID-19 will be collected via telephone interviews; this 
survey is equivalent for both Aim 1 and Aim 2 activities, as data collection will be 
conducted in parallel. 
 EHR  data. Medical record data will be collected via the Electronic Health 
Record (EHR) from January 1, 2019 - present. EHR data will confirm comorbidities

Waves 5-9:
In March  2020, we recruited a subset of the REMinD cohort (n=136), and patients enrolled 
in four other studies (n=537; Total N=673) to form the Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities 
(C3) cohort study. We initially completed four phone interviews (described above) with 
them to better understand how older adults with underlying health conditions, at greater 
risk for COVID-19 complications, were responding and taking action (or not) to prevent 
infection and disease spread. 
We will now  continue our investigation to better understand the longer-term impact of

 this study (STU00208130) in order to create a final and complete dataset..
10.0 Data  and Specimen Banking
10.1 Participant  data will be collected using the Northwestern-based REDCap survey 
platform and Northwestern’s Sharepoint (for EHR extraction data) and all data will 
be stored under an ID number.  Upon completion of all study activities, a final de-
identified dataset will be created.  This dataset will be stored indefinitely on the GIM 
server for secondary analyses.  Only authorized personnel will have access to the 
dataset. Data will be stored on Northwestern encrypted servers and access will be 
granted through the PI.    
11.0 Data  and Specimen Management
11.1 Analysis  Plan – Aim 1 
The proposed  trial uses stratified randomization with random block size to achieve 
group comparability and balance. Stratified by [CONTACT_6903], and provider type (full time, 
part-time, resident) randomization occurs at the provider level, where patients are 
randomized to the same group as their provider. Each provider (approximately 201 
across the 2 sites, 100 per site) will be randomized to one of three arms resulting in 
approximately [ADDRESS_77921] 80% retention for follow-up at six months. This will 
result in 900 participants recruited to the study with an anticipated minimum of 720 
(240 patients per arm, 3 per physician) available after 6 months, contributing to 
primary data analysis.
To ensure  adequate balance across treatment arms, baseline outcomes and potential 
confounders including socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, regimen 
complexity (i.e., # of medications, total pi[INVESTIGATOR_71678]), health literacy, and 
language will be compared across arms using descriptive statistics.  Additionally, 
these variables will be examined one-at-a-time for associations with effectiveness 
outcomes, and those variables found to have significant associations with outcome(s) 
will be considered potential covariates in the generalized linear mixed models 
(GLMMs) used for formal analyses as described below.  Backward stepwise model 
building approaches will be used to determine final, parsimonious model(s) for study 
outcome(s).
Prescription medication  adherence at [ADDRESS_77922]. For each 
outcome, we will use generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to test for 
the effects of EHR and SMS text reminders, specifying the proper link functions 
IRB #: STU00203777-MOD0052 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/1/2021
Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page 19 of 32based on the  distribution of the outcome variable. The GLMMs will include random 
provider effects and fixed binary variables for SMS text reminder and EHR to denote 
the intervention groups and the usual care group (H1-4).  We will include a fixed 
indicator variable for clinic in the GLMMs and any potential confounding covariates 
as noted above.  Analyses will be performed using PROC GLMMIX in SAS (v.9.3) 
and lme4 package in R. Since understanding and adherence will be assessed for each 
medication, 2-level GLMM will be used with medications nested in participants.  We 
will first test for differences in the outcomes between the EHR group and usual care 
(H1-3), followed by [CONTACT_71700]+SMS vs. usual care, and EHR vs. 
EHR+SMS to determine additional benefits of SMS texting (H4) by [CONTACT_71701]. 
         Aim [ADDRESS_77923] appropriate 
contrasts for pairwise comparisons for each literacy level and each language. 
Aim 3
We will  determine the extent to which the interventions were implemented as planned 
(a process evaluation) across each site and for all three study arms, in order to 
optimize the intervention for future dissemination opportunities. 
Mixed methods  will be employed using a convergent parallel design to obtain data 
on intervention implementation.  
Quantitative and qualitative  findings will be merged to answer 1) whether either 
intervention was implemented as planned, 2) from a user-perspective, do 
interventions require modification and how. In this approach, both analyses are 
conducted separately and merged for side-by-side data comparisons. For quantitative 
data (patient report, EHR data), frequencies will be generated to determine outcomes 
related to receipt of materials, perceived helpfulness of materials, CAHPS and 
PACIC. For CAHPS and PACIC data, similar GLMM models as described in Aim 1 
analyses will be performed, with intervention arm as the primary independent 
variable. For qualitative data, we will review and explore the transcribed patient 
interviews and clinic staff discussions using content and ethnographic analysis. 
Predetermined categories will organize feedback from all users: patient, provider, 
clinic/health system. Within each of these broad categories we will use a 
predetermined coding approach to quantify the frequency of two subcategories: 
facilitating factors, and impeding factors (see Figure 8). An additional layer within 
impeding factors would be whether factors are modifiable or not, and under 
facilitating factors, if they are replicable. Field notes and quantitative findings will be 
integrated in this model. Transcribed interviews and field notes will be examined by 
[CONTACT_71702]. 
Aim 4:
We will  directly measure and assess the provider perspective costs of developi[INVESTIGATOR_71679], alone and in combination. Incremental cost of 
IRB #: STU00203777-MOD0052 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/1/2021
Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page [ADDRESS_77924] operating manual guidance 
from Aim 3. The primary costs of running these UMS technologies in the EHR arm 
involves the limited expenses around printing the EHR tools (printer ink, paper, staff 
time) as a result of generating new Rx information with after-visit summaries. SMS 
monthly costs will be easily documented from EZText invoices as well as usage. 
However, we will include estimates for programming maintenance for Epic EHR, 
and will test the sensitivity of results to changes in the maintenance requirements in 
terms of programmer hours, calculated per site. We also will separately track 
development costs for software and other programming requirements based on 
programmer hours. Staff/programmer costs will be measured using tracked time 
spent on the intervention and wage estimates.  We will test the sensitivity of 
operational costs to different assumptions about the potential use of variable staff 
using different salaries but assuming the same proficiency in terms of time required. 
Further, we will assess the sensitivity of estimates to different proficiency levels that 
could arise from learning by [CONTACT_7087]. 
Exploratory Analyses.  We will repeat all GLMM analyses described for Aim [ADDRESS_77925] outcomes, specifically 
adherence. Interaction terms will be included in models accordingly. As adherence 
has its many measurement challenges, experts recommend triangulating with 
multiple measures. We will compare results across each adherence measure (ASK-
12, 24-hour recall, pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]) and create a general estimate of adherence via single 
factor score using maximum likelihood estimation. Exploratory analyses will 
examine HbA1c and blood pressure from baseline to [ADDRESS_77926] marginal models for all primary and 
secondary outcomes using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in a process 
similar to those described for the GLMMs. The purpose is to obtain population-
averaged estimates of any differences in outcomes across arms vs. estimates at 
participant level.
The effect  of the educational tools will be assessed by [CONTACT_71703]-specific questionnaires administered post-education in those undergoing 
standard pregnancy-related diabetes education with those utilizing the newly 
developed toolkit. The effect of the educational intervention will also be assessed via 
the primary and secondary clinical outcome variables previously described. Patient 
satisfaction, assessed by [CONTACT_71704], will also be compared.  
Health literacy  data will be analyzed and categorized as to “high likelihood of limited 
literacy”, “possibility of limited literacy”, or “adequate literacy’. Comparison of 
literacy categorizations will be made between the two populations (military and 
civilian). Baseline disease-specific knowledge will also be analyzed according to 
literacy and compared between the populations. Literacy and disease-specific 
knowledge will be analyzed according to demographic characteristics as described. 
11.2 Sample  Size.
IRB #: STU00203777-MOD0052 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/1/2021
Regimen Education and Messaging in Diabetes (REMinD)
Page 21 of 32Study sample size  was based on pairwise comparisons (EHR vs. usual care, EHR + 
SMS vs. usual care, EHR vs. EHR + SMS) of the primary outcome of medication 
adherence at 6 months between the EHR and usual care study arms (Aim 1, H3).   
Power calculations assumed roughly 67 physicians (clusters) per arm (201 total 
clusters), each with approximately 4 participants, yielding a targeted 900 total 
participants and a conservative 80% retention rate (~3 participants per provider). All 
pairwise comparison type I error rates were assumed to be a conservative 1.67% (i.e., 
the Bonferroni correction to preserve overall type I error rate at 5%), to correct for a 
potential type I error rate inflation in the presence of multiple pairwise comparisons. 
While a low Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) is expected based on a lower 
probability of clustering either by [CONTACT_71705] (given behavior under study and 
ability to prevent EHR or SMS functionality in usual care), we explored scenarios 
where the ICC might range from 0.001 to 0.01.  
Based on  our 2014 findings examining the UMS in pharmacy practice 
[R01HS017687; R01HS016435], We expect 45% of usual care patients to be 
adherent at 6 months (Table 5). With prior-specified assumptions, we will have 85%-
88% power to detect a minimum absolute difference between study arms of 14%. 
With the sample size set by [CONTACT_71706] 6 months, we also 
show overall estimated detectable pairwise differences for secondary outcomes of 
demonstrated proper use and consolidation at 80% power (Aim 1, H1-4) based on 
usual care estimates for proper use and regimen consolidation.
11.3 Protocol  to ensure confidentiality:
Each subject  will tracked using an Access database. Identifiers and other related 
information for coordinating research activities (recruitment outcome, research 
interview call log and interview visit schedule, etc.) will be password protected and 
kept on the secure Northwestern network drive. Only the PI, project manager, and 
RAs will have access this database.    
Several methods  will be employed to reduce the risk of breach of confidentiality. A 
study identification number will be assigned to each subject in the study. The research 
data collected and stored will have the study identification number and no other 
identifying information on it. The consent forms and the de-identified study data will 
be kept in a separate locked file cabinet at the same location. Using this method, if 
someone were to gain illegal access to the locked filing cabinet with study data, they 
would have no way to link this data to any identifying information. Mt. Sinai will do 
the same with their participants, under their own IRB. 
11.4 Quality  Assurance: 
Training will  begin after surveys and interview protocols have been refined and 
standardized. The project manager will lead sessions to orient the research staff to the 
surveys and study protocols (e.g., interview process, use of laptop PCs, data security). 
Training the entire research staff at once, via a web conference, to ensure uniform 
administration of the study protocols and interviews. Practice of the interviews will 
proceed independently at the participating institutions. All interviewers will be 
required to demonstrate competence in survey administration and to pass a 
certification test.

Data Access:  Only authorized personnel listed on each institution’s IRB will have 
access to the data.  
Data Storage:  The research staff at NU and Mt. Sinai will collect data through the 
Northwestern RedCap survey  platform.  Data will be stored in REDCap, a secure, 
web-based application, and on the Northwestern secure servers for the length of the 
study. Data from Mt Sinai’s EHR extractions will be uploaded to Northwestern’s 
Sharepoint site specific to this study. The Project Manager or Data Analyst will 
download the data from REDCap monthly and save to the “Analytic” folder within 
the project folder on the FSM department servers which are located in a HIPAA 
compliant data center.  These data files do not contain any identifiable information, 
and are identified by [CONTACT_71707]. No identifiability 
information are entered into REDCap.  Upon completion of all study activities, a final 
de-identified dataset will be created. This dataset will be stored indefinitely on the 
GIM server for secondary analyses. Only authorized personnel will have access to 
the dataset. All identifiable information will be deleted upon completion of the study
Data Coordination Center (Northwestern):  The project manager and data analyst at 
NU will combine the data and maintain the master data file containing all data from 
each location, create a data dictionary, and be responsible for data cleaning and 
providing updated data to study investigators when requested.

reported outcome related to one’s knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to 
COVID-19, we can link participants’ responses to this longitudinal  survey to a 
minimum data set of participant characteristics that include demographic, 
socioeconomic, cognitive (including health literacy) and health behavioral 
characteristics. We will then be able to investigate determinants of COVID-[ADDRESS_77927] interviews by  [CONTACT_71709]. [CONTACT_71730] (analyst) will oversee database structure & quality assurance.  Participants

Page [ADDRESS_77928]. Kwasny, and all analyses will be conducted 
with SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Using data from the C3 cohort, participants’ perceived 
levels of stress has been assessed from the initial onset of the outbreak (March 13-
20; C3 W1), through its rapid acceleration (March 27-April 3; C3 W2) and apex 
phases (May 1-22; C3 W3), and the flattening phase (July 15- August 15; C3 W4) of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional surveys provides the opportunity to 
continually assess persistent stress over a span of time that likely will include the 
pandemic’s expected, slow recovery, an anticipated second wave in the fall/winter of 
2020/2021, and its eventual recovery as well. Also during this time, there may be new 
treatments available, as well as a vaccine for COVID-19. Initial models will examine 
associations between perceived stress as a result of COVID-19 and health and 
healthcare outcomes over time among C3 participants. As perceived stress, health 
and lifestyle behaviors are expected to change over time, we will use GLMMs to 
examine the relationship between stress, and outcomes (diet, alcohol use, smoking, 
physical activity, diet, weight gain, sleep, social isolation, treatment adherence, self-
reported health status) using stress as a time-varying covariate. For data from the 
EHR, we will assess routine health care use.

project and be given responsibility to review and approve the methods and analysis 
plan. It will be organized by [CONTACT_6283]. Wolf and Federman and include a biostatistician, 
and three clinical researchers (physician, nurse, pharmacist) with related expertise. 
Meetings will be held via video-conference to review protocols, procedures, and 
concerns related to research integrity. 
13.0 Withdrawal  of Subjects
13.1 There  are no anticipated circumstances when a participant would be withdrawn from 
the study without her consent.   
13.2 Participants  can choose to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a participant 
chooses to withdraw from the research, any data collected up until the point of 
withdrawal will still be utilized as it will not include identifying information.  They 
will then not be contact[CONTACT_71710].  
14.0 Risks  to Subjects
14.1 Participation  in the study poses minimal risk of psychological, social and economic 
harm.  Informing subjects in advance that they may decline to answer any questions 
asked during the interview and discussion group will mitigate any risks associated 
with expressing their opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153] (e.g., feeling uncomfortable).  They will also be 
assured they can terminate their participation in the study at any time without penalty.  
The risk/benefit ratio is low.  Minimal to no risk is expected for subjects in this study.

22.0 Recruitment  Methods
22.1 This  section provides more explicit detail about the recruitment methods that will be 
employed at the Northwestern site.  
Potential participants will  be identified through reports generated by [CONTACT_71711] (EDW).  The EDW report will list patients with an upcoming 
appointment in the NMHC or Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group GIM 
clinics and will contain patients name, dob, address, mrn, appointment date, 
appointment type, PCP.  The research staff will review the charts of identified 
patients to confirm eligibility that cannot be ascertained via the EDW (Eligibility 
Criteria: 5) prescribed 5 or more prescription drugs for chronic conditions).  Among 
the remaining eligible patients, primary care physicians will be contact[CONTACT_71712]. A Research 
Coordinator may then contact [CONTACT_71713]. A mailed letter to potential 
participants will include detailed study information and will have the option to opt 
out of the study via a toll-free number (see Recruitment Letter). The letter will be 
mailed using NMHC letterhead.  Seven days after the initial mailing, a Research 
Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_66919].  Due to COVID-[ADDRESS_77935]. Eligibility of patients will be determined 
from screening questions administered at this time (see Screener).  During the 
screening phone call, if a participant is interested in participating but does not want 
to complete the screener over the telephone they may complete the screener in person 
prior to the baseline interview.  The participant will be informed that prior to

(HIPAA). All study generated datasets will be stored on the FSM server.  In order to 
preserve participants’ confidentiality rights, research subjects will be assigned code 
numbers that will be used to identify all the information collected. Using these codes, 
none of the collection forms will contain the names of the participants. All electronic 
data will be stored in on a password-protected computer. A master study tracking 
database will be created using Microsoft Access and will be separate from all study 
responses that are collected in REDCap.  This database will be encrypted and 
password protected, kept on a secure server and only accessible by [CONTACT_3462]. 
Survey data will be stored in a REDCap. EHR extraction data will be stored in 
SharePoint. The data will not contain any identifiable information. Individual study 
identification numbers will be assigned to each participant and only this number will 
appear on the survey.  Only information that has been generalized and/or de-
identified will be shared.
Subjects will be  informed that participation in any part of this research study may 
result in a loss of privacy, since persons other than the investigators may view their 
study records if deemed necessary for oversight purposes.  However; they will be 
identified by a unique identification number (“study id”), not by [CONTACT_2300], and any other 
identifying information (e.g. personal and/or contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be kept 
separate from the other data; all information will be kept in secure, password-
protected files.  Personal information will be encrypted and linked to the study 
number. Further, subjects will be told that unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the study 
investigators, members of the project staff, and representatives of the Northwestern 
University and local Institutional Review Boards will have the authority to review 
any study records.  In such case, they too will be required to maintain confidentiality.
25.2 Participation  in the study poses minimal risk of psychological, social and economic 
harm.  Informing subjects in advance that they may decline to answer any questions 
asked during the interview and discussion group will mitigate any risks associated 
with expressing their opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153] (e.g., feeling uncomfortable).

Page 29 of 32(i.e. private  study rooms in libraries) or IMA clinic.  We will follow “SOP: Informed 
Consent Process for Research (HRP-090).” For patients unable to complete the in-
person interview/in-person written consent due to COVID-[ADDRESS_77952] 
patients’ safety and to follow Northwestern guidelines. For patients that are unable 
to complete online consent or written consent, research cannot practicably be 
conducted without the waiver or alteration. After verbal consent and HIPPA 
Authorization is obtained, the consent date and the name [CONTACT_71726] [CONTACT_71720]. 
Informed, online  and verbal consent will be viewed as a process, i.e. at several times 
during review of the IRB approved consent document, the subject will be asked to 
explain in his/her own words what his/her understanding of the consent. This will 
enable the research personnel to enter into a dialogue with the subject and ensure that 
the subject understands that he/she is free to withdraw at any time without penalty. 
Information will be provided to the subjects in terms that they can fully understand. 
There will be no exertion of any overt or covert coercion. They will be encouraged 
to ask questions prior to giving consent.
Providers.  We  will ask providers to consent to be part of the study, which includes 
consenting to  be randomized to one of the three study arms.  We are asking for 
provider consent to allow any providers who are uncomfortable with the study to opt 
out.  As noted in recruitment, providers will be informed of the nature and details of 
the study via email and a brief overview at a monthly business meeting.  Thus they 
will be asked to sign a written or online consent to be a part of the study, which 
includes their consent to allow their patients to be randomized to condition, as well 
as their willingness to allow us to contact [CONTACT_71721]. 
Patients. Subjects  will be informed about the nature of the study by a CITI certified 
RA and asked  to provide consent.  Specifically, they will be told that depending on 
the doctor they see, they may be given additional educational materials and tools to 
help them better understand their medication.  They will also be told that their 
physician may provide them with additional education.  Additionally they will be 
notified that only those contents of their medical record that are necessary to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the intervention will be released to the research team at

including 2 visits (at 3 and 6 months).  They will be informed that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time and given contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_27116].  For in-person interviews, the patients will complete a written informed 
consent document and will be given a copy of the consent document. See consent 
document. For phone interviews, the patient will complete an online consent or verbal 
consent and verbal HIPPA Authorization. For online consents, patients will be 
informed they can print their screen to keep a copy of the consent. For patients that 
complete a verbal consent, they will be emailed or mailed a blank copy of the consent 
document for their records. 
Non-consenting patients.   Subjects in  this study are consenting to follow-up; 
however, because of the nature of implementing the EHR-based intervention at the 
system level, it is possible that patients who are seen after hours (outside of RA 
availability) will receive the EHR components of the intervention without being 
approached for consent or enrolled in the study. Note that any patient not enrolled in 
the study and not providing written consent will not be called to ask to participate in 
follow-up visits.  We believe that were a patient to see an enrolled physician and thus 
potentially receive the EHR-components of the intervention, that the patient would 
not be exposed to any additional risk as the physician-facing interventions (e.g. EHR 
alert) are educational and do not change the prescribing practices of the physician.
Changes to  the care delivery as a result of the intervention should be perceived as an 
exploratory quality improvement activity, and therefore reasonable that some patients 
may be exposed to new, available services as part of the study. 
Follow-up providers.  The physicians enrolled will be asked to consent to complete a 
survey gauging their  responses to the intervention which their patients received. 
These providers will be asked to document their consent by [CONTACT_71723] “I agree” box 
(on the electronic version of the survey) or by [CONTACT_71724] (paper version of 
the survey). 
 
28.2 Waiver  of HIPAA Authorization are requested to identify subjects (patients) prior to 
enrollment into the study.  
28.3 Verbal  consent process for COVID-19 survey: Subjects will be informed about the 
nature of  the study by a CITI-certified RC and asked to provide verbal consent.  They 
will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and given contact 
[CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_71680]. A verbal consent, or a waiver of documentation of 
consent, is deemed appropriate because the nature of the study involves minimal risk 
and no PHI will be collected. If a patient agrees to participate after the RC reads the 
consent, the RC will record the patient’s name [CONTACT_71727]. These consent forms will be locked in a file cabinet 
only accessible to necessary research staff. Patients will be given the option to receive 
a blank consent form for reference if they request it.

Information will be provided to the subjects in terms that they can fully understand. 
There will be no exertion of any overt or covert coercion. They will be encouraged 
to ask questions prior to giving consent.
Once online consents are filled out, they will get an automatic email with the signed 
version of the consent. Patients will also be informed that they may print their 
screen to keep a copy of the consent. For patients that complete a verbal consent, 
they will be offered a copy of the consent document to be sent via email or mail for 
their records according to their preference.
29.0 Process  to Document Consent in Writing
29.1 All  procedures listed in “SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP-
090)” will be followed.   
29.2 Providers  being randomized to study arms
Written informed  consent or online consent will be obtained from physicians (both 
attending and resident physicians). All participants will be told that their 
participation is voluntary; they can stop at any time, and whether they participated 
or not will not be disclosed to their superiors.  Their participation in the EHR-based 
intervention will be kept confidential and made anonymous in reports.  If the 
physician does not want to participate or decides to stop before completing the 
patient enrollment period, this will not be disclosed to any superiors.

informed consent because: 1) this is a low-risk study, in particular, it is research 
designed to evaluate an educational strategy, 2) it would not be feasible to conduct 
the study as intended if obtaining individual informed consent were necessary (in 
this case because patients do not become eligible until a prescription is written for 
a new or changed medicine - but a key component of the intervention is the text on 
the prescription), 3) informed consent from each participant would threaten the 
scientific validity of the study (in this case it would be impossible to evaluate real-
world dissemination and implementation of the intervention if the EHR 
automations needed to be turned on and off at the individual patient level) and 4) 
for the patients receiving the intervention, but not completing follow-up, no patient 
data are collected that would not be routinely collected in usual care without 
consent. 
As detailed above,  this specific strategy of “turning on” an EHR intervention with 
physician or clinic level randomization has been previously approved by [CONTACT_71725] (P01HS021141-
01, 1U19HS021093-01 & 1R18HS017220-01).

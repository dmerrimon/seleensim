Study Title  
Noninvasive Cortical Stimulation to Improve Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)  
(IRB Title of Study :  Noninvasive Brain Stimulation for  Mild Cognitive Impairment)  
Objectives  
The purpose  of this study is to test the efficacy of  repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) .  There are 
currently no effective treatments for MCI.   
Primary  Objective: T est the hypothesis that participants  receiving active (“real”) rTMS 
will show more improvement in memory at the immediate post -treatment assessment than 
the placebo (sham) control g roup.  
Secondary Objectives (aims) : 
(2a) Assess the durability of rTMS effects  on memory  over a  6-month follow -up 
period, which is  longer than assessed in  previous studies;  
(2b) Examine effects of rTMS on behavior and brain function related to the site of 
stimulation, which is a novel approach in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  spectrum ;  
(2c)  Explore patient characteristics  that could be useful in identifying who responds  
preferentially  to rTMS  or to a particular  stimulation site . 
Design and Primary Outcome   
The study will use a double -blind, placebo  (sham)- controlled , randomized 3 -arm  design.    
Different cortical stimulation- sites will be studied in the two A ctive arms : 
Active group 1: Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC);   
Active group 2: Bilateral Lateral Parietal cortex (LPC)  
Primary O utcome  is the  [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test (CVLT -II) Trials 1- 5 Total raw score  
Interventions and Duration  
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups :  Group 1: DLPFC 
Active rTMS; Group 2: LPC Active rTMS; and Group 3: Placebo (sham) control (evenly split between each coil location).  Thus, a participant has a 2/3 chance of rec eiving  active rTMS . 
Each participant will participate in the study for approximately  7 ½ months —including  a daily  
rTMS  treatment phase  (20 sessions in all), and  post -intervention follow -up lasting  6-month s. 
Sample Size and Population  
Sample Size : 99 men and women between the ages of 55 and 90 inclusive (n=33 per group ).  
Target population : Individuals  with a clinical diagnosis of  single-  or multi -domain amnestic 
MCI  (aMCI).   MCI  is an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia due to 
conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

[ADDRESS_269613] the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 
(rTMS) as a treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).  MCI an important public 
health concern due to its prevalence and risk of progression to dementia.   Alzheimer’s 
Disease is the most common underlying cause of dementia.  
There are currently no effective treatments for MCI , aside from  general health 
recommendations .  As discussed in the NIH /NIA  R01 application, the low efficacy  of 
cholinesterase inhibitors  is outweighed by [CONTACT_224149] (C ooper, Li, Lyketsos, & 
Livingston, 2013; Fitzpatrick -Lewis, Warren, Ali, Sherifali, & Raina, 2015; Raschetti, 
Albanese, Vanacore, & Maggini, 2007; Russ & Morling, 2012; Tricco et al., 2013) .  
Systematic reviews of  other interventions for MCI (Cooper et al., 2013; Fitzpatrick -Lewis et 
al., 2015; Rodakowski, Saghafi, Butters, & Skidmore, 2015)  indicated  that the treatment 
investigated was ineffective; or if the treatment showed promise of efficacy, the finding still 
needs to be independently replicated; or the clinical trial was underpowered (Cooper et al., 2013) .   
This clinical interventional study, originally proposed in response to NIH/NIA PAR -16-365 
“Pi[INVESTIGATOR_165679]’s Disease and Age- related Cognitive 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  11 Decline (R01) ,” is designed  to provide key cognitive and other outcome data as to whether 
rTMS is a viable nonpharmacological intervention for treatment of MCI.   
2.2 Study Rationale  
Cognitive Efficacy of rTMS    
rTMS has shown promise in improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) dementia (Ahmed, Darwish, Khedr, El Serogy, & Ali, 2012; Cotelli et al. , 2011; 
Cotelli et al., 2006; Cotelli, Manenti, Cappa, Zanetti, & Miniussi, 2008; Rabey et al., 2013; Rutherford, Lithgow, & Moussavi, 2015) .  As discussed in the NIH R01 application,  these 
studies had limitations including small sample sizes, non- blinded control treatments, and 
collected limited outcome data.  The limited follow -up data published so far suggests that 
five or m ore sessions of rTMS can produce significant benefits lasting up to 4 months  
(Ahmed et al., 2012; Cotelli et al., 2011; Rabey et al., 2013) .  Two meta- analys es have been 
conducted.  One meta- analys is reported a Standardized Mean Difference ( SMD ) = 1.00, 
which is a relatively  large effect size (based on seven rTMS studies with a total of 94 AD 
patients) (Liao et al., 2015) . The second  meta- analysis  reported a SMD  = 1.35 (Two NIBS  
methods were pooled  based on six  rTMS and five  transcranial direct current stimulation 
studies ) (Hsu, Ku, Zanto, & Gazzaley, 2015) . After adjust ing for potential publication bias , 
the mean effect size was  0.78, still  a large  and  clinically meaningful  effect  (Cohen, 1977; 
Kraemer, 1992) .   
For MCI, we found only one rTMS experiment (Turriziani et al., 2012) , one rTMS clinical  trial 
(Drumond Marra et al., 2015) , and one case report (Co telli et al., 2012) .   In the clinical trial, 
which was sham- controlled  and involved 34 MCI patients , half the patients received 10 Hz  
rTMS, applied over the left DLPF C for 10 weekday sessions  (Drumond Marra et al., 2015) .  
This rTMS treatment protocol significantly improved performance on the primary efficacy measure, the Rivermead Ev eryday Memory Test  (Drumond Marra et al., 2015) .  The 
improvement in memory was sustained at the 1 -month fo llow -up (p = .03; SMD = 0.78).  
Together, these scant preliminary findings suggest that rTMS may  enhance cognition in 
MCI patients.  As in the case of AD dementia, it is unknown how long the effects of rTMS 
last.  A rigorous pi[INVESTIGATOR_224104]- term 
efficacy of rTMS and duration of effects . 
Therapeutic Rationale for rTMS as a treatment for MCI and AD spectrum disorders   
AD leads to regionally specific synaptic  loss  due to a neurodegenerative cascade of 
processes involving  “amyloid -β facilitated tauopathy” (LaFerla, Green, & Oddo, 2007; 
Nisbet, Polanco, Ittner, & Gotz, 2015; Sadigh -Eteghad et al., 2015) .  In patients with MCI, 
structural MRI studies reveal gray- matter volume loss  in AD -vulnerable regions, in 
particular medial and posterior regions  of the  limbic  lobe , and midd le and inferior  regions 
of the  temporal lobe (Bakko ur, Morris, & Dickerson, 2009; Convit et al., 2000; Desikan et al., 
2008; deToledo -Morrell et al., 2004; Driscoll et al., 2009; Fennema -Notestine et al., 2009; 
Greene & Killiany, 2010; Kaye et al., 1997; Whitwell et al., 2008) .  Synaptic  dysfunction or 
loss in AD -vulnerable regions plausibly underlies functional  MRI abnormalities  seen in 
resting -state networks  (RSNs ; aka intrinsically connected networks or ICNs ).   
According to a  meta- analysis of rs -fMRI studies comparing aMCI to healthy controls , the 
most consistently  significant regions  that show loss of functional connectivity  in aMCI  are 
the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC : medial and right), the right angular gyrus, right 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  12 parahippocampal gyrus, and left fusiform gyrus (Lau, Leung, Lee, & Law, 2016) , regions  
that are canonically accepted to be part of posterior D efault M ode N etwork (DMN).   As 
described in the NIH R01 application, an experiment in healthy younger adults provided  
proof of concept that rTMS can induce greater functional connectivity within the DMN (J. X. 
Wang et al., 2014)  when delivered to the LPC over an area encompassing the angular gyrus .   
While much remains to be learned regarding the mechanism of action of rTMS, rTMS has 
evidence of modulating brain networks in a relatively selective fashion depending on the 
site of stimulation.  Thus, rTMS offers a neurocircuit- driven strategy for stimulating and 
targeting neural networks that likely underp in core deficits of amnestic MCI.  rTMS may 
also have restorative effects, owing to  the hypothesized effects  of rTMS  on long -term 
potentiation (LTP) and synaptic modification.   
Pre-clinical animal and cell culture studies hold the most promising keys to understanding 
the mechanisms of action of neuromodulation.  Pre- clinical studies of transcranial EMF 
treatment, a nother  neuromodulatory intervention for  cognitive decline due to A D, have 
been conducted by [CONTACT_224150] (Arendash, 2016) . These studies , using  AD 
transgenic mice that overproduce Aβ , were able to show  positive effects of EMF  on 
measures of learning and memory, on Aβ plaque burden, as well as  more general positive 
effects  on brain function—mitochondrial function and neuronal activity  measures 
(Arendash, 2016) .   
Evidence of disease- modifying actions  of neuromodulation via noninvasive brain 
stimulation in human research  would be a  major step forward in the clinical development 
these no ninvasive brain stimulation as a nonpharmacological treatment for MCI due to AD  
(Albert et al., 20 11).  If the current study provides a signal that rTMS favorably modulates 
brain networks affected in MCI, the next step in clinical development would the inclusion of 
AD-neuropathological biomarkers of treatment response in a longer clinical trial.   
Scientific  Motivation  for study ing effects of rTMS  at two different  cortical sites  
Only two of the controlled rTMS trials in AD dementia and MCI  targeted a site that is 
functionally part of the DMN.  T he majority of trials --wit hout a n explicit disease- relevant 
rationale--stimulated the DLPFC, the  target site for treating major depression and likely to 
be a “node”  withiin the Central Executive Network (CEN).   It is not known whether the 
stimulation site used for treatment of depression—the DLFPC —is truly the ideal 
stimulation site for MCI / AD patients .   
In younger and  non -AD populations, there is experimental and clinical evidence that rTMS 
delivered to the right or left DLPFC region can improve network interactions between the CEN and DMN regions  (Chen et al., 2013; Liston et al., 2014) .  Importantl y, rs-fMRI studies 
of aging and the AD spectrum have revealed altered network interactions between the 
DMN and attention- related networks  such as the CEN , which in turn correlate with lower 
cognitive performance (Grady, Sarraf, Saverino, & Campbell, 2016; Ng, Lo, Lim, Chee, & 
Zhou,  2016; K. Wang et al., 2007; P. Wang et al., 2015) .  Thus, stimulating the DLPFC using 
rTMS has potential to improve CEN: DMN interactions in AD and MCI .  
By [CONTACT_224151], this pi[INVESTIGATOR_224105], laying the 
ground work for later- stage clinical trials.   Ultimately, stimulating both cortical regions 
might provide superior clinical outcomes given the profound effects of AD on widespread 
interconnected brain regions.  However, clearer understanding of how rTMS over a cortical 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269614] that improves clinical 
outcomes in a sustained manner, this wil l be a significant advance for the treatment of MCI . 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_224106] P arameters  and Delivery S chedule  
In this study, each participant will receive a total of 20 sessions  of rTMS  bilateral  10 Hz 
rTMS  lasting 2 5 minutes per session.  The stimulation parameters of this study were 
selected on the basis of  a meta- analyses of rTMS studies targeting the AD dementia 
population (Liao et al., 2015) , publications that presented safety  and tolerability  data 
(Nahas et al., 2004) , and the clinical interventional research experience of our co -
investigators and consultants to ameliorate the core symptoms of treatment- resistant 
major depressive disorder  (TRM DD), mild AD dementia, and mild traumatic br ain injury 
(mTBI).   The empi[INVESTIGATOR_224107]:  
Stimulation F requency and Intensity .  The decisions to use10 Hz rTMS and to stimulate 
both hemispheres  is based on  a recent meta -analysis of AD trials, which reported that the 
cognitive efficacy of rTMS was  larger when high frequency ( ≥ 10 Hz) rTMS was used, and 
when stimulation was bilateral  or to the right hemisphere (L iao et al., 2015) .  The decision 
to use  an intensity of 120% magnetic field intensity relative to the participant’s resting 
motor threshold (MT) is also based on a strategy to achieve efficacy in the older population 
without compromising safety.  Early studies used lower intensity stimulation because of 
safety concerns at the time, which have now been alleviated with greater experience.  This 
intensity is safe, tolerable, and has been necessary and sufficient to overcome the effect of 
age-related cortical atrophy (Nahas et al., 2004) .  Recent rTMS studies of cognitive 
enhancement that targeted the older population used intensity  levels ranging from 90% 
MT to 120%  MT,  depending on the site selected for treatment stimulation (Hsu et al., 
2015) .  120% is the intensity used in the AD , mild TBI,  and depression clinical trials,  
directed by [CONTACT_56049] C o-Investigators, Drs. Jauhtai Joseph Cheng, Maheen Adamson, and Jerome 
Yesavage.    
Stimulation Pattern and Session Duration : The 10 Hz pulse frequency will be patterned 
as a 4-second train ( 40 pulses)  with an  11- second  interval  between trains, which is 
repeated  over a period of  25 minutes  (i.e. a total of 4 ,000 pulses per session: 40 pulses per 
train x 4 trains per minute x 25 minutes ).  Prior studies generally used 1 ,900 pulses or less 
per session , in line with 2009 safety recommendations (Rossi, Hallett, Rossini, Pascual -
Leone, & Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009) .  The lack of serious adverse effects seen 
with 1 ,900 pulses has motivated clinical investigators focused on the target population of 
treatment- resistant major depressive disorder (TRMDD) to deliver an effic acious course of 
treatment safely, but in a shorter period of time.  We note that MagVenture received 510(k) 
FDA clearance in June 2017 to use "... a range of inter -train intervals from 11 to 26 seconds” 
in delivering the 10 Hz / 3000 pulse, FDA cleared protocol for treatment of adults with TRMDD.   
 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  14 A 10 Hz 4-sec train, 10 -sec ITI protocol that delivered a total of 4,000 pulses during a 2 3-
minute session was used in the VA 9 -site depression trial (VA CSP #556; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_224108]) , 
which completed data collection in 2016.  Although detailed safety and efficacy data are not 
available as of August 2017, the CSP #556 PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Chair Mark George, MD  state that no 
seizures occurred in CSP #556 (per email communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224109]).   Study c o-investigators, Drs. Cheng and Adamson, have adopt ed a 10 Hz 5 -sec train, 10 -sec 
ITI protocol for use  in their  currently ongoing rTMS clinical trials for treatment of cognitive 
impairment due to mild AD and mild TBI .  The DSMB  of the present trial has  advised 
stricter adherence to the published safety table (Rossi et al., 2009) .  In summary, we have 
selected a 10 Hz 4 -sec train, which is within the safety table, and an 11 -sec ITI, which is 1 
sec longer than that used in CSP #556.   
Delivery schedule.  Delivery of the study intervention will be scheduled as two rTMS 
sessions per treatment visit,  with 10 treatment visits scheduled M -F during two 
consecutive weeks .  This delivery schedule was documented to be safe and  effective in a 
depress ion-treatment trial (Loo, Mitchell, McFarquhar, Malhi, & Sachdev, 2007)  (10 Hz, 
110% intensity, 1 ,500 stimuli per session) .  This “ twice- daily” procedure is being used at 
our site by [CONTACT_15957] -Investigators  Drs. Adamson and Cheng  in two ongoing clinical interventional 
studies  (10 Hz, 12 0% intensity, 4000 stimuli per session).  From a patient’s perspective, a 
twice- daily intervention that requires a 2- week commitment is likely to be more 
convenient than coming to a clinic M-F for 4 weeks, particularly if there is some flexibility for “make -up” sessions, e.g. when the participant needs to fulfill  other commitments . 
In summary , the [ADDRESS_269615]  of 
delivering  up to 8,000 magnetic pulses per day, with  a total of 8 0,000 pulses  over 2 to 2.5 
weeks .  This is within the  range of  60 to 90,000 total pulses  that is  delivered in FDA -
approved rTMS treatment of TRM DD ( e.g. 3,000 magnetic p ulses per day,  5 days  per  week, 
for 4 to 6 weeks) and more  than the 39,[ADDRESS_269616] ™ Therapy 
System protocol (Rabey & Dobron evsky, 2016; Rabey et al., 2013) .  Our  experience, based 
upon  clinical research involving more than 6 0 AD and mTBI study volunteers , is that the  
stimulation protocol to be used in this study will be a safe, tolerable , and efficient means of  
providing  noninvasive brain stimulation, provided  that  safety screening and other  
precautions  are taken t o minimize the risks of rTMS . 
Summary of  the known and potential risks  of the rTMS  study intervention :  
The serious known and potential risks of rTMS  are: 
o Inadvertent induction of a seizure (less than 1 in 1000 patient exposures ); 
o In the absence of careful screening, ferromagnetic implants, objects or electromechanical devices such as  pacemakers are serious risks  
Other known and potential risks  of rTMS  are: 
o Discomfort at the site of rTMS stimulation (15% of patients ); 
o Mild to moder ate headaches (up to 30% patients), and the  
o Possibility of temporary hearing loss if ear protection is inadequate.

ASSESSMENTS.”  See also,  the original  IRB protocol submissio n and informed consent form ,

rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269617] of rTMS on memory in persons with  aMCI will be 
tested  in a randomized, 2 -stimulation- site, double -blind sham- controlled, 3  parallel -arm 
design, in which bilateral rTMS is delivered as: (1) real rTMS of the DLPFC, (2) real rTMS of 
the LPC, or (3) sham rTMS (evenly split between each coil location).  
Note:  All IRB -approved materials refer to the treatment groups as  active “ real” rTMS and  
inactive/placebo rTMS .  In the study protocol, we use the more conventional term s, “active” 
and “sham” rTMS.  
Overview  of Measures .  As sho wn in Table 1 , behavioral and cognitive outcome measure s 
will be collected at 4 timepoints:  Baseline, I mmediate post- treatment, and at two 
subsequent F ollow -up visits  at 3 and 6 months .  Resting -state fMRI (rs -fMRI, aka task -free 
fMRI) scans will be acquired at B aseline and  repeated  Immediate post- treatment to examine 
the effects of rTMS on functional connectivity.  BDNF levels will be measured twice, prior to 
the first treatment session and again during the last treatment visit.  Genomic DNA will be 
collected  at the first treatment session to examine heterogeneity of response to rTMS.

in orde r to reduce the magnitude of practice effects .  Fluency and Trails are included because they 
are widely used  tests, and their brevity sh ould not add substantial participant burden. )  
Secondary  fMRI and BDNF measures relevant to improved functional connectivity 
and plasticity .  Resting -state fMRI  (rs-fMRI, aka task -free fMRI) scans will be acquired at 
the B aseline and I mmediate post- treatment visits  to examine effects of rTMS on functional 
connectivity.  Additionally, plasma levels of b rain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  will 
be measured  before and at completion of treatment as a strategy to gain more information 
about mechanisms of action.  BDNF  expression in the brain plays a role in synaptic 
remodeling (McAllister, Katz, & Lo, 1999) .  It has been suggested that the longer -lasting 
effects of rTMS involve long -term potentiation- like (LTP- like) mechanisms (Hoogendam, 
Ramakers, & Di Lazzaro, 2010) .  Although a  direct link between neuromodulatory 
stimulation, such as rTMS,  and synaptic plasticity remains to be demonstrated , an rTMS -
related  rise in BDNF plasma levels would be consistent with an effect on brain plasticity.  
Secondary  measures relevant to heterogeneity of therapeutic response.  Genomic  
DNA  will be collected to examine heterogeneity o f response to rTMS.  For this project, three 
genotypes will be determined --Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 ε3 ε2, BDNF  val66met , and 
catechol- O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) val158met genotypes --and used in exploratory 
analyses of heterogeneity of response to rTMS.   In addition, selected Baseline clini co-
demographic variables and summary measures of functional connectivity , will be used in 
these exploratory analyses (See Section 9.5.2).  
Study Location  and Duration  
The study will be conducted in an outpatient clinic setting at the VA Palo Alto Health Care 
System.  The total duratio n of the study  will be [ADDRESS_269619] -treatm ent. 
The study database will  ultimately include data from 99 aMCI participants  (33 per arm) , 
with measures of cognitive efficacy, change in brain function, and predictors of response to rTMS, which will be analyzed as described in Section 9.5.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Recruitment s trategies.   (1) We will recruit participant in collaboration with the NIA -
funded Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and the [LOCATION_004]- funded 
Stanford -VA AD Center.  The two centers will enable us to minimize screen fails by 
[CONTACT_224159]’s eligibility criteria.  The ADRC and [LOCATION_004] AD center both have ongoing outreach efforts in place to recruit participants of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds.  (2) Participants will also be recruited from local clinics and physicians.  We estimate that the Study Coordinator will conduct 3 screens for 
every 1 that is eligible for randomization.  
To augment the AD Centers’ outreach efforts to older, ethnically diverse individuals, we 
have budgeted for direct- mail advertising that will be targeted to older ethnically diverse 
residents.  Local area marketing companies have lists of individuals by [CONTACT_654], by [CONTACT_224160], and by [CONTACT_224161].  Our collaborators at both Centers have found that these 
IRB-approved postcards are one of the most effective outreach strategies.  More general 
advertising will include IRB -approved fl yers posted throughout the Stanford campus, 
VAPAHCS and AD Center newsletters.  Interested r espondents will learn more about the 
study during a telephone interview.  If the respondent has never had a MCI/dementia work -up, they will be invited to undergo th e rTMS study’s screening evaluation at the NIA 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269623] information on each candidate who is pre -screened by [CONTACT_224162] 1, the i n-person  screening visit.   For each candidate screened  in person,  
two forms will be completed to document eligibility and the participant’s decision to enroll : 
 The Inclusion -Exclusion Form  will document  study  eligibility and r easons for 
ineligibility .  
 The Enrollment and Randomization Form  will document eligibility as a binary Y/N 
outcome.  The form will also have a check -box variable for recording why an eligible 
candidate was  not enrolled.  
Randomization .  Participants  who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to double -blind  active treatment or sham  at B aseline.   Within the active and s ham 
groups, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two unmasked cortical sites.  The 
method of random assignment to treatment (active vs. sham) and to cortical site (DLPFC vs 
LPC) will be determined  by a computer -generated  random sequence a s explained  in 
“Treatment Assignment Procedures  9.2.1.”    
For the purposes of the Data Analyses, there are [ADDRESS_269624] 
in this randomized trial :  
(1) one -third of subjects will receive active DLPFC ;  
(2) one -third of subjects will receive active LPC ; and  
(3) one -third of subjects  will receive sham ( sham DLPFC and s ham LPC  are combined ). 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Intervention  Device  
Briefly, the TMS device system  used in this study is comprised of the following 
components: MagPro X100 magnetic stimulator,  the C-B60 c oil (for MT determination) , 
Coil Cooler  unit, and motorized treatment chair.  These are the major  components  of the 
MagVita TMS Therapy system, which is FDA cleared to market for the treatment of drug 
resistant Major Depressive Disorder . 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  20 For this  double -blind  controlled  trial, the  TMS Therapy System will be configured with  
three additional  research components:   a Coil Cool- B65 A/P (Active & Sham figure -of-eight 
coil), a TMS Sham Noise generator (for masking any difference in sound between real and 
sham), and a  Localite TMS Navigator Spectra Edition system (for f MRI -guided placement of 
the rTMS coil ). 
5.[ADDRESS_269625] a 
morning session and an afternoon session. At the study physician’s discretion and if the 
participant requests, up to three rTMS sessions can be schedu led per day with at least a 
one-hour interval between sessions.  
Intervention sessions are scheduled as a 1 -hour blocks, to allow time for late arrivals, for 
assessments of adverse effects, and for  the 25- minute rTMS intervention.  The intervention 
will be administered in outpatient clinic setting.  In all, the participant will receive a total of 
20 rTMS sessions . 
Procedures for administering the rTMS  Intervention  
1. Motor Threshold Determination .  Prior to administering the intervention, the 
participant’s right and left motor threshold (MT) will be measured to standardize the stimulation intensity to be 120% of resting MT , i.e. 1.2 x MT) .   The 120% intensity will be 
specific to the MT of each hemisphere.  The TMS Operator  will determine the left  MT at the 
end the screening  visit, and  the right  MT a t the beginning of Session [ADDRESS_269626] t he right and left MTs —and the corresponding 
stimulation intensities equal to 120% of  right and left MT —on the participant’s T MS 
Intervention Log ( described in Section 6.2.3).  The participant’s right  MT will also be 
recorded within the TMS system in association with the participant’s randomization treatment number .  (The device software allows for one MT to be saved per particip ant.)   
Left and right hemisphere MT will be determined using electromyographic measurement (EMG) of the resting contralateral thumb (abductor pollicus brevis) using a mathematical 
algorithm (Maximum- Likelihood Strategy using Parameter Estimation by [CONTACT_224163]; MLS -PEST) that efficiently and reproducibly arrives at the participant’s MT s.  As 
explained in the appended TMS Operator  manual (Appendix IV.  “TMS Quick Guide and 
TMS Operator’s Manual of Procedures ”), adapted from the CSP #556 Study Protocol 
(Yesavage, Fairchild, & George, 2015, November ) , the EMG and MLS -PEST features are 
incorporated within the TMS devic e and software.   If the scr eening MT is so high that the 
TMS system lacks capability to deliver rTMS at an intensity of 120% MT , the participant 
will not be eligible to enroll in the study .  Fewer than five percent of participants are 
expected to be ineligible due to an excessively high MT (see Table 2 of George et al., ( 2010)  
for a large -sample distribution of MT values).  The remainder of this section gives an 
outline o f the basic procedures for administering rTMS:  
2. Neuronavigation to guide placement of the coil .  The placement of the coil  will be 
individualized to each subject, using the subject’s MRI  data collected at the Baseline visit.   
By [CONTACT_224164], we  aim to optimize subjects’  clinic al response s (Bashir, 
Edwards , & Pascual -Leone, 2011; Fox, Buckner, White, Greicius, & Pascual -Leone, 2012; 
Fox, Liu, & Pascual -Leone, 2013) , irrespective of  whether the subject is assigned to DLPFC 
or LPC stimulation.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  21 As discussed in the grant application, multiple sessions of rTMS, when applied  to the DLPFC 
or LPC, can ultimately change DLPFC:PPC connectivity and LPC:PPC connectivity, 
respectively in TMRDD (Liston et al., 2014)  and healthy young adults (J. X. Wang et al., 
2014) .  Regarding  aMCI, the most significant x, y, z  coordinates of abnormal functional 
connectivity appear to be located near  MNI coordinate : x = 6, y= - 52, z=16, located in the 
PCC  bilaterally .  This coordinate was derived through  an ALE meta- analysis of 21 rs -fMRI 
studies comparing aMCI participants to healthy older  control participants (Lau et al., 2016) .  
Therefore, in the present study, e ach subject’s MRI  data and a  frameless stereotactic 
neuronavigation system will be used to position  the coil where it is  most likely to 
ultimately target the medial PCC, given evidence that this  hub -like region of the brain is 
most consistently abnormal in aMCI .   
The present study’s procedures for neuronavigation will be per formed  in consultation with  
[CONTACT_224206]  and [CONTACT_224207] of Stanford University School of Medicine .  
The general methods, which are based on prior work (J. X. Wang & Voss, 2015) , are 
outlined in the grant submission, Section C.2.d.4  and in Appendix VIII. “R esting -state 
functional MRI Methods” ).  Briefly, the first step is to generate a seed -based connectivity 
map f or each subject , using the subject’s  rs-fMRI Baseline data .  In this step, the fMRI 
timeseries  of the bilateral PCC region will be extracted as the seeds .  Next , timeseries 
analyses will be used to locate bilateral  LPC or bilateral DLPFC  cortical targets, depending 
which  of the  two cortical site the subject has been randomly assigned to.   If the fMRI data 
are too noisy  due to excessive head motion, large framewise displacement, and/or low 
temporal signal -to-noise ratio, then the T1 -weighted anatomical image  will be used as a 
fallback.  Review of data quality and selection of stimulation locations for individual subjects will be done in collaboration  with [CONTACT_224208].  [CONTACT_224208]’s image -
processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_224112], each involving unique diagnoses or unique targets.   
LPC :  To locate the  left and right LPC cortical stimulation sites, we will locate the 
clusters of voxels  located within the left and right angular gyri (and near Brodmann Area 
(BA) 39/40)  that show local maximum connectivity  (i.e. are positively  correlated) with the 
PCC  seeds .  The left cluster  should also lie within a 15 -mm radius of MNI coordinate : x= - 47, 
y= -68, z=36; this coordinate is the peak location, across subjects, in the rTMS experiment 
that stimulated  the left LPC  to improve memory  (J. X. Wang et al., 2014) .  
DLPFC :  To locate the left and right DLPFC sites  for stimulation, we will locate the 
clusters of voxels within left and right prefrontal gyri ( near the juncture of BA s 9 and 46)  
that show  local maximum negative connectivity (i.e. are inversely correlated)  with th e PCC  
seeds .  The left cluster  within the DLPFC should also lie  within a 15 -mm radius of the  peak 
MNI coordinate  (x= - 38, y=44 , z=2 6), which was  found to be  predictive of  how effective 
rTMS was  in treating clinical depression (Fox et al., 2012) .  This coordinate is  also near the 
peak a ctive cluster in fMRI studies of working memory  in MDD (Fitzgerald et al., 2006) , and 
shows significant inverse correlations with the PCC in resting -state fMRI  (Greicius, 
Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon, 2003) .   
Following  localization of the stimulation site (LPC or DLPFC), the bilateral locations for that 
subject will be marked in stereotactic space, transformed into original MRI space, and 
overlaid onto the structural MRI to  aid in position ing the coil for  the interventio n.  These 
locations will be marked on the subject’s cap.  Once the locations are marked, a coil template will be placed ov er each location to mark the  location on the cap where  the edge 
of the coil should be .  As described  in the TMS Operator  manua l (Appendix IV), cap fitting 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269627] of reproducibly delivering rTMS across multiple intervention 
sessions.  
3. Procedures for each intervention session .  Except for positioning the rTMS coil over 
the assigned cortical site, the intervention procedures are identical for all treatment groups.   The TMS Operator manual (Appendix IV) lists, step  by [CONTACT_75849], th e procedures for 
safety screening, for operating the rTMS device, placing scalp electrodes  (see also Section 
5.3 below), cap repositioning, positioning the participant for comfort and stable head 
position, delivering the treatment and monitoring for safety  and tolerance to the 
procedure.   The TMS Operator will manually set the amplitude to  equal  1.2 times the MT of 
the to -be-stimulated hemisphere.  For example, if the right MT = 65 and  the left MT= 70, 
then the TMS Operator will manually set the amplitude t o 78 (1.2 x 65)  to stimulate the 
right , and  to 84 (1.2 x 70)  to stimulate the left .   
As in Ahmed et al (Ahmed et al., 2012) , rTMS will be applied over the right hemisphere 
first , immediately followed by [CONTACT_224165]. Rabey et al. (2013) al so used 
a R, L order for the two bilateral regions .  In both studies, all participants will receive the 
same order .  It is beyond the scope of this study to investigate order effects.  Given the 
absence of a priori data on this point , this study will follow the method s of the two  prior 
studies  (Ahmed et al., 2012; Rabey et al., 2013)  and stimulate the right , immediately 
followed by [CONTACT_224166]. 
TMS Stimulation Parameters  for the active DLPFC and active LPC  rTMS intervention 
groups  will be : 10 Hz, 4 -second train duration and 11- secon d inter -train interval . During 
each session, 2,000 pulses will be  applied for each hemisphere (for a  total of 4 ,000 pulses 
per session ).  These parameters will be pre- programmed in the device at the outset of the 
clinic al trial , before the TMS operator begins administering the intervention.  
Modifications and supportive care  in case of difficulty tolerating the intervention.  As 
noted previously, headache, scalp discomfort at the site of stimulation are relatively common, although tolerance to these adverse effects generally develops over the first 5 to 
10 sessions of TMS therapy (Perera et al., 2016) .   Should a headache or site discomfort 
occur, these symptoms are expected to b e self -treated , e.g. with ibuprofen.  Discomfort can 
vary depending on intensity and location.  For better tolerability, intensity can be ramped 
up from 80% to 1 20% during the first two sessions, and study staff may be able to move 
the coil position slightly if dental pain occurs.  
5.3 Mechanisms for M asking (i.e., blinding) Study  Interventions  
The mechanisms used to create matched sensations for active and sham rTMS  are the same 
as those  used  in currently  ongoing  VA-funded  rTMS trials  at this site and are very similar to 
those  used  in an NI MH-funded randomized rTMS  trial for patients with depression (George 
et al., 2010) .   
The masking  system  is comprised of three components: (1) the Cool -B65- Active/Placebo 
Coil, which  functions as both a real and sham coil; (2) sc alp electrodes; and (3) a white-
noise generator.  The Active/Placebo coil has a symmetrical mechanical design and no 
labeling identifying the active and the sham side of the coil.  Second , the subject wears scalp 
electrodes through which, in the case of sh am assignment, a low voltage, low electric 
current (2 –20mA at no more than 100V) is passed to mimic the sensation of receiving 
actual rTMS.   Third , a white- noise generator is used to hide the click noise produced by

rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  26 6.2 Description of Assessments and Procedures  
6.2.1  In-Person Screening Visit  
Consenting Procedure  
Before any in- person screening procedure is performed, informed consent will be obtained. 
A single informed consent form describes both the screening and study procedures .  See 
Appendix II . “Informed  Consent Form s.” 
The Study Coordinator or PI, in consultation with the Study Physician will conduct the 
consent process.  The process will be implemented as described in Section 11.2 “ Informed 
Consent Forms .”  To d ocument that informed  consent was obtained, a progress note  will be 
entered  in the participant’s  binder of study documents that contain PHI.  The o riginal 
signed consent form  will be filed in a single Study  Consent Binder to facilitate the annual 
audit of consent forms that are conducted by [CONTACT_224167].  The participant 
will receive a copy of the signed consent form . 
Note: If a change in the study procedures is  required, a revised consent form  will be  
submitted to the local IRB for review and approval .  At their next clinic visit, study 
participants will be reconsented  using the revised, approved consent form .  
Screening Evaluation  (Visit 1)  
All screening evaluations to determine eligibility must be completed within 42 days ( 6 
weeks ) of the Baseline visit.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the screening evaluation will be completed at a 
sing le clinic visit and eligibility will be determined within the next 2 weeks.  The next 4 
weeks is a waiting period to obtain a time slot for the Baseline MRI.  
To assess whether an individual meets enrollment eligibility criteria , the following 
assessments w ill be performed : 
The Participant  will complete  the following questionnaires  
o Cognitive Change Index  
o Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS 15 -item)  
o ETOH Use Questionnaire (note ETOH use will also be assessed during MD interview with SP)  
The Study Coordinator  will complete:  
o Vitals Signs (Safety Measure)  
o MMSE (Mini -Mental State Examination)  
o Logical Memory I and II  
The CDR Rater  will complete:   
o Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) Scale  
The referring Memory Clinic Physician or the rTMS  Study Physician will perform  
the following medical evaluations  
o Medical history form /Initial Health Assessment 
o Physical, neurological examination  
(PE and NE within the past 12 months will be acceptable)  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  27 o Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score  
o Concomitant Medications & Key Backgrou nd Medications  
o MCI Diagnostic Worksheet  (normal, MCI and subtype, or dementia)  
o Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Form  
The TMS Operator  will administer  the following:  
o MRI (and rTMS) Safety Screening   
o Motor Thresho ld (Left Hemisphere)  
If the MMSE is less than 24, the Study Coordinator will alert the PI , who will decide whether 
the remaining  screening  evaluations should proceed, or whether to end the screening visit 
early and inform the individual that the study is not a good fit for them.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_269634] been 
met and  the previously consented individual agrees to participate.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  eligibility will  
be determined within 2 weeks  of completing  the screening evaluation; enrollment will 
occur as soon as the individual expresses willingness  to participate.    
The Study Coordinator will record the participant’s eligibility status, willingnes s to enroll, 
and the enrollment date on the Enrollment and Randomization Form .   
Randomization  
The Data Manager/SAS Analyst will receive the Study Coordinator’s emailed copy of the 
Enrollment and Randomization Form .  The Data Manager will randomize the participant 
using the randomization method described in Section 9.2.1 “Treatment Assignment 
Procedures.”  Once the participant is assigned, the Data Manager will record the date of randomization on the form and return the fo rm to the Study Coordinator for data entry.   
The Data Manager email s the following information to the TMS Operator and the MRI  Data 
Analyst:  
1. TMS Operator : receives the participant ID, the randomly assigned 6 -digit treatment 
code, and the randomly assig ned cortical site (DLPFC or LPC).  The 6 -digit code 
masks whether the assigned treatment is active or sham .  (This code maps to the 
TMS device’s pre- programmed table of treatment codes.)  The site assignment is 
unmasked.  
2.  MRI  Data Analyst:  receives the participant ID and the randomly assigned cortical site 
assignment for use in subject -specific fMRI -guided neuronavigation of coil 
placement.   
Randomization will occur at least 14 days before the initiation of study intervention.  
As noted above, the time w indow from the beginning of Screening to the completion of 
Baseline Assessments is  42 days; t he time window from the completion of Baseline to the 
initiation of the  intervention is 7 ±[ADDRESS_269635]- specific fMRI -guided 
neuronavigation of coil placement.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  28 Baseline Assessments  (Visit 2)  
Baseline assessments are only performed for  consented particip ants who have completed 
screening, have met all  eligibility criteria, are willing,  and have enrolled  into the study . 
All Baseline imaging  and medical /cognitive assessments must take place within a  1-week 
timeframe.   The se Baseline assessments must be completed at least 7 days b efore initiation 
of the  intervention.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the  Baseline assessments will  be completed during a single 
visit, lasting 4 to 5 hours . 
The following assessments will be  performed  at the Baseline Visit:  
The Study Coordinator  will  complete:  
o Concomitant Medications  (update of previously recorded medications)  
o Adverse Event Monitoring ( to capture a new or a worsening ongoing  condition)  
o Repeat of MRI (and rTMS) Safety form  
o MRI scan: 40 minutes of scan- time, which includes : 
 Scout an d calibration scans  
 3D T1- weighted anatomical scan

The Participant  and Study Partner  will independently complete the Everyday 
Cognition (ECog)  questionnaire (Farias et al., 2008) . 
The Study Partner will complete the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ)  
(Pfeffer, Kurosaki, Harrah, Chance, & Filos, 1982) . 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  29 Brief Descriptions of Behavioral  Assessments 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA ) (Nasreddine et al., 2005) .  The Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment test (MoCA) is, similar to the MMSE, a brief, [ADDRESS_269636]- II  (CVLT- II) (Delis et al., 2000), primary efficacy measure).  
The CVLT is a list- learning task that assesses multiple aspects of verbal learning and verbal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682].  List A of the CVLT -II contains 16 concrete words; four words each from 
four categories (animals, vegetables, ways of traveling , and furniture).  List A is presented 
for [ADDRESS_269637] (B), a short -delay free 
recall and cued recall of list A is performed.  After a 20 -minute delay filled with nonverbal 
testing,  long -delay free recall and cued recall are assessed, followed by [CONTACT_224168]/no recognition 
of list A.  
Brief Visuospatial Memory Test–Revised (BVMT -R) (Benedict et al., 1996) ).  The BVMT- R 
assesses visual memory.  The BVMT- R has  six alternate, equivalent forms.  Each test form 
consists of a) 6 sets of geometric figures, each set arranged as  a 2x3 array and printed  on a 
page  of the Recall Stimulus Booklet;  and b) [ADDRESS_269638], Parts A & B  (Partington & Leiter, 1949; Reitan, 1958).  These two tests 
progress from a numerical connect- the-dots puzzle to a more challenging alternation 
between alpha- and numerical order.  Although both Parts A and B depend on visuomotor 
and perceptual -scanning skills, Part B also requires cognitive flexibility in shifting from 
number to letter sets under time pressure. 
[LOCATION_011] Naming Test (BNT ) Huff et al. (1986)  42-items, two -equivalent f orms .  The BNT 
assesses the ability to verbally name [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_224114].  The subject is shown a series of line 
drawings and asked to name [CONTACT_87223].  If the correct name [CONTACT_224201] 20 seconds, then a semantic cue (e.g., “kind of a building” for “house”) is offered.  If 
the correct name [CONTACT_224202] [ADDRESS_269639] items  become progressively more difficult (items are presented in 
order of decreasing frequency of  the target word) . 
Rey-O
sterrieth Complex Figure ( ROCF ) (Hubley, 2010; Hubley & Jassal, 2006); copy task 
only ).  The complete Rey -Osterrieth Complex Figure Test is designed to measure 
visuospatial constructional ability and visual memory.  In this clinical trial, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test–Revised  (described below) has been selected for assessment of 
visual memor y, and the ROCF copy task will be used to assess visuospatial constructional 
ability .  The participant will be presented with the complex figure and asked to copy it.  
Category Fluency  
 (Strauss et al., 2006) .  This i s a measure of verbal fluency in which the 
participant is asked to generate examp les from a semantic category during a one -minute 
period . 
Attentional Network Task (ANT ) (Fan et al., 2002; Posner, 2012; Y. -F. Wang et al., 2015)  
(Y.-F. Wang et al., 2015) .  The ANT was developed by  [CONTACT_224169]- time measures of the efficiency of alerting,  orienting and executive attention.  
Posner has proposed that each  attentional  function is  subserved by [CONTACT_224170] (S. E. Petersen & Posner, 2012; Posner, 2012) .  The ANT requires  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  30 participants to determine whether a central arrow  in a set of 5 arrows points  left or right.  
The basic design of the ANT incorporates  a combination of  Posner’s cued reaction time 
(RT)  task  (Posner, 1980) and the flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). Efficiency  of 
orienting, alerting, and executive attention is assessed by [CONTACT_224171], spatial cues, and congruent or incongruent flankers.  
Overall, the task has been deliberately kept short and simple so that it can be used  with 
adults, children, monkeys, and patients with mild abnormalities of attention, and so that reliable estimates  of the three attentional networks can be obtained within a half hour.  
Everyday Cognition (ECog ) (Farias et al., 2008) .  This instrument assesses for very mild 
functional impairment as may occur in MCI.  The ECog is an informant- rated questionnaire, 
but participants will also be asked to  complete a self -reported version of the same 
questionnaire.  It looks at everyday function in seven key cognitive domains: memory, language, semantic (factual) knowledge, visuospatial abilities, planning, organization and divided attention.  ECog correlates well with well -known established measures of  
functional status and global cognition.  ECog can differentiate between individuals 
diagnosed with mild impairment in memory only and those mild impairment in several cognitive domains. ECog correlates weakly with age and education.  
Functional Assessment Questionnair e
  (FAQ)  (Pfeffer et al., 1982) . The F AQ consists of 10 
questions  to ascertain the level of performance  of daily function activities, including:  
paying bills;  assembling tax records  or other papers; shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224115];  playing a game or 
working on a hobby; ke epi[INVESTIGATOR_224116]; understanding a TV program, book, 
or magazine; remembering appointments, family occasions, and medications; and driving  
or arranging to take public transportation. The four levels ranging from dependence or 
prep aring meals.  Each of the 10 items  is scored  as one of four levels of independence 
(normal =0, has difficulty =1, requires assistance=2, and  dependent=3).  
Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form  (GDS ) (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986) .  The GDS Short 
Form is a self -report scale designed to screen for symptoms of  depression in the elderly .  
Note: the GDS is collected at the Screening Visit and at all three post- intervention Follow -
up Visits.  
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)  (Morris, 1993) .  The CDR is a 5 -point scale used to 
characterize level of functioning in six domains of cognitive and functional performance 
applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias.  The six domains are:  Memory, 
Orie ntation, Judgment & Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home & Hobbies, and 
Personal Care.  The information to make each rating is obtained through a semi- structured 
interview of the participant and a reliable collateral source, the Study Partner .  In addition 
to ratings for each domain, an overall CDR score is  calculated through the use of 
an algorithm ; the overall scores are: 0 = Normal; 0.5 = Questionable  Dementia; 1 = Mild 
Dementia; 2 = Moderate Dementia; 3 = Severe Dementia. As in ADNI,  a clinical diagnosis of 
MCI requires an overall CDR score = 0.5.   Note: the CDR is rated at the Screening Visit only.  
 
6.2.3  Intervention Visits  (Visits 3 – 12) 
A participant will receive a total of [ADDRESS_269640] a 
morning session and an afternoon session during a one- day clinical visit.  Accordingly,  2 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  31 intervention sessions are recorded as a single “visit” and the visits are numbered from 
Visits [ADDRESS_269641] intervention session (Visit 3)  needs to take place during a window of 7 ±3 days 
after the completion of the Baseline assessments.   An Intervention session is  scheduled as a 
1-hour block to allow time for late arrivals, assessment of adverse effects, and for the 20 -
minute rTMS intervention.  At the study physician’s discretion and if the par ticipant 
requests, up to three rTMS sessions can be scheduled per day with at least one hour 
between sessions.  
To be fully adherent, the participant should complete 20 sessions within 30 calendar days.  
The following assessments and procedures will be perfo rmed  at the Intervention Visits:  
First Intervention Sessi on ( am,  Visit 3 : Overnight fasting is necessary )  
o Concomitant Medications (update of previously recorded medications)

Brief Descriptions of Asse ssments During the Intervention  Phase  
Concomitant medications and  AE monitoring .  Concomitant medication use (prescription, 
natural food products, and “over the counter”) will b e updated  at each morning 
intervention session .  During the intervention phase, medication use is recorded by [CONTACT_224173].  The Study Physician will be apprised of changes in medications.  
rTMS Safety Questionnaire.  The items of the Safety  Questionnaire cover changes in mental 
and physical health, sleep patterns, changes in prescribed medications , recent alcohol 
consumption, and recent use of non- prescribed drugs .  The  questionnaire is completed by 
[CONTACT_2299], in collaboration with the participant’s study partner.  S ee Section 7.1.4 
“rTMS: Safety and AE Monitoring during the rTMS Study Treatment Sessions 1 -20,” for 
additional information on study staff responsibilities.  
rTMS Intervention Log  (adapted from VA CSP 556) .  The rTMS In tervention Log has [ADDRESS_269642] adherence- related 
information (Treatment Completed (Y/N), # of minutes of treatment c ompleted, and 
comments as to why treatment was not c ompleted  or what adjustments were made to 
improve tolerability ).  These intervention- related  data will be entered in the study 
database.   See also Section 7.1.4 “rT MS: Safety and AE Monitoring during the rTMS Study 
Treatment Sessions 1 -20.” 
Vital Signs .  Vital signs, including temperature and weight, will be measured at all morning 
intervention sessions.  Blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and pulse will be measured in the sitting position.  
Fasting Blood Sample s
 .  Blood samples for  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , plasma -, and serum -derived 
biomarkers and will be collected at Intervention Session 1.  Blood for p lasma and serum  
biomarkers will be collected again at Intervention Session 19. 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  33 Procedures for Sample Collection .  FASTING OVERNIGHT (MINIMUM 6 HOURS) IS 
REQUIRED.  Only water is permitted until blood draws are completed.  The study visit 
schedule include s time for b reakfast after the fasting blood  sample is drawn.  
CONSENT TO DRAW BLOOD:  When samples are collected, the Study C oordinator will 
confirm  the subject consented to biomarker collection per prior written informed consent.  
If the participant consented to biomarker collection, but is unable to provide a blood 
sample, a saliva sample can be collected for the genetic research.  
Table  3 summarizes the timing and sequence of sample collection, and the instructions  
for the immediate handling of samples.

o Each of t he assessments performed at the 3 -Month Follow -up will be repeated.  
o The Study Completion/ Participant Withdrawal Form will be filled out to 
document  the participant’s completion of the study . 
 
6.2.5  Study Completion s, Withdrawals , Early Discontinuations and 
Terminations  
Study Completions and Withdrawals  
Visit 15 serves as  the participant’s final evaluation.   If a participant withdraws from the 
study  before Visit [ADDRESS_269643] the reason for the withdrawal  
of consent .  If the withdrawal  from the study  is due to a  Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) or 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect ( UADE ), the participant will be followed by [CONTACT_224175] [ADDRESS_269644].   Adverse Events  (AEs), SAEs, and Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) are defined and 
discussed in more detail in Section 7.3.  
Early Discontinuation of the Study In tervention  
If a participant has a seizure during the intervention phase , the intervention will be 
discontinued  immediately and completely.   A VA Outpatient Neurology Outpatient Consult 
evaluation will be requested to provide an understanding of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_224117], and whether follow -up care is needed .  Study staff will  then follow the 
partic ipant by [CONTACT_224176],  and report this SAE 
promptly per the appended protoco l Appendix VI .  “Seizure Protocol .” 
If it is determined that a participant is using medications or abusing substances that increase risk of having  a seizure, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224118].  If the study 
physician or PI [INVESTIGATOR_224119]’s best interest to discontinue intervention 
because clinical judgment is that the intervention is not safe or tolerable for the participant , 
the intervention will be discontinued.   
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  35 In each  of these situations that lead  to early discontinuation of the intervention, the 
participant will be asked to undergo  the assessments that are normally administered 
during the Follow -up Phase ( i.e. all assessments for Visits 13, 14, and 15 ). 
Early Termination of Participation  
Study enroll ees are unlikely to be terminated from the study per se, unless an SAE occurs 
prior to the first rTMS session;  or, if after enrollment, the investigators determine that the 
participant is  ineligible.   
Documentation of Study Status  
Whenever a participant  withdraws , is terminated, or completes  Visit 15 , the Study 
Completion /Participant Withdrawal  Form  will be filled out to formally d ocument and 
track the enrollees’ study status .  
 
7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Expected AEs ; Safety screening ; Modifications and management  if an AE 
occurs  
Expected adverse experiences , monitoring  of participant safety,  and  modifications or 
management i n case an AE  occurs  are described below for each study intervention, in order 
of procedural flow , starting with the Baseline MRI : 
7.1.1  MRI  
MRI has potential risks and discomforts but with careful screening of patients and 
adherence to manufacturer’s operation instructions, many  adverse events  can be 
prevented  (Shellock, 2001; Sh ellock, 2002) .  
MRI Safety Screening  (Telephone pre- screening; Visits 1, 2,  and 13)  
Serious adverse events (SAEs)  occur if  ferromagnetic objects (particularly when 
implanted) or electromechanical devices such as  pacemakers enter the MRI.  To assess for 
MRI Safety , all subjects will be rigorously screened by [CONTACT_224177], or cardiac pacemaker.  This safety screening is part o f routine clinical 
practice at MRI centers and is performed before any subject is permitted to enter the 
scanning room.   
The MRI Safety  Form provides screening  for factors that might affect the participant’s  
comfort in the MRI environment. These factors i nclude claustrophobia and back pain that 
interferes with their ability to lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] a prolonged period.  Individuals who know 
they are severely claustrophobic would be excluded from participating in the study.  People 
with weight or size above the size allowable by [CONTACT_224178].  While it is unlikely that women in this study will be of childbearing age, the formal, written screening form lists pregnancy as exclusion.   
Safety Procedures  and Modifications during an MRI  Scan Session  (Visits 2 and 13)  
Anxiety .  Any participant who experiences anxiety when placed into the MR scanner will 
be pulled out of the scanner, offered reassurance by [CONTACT_224179], and 
offered the option of c ontinuing or terminating the scan.  There will be no attempt to 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269645] the participant regarding follow -up with the 
participant’s physician.  Image data collected in the course of the research project wil l not 
be made available for diagnostic purposes because they do not comprise a full clinical MRI 
series.  
Investigational MRI .  Some of the imaging software are not FDA approved, but have been 
tested for safety and are very similar to what is used regularl y in clinical MR examinations. 
The MR personnel are highly trained in the set- up, monitoring , and use  of this  software .  
Metal .  There is a slight risk that someone will accidently bring metal into the MRI scanner 
room, which might be pulled into the MRI m agnet and injure the participant.  M R personnel 
work with the participant to make sure such objects are removed and stored in a locker 
before entering the magnet room.  
Medical emergency.  In the unlikely event of a medical emergency, the Stanford University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Emergency Department is a nearby, where medical intervention can be provided 
by [CONTACT_224180].   See Appendix VII.  “MRI Emergency 
Protocol”.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_269646] 
party . 
7.1.4  rTMS  
TMS Safety Screening  (Telephone pre- screen and Visit 1 in- person screen ) 
To minimize risks and AEs related to rTMS, the same ferromagnetic safety policies and 
procedures  described above for MRI  will be applied to rTMS safety screening.    During the 
consenting and history taking process, we emphasize to participants that giving false information about their medical history, including past and present drug use, could have serious  consequences for their health and  well -being.  
Individuals who might be prone to seizures (e.g. have had a recent traumatic brain injury, have history of a seizure disorder, need to be on medications that substantially increase the 
risk of having se izures , or abuse medications or use illegal substances that can increase the 
chance of having a seizure) will be excluded from this study , as documented on the Medical 
History and the Inclusion/Exclusion Forms .  
Even though psychotic symptoms and suicidal ideation have been never described in 
normal subjects during or after rTMS, there is a report of one patient with major 
depressive disorder who developed delusions during rTMS treatment (Zwanzger, Ella, 
Keck, Rupprecht, & Padberg, 2002) .  In the present MCI rTMS study, participants with a 
Geriatric Depression Scale score ≥ 6 will not be eligible to enroll. (They will be referred for 
evaluation and treatm ent of their depressive symptoms.)    
Safety  and AE Monitoring  during the rTMS Study Treatment Sessions  1-20 
Eligible participants will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_224181]/device and to document adverse effects.   
At the beginning of every morning treatment sessio n, the participant will be asked about 
changes in mental and physical heal th, sleep patterns, changes in prescribed medications , 
recent alcohol consumption, and recent use of non -prescribed drugs , using  the TMS Session 
Safety Questionnaire.  This questionnaire will be used by [CONTACT_224182] .  All AEs wil l be documented on th e Adverse Event form.   
In case of a safety concern, the Study Coordinator or TMS Operator will alert the Study 
Physician before proceeding with rTMS.  I f the participant reports  having had less than one 
hour  of sleep  the previous night, the rTMS session will postponed until the participant’s 
sleep pattern improves.  D uring every  session , the rTMS O perator will monitor the  
participant’ s ear protection, coil placement, and possible seizure activ ity.  The log sheet 
explicitly reminds the Operator to notify the Study Physician in the event of a change in medication, change in sleep pattern, recent consumption of more than [ADDRESS_269647] drug.   Motor thresholds  (MTs)  will be rechec ked at the S tudy P hysician’s 
direction. Rechecked MTs and power outputs will be documented in the participant’s 
intervention log .   
If an AE occurs:  Risk management, m odifications , and assessments  
Discomfort .  Should a headache or site discomfort occur, these symptoms are expected to 
be self -treated  (e.g. with ibuprofen) .  Report ed levels of d iscomfort often  diminish in later 
sessions in the absence of over the counter ( OTC)  pain medications .  If dental pain occurs, 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269648] possible hearing damage, participants will wear ear 
protection during rTMS sessions.  
Syncope . Occa sionally, syncope occurs  with TMS, particularly in initial sessions.  Staff will 
provide reassurance and monitor the participant for level of anxiety and psycho -physical 
discomfort.  Premonitory complaints are: “I need to lie down”, or “I need air” “I think I’m 
going to black out.” Visceral d istress, nausea, dizziness, pallor, and diaphoresis are other 
symptoms.  Upward eye deviation, which is common in circulatory syncope, is rare in 
partial seizures unless there is progression to generalized convulsions.  Because 
participants  will be reclined in a chair during the stimulation procedure, the risk of syncope 
and a fall -related injury are lower.   Study s taff will be trained to be first responders to these 
unlikely events,  and will know to call the VAPAHCS facility ’s E-Team as a proactive 
measure .  Uncomplicated syncope not  requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224120]; the seriousness of the AE is a clinical judgement of the study physician.  
Seizure.  T he VAPAHCS facility where the rTMS treatment sessions are  performed is fully 
equipped to  safely  handle a seizure.   The initial management of  syncope and seizure is 
identical .  Clinically, the cardinal feature that distinguishes syncope from seizure is rapid 
recovery of consciousness within seconds and not minutes .  Delayed recovery of normal 
consciousness beyond 30 seconds mandates further evaluation and a neurological work -
up.  The participant will be treated  at the study site for any medical or psychologi cal 
consequences .  Procedures for medical care, for documenting this study -specific SAE, and 
for monitoring the outcome of a seizure- related  SAE  are described separately in seizure 
safety protoc ol (see Appendix VI .  “Seizure Protocol”).  
7.2 Summary of Safety Assessments  
Safety will be measured based on the occurrence of serious adverse events, such as 
seizures , and syncope that  result s in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Tolerability  of rTMS  will be based on 
the number of adverse events reported (grouped per side effect  type) and number o f 
dropouts due to AEs and other reasons  during the intervention phase of the study .   
All AEs  will be documented on th e Adverse Event form .   If the AE is serious, then the SAE 
will be further documented on the SAE Form.  Briefly, the form s contain the event 
description, severity, outcome, recovery date, and other follow -up information.   
7.3 Adverse Events  and  Serious Adverse Events  
Definitions for Adverse E vents  (AEs)  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any  untoward medical occurrenc e, including any  abnormal sign, 
symptom,  or disease temporally  associated with study participation, whether or not 
considered related to participation in the research .   
 An AE is deemed to be associated with the use of the study device if there is “a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_8121].”   
 Chronic problems which are unchanged from baseline are not considered AEs.  However, worsening of an ongoing condition would be considered an AE.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) is a n adverse event that  
 results in death   
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  39  is life- threatening , or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred  
 requir es or prolong s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 leads to  persistent or significant disability or incapacity   
 is a seizure ( Note: intervention- specific SAE definition)  
 Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards . 
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  is an SAE  caused by [CONTACT_1282]  a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety , or welfare of patients.    
Time span  of collecting AEs and SAEs 
Collection of  all adverse events  will begin at the time the participant signs the informed 
consent form and will continue throughout the [ADDRESS_269649] -intervention follow -up phase:    
 At the Baseline visit, the participant and study partner (SP) will be asked about 
changes in medications, any other health or behavior changes , and  any medical 
care received since the Screening visit;   
 At each Intervention session, the participant will be asked about any side effects experienced.  At eac h morning Intervention session, the participant will 
additionally be asked about any  changes in medications , any other health or 
behavior changes, and any medical care received;   
 At the Immediate Post- Intervention Follow -up visit, the participant will be asked 
about any side effects experienced since last seen, and any changes in medications, 
any or other health or behavior changes since the previous visit or phone follow -
up, and any medical care received ;  
 At the 3 - and 6 -Month Follow -up visits, the partic ipant will be asked about any 
changes in medications, medical care received , or other health or behavior 
changes since the previous visit or phone follow -up.  
In summary, study staff will s creen for new AEs/SAEs  and review any unresolved 
AEs/SAEs at each e ncounter with the participant.   
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
Time lines for reporting AEs and SAEs  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_30496] w ill notify the DSMB and the NIA Program Official of all SAEs 
(regardless of intervention vs. follow -up phase) by [CONTACT_224183] 24 hou rs of study 
staff’s knowledge of the event.  
 The emailed , expedited report will be followed by a detailed, written initial SAE 
report as soon as possible.   
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_224121].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_224122]’s HRPP Policy Guidance “Events and Information that Require Prompt Reporting to the IRB“ GUI -
P13 1/3 (see Appendix X). 
All adverse events will be reported annually or more often to the DSMB, Stanford IRB, and 
NIA staff.   
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  40  The study’s Data Manager will generate tabulations of all AEs (including SAEs and 
non-serious AEs) and present a summary of these to the DSMB and NIA staff  on a 
schedule set by [CONTACT_4318].   
 Aggregate summaries of SAEs and non- serious AEs will also be reported annually 
to the Stanford IRB.   
Procedures  and forms for recording AEs  
Any new condition, recurrence of a previously resolved condition, or worsening of a pre-
existing condition will be reported as an AE.   (The Screening Visit Medical History Form 
provides a  list of all pre -existing conditions and whether each  condition is resolved or 
ongoing.)  
All adverse events (including adverse device effects) will be recorded on the AE report form (based on NIH Template AE form 9a) and, if severe,  on the SAE form (based on NIH 
Template SAE form 9b).  B oth SAEs and UADEs will be recorded using SAE form 9b.  All 
adverse events will be assessed as “Not related,” “Possibly related,” or “Definitely Related” to the intervention or to other study procedures.   
Decisions regarding AE relatedness and severity  
The Study Physician will be responsible for decisions regarding relatedness and severity.   
Assessment of st udy relatedness .  Relatedness involves an assessment of the degree of 
causality between the study intervention and the event. Relatedness can be assessed by 
[CONTACT_224184]:   
 Previously reported with this treatment,  
 Occurred after treatment began,  
 Improved when treatment is withdrawn or a specific antagonist administered,  
 Reappearance upon re- challenge,  
 No a lternative causes for the reaction,  
 Increased severity when dose increased or lessened when dose decreased,  
 Patient previously had similar reaction when exposed to the treatment,  and  
 Reaction confirmed by [CONTACT_224185].  
Study -relatedness criteria.  
 All adverse events or effects with a clear causal relationship to the intervention or 
to the procedures involved in the research should be considered “ Definitely 
related ”.   
 All adverse events or effects with a possible causal relationship to the intervention or to the procedures involved in the research should be considered “ Possibly  
related ”.   
 In general, if event is determined to be caused  solely  by [CONTACT_113363], 
disorder, or condition of the subject, or due to other circumstances unrelated to 
either the research or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject, 
it would be considered “ Unrelated”  to participation in the research.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  41 Study Staff Responsibilities  
 During the pre-  and post- intervention phase of the study, the Study Coordinator 
will be responsible for collection of initial AEs, follow -up of AEs  (see Section 7.5)  
and completion of  AE forms.  
 The TMS Operator will be responsible for initial AE collection, follow -up, and form 
completion during the intervention phase.  
 The Study Physician will be  responsible for reviewing  all AEs and for making 
decisions regarding relatedness and severity.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_224123] , for monitoring the AE data to avoid double capture of AEs , and  for 
monitoring charts and CRFs for  documentation of the physician’s  review of AEs .  
7.5 Foll ow-up of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, or until the patient’s participation in the study 
ends.  For a participant who ends study participation prior to  the 3 -month follow -up visit 
(Visit 14) , unresolved SAEs/UADEs will be monitored and reported for [ADDRESS_269650]- seen.  
An AE will be considered “ resolved ” when one of the following criteria are met:  
 Health has returned to baseline status or applicable variables have returned to normal.  
 The event has stabilized and the study staff expect no further improvement or worsening of the event.  
If the Adverse Event does not resolve and it has been determined that the condition is 
stable or chronic, then the event can be considered  “resolved with sequelae”.  
The study staff are also responsible for f ollowing up on AE/SAE information that was 
initially incomplete.  Whenever new information about an SAE  is obtained , the staff is 
responsible for reporting the follow -up information as soon as it becomes available.  
Examples of incomplete AE/SAE informatio n that may require follow up:  
 An event for which complete information was not available at the time of 
reporting to the DSMB or NIA Program Official.  
 Update or new information related to an event that was previously reported (e.g. receipt of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n records, clarity from study participant on event details).  
7.6 Safety Monitorin g and other DSMB Reporting  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_60414]’ safety on a daily basis. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to 
monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, to review pro cedures for 
maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and 
analyses.  The DSMB will also determine when they should be un- blinded to treatment 
assignment for the reviewing of AE data and evaluating whether the aggr egate AE 
information may also qualify as a UP.  The DSMB will advise the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224124].  
DSMB will meet twice annually, typi[INVESTIGATOR_224125], data quality, and participants’ safety.  The DSMB may decide to meet less frequently (such 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  42 as annually) and may receive a data report for their review in- between meetings.  The 
DSMB will disch arge itself from its duties when the last participant completes the study.  
Open -Session Reports to the DSMB will include  information on:  (1) recruitment and 
overall study status; (2) participants descriptive information; (3) safety information, and 
(4) information on study quality.   The contents of the report will be based on the NIH 
Single- site Open DSMB Reports Templa tes.  Appendix IX  “Data and Safety Monitoring” 
provides an outline of the various tables and charts that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224126].  For example, a recruitment- related  table will show the reasons for screen failures, 
including any refusals to donate blood or saliva  for DNA extraction.   
For Closed -Session reports, the Study’s Data manager will generate AE reports using 
modified NIA templates with information reported by [CONTACT_47123] (A, B, C). 
The final content and format of the repo rts for both the open and closed sessions will be 
determined by [CONTACT_4318].  Throughout the trial, the DSMB may request changes in the 
content or format of the reports.  
Special Procedures for the Monitoring of Seizures  
As addressed in the rTMS Safety Section 7.1.1, participants will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_224186]/device.  In the unlikely event that a seizure occurs, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l where this rTMS study will be conducted is fully equipped and staffed 
to respond to a seizure.  The study staff will be trained as first responders, and trained  to 
carry out the “Seizure Protocol” previously developed by [CONTACT_64106] 556 investigators (see Appendix VI ).  Procedures for medical care, for documenting  and reporting  this study -
specific SAE, and for monitoring the outcome of a seizure- related SAE are described 
separately in the seizure safety protocol .  
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
8.1 Permanent disco ntinuation of the study intervention  
The study intervention will be discontinued if:    
 A participant has a seizure;  
 There are signs or reports of inability to tolerate the intervention .  Specifically, the 
participant will no longer continue with the intervention if the participant either 
reports or indicates upon questioning that a side effect (such as a headache) is not 
well tolerated despi[INVESTIGATOR_224127] -treatment (e.g. severe in intensity and persists beyond 
the first week of treatment), or if the study ph ysician feels it is in the participant’s 
best interest to discontinue with the intervention.  
 Or, any  other health or safety concern that contraindicates continuation,  based on 
the judgment of the study physician.  
Continued follow -up will occur in each of these cases.  T he participant will be closely 
monitored and treated for any medical or psychological consequences.  The Study Coordinator will be responsible for phone follow -ups to check on the participant’s well -
being and to collect follow -up AE information.   
Such p articipants will be encouraged to return for all three post- intervention follow -up 
evaluations (Visits 13, 14, and 15).   Except for the MRI scan (Visit 13), all other outcome 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  43 measures, safety assessments, and AE information would be collected  at the three follow -
up visits.  
8.2 Temporary  discontinuation of the study intervention  
The intervention will be temporarily discontin ued in case of a concern regarding safety or 
intolerability to rTMS.   
Recognized safety concerns  for eligible participants during intervention are: 
 Insufficient sleep;  
 Use of substances or medications that increase seizure risk .  
Tolerability concerns  include : 
 In case of headache or site application discomfort or other AE, the intervention 
can be temporarily discontinued either at the request of the participant or based 
on a physician’s recommendation . 
Modifications to the intervention schedule.  In the event of a safety concern, the Study 
Coordinator or TMS Operator will alert the Study Physician before proceeding with rTMS.  
If the participant reports having had less than one hour of sleep the previous night, the 
rTMS session will postponed until the participant’s sleep pattern improves.  If it is 
determined that a participant is using or abusing substances or medications that increase risk of having a seizure, the Study Physician and PI [INVESTIGATOR_224128].  
While a participant is temporarily discontinued from  receiving the intervention, t he Study 
Coordinator will be responsible for phone follow -ups to check on the participant’s well -
being  and, if applicable,  to collect  information regarding resolution and/or occurrence of 
adverse events.  
8.3 Replacement Subjects and Voluntary Withdrawals  
Replacements .  In the event of an SAE prior to the Baseline Visit or a medical emergency 
during a Baseline MRI, (i.e. prior to randomization), the intervention and study assessments will be canceled.  Such a participant would continue to be followed to  monitor recovery; 
however, active participation in the study would end for the participant’s safety, and because 
of unstable or uncertain health status.  (See also Appendix VII. “ MRI Emergency Protocol” and 
Section 7 above.)  Another subject will be enrolled to replace that participant .  
Voluntary withdrawals .  Subjects  may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the 
study at any time and for any reason.    If voluntary withdrawal occurs during the 
intervention phase, the p articipant will be encouraged to return for all three post-
intervention follow -up evaluations (Visits 13, 14, and 15).  Except for the MRI scan (Visit 
13), all other outcome  measures , safety assessments, and AE information would be 
collected at the three follow -up visits.   If an AE or SAE begins during the intervention phase 
and the participant decides to withdraw, the Study Coordinator will continue to do phone 
follow -ups to check on the  participant’s well -being and to collect follow -up AE information.   
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269651] .  The length of an appropriate washout period for rTMS has not 
been established  for this rTMS intervention protocol in this population.   
Primary H ypothesis   
The primary hypothesis is that participants  receiving active (“real”) rTMS will show more 
improvement in memory at the immediate post -treatment assessment than the placebo 
(sham) control group.   The sham group is comprised of all subjects assigned to the sham 
group, regardless of the position of the sham coil.  
Testing the primary hypothesis  involves two statistical tests:  Test 1 will compare  Active 
DLPFC to sham; Test [ADDRESS_269652] reliability  (Total and Del ayed: r  >  .75) , diagnostic 
validity (Rabin et al., 2009)  (Silva et al., 2012) , and normative data on a representative 
sample .  The CVLT,  which is comprised of 16 concrete words presented for 5  learning  trials, 
helps achieve a wide range of scores that are neither at floor nor at ceiling level (Ellis et al., 
2009; Karrasch, Sinerva, Gronholm, Rinne, & Laine,  2005; Ribeiro, de Mendonca, & 
Guerreiro, 2006) .  An additional advantage of the CVLT- II is the availability of  alternate test 
form s. 
Secondary Anal yses    
This study, was originally proposed in response to NIH/NIA PAR -16-365 “ Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224129]’s Disease and Age- related Cognitive Decline (R01) .”  In 
addition to testing the primary hypothesis  to learn whether rTMS is a viable 
nonpharmacological intervention for treatment of MCI , this study was designed to  address 
essential questions of durability, choice of site, and prediction of response.  Inform ation 
gained  from this study  will inform efforts to optimize rTMS effectiveness  and pave the way 
for further clinical development.  From this perspective, we plan to examine durability of 
rTMS over the 6- month follow -up, and  to describe effects of rTMS on secondary cognitive 
and behavioral outcomes, as described below:  
 (Grant Aim 2a) As sess the d urability of rTMS effects :  The primary efficacy 
measure, the CVLT -II Trials 1- [ADDRESS_269653] of 
rTMS on memory will be sustained up to 3  months.  
 (Grant Aim 2b.1)  Examine behavioral differences related to the s ite of brain 
stimulation:  T he secondary behavioral outcomes will be analyzed in longitudinal data 
analyses with respect to  the site of active stimulation (DLPFC or LPC).  The secondary 
behavioral outcomes of most interest are selected sub -scores of the CVLT -II.   
 Because the DLPFC and LPC have distinct roles in memory encoding  and  delayed 
recall (Long, Oztekin, & Badre, 2010) , our working hypothesis is that D LPFC 
stimulation could result in a higher level of  semantic clustering compared to  LPC 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269654], LPC stimulation could result in higher recall, assessed by 
[CONTACT_21405]- II short - and long -delayed recall scores.  An rTMS -induced increase in 
semantic clustering  would be a positive outcome  in MCI  because older  adults  who 
showed more semantic clustering on the CVLT -II were more cognitively stable 
over time (McLaughlin et al., 2014) .  An rTMS induced increase in delayed recall 
would also be clinically important.  
As part of addressing secondary Aim 2b.1, effects of rTMS on other secondary outcomes 
will be described .  These  outcomes  include  depressive symptoms , objective assessments of  
global cognitive function,  visuospatial epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], language, visuo -constructional 
ability, orienting of attention, information processing speed, executive function, and self - 
/partner -reported assessments of everyday cognitive functioning .  All m easures have  
demons trated re- test reliability and construct validity .  These secondary outcomes (whic h 
are described in Section 6.2.2 ) are  listed in Section 9.4. 2 below.  
 (Grant Aim 2b.2)  Changes in brain function related to the site of brain stimulation . 
This study is designed to  provide novel  information about the therapeutic mechanisms of 
rTMS in the target population .  Resting -state f MRI scans  will be acquired at the B aseline visit 
and the I mmediate P ost-Treatment visit t o examine ef fects of rTMS on brain functional 
connectivity .  Additionally , plasma levels of brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be 
measured before and at completion of the rTMS  intervention .     
 Our working hypothesis  is that BDNF levels will increase more in either active 
rTMS group, compared to that in the sham group.   
 Our working hypothesis is that rTMS will beneficially modulate functional 
connectivity within and between large -scale networks that are abnormal in MCI . 
Two analyses will be performed: (1) The aim of one set of analyses is to learn the 
extent to which rTMS  can restore connectivity within regions of the Default -Mode 
Network ( DMN ), especially to the hypo -connected PCC ; (2) The aim of the second 
set of analyses relates to between- network connectivity.  We will examine if  rTMS 
reduces abnormal ly strong functional connectivity between the Central Executiv e, 
and Default -Mode N etworks ( CEN and DMN ), as has been found preliminarily in 
rTMS studies on ameliorating depressive symptoms in TRMDD  and executive 
dysfunction in mild TBI .  Functional connectivity  metrics are outlined  in Section 
9.4.2 “Secondary neuroimaging outcomes.”   Analyses are outlined in Section 9.5.2  
“Secondary  Analyses.”  
 As part of addressing secondary Aim 2b.2, w e will explore the extent to which 
rTMS -induced changes in functional connectivity  correlate  with changes in 
selected behavioral variables , e.g., is the amount o f reduction in f unctional 
connectivity between the CEN and DMN  associated with improvement in executive 
function?   
(Grant Aim 2c)  Heterogeneity of response to rTMS .  We expect that baseline clinico -
demographic characteristics, baseline connectivity, and genetic variants may help explain 
individual differences in responsiveness  to rTMS, either generally, or to a particular rTMS 
site.  Selected baseline variables relevant to explaining heterogeneity  of response are 
outlined  in Data Analysis Sections 9.5.2.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269655] size (Cohen’s d = 0.80) of either rTMS treatment on the primary 
outcome .  Moderately large effect sizes of 1.0, 0 .80, and 0 .80 were reported in two meta-
analyses of rTMS studies in AD (Liao et al., 2015)  (Hsu et al., 2015)  and one rTMS trial in 
MCI (whi ch used unilateral rTMS (Drumond Marra et al., 2015) , deemed suboptimal by 
(Liao et al., 2015) ).  Our proposed design is estimated to have 80% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.8, for a 5% two -tailed test., with a multiple testing penalty for [ADDRESS_269656]. Adamson’s rTMS 
TBI trial at our site has been 0% so far.  T he rate of attrition in the rTMS MCI trial (Drumond 
Marra et al., 2015)  due to all reasons  was 6%.  Based on these rates of attrition,  we do not 
expect attrition to substantially reduce power or the interpretation of results.  If a participant in the present study discontinues the intervention early, we will encourage the participant to undergo all post -intervention assessments that are normally administered during the 
Follow -up Phase (Visits 13, 14, and 15).   If there are baselined participants who have missing 
outcome data, we will perform and report sensitivity analyses that include participants with missing data, and make plausible assumptions about their outcomes based on the observed data.   Additionally, the total minutes of rTMS received by [CONTACT_224187] a 
covariate in the data analyses.   
Attrition and  secondary  data analysis of behavioral outcomes .  For the durability 
analysis of rTMS effects, mixed -effect growth curve analyses will be used, which enables 
full utilization of repeatedly measured outcomes and minimizes bias if subjects drop out 
during the extended follow -up period of the study (Singer & Willett, 2003) .   
Likelihood of obtaining other useful secondary results.   In these secondary analyses, 
the proposed sample size will provide 80% power to detect a large difference (d = 1.00) 
related to the sit e of stimulation.  For all analyses, we will convey practical significance by 
[CONTACT_224188], in addition to reporting statistical significance.  
9.2.1  Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Participants will be randomized to  one of three treatment groups: (1) active rTMS of the 
DLPFC, (2) active rTMS of the LPC, or (3) sham rTMS (evenly split between each coil location).  An adaptive randomization scheme will be used so that equal numbers of 
participants will be randomized to each of the [ADDRESS_269657] 
of:  2 active DLPFC, 2 active LPC, 1 sham DLPFC and 1 sham LPC.  
The treatment numbers are non -sequential , and a  6-digit number is a ssigned to each 
participant.  This unique 6 -digit number will be key entered into the TMS device interface,  
whose  programming enables the device to deliver the appropriate treatment (active or 
sham) to that participant.   
Masking .  To ensure appropriate masking for the study , the Database Manager/SAS 
Programmer perform s the randomization of each participant to treatment and maintain s 
the randomization codes.  The Database Manager  will store the r andomization codes  in an 
encrypted restr icted -access file  on the server.   Only the D atabase M anager will know the 
link for randomization.  To prevent unplanned breaking of randomization codes, th e 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  47 Database M anager will utilize codes to refer to treatment groups, and maintain the link of 
these codes to the actual treatment groups in a separate file .   
Unmasking .  If a participant were to experience an SAE during the intervention phase, 
unmasking  of that participant’s treatment is permitted  only  if knowledge of the 
participant’s treatment assignment is necessary to protect patient safety .  The DSMB  will 
determine when they should be unmasked  to treatment assignment for the reviewing of  
adverse event data.  
9.[ADDRESS_269658].  The DMSB or NIA  will 
determine if a planned i nterim analysis  should be conducted.   If the DSMB requests a 
detailed safety review  of SAEs or severe AEs by [CONTACT_19313], then based on that review, the DSMB 
or NIA Officer will determine what steps will be taken.   
9.4 Outcomes  
Outcome measures will be collected by [CONTACT_201218] (study coordinator, imaging analyst, 
laboratory staff), and analyzed at study completion by [CONTACT_941] D atabase  Manager under the 
supervision of the Ph.D. biostatistician.

9.5 Data Analyses  
9.5.1.   Primary Hypothesis Testing  
o Analysis:  Test the hypothesis that active rTMS (to either stimulation site) is superior to 
sham in improving memory  performance, as observed at the  immediate post -treatment 
visit.  
o Method:  Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)   
o Population:   Int ention- to-treat (ITT), defined as all randomized patients who 
started at least 1 treatment session.  
o Independent variable:  rTMS Treatment group  
 ANCOVA 1:  active DLPFC vs sham  
 ANCOVA 2:  active LPC  vs sham  
o Dependent variable: Primary outcome, i.e. CVLT- II Trials 1 -5 Total raw score at 
Visit 13  
o Covariate:  CVLT- II Trials 1- [ADDRESS_269660] deviation of CVLT -II (Total 
Trials 1 -5) scores at baseline and post- treatment.   ANCOVA model parameters 
with estimates will be provided.  
o The two tests of treatment effects  will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 
0.05, adjusted for two tests; 2- sided confidence intervals will be displayed with a 
95% confidence level . 
9.5.2.   Secondary Analyses   
Durability of rTMS effects (Aim 2a)  
o Analysis: Longitudinal anal ysis of  primary efficacy measure ( memory 
performance) over the entire trial period  in relation to treatment group   
o Method: Mixed -effects growth curve modeling  
o Population:  ITT  
o Dependent variable:   CVLT- II Trials 1- 5 Total  raw score ( Visits 2, 13, 14, 15) 
o Independent variable:  rTMS T reatment group  
 Model  1:  active DLPFC vs sham  
 Model 2:  active LPC   vs sham  
o Results:  Mixed model parameters with estimates will be provided.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  49 o Contrasts:  T o convey the durability of the effect of each type of rTMS stimulation 
on the primary efficacy measure, the magnitude of  treatment  effects at the 3 -mos 
and 6 -mos time points will be reported . 
 
Analysis of behavioral differences related to stimulation site (Aim 2b.1)  
o Analysis:  Longitudinal analysis of behavioral changes over the entire trial period 
in relation to treatment group .  
o Method: Method: Mixed -effects growth curve modeling .  
o Population:  ITT.  
o Dependent variables:  Behavioral measures listed in Section 9.4.2.a (Visits 2, 13, 14 & 15).  Semantic clustering and delayed recal l sub -scores of the CVLT -II are of 
most interest.  
o Independent variable:  Active rTMS Treatment group (DLPFC vs LPC) . 
o Results:  Mixed model parameters with estimates will be provided.  
Analysis of effects on  brain function related to stimulation site (Aim 2b.2)  
As noted above, rs -fMRI data will be acquired at baseline (V isit 2) and  post -intervention 
(Visit 13)  to examine effects of rTMS on brain function.  Secondly, plasma levels of brain -
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be measured  at the first and last intervention 
sessions to gain information about mechanisms of action of rTMS  with respect to brain 
plasticity .   
BDNF levels  analysis  (two time- points).  As in the primary analysis,  ANCOVA will be used.   
Functional connectivity  (two time- points) .   
 To define the DMN and CEN  networks, we will perform seed -based whole brain 
analysis of the baseline fMRI data, using the methods of Greicius (for the DMN) 
and Vincent (for the CEN).  The networks will be broadly defined (p< .01) from the 
group data to generate inclusive masks of the DMN and CEN.  
 1) Analysis of  rTMS effects on PCC connectivity within the DMN.  As described in 
more detail in Appendix VIII, connectivity maps will be calculated by [CONTACT_224189]’s timeseries of the PCC seed -ROI with those of non -seed voxels 
in the DMN group mask, followed by [CONTACT_3493]’ r  to z transform of the values. 
Contrasts of the connectivity maps will be made (Pre- vs. Post- Tx, for each active 
rTMS vs. sham, and for active LPC vs. DLPFC).  The aim of these analyses is to 
discover the extent to which rTMS restores connectivity of the PCC within regions of the DMN.  rTMS -induced increases in PCC:hippocampal, PCC:parahippocampal, 
PCC:LP C, and/or PCC:mPFC connectivity would provide indications of therapeutic  
response (J. X. Wang et al., 2014; J. X. Wang & Voss, 2015; Ward et al., 2014) .   
  Analysis of  rTMS effects on between- network connectivity.  As explained in 
Appendix  VIII, we will define 6 a priori  ROIs: bilateral PCC  (posterior DMN) , and 
DLPFC  (key node of the CEN)  and medial PFC  (anterior DMN).  For each subject 
and scan session, a correlation matrix of ROI -pairwise timeseries correlations will 
be computed; next, each participant’s z -score matrix (using Fisher’s r -to-z 
transform) will be used to compute Pre -minus -Post changes in z values. These will 
be used in group -level analyses to compare each active rTMS to sham -control and 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  50 to compare active LPC to DLPFC.  The aim of these analyses is to examine the 
extent to which rTMS reduces functional connectivity between the DMN and CE N. 
Decreases in PCC:DLPFC  and mPFC:DLPFC between- network connectivity would 
provide indications of therapeutic response.   
 Finally, w e will explore the extent to which rTMS -induced changes in functional 
connectivity correlate with changes in selected behavior al variables (delayed 
recall, semantic clustering, executive function, and depression).  
Heterogeneity of response to rTMS (Moderators: Aim 2c).   
To explore the extent to which one treatment is superior over another as a function of a moderator variable, w e will fit regression models with interactions between the treatment 
group variable and a selected moderator  variable, yielding estimates of the regression line 
for each group.  In addition to reporting the magnitude of the interaction as a p value, we will obtain predicted values of the regression lines corresponding to each group .  (From 
these, we can estimate the superiority of one treatment over another as a function of the 
moderator; confidence intervals and p -values can be readily reported).  A s these are 
exploratory analyses, we would analyze individual moderators separately to avoid over -
fitting the models.   
Based on limited data from previous  TMS studies, the following classes of  moderators  are 
most likely to account for heterogeneity of respons e to rTMS in patients with MCI :  
 Profiles  of baseline c ognitive deficits , as defined by [CONTACT_21405] -II clustering and 
delayed recall scores ; 
 Brain endophenotypes, as defined by  a baseline  functional connectivity  metric for 
the L anguage, Central E xecutive, and Def ault -mode N etworks;  
 BDNF met carrier status (in other clinical populations, val/val genotype has 
predicted a better response to rTMS (Chang et al., 2014; Cheeran et al., 2008) ). 
In addition, gender and  racial/ethnic categorical variables will be examined to gauge the 
magnitude of any potential differences in response to rTMS in patients with MCI.  
Descriptive analyses of safety and tolerability 
Adverse events will be coded according to established Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) terms and summarized by [CONTACT_224190].  In most cases, aggregate safety and tolerability data (see S ection 7.2) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (counts, percentag es, mean and standard deviation) 
for all participants, by [CONTACT_224191] (i.e., intervention and follow -
up).  Summaries will indicate whether events were determined to be related to  the study 
device and whether the AE  led to treatment d iscontinuation.  Inferential comparisons may 
include t- tests or chi- square tests as appropriate.  T he time course of incidence of common 
treatment- related adverse effects  will be examined to characterize the extent to which  
participants accommodated to the treatment.  
 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  51 10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Management  
In this single- site study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224130].  The Database Manager will monitor all  data entered into the database by [CONTACT_224192] .  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_224131].  A formal review of  the accumulating data and any data integrity issues will be  
conducted at a meeting of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224132] M anager every 3 months during the active 
data collection period.  
Information about adverse events will be collected at each visit.  Any potentially s erious 
problem will be  brought immediately to the attention of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_122554].  
Biomarker/genetic information will be  stored in a separate password -protected file, in a 
separate database, which can only be accessed by [CONTACT_71392] D ata M anager  and MIRECC 
Senior Data Manager .  Only the Data Managers  can match genetic information with the 
participant ID (PID);  the Data Managers  are blind ed as  to which P ID is associated with 
which study participant . The genetic data will  only be used for analysis o f data conducted 
by [CONTACT_87137] . 
The Participant ID (PID) will be recorded on all data collection forms and entered into 
encrypted, password -protected databases located on physically secure VA servers behind a 
firewall.   
10.2 Data Collection Forms  
Data collection forms include:   
o Original copyrighted test forms  (e.g. CVLT -II);  
o Standard questionnaires  (e.g. ECog form and  GDS like those used in the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative [ ADNI ]);  
o Case report forms adapted from the NIH Clinical Tr ial Toolkit (e .g. Participant Demographic 
form, Enrollment  & Randomization form, Vital Signs form, and Adverse Event Forms ). 
o Forms developed specifically for this study, many of which were adapted from VA CSP #556 (e.g. Inclusion -Exclusion Form, and rTMS I ntervention Log sheet) . 
No data collection forms will show  an individual participant’s  identifiers , such as name [CONTACT_224203] .  For additional steps taken to maintain participants’ confidentiality, please see 
Section 11.3.   For information regarding which m embers of the study team will fill out the 
about forms, please see Section 6.2.  
10.[ADDRESS_269661] -required online 
training in Human Subjects, Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  Privacy, and HIPAA  before 
engaging in any study -related activities.  Each member of the study staff will have 
completed training specific to their scope of practice and specific to their roles before performing study procedures.  These types of training include:  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  52 TMS Training .  Didactic and practical hands -on training will be provided onsite to  the 
study staff at VA -Palo using the training model of the VA- funded, Mental Illness Research, 
Education, and Clinical Center ( MIRECC )-led "TMS Clinic al Roll- out" training program.  The 
trainers will be rTMS -certified physicians and nurses.   The didactic materials include the 
MagVita TMS Therapy User Guide for use with MagVenture MagPro devices, software 
version 7.1.  
Study Staff TMS Safety training .  Mul tiple study personnel, including the Study 
Coordinator and TMS Operator, will be trained comprehensively in TMS safety procedures, including: pre- session safety screening, solicitation and recognition of AEs, and training as 
first responders per the seizure protocol.  Knowledge will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_41680] a 
written examination that includes questions on what to do if there is a TMS -induced 
seizure.  Annual drills simulating a TMS emergency will be conducted to maintain staff 
preparedness.  
TMS Operator training .  T
 he TMS Operator will be trained to reach proficiency in all 
aspects of the rTMS intervention procedure , including: device operation, motor 
thresholding, coil placement for cortical targeting, and delivery of rTMS .  Proficiency will be 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_17588] a written test and by [CONTACT_4171]- based  testing  of all aspects of the 
rTMS intervention procedure.  Once the TMS Operator is  certified as proficient by [CONTACT_224193], the TMS Operator’s research scope of practice will allow the operator to 
independently administer rTMS under the supervision of an rTMS -certified physician.   This 
aspect of training is the “Core” component of TMS Certification.   Following completion of 
the Core training, the TMS Operator will be trained  to proficiency in the specific stimulation 
protocol of this study, and certified by [CONTACT_978].  
Assessments Training .  The Study Coordinator will be trained in the administration and 
scoring of the behavioral assessments by [CONTACT_978].  Training will take place in three phases:  self- study of the test manuals; practice in administering and scoring the assessments with a 
trained study coordinator (e.g. the ADNI  3 coordinator ), and finally observation by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_224133].  Th e PI [INVESTIGATOR_224134] . 
Training of Specific Assessments:  CDR . The CDR rater in this study will be another  
researcher  at the study site, so that the CDR —which is part of the screening visit diagnostic 
evaluation—will  be collected  independently of the outcome measures.  The CDR rater  will  
be certified through Washington University.  I f the  rater has never  been CDR certified, full 
certification will be  required.  The training includes nine (9)  reliability tapes.   The 
ratings/scores are compared to the Gold Standard and, if the rater passes,  Washington 
University will issue a certificate.  CDR Certification and Refresher Course can be found 
online at url: http://alzheimer.wustl.edu/cdr/application/step1.htm    
Experienced MIRECC  personnel associated with the Study Protocol .  The following 
long -time study staff have worked on NIH - and  VA-funded  protocols  that involve similar 
populations, assessments , biomarkers,  and/or interventions ( e.g. rTMS clinical trials , older 
adults , and cognitive outcomes ): 
Beatriz Hernandez , Database Manager and SAS Programmer ( 15% FTE) .  [CONTACT_224209] is presently studying for a Master’s in Statistics and has used SAS professionally for over [ADDRESS_269662] worked together 6+ years  on cognitive and MRI 
datasets.  She has performed complex analyses, including multiple linear regression modeling and mixed -effects growth curve modeling under the supervision of [CONTACT_224210].  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  53 She has substantial experience in database management, gained under the direction of Art 
Noda, the MIRECC Senior Data Manager.  [CONTACT_224211] will perform randomization of the 
subjects to treatment arms, to ensure that all other research staff are blinded.   [CONTACT_224209] will be responsible for setting up REDCap study database for the Study Coordinator to enter screening and other behavioral data.  S he will also be responsible for 
dataset merges in SAS and coding the data analyses and models involving the p rimary and 
secondary outcome measures .  
Phoebe ( Chun -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) Liao,  Laboratory Technician  (effort as needed).  [CONTACT_224212] and 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_224135] 10 years.  [CONTACT_224212], who has Bachelor’s Degree from UC Davis , 
has over [ADDRESS_269663], and will be carefully trained on all necessary aspects  of the 
protocol by [CONTACT_112016] -certified physicians, nurses , and the PI . 
 
10.3.2  Quality Control Metrics  
Outcome measure s will be entered using the procedures outlined in Section 10.2 “ Data 
Management ” above.  R ange checks  and automatically computed total scores will be 
utilized in RedCAP to enhance data quality.   Double data entry will be performed on 
randomly selected rec ords using RedCAP’s double data entry feature.  The percentage of 
errors detected will be captured and  tabulated for review by [CONTACT_1758]’s biostatistician and 
members of the DSMB . 
10.3.3  Protocol  Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be captured  using a  Protocol Deviation Log that is very similar to 
the NIH Clinical Trial Toolbox form.   
o Any serious protocol deviation (that meets the definition of an SAE or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others ) will be reported to 
the DSMB Chair , NIA Program Official, and IRB as soon as possible , not more than 
[ADDRESS_269664] been taken and what steps are planned as a result of the event.  
The DSMB will receive a tabulation of  all protocol deviations (e.g. visits out of window; 
missed assessments)  at each meeting or reporting interval.  
10.3.4  Monitoring  
The Research Compliance Officer of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System  conducts annual 
audits of the participants’ informed cons ent documents.  
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269665] (IRB) Review  
An IRB -required  protocol and informed consent documents for study participants and their 
study partners were approved on March 14, 2017.  This IRB approval include s a waiver of 
individual  HIPAA  authorization for recruitment and  a waiver of documentation of consent 
for tele phone pre -screening using an approved telephone script .   
This study protocol, as well as any subsequent modifications , the informed consent document s, 
and other information for participants --will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201] .  
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
The consent form describes the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and 
the risks and benefits of participation.   See Appendix II .  “Inform ed Consent Forms.”   A 
separate consent form  will be presented to the study partner  (SP).  The SP ’s consent form  
informs the SP  of their role in the study  including  the kinds of information the partner  will 
be asked to provide during the study.  
Procedures for obtaining informed consent .  During the consenting process , each 
prospective participant and a study partner  will meet in a private interview room at the 
study site with  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33803] .  The information contained in the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) is initially described orally to the prospective participant.  Care is  taken 
to inform prospective participants  repeatedly  that participation is entirely voluntary and 
that they may withdraw at any time and for any reason.  A ny questions will be answered.  
The prospective participant is then asked to read the consent form  carefully .  The 
prospective participant is  asked to summarize the consent form, including the discomforts, 
risks, and confidentiality sections.   
Enou gh time will be allowed f or the potential participant to make an informed decision, 
including time to discus s the study with the researchers  and  ask any questions they may 
have.  We estimate the consenting process  will take between [ADDRESS_269666] will be documented in the participant’s reco rd.  All original signed 
consent forms will be stored in the Study Consent Binder  in a locked file when not in use.     
Provisions for vulnerable populations .  Most participants with a MCI are expected to be 
demonstrate adequate decision- making capacity  by [CONTACT_224194], risks, and potential benefits of the study and they are willing to volunteer .  As noted above, each  prospective participant is  asked to summarize the consent 
form, in cluding the discomforts, risks, and confidentiality sections.  P articipants  will be 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  55 given ample time to  discuss the study  and ask the researchers questions .  Participants  will 
be given time to discuss the study with the study partner, or with any family member, 
friend, or primary care provider . 
It is possible that a volunteer who comes for an in- person  screening visit may be  more 
impaired  than we expected , based on the phone pre -screening interview.  If  the prospective 
participant lacks adequate decision- making capacity  at any in- person visit, then a legally 
authorized  representative will need to sign the ICF and the volunteer will need  to co- sign to 
indicate assent prior to participating in screening or any other study procedures . 
We will follow the recommendations set out in the Alzheimer's Assn position paper, 
"Research Consent for Cognitively Impaired Individuals" (AD & Assoc iated  Disorders 2004, 
18:171- 175), which puts forth that cognitive impairment is not always associated with the 
lack of capacity for informed consent to research .  Nevertheless, potential participants will 
be evaluated by a Stanford/VA [LOCATION_004] Alzheimer's Center physician , a Stanford  
Neurology ADRC  physician, or a VA physician for competency.   In case a person lacks 
capacity,  a proxy (legally authorized representative) will need to sign the consent form. 
The subject's assent will be obtained & documented by [CONTACT_224195].  Using these procedures for obtaining consent, we aim to protect the rights of  any 
decisionally -challenged subjects.   
We note that anyone who scores less than 24 on the MMSE at the Screening Visit will be a 
screen- fail and will not be enrolled in the study because the inclusion /exclusion criteria 
select for participants  with MCI , who by [CONTACT_224196]. Given 
the low risks of the proposed procedures and study's exclusion criteria, we feel that the 
risks an d chance of harm to potentially vulnerable subjects are minimized.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
An i dentification code (Participant ID, PID)  will be assigned by [CONTACT_224197]. The PID  will be used in lieu of the participant’s  name [CONTACT_224204]’s  identity :   
o All computer entry will be done using participant identification number s (Participant ID, 
PID)  only ;   
o Any data, specimens, forms, reports, video recordings, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by [CONTACT_224198] ;   
o The PID will be used  when reporting AEs and/or other  trial -related data;  
o No research reports will identify any individual participant or otherwise disclose identifiers.  
Privacy .  All paper records containing  individually  identifiable information (III) , including  
Identifiable Protected Health Information (PHI) --such as original signed consent forms , 
telephone pre- screening and  study visit progress notes --will be  maintained in a secure 
room,  and in locked file cabinet when not in use .   
HIPAA compliance .  Information will not be shared or disclosed  without written permission 
of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIA, and the 
OHRP.  
Data security requirements .  All portable IT equipment (i.e., laptops, USB  thumb drives, and 
other  removable storage media) used in the research  project must be  encrypted .  Access to 
rTMS -MCI Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_269667] be maintained for 6 
years after study closure.  
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be d iscontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are 
protected.

Appendix XI 
 
Protocol Amendment / Modification: 
 Attention Network Task Dropped   
 
Noninvasive Cortical Stimulation to Improve 
Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
 
Amendment:  The Attention Network task (ANT) was dropped from the study 
protocol on September 19, [ADDRESS_269673] (DSMB).   
 
DSMB meeting minutes summary: “ Other assessments already require 2 hours to 
complete. Members agreed that the protocol already included enough assessments to answer the research question. The possibility of study drop -outs due to 
participant burden was more concerning than administering  the ANT  task  and 
collecting data  on th is secondary outcome. Consensus was to drop the ANT from 
cogni tive battery.  
Date of approval  by [CONTACT_224146]: September 19, 2019  
Effective date : Immediate  
The following pages document approval of this protocol modification by [CONTACT_224200].

I. Open Session  
Opening Remarks : PI [INVESTIGATOR_224139].  
Summary of Discussion  
1. Study Progress:  
a. Enrollment : [ADDRESS_269675] -treatment measures, and 6 completed the study. Commit tee discussion: Board 
members  discussed  the importance of meeting recruitment milestones for the study to  
continue. From an NIA perspective, insufficient statistical power due to low recruitment  raises 
ethical concerns about continuing the study ; [CONTACT_224213]  outlined a milestone of [ADDRESS_269676] on the study timeline.   Consensus was to 
continue t he study and reassess in 6 months.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_224140] : 1) Aim to screen 4 -6 participants per 
month; 2) provide the board with  a realistic recruitment rate  and its impact on the study 
timeline.  
2. Protocol:  
a. Inclusion criteria:  PI [INVESTIGATOR_224141] 
55 to 90 years. Committee discussion : Board members agreed there are no safety concerns but 
discussed data integrity issues that may result from  exceptions. Consens us was to recommend 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_224142].  
b. Excluded medications:  PI [INVESTIGATOR_224143]. Committee discussion:  board members pointed out this medication is excluded based on a 
theoretical concern , and that the motor threshold value may provide a favorable level  of safety.  
That said,  there is no solid evidence for contra -indication of rTMS  or for safety of rTMS.  G iven 
the research protocol  context , recommended  participant be taper ed off medication before 
starting rTMS (achieve a washout p eriod of at least 4 times the drug half -life).  PI [INVESTIGATOR_224140] : 
proceed with screening if participant is willing to discontinue  dextroamphetamine  during the 
rTMS Intervention phase . 
c. Secondary outcomes:  PI [INVESTIGATOR_224144]  (ANT)  as 
other assessments already require 2 hours to complete. Committee discussion : members 
agreed that protocol already includes enough assessments to answer the research questio n. The 
possib ility of drop -outs is more concerning given recruitment issues. Consensus is to drop the 
ANT from cognitive battery. PI [INVESTIGATOR_224140] : submit a protocol modification to drop the ANT.  
3. Safety Assessments : Chair verified that board members had no safety assessment  concerns before 
ending the open session . 
II. Closed Session  
Meeting attendees  
F. Andy Kozel MD (Chair) , Prasad Padala MD , Kristina McLinden PhD, Alvin McKelvy PhD, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224138] , Noah 
Philip MD, Beatriz Hernandez  (unmasked, Data Manager) ; not present : Joy Taylor PhD (PI) , Joshua Teso  
(Research Coordinator)  
Summary of Discussion  
1. Board members would like greater clarification about the degree of medical instability permitted before 
denying further participation. Study team should make clear the criteria and procedures to evaluate 
medical instability during study participation (post -randomization).  
2. Board chair would like to know  how often beam F3 is used instead of sole reliance on the Localite 
method.  
3. There were no safety concerns raised during the closed session.  
III. DSMB Recommendations  
1. Continue the study  with recruitment goal of at least [ADDRESS_269677] recruitment.  
2. Submit a protocol modification to drop the Attention Network Task from assessments.  
3. Clarify criteria and procedures to determine whether medical instability warrants discontinued 
participation.  
4. Next meeting  will be held  in 6 months  (NIA requires DSMB meeting every 6 months) .

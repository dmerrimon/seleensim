[ADDRESS_891005]	identified	effective	interventions	to	manage	blood	loss	during	D&E	39	(dilation	and	evacuation),	the	procedure	used	to	terminate	pregnancy	above	14	weeks	40	gestation.		Many	practitioners	use	uterotonics,	including	oxytocin,	to	help	minimize	blood	loss,	41	however,	oxytocin	administration	has	never	been	studied	with	D&E.			42		43	Design:	We	propose	a	randomized,	double-blinded,	placebo-controlled	trial	at	two	sites,	the	44	University	of	Hawaii	(UH)	and	the	University	of	Washington	(UW).		Subjects	who	present	for	45	D&E	at	18	to	24-weeks	gestation	will	be	recruited	and	randomized	to	IV	oxytocin	versus	IV	fluid	46	alone.		Bleeding	will	be	measured	during	the	procedure	and	until	the	time	of	discharge	from	the	47	postoperative	care	unit.			48		49	Outcomes:		The	primary	outcome	is	the	rate	at	which	providers	intervene	to	control	blood	loss	50	during	D&E	procedures.		Interventions	include	bimanual	massage,	administration	of	51	medications	(i.e.	misoprostol,	methergine)	and	performing	additional	procedures	(i.e.	52	placement	of	an	intrauterine	tamponade	balloon,	exploratory	laparoscopy	or	laparotomy).		53	Secondary	outcomes	include	measured	blood	loss,	complication	rates,	procedure	length,	and	54	postoperative	pain	and	satisfaction.			55		56	Sample	size	&	population:		We	designated	a	15%	decrease	in	provider	interventions	to	control	57	blood	loss	to	be	clinically	significant.		To	achieve	this,	with	80%	power	and	two-sided	alpha	of	58	0.05,	we	need	83	subjects	per	group	for	a	total	sample	of	166	women.

		Version	3		
	4			66	1.		Background	&	Rationale	[ADDRESS_891006]	69	common	surgical	procedures	performed	(1).		Only	a	small	number	of	surgical	abortions,	1.9	per	70	1000	procedures,	result	in	a	complication	(1,	2).		Dilation	and	evacuation	(D&E),	the	surgical	71	procedure	used	to	terminate	pregnancy	above	14	weeks	gestation,	has	a	higher	risk	of	72	complication.		Hemorrhage,	defined	as	blood	loss	over	500-ml,	occurs	in	0.8%	to	2.1%	of	all	73	D&E	procedures	and	is	the	most	common	complication	of	D&E	(3,	4).		The	rate	of	hemorrhage	74	increases	with	gestational	age;	up	to	6.3%	of	D&Es	performed	above	18	weeks	gestation	are	75	affected	by	[CONTACT_327785]	(5).		76		77	In	an	attempt	to	decrease	hemorrhage	with	D&Es,	many	abortion	providers	routinely	78	administer	uterotonics	like	oxytocin	(6).		The	ability	of	oxytocin	to	decrease	bleeding	is	[ADDRESS_891007]-trimester	surgical	abortion	failed	to	show	any	change	in	blood	loss	(7,	8).		To	[ADDRESS_891008]	evaluated	routine	oxytocin	administration	at	the	time	of	D&E	in	[ADDRESS_891009]	on	blood	loss	at	the	time	of	a	term	delivery,	84	oxytocin	is	often	used	during	surgical	termination	of	pregnancy	at	a	variety	of	gestational	ages.		85	There	is	no	documented	“standard	of	care”	in	the	literature	regarding	prophylactic	use	of	any	86	uterotonics	during	D&E.			At	The	Queen’s	Medical	Center	(QMC),	many	providers	very	87	commonly	use	oxytocin	at	the	time	of	D&E.		We	seek	to	determine	whether	this	intervention	[ADDRESS_891010]	performed	a	preliminary	retrospective	analysis	of	a	subset	of	patients	(n=23)	91	undergoing	D&E	at	18-	to	24-weeks	(Study	Title:	Abortion	Database,	WIRB	Approved,	Study	ID	92	2013-88).		This	study	included	procedures	performed	by	[CONTACT_62089]/UCERA	Faculty	Physicians.		Eight	of	93	23	(34.8%)	patients	included	in	this	subset	received	oxytocin.		We	found	that	those	who	94	received	oxytocin	had	a	mean	estimated	blood	loss	(EBL)	of	112.5-ml	while	those	who	did	not	95	receive	oxytocin	had	a	mean	EBL	of	135.3-ml.		A	difference	in	blood	loss	of	22.8-ml	(about	5	96	teaspoons)	does	not	have	any	clinical	consequences	for	the	patient.		In	other	words,	the	patient	97	does	not	experience	a	drop	in	their	blood	count	(hemoglobin),	would	not	have	any	symptoms	98	of	anemia	(lightheadedness	or	weakness),	and	would	not	require	any	additional	treatment	[ADDRESS_891011]	during	a	procedure.		100		101	Importantly,	this	retrospective	analysis	does	not	properly	answer	our	clinical	question.		For	a	102	research	study	to	answer	a	question	it	is	important	to	be	able	to	properly	assess	the	following:	103	1. Exposure	–	In	this	case	the	exposure	is	whether	or	not	the	patient	received	oxytocin	104	and	the	dose	of	oxytocin.		With	a	retrospective	analysis,	we	are	“stuck”	with	[ADDRESS_891012].		In	terms	of	collecting	106	
		Version	3		
	5	information	on	the	exposure	(oxytocin),	we	have	information	on	whether	a	patient	107	received	oxytocin	but	the	amount	infused	was	not	always	recorded.			108	2. Outcome	–	In	this	case,	the	outcome	is	estimated	blood	loss.		In	terms	of	collecting	[ADDRESS_891013]	estimate	blood	loss	by	[CONTACT_660690]	112	inspecting	the	amount	of	blood	in	the	collection	canister	and	the	blood	on	surgical	113	sponges.		It	is	no	surprise	that	one	obstetrical	study	comparing	estimated	and	114	measured	blood	loss	demonstrated	a	difference	of	nearly	300-ml	between	the	two	115	groups	(9,	10).			116	3. Confounders	–	A	confounder	is	something	that	“mixes”	or	“blurs”	the	effect.		A	[ADDRESS_891014]	factor,	known	as	a	confounding	variable	to	the	119	outcome.		For	example,	the	results	of	our	preliminary	analysis	show	that	patients	120	who	did	not	receive	oxytocin	had	slightly	less	bleeding.		However,	what	if	some	121	confounding	factor	(i.e.	low	platelets,	higher	gestational	age,	multiple	gestation,	122	etc.)	made	it	more	likely	for	patients	who	had	a	higher	risk	of	bleeding	to	get	123	oxytocin?		Although	we	were	trying	to	measure	the	effect	of	oxytocin	on	bleeding	[ADDRESS_891015]	of	confounders	on	bleeding.		125	Sometimes	confounders	are	easily	identifiable,	sometimes	they	are	unknown,	yet-126	to-be	identified	factors.				127		128	The	retrospective	analysis	we	conducted	does	not	adequately	address	our	scientific	question	129	because	of	the	three	factors	listed	above.		In	our	randomized	controlled	trial	we	will	be	able	to	130	improve	on	the	quality	of	data	collected	in	the	following	ways;	131	1. Exposure	–	We	will	know	if	a	patient	received	oxytocin	and	those	who	get	oxytocin	[ADDRESS_891016]	amount	of	the	medication	133	2. Outcome	–	Blood	loss	will	be	accurately	measured	rather	than	estimated.			[ADDRESS_891017]	to	avoid	135	confounding	because	assignment	of	participants	into	one	group	or	another	happens	136	purely	by	[CONTACT_3364].		In	other	words,	possible	confounders	don’t	affect	whether	the	137	patient	receives	or	does	not	receive	the	intervention.	138		139	Though	oxytocin	is	a	safe,	inexpensive	medication,	no	medication	is	administered	without	some	140	risk.			Some	abortion	providers	hypothesize	that	use	of	oxytocin	can	make	it	more	difficult	to	141	remove	pregnancy	tissue	because	the	uterine	muscle	contracts	around	the	surgical	instrument	142	making	them	difficult	to	manipulate	(5).		Oxytocin	may	increase	postoperative	uterine	crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]	143	causing	the	patient	unnecessary	discomfort	(11).		Though	no	published	reports	describe	adverse	144	events	when	oxytocin	is	used	at	the	time	of	D&E,	when	used	during	labor	and	delivery	at	term	[ADDRESS_891018]	been	reported	(12-147	15).	Unnecessary	use	of	oxytocin	would	raise	abortion	related	healthcare	costs	both	directly,	[ADDRESS_891019]	of	treating	related	adverse	events	and	149	pain.	150

We	will	not	be	obtaining	any	additional	information	from	study	355	participants	356		357	Pre-operative	evaluation	on	the	day	of	surgery	358	In	the	pre-operative	area,	the	following	study	procedures	will	be	performed:	359	• Approximately	one-	to	two-hours	before	the	procedure,	providers	will	confirm	that	360	subjects	are	willing	to	participate.			361	• Pain/Satisfaction	Assessment:		The	research	assistant	will	assess	subject’s	pain	score	[ADDRESS_891039]	369	D&E	procedures	will	be	performed	under	ultrasound	guidance	according	to	the	usual	standard	[ADDRESS_891040].		Unless	there	is	a	372	contraindication,	surgeons	will	give	all	patients	5-units	of	vasopressin	mixed	with	10-mL	of	373	saline	in	a	paracervical	block.		This	is	the	current	practice	at	QMC	based	on	scientific	evidence	374	(17)	and	recommendations	by	[CONTACT_660695]	(NAF)	(18)	and	Society	of	375	Family	Planning	(SFP)	(3).		As	is	the	usual	practice,	amniotic	fluid	is	drained	from	the	uterus	376	prior	to	removing	products	of	conception.		Intraoperative	care	of	study	participants	will	differ	377	from	usual	care	in	the	following	ways:			378	
		Version	3		
	12	• Study	Drug	Administration:		Upon	speculum	insertion,	500-ml	of	lactated	ringers	or	500-379	ml	of	lactated	ringers	with	30-units	of	oxytocin	will	be	given	as	an	IV	fluid	bolus	infusion	380	over	approximately	15-minutes.		The	dose	of	oxytocin	is	extrapolated	from	the	obstetric	381	literature;	oxytocin	is	used	at	this	does	at	the	time	of	term	delivery	at	QMC	and	382	throughout	the	US	(16).		Currently,	the	same	dose	of	oxytocin	is	very	commonly	383	administered	at	QMC	on	labor	&	delivery	and	during	D&Es.			384	• Blood	Loss	Measurement:		It	is	the	usual	practice	at	QMC	for	the	surgeon	to	handle	all	385	products	of	conception	throughout	the	procedure	until	it	is	sealed	in	a	specimen	386	container	and	they	will	continue	to	do	so.		Simple	visual	inspection	is	known	to	be	387	inaccurate	in	estimating	blood	loss	(9,	10).		Thus,	following	the	procedure,	the	surgeon	388	or	research	assistant	will	measure	blood	loss	with	a	graduated	cylinder.			389	• Weighing	of	gauze	and	sponges:	Used	gauze	or	sponges	will	be	weighed	and	the	dry	390	weight	of	the	gauze	or	sponge	will	be	subtracted	and	converted	from	grams	to	milliliters	391	using	a	one-to-one	ratio.	392	• Measurement	of	procedure	length:		The	research	coordinator	will	measure	and	record	393	length	of	procedure	in	seconds	starting	from	when	the	speculum	is	placed	and	ending	394	when	the	speculum	is	removed	from	the	vagina.			395		396	In	rare	cases,	the	surgeon	may	not	able	to	separate	amniotic	fluid	from	blood.		In	these	cases,	397	hematocrit	of	the	blood-amniotic	fluid	mixture	will	be	checked	at	completion.		This	hematocrit	398	will	be	compared	to	the	patient’s	preoperative	serum	hematocrit	to	determine	the	dilution	399	ratio	and	ascertain	blood	loss.		We	plan	to	validate	this	process	by	[CONTACT_660696]	400	hematocrit	assessment	on	a	subset	of	patients	whose	amniotic	fluid	was	separated	at	the	start.			401	Intraoperative	complications	such	as	hemorrhage	(blood	loss	greater	than	500-ml),	need	for	[ADDRESS_891041]	all	such	events	in	the	study	documents.		If	the	surgeon	is	concerned	for	406	excessive	bleeding	due	to	uterine	atony,	measures	will	be	taken	to	manage	it.		The	decision	to	407	intervene	will	be	based	on	signs	of	impending	hemorrhage	such	as	the	presence	of	brisk	and/or	[ADDRESS_891042]	clinical	judgment	to	decide	when	to	intervene.		When	providers	411	feel	it	is	necessary	to	intervene,	they	will	perform	the	following	interventions	in	the	order	412	described	below	(3):	413	1. Bimanual	uterine	massage	414	2. Intramuscular	methylergonovine	0.2-milligrams	(may	repeat	dose	in	2-	to	4-hours)	[ADDRESS_891043]	tromethamine	(may	repeat	dose	every	417	15-	to	90-minutes)	418	5. Intra-uterine	balloon	tamponade		419

Additional	surgical	procedures	such	as	re-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_660684],	420	exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy	(including	those	resulting	in	hysterectomy),	[ADDRESS_891044],	the	provider	may	430	skip	to	the	next	step	in	the	algorithm	and	this	will	be	documented.			Providers	may	use	431	additional	injections	of	vasopressin	at	any	time	during	the	procedure	at	their	discretion	to	432	control	excess	bleeding;	these	additional	injections	will	be	noted	in	the	study	documents.			433		434	Postoperative	Evaluation	435	After	the	procedure	is	complete,	the	surgical	team	will	transfer	the	patient	to	the	recovery	unit	436	where	she	will	spend	a	minimum	of	60-minutes	(6).		The	following	will	be	performed	in	the	437	postoperative	care	unit:	438	• Pain	management:		All	patients	will	receive	15-milligrams	of	IV	ketorolac	or	500-[ADDRESS_891045]	440	contraindications	to	these	medications	(18,	19).		Anesthesiologists	may	give	alternative	441	or	additional	doses	of	pain	medication	if	the	patient	does	not	obtain	relief	with	initial	442	dose.		All	pain	medications	administered	will	be	recorded	in	study	documents.				443	• Pain/Satisfaction	Assessment:		The	research	assistant	will	assess	patient	satisfaction	and	444	postoperative	pain	60-minutes	after	the	procedure.		Satisfaction	will	be	assessed	using	a	445	5-point	scoring	system	and	pain	will	be	assessed	using	a	10-cm	VAS	(19-21).			446	• Postoperative	Bleeding	Assessment:		Before	the	patient	is	discharged,	the	research	[ADDRESS_891046]	and	weigh	all	used	pads	to	quantify	postoperative	bleeding,	448	subtracting	out	the	weight	of	a	dry	pad	from	the	used	pad.			449	• Monitoring	for	Signs	of	Adverse	Events:		Respi[INVESTIGATOR_300666],	heart	rate	and	oxygen	[ADDRESS_891047]	456	15-minutes,	every	15-minutes	for	the	next	hour,	then	every	hour.		Patients	will	be	asked	457	every	30-minutes	if	they	are	experiencing	symptoms	of	pain,	bleeding,	heart	458	palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].		Any	complications	that	occur	postoperatively	will	be	recorded.		459		460	Please	see	attached	Data	Collection	forms,	which	will	be	used	throughout	the	above	processes.		461	See	Study	Flow	Schematic	for	visual	representation	of	the	above.	462		463

Otherwise,	the	principal	investigators	will	be	506	responsible	for	protecting	and	monitoring	the	rights,	safety	and	welfare	of	the	subjects	at	each	507	site.		Statistical	analysis	will	be	performed	with	R-software®.		Data	will	be	analyzed	using	[ADDRESS_891052]	access	to	study	records,	which	will	be	kept	in	locked	file	cabinets	in	510	the	study	investigator’s	office.		All	data	will	be	entered	into	a	database	without	personal	health	511	identifiers	for	analysis.		Any	publications	or	presentations	will	be	reported	without	reporting	512	any	personal	health	identifiers.		Any	deviations	from	the	planned	statistical	analysis	will	be	513	documented.		514			515	Number	of	subjects	and	statistical	power	516	Hemorrhage,	defined	as	EBL	greater	than	500-ml,	is	a	rare	outcome	that	occurs	in	less	than	one	517	to	6.3%	of	D&Es	above	18-weeks	gestation	(3-5).		Given	this,	a	study	to	decrease	the	rate	of	[ADDRESS_891053]	several	measured	outcomes,	the	sample	size	is	based	on	the	study’s	[ADDRESS_891054]	data	on	in	this	study	include	measured	blood	loss,	procedure	538	time,	complications	(uterine	perforation,	cervical	or	vaginal	laceration,	hemorrhage	(blood	loss	539	greater	than	500-ml),	need	for	transfusion,	exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy,	540	postoperative	pain,	and	patient	satisfaction.		Though	each	of	these	is	important,	the	sample	541	size	in	a	research	study	is	based	on	the	ability	to	demonstrate	differences	in	the	primary	542	outcome.				543		544	Based	on	an	unpublished	study	from	Oregon	Health	and	Science	University	(OHSU)	that	was	[ADDRESS_891055]	estimated	our	546	baseline	need	for	intervention	to	be	20%	(22).		We	have	deemed	a	decrease	of	15%	from	20%	547	to	5%	to	represent	a	clinically	significant	change.		In	other	words,	we	are	trying	to	show	that	548	
		Version	3		
	16	prophylactic	oxytocin	will	change	the	provider	intervention	rate	from	20%	in	the	unexposed	549	(placebo)	group	to	5%	in	the	exposed	(treatment)	group.		A	clinically	significant	decrease	means	[ADDRESS_891056]	size	is	large	enough	to	be	important	to	physicians	and	patients.		Thus,	we	believe	551	that	a	surgeon	will	be	willing	to	use	a	medication,	in	this	case	oxytocin,	if	it	will	decrease	their	552	need	to	perform	additional	interventions	from	20%	to	5%.			[ADDRESS_891057]	also	be	statistically	significant.		Statistical	555	significance	is	based	on	two	parameters,	power	and	alpha.		By	[CONTACT_559],	research	studies	556	typi[INVESTIGATOR_660685]	0.80	or	80%	meaning	there	is	an	80%	chance	of	detecting	a	difference	557	between	two	treatments	if	a	real	difference	exists	and	a	20%	of	making	a	false-negative	558	conclusion.		Alpha	is	conventionally	set	at	0.05	or	5%	meaning	there	is	a	5%	chance	that	results	559	were	due	to	chance	rather	than	a	true	difference	(false-positive	conclusion).	560		561	We	based	our	sample	size	calculations	on	these	conventions:	power	of	0.80	and	alpha	of	0.05.		562	Based	on	these	parameters,	we	calculated	that	a	sample	size	of	75-subjects	per	group	is	needed	563	to	demonstrate	a	difference	of	15%.	To	account	for	a	projected	10%	dropout	rate,	we	will	[ADDRESS_891058]	the	ability	to	demonstrate	a	decrease	of	15%	or	more	in	the	566	need	for	interventions	to	decrease	bleeding.			567	9.		Risks/Benefit	Assessment	568		569	Risk	Category	570	This	study	presents	minimal	risk	to	the	subjects	involved.		Minimal	risk	is	defined	as	"the	571	probability	and	magnitude	of	harm	or	discomfort	anticipated	in	the	research	are	not	greater	572	than	those	ordinarily	encountered	in	daily	life	or	during	the	performance	of	routine	physical	or	573	psychological	exams	or	tests."		The	study	involves	routine	venipuncture	which	would	be	done	574	regardless	of	whether	an	individual	participated	in	this	study.			575		576	Any	patient	who	undergoes	a	D&E	is	at	risk	for	bleeding.		For	patients	in	the	treatment	group,	[ADDRESS_891059]	not	been	579	documented	during	D&E	(12-15).		These	adverse	events	are	more	likely	to	occur	to	patients	580	who	are	exposed	to	large	and/or	prolonged	doses	of	oxytocin,	such	as	doses	used	for	labor	581	induction	(23,	24).		No	cases	of	water	intoxication	have	been	reported	with	a	single	30-unit	582	infusion	diluted	in	500-ml	of	IV	fluid	at	the	time	of	D&E.		Because	oxytocin	is	already	very	583	commonly	used	during	D&E	at	QMC,	the	risk	posed	to	the	patient	by	[CONTACT_660698]	[ADDRESS_891060].		The	595	patient	will	not	incur	any	additional	economical	costs	for	study	participation	nor	will	596	remuneration	be	provided.		Patient	will	be	made	aware	that	she	can	discontinue	the	study	at	597	any	time	and	that	she	will	still	be	offered	the	procedure	she	requests.		We	will	utilize	a	data	598	safety-monitoring	plan	(DSMP)	(see	Section	10B)	to	monitor	and	track	adverse	events	that	may	[ADDRESS_891061]	bleeding	during	D&E,	we	do	not	think	that	the	[ADDRESS_891062]	benefits	over	the	placebo	group.		Overall,	the	results	of	607	the	study	will	help	patients	having	D&Es	in	the	future.		If	oxytocin	is	ineffective	at	decreasing	608	the	need	for	interventions	to	control	bleeding	during	D&E,	we	can	stop	administering	it,	609	thereby	[CONTACT_660699].	If	it	is	found	to	be	effective,	routine	use	of	it	could	help	610	women	avoid	complications	of	excess	bleeding	in	the	future	and	decrease	overall	morbidity	and	611	mortality	associated	with	this	procedure.		Because	there	is	currently	no	established	“standard	612	of	care”	regarding	uterotonic	use	during	D&Es,	results	from	this	study	may	help	to	develop	[ADDRESS_891063]	providers	in	how	to	optimally	care	for	their	patients.		614		615	Financial	Obligations/Cost:	[ADDRESS_891064]	of	care	labs,	medications	and	procedures	will	618	be	billed	through	the	subjects'	insurance.

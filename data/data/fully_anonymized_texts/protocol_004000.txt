  Proprietary and Confidential  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized  Phase 3 , Open -Label Trial of Sipuleucel -T Administered to 
Patients on Active Surveillance for Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer  
Protocol Number:  P17-1 
Clinical Phase:  [ADDRESS_1240260], Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy available as a suspension for 
intravenous infusion.  Sipuleucel -T consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells  
(PBMC) , including antigen presenting cells (APCs) that have been activated during a defined  
culture period with a recombinant human protein, PAP -GM-CSF, consisting of prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in prostate cancer tissue, linked to granulocyte -
macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM -CSF), an immune cell activator.  Each dose of 
sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million autologous CD54+ cells activated with PAP -
GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP.  
The active components of sipuleucel -T are autologous APCs and PAP -GM-CSF.  During 
culture, the recombinant antigen binds  to and is  processed by [CONTACT_886356].  The recombinant antigen is designed to target APCs, and may help direct the 
immune response to PAP.  Minimal residual levels of the intact PAP -GM-CSF are detectable 
in the final sipuleucel -T product.  
The patient's PBMCs  are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days 
prior to the infusion date.  Due to the autologous nature of sipuleucel -T, it is important that the 
patient and physician adhere to the personalized leukapheresis and infusion schedules.  
The cellular composition of sipuleucel -T is dependent on the composition of cells obtained 
from the patient's leukapheresis.   In addition to APCs, the final product contains T cells, B 
cells, natura l killer (NK) cells, and other cells.  The number of cells present and the cellular 
composition of each sipuleucel -T dose will vary.  
The potency of sipuleucel -T is in part determined by [CONTACT_886357]54 molecule, also known as  ICAM -1, on the surface of APCs after culture with PAP -GM-
CSF. CD54 is a cell surface molecule that plays a role in the immunologic interactions between 
APCs and T cells, and is considered a marker of immune cell activation.  
In-process and final sterility tests are initiated prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], but the final results are not 
available for up to [ADDRESS_1240261] (Sipuleuce l-T, 2017) . 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.[ADDRESS_1240262], Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:   
No reference product will be used in this clinical study.  
Primary Objective:  
• To assess the efficacy of sipuleucel -T in reducing histopathologic reclassification to a 
higher Gleason grade in prostate cancer su bjects on active surveillance (AS)  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To assess the differential receipt of local or systemic therapy (surgery, radiation , 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ) in each study  arm, and the reasons for receipt of 
further local or systemic therapy  
• To assess differences in quality of life (i.e., patient -reported outcomes (PRO))  between 
sipuleucel -T and c ontrol arms  
• To evaluate the safety of sipuleucel -T in men with low to intermed iate risk localized 
prostate cancer  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate in the sipuleucel -T arm the association of peripheral blood and tumor 
microenvironment immunologic responses with reclassification of Gleason grade over 
time  
• To evaluate clinical asse ssments and potential correlation to sipuleucel -T 
• To evaluate prostate tissue  genomics  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects without histological reclassification ( Gleason group upgrade ) 
within 36 months of randomization as determined by [CONTACT_53947] ( BICR)  
o Upgrade  is defined as subjects at randomization with either  International Society of 
Urological Pathology ( ISUP ) Grade Group 1 (Gleason 3+3) upgrade d to Grade 
Group 2 (Gleason 3+4) or higher or subjects at randomization wi th Grade Group 2 
upgraded to Grade Group 3 (Gleason 4+3 ) or higher . 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• To determine the number of subjects with subsequent prostate cancer treatment (e.g., 
surgery, radiation, ADT ) in each study arm

Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF -12), The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 
for Clinical Practice (EPIC -CP), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 
baseline and 12- , 24-, and  36-month vi sits after randomization  
• To evaluate safety by [CONTACT_886359]  (AEs), assessing 
laboratory data for  clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and evaluating  
physical examination (PE)  findings  in each study arm  
Exploratory Endpoints:

as product parameters to sipuleucel -T efficacy  
• To determine , in the cohort of  subjects having a radical prostatectomy , the number of 
subjects with  an ISUP Grade Group change (up-  or down- grade) determined by [CONTACT_886360]  
• To measure the percentage of subjects with a negative biopsy at any post -randomization 
biopsy assessment  in each study arm   
• To compare the proportion of subjects with clinical risk group  progression ( e.g., Cancer 
of the Prostate Risk Assessment  (CAPRA) and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network  (NCCN) prostate cancer risk groups ) between study arms  
• To calculate Prostate -specific an tigen  (PSA)  velocity from randomization through 
study completion in each study arm  
• To determine the association of prostate cancer tissue genomic profile and sipuleucel -T 
treatment 
Study Design  and Duration:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label  study of immunotherapy with sipuleucel -T 
compared to control  subjects followed on AS .  The study will enroll subjects being followed

  Proprietary and Confidential  During the Active Phase, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and  control arms  will complete : 
•  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires (Max -PC, SF -12, EPIC -CP, and IPSS) annually 
(12-, 24-, and 36- month visits)  post randomization.  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires 
should be collected prior to any procedures on these spec ified visits.  
• Two ( 2) systematic biopsies (Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2; ≥10 cores each)  will be 
administered as standard of care.   Additional cores may be collected by [CONTACT_886362] ; however, MRI targeted cores collected at baseline should 
be repeated for Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2 (Appendix 7 ). 
Biopsy [ADDRESS_1240268] randomization.  All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E ) and special 
stained slides will be assessed for histopathologic grading by [CONTACT_19377].  Slides from each biopsy will be considered as a group to determine the ISUP Grade Group as opposed to any single slide .  The BICR is blinded to a subject’s study arm randomiz ation.  BICR will receive the 
local pathology staining methods and Gleason score.  All subject information should be redacted from the local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology r eports and slides will 
be identified only by [CONTACT_886363].  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Post randomization, central pathology requested formalin -fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE)  
tissue blocks identified by [CONTACT_886364]  (IHC)  and genomic analysis .  All tissue 
blocks will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Upon study completion, if the primary endpoint is met subjects on the control a rm may  be 
offered sipuleucel -T. 
Follow -up Phas e:  
Once a subject  from either the sipuleucel -T or control arms  completes the end of Active Phase 
visit, they will enter the Follow -up Phase and complete Follow -up Phase visits every [ADDRESS_1240269]

Statistical Considerations  
The Phase 3, open- label  study is designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel -T in subjects on 
AS.  The primary endpoint will analyze a pproximately 450 subjects randomized (2:1 sipuleucel -
T arm versus control arm ). 
It is estimated that the proportion of increased histopathologic  grade reclassification  over the 36 
months following randomization for the control  arm will be approximately 0.30.  While there 
is no prior information on sipuleucel -T treatment response in early -stage disease available, a 
meaningful hypothesized reduction in this proportion is a  reduction by 0.14, giving a projected 
outcome proportion of upgrading in the sipuleucel -T arm of 0.16.  The null hypothesis of both 
arms having a proportion of 0.70 (= 1-  0.30) being free from upgrading at 36 months  versus the 
specific alternative hypothe sis of a sipuleucel -T arm outcome of 0.84 (= 1-  0.16).  The odds 
ratio associated with the specific alternative hypothesis is 2.25 ( sipuleucel -T arm odds over 
control arm odds).  Based on an overall 1- sided alpha of 0.025 approximately 300 subjects in 
the sipuleucel -T arm and 150 subjects in the control  arm will provide 90% power to demonstrate 
the superiority of sipuleucel -T to control .

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
2.1.1 Prostate Cancer 
In the [LOCATION_002], an estimated 164,690 cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2018 (Siegel , 2018) .  However, many of these men will have disease that may never cause morbidity 
or mortality due to their diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Therefore, the management of newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer detected on the basis of prostate -specifi c antigen (PSA) 
remains controversial.  Recently, Cooperberg et al. showed a shift from initial active treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation) to choosing AS ( Cooperberg, 2015) .  Active surveillance ( AS) delays 
or indefinitely postpones  the complications of surgery, radiation or androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) , while allowing for subsequent interventional treatment with similar clinical 
efficacy associated with immediate treatment  (Dall’Era, 2017) .  Men on AS are advised to 
adhere to  follow -up protocols  and schedules  (Borkhorst, 2015) , yet 25% to 45% of men were 
no longer on AS  after 5 to 15 years of follow -up (Klotz, 2015) .  The most common reasons for 
discontinuing AS were  PSA-doubling time (43.5%), grade progression (35%) patient preference 
(6%), and stage progression (3%) ( Klotz, 2015 ).  Recently, the PRIAS study investigators 
concluded Gleason  upgrading and disease re-classification (≥ cT3) as the only indicators for an 
immediate switch to active treatment.  Surrogate indicators such as number of posit ive cores 
and a PSA -doubling time of <3 years  should not trigger immediate active treatment but instead 
continued follow -up to confirm higher -risk disease (Borkhorst, 2016 ).  Thus histopathologic 
progression is an important indicator for prostate cancer progression and th e need for treatment, 
and decreasing  histopathologic progression would be a significant benefit for the AS prostate 
cancer population.  
2.1.2 Sipuleucel -T 
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy available as a suspension for intravenous 
infusion.  S ipuleucel -T consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) , 
including antigen presenting cells (APCs)  that have been activated during a defined culture 
period with a recombinant human protein, PAP -GM-CSF, consisting of prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in prostate cancer tissue, linked to granulocyte -
macrophage colony -stimulating facto r (GM -CSF), an immune cell activator.  Each dose of 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 29 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million autologous CD54+ cells activated with PAP -
GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP.  
The active components of sipuleucel -T are autologous APCs and PAP -GM-CSF. During 
culture, the recombinant antigen binds  to and is  processed by [CONTACT_886371]. The recombinant antigen is designed to target APCs, and may help direct the immune 
response to PAP.  Minimal residual levels of  the intact PAP -GM-CSF are detectable in the final 
sipuleucel -T product.  
The patient's PBMCs are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days 
prior to the infusion date.  Due to the autologous nature of sipuleucel -T, it is important  that the 
patient and physician adhere to the personalized leukapheresis and infusion schedules.  
The cellular composition of sipuleucel -T is dependent on the composition of cells obtained from 
the patient's leukapheresis.  In addition to APCs, the final pr oduct contains T cells, B cells, 
natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells.  The number of cells present and the cellular 
composition of each sipuleucel -T dose will vary.  
The potency of sipuleucel -T is in part determined by [CONTACT_886372]54 molecule, also known as ICAM -1, on the surface of APCs after culture with PAP -GM-
CSF.  CD54 is a cell surface molecule that plays a role in the immunologic interactions between 
APCs and T cells, and is considered a marker of immune cell act ivation.  
In-process and final sterility tests are initiated prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], but the final results are not 
available for up to [ADDRESS_1240315] (Sipuleuce l-T, 2017) . 
Sipuleucel -T induces robust and long- lived antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune 
responses that target prostate cancer cells.   The magnitude of the immune response correlates 
with overall survival (OS) in subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer  
(mCRPC)  (Sheikh, 2013).  
Sipuleucel -T administered to subjects prior to radical prosta tectomy demonstrated both a 
systemic antigen -specific T cell response and a local response with the recruitment of activated 
effector T cells into the prostate tumor microenvironment (Fong, 2014).   In subjects with non-
metastatic hormone -sensitive prostate cancer, the magnitude of immunoglobulin G  responses 
to antigen was significantly higher, and the magnitude of secondary antibody responses (antigen 
spread) , as well as APC activation was significantly greater when compared to  subjects with 
mCRPC ( Antonarakis, 2017) .  These data suggest sipuleucel -T may have a more robust anti -
cancer effect in non -metastatic hormone -sensitive prostate cancer subjects and the potential to 
slow or inhibit the development of more aggressive disease requiring treatment for men on AS. 
The p urpose of this study is to determine if sipuleucel -T will decrease the development of 
histopathologic progression upon subsequent prostate biopsies for subjects on AS.

5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1  Study Design and Duration  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label study of immunotherapy with sipuleucel -T 
compared to control  subjects followed on AS .  The study will enroll subjects being followed by 
[CONTACT_886374] 12 months prior to Screening with either ISUP Grade Group 
1 or 2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  
This study consists of 3 phases (see Section 8.0 for more details):  
Screening Phase:  
The Screening Phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue s 
until randomization.  Screening procedures will be performed up to 30 days prior to 
randomization.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 32 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  The following assessments will be performed on all subjects during the Screening Phase:  
• BICR of p rostate biopsy slides obtained from local pathologist ( ISUP Grade Group and 
Gleason Score)  
• Clinical evaluations (demographics, medical history, PE & vital signs , digital rectal 
examination (DRE) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status , 
cardiovascular risk assessment & electrocardiogram  (ECG)) 
• Cardiovascular  and thrombosis disease history  
• Concomitant medications 
• All anti- prostate cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• PROs/Quality of life questionnaires  
• Virology serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, HCV antibody(Ab), if Ab positive (Ab+) 
then HCV RNA) ), HIV -1 and HIV -2 antibody screen and HTLV -1, HTLV- 2 antibodies  
• Hematology and chemistry  
• PSA 
• Total testosterone  
Active Phase:  
The Active Phase will begin at randomization and continues through completion of the end of Active Phase study visit (within 30 days of Biopsy 2) or until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_103] .  Subjects who withdraw consent and discontinue from the study prior completing end 
of Active Phase study visit  will undergo an Early Withdrawal visit within 30 days following 
discontinuation notice ( Section 6.3 ).  Subjects are encouraged to have, as standard of care, a 
systematic prostate biopsy  (≥10 cores) with or without MRI at the investigator’s discretion prior 
to study withdrawal.  The H&E and special -stained slides from this biopsy will be submitted 
for  BICR determination of their ISUP Grade Group classification  prior to study withdrawal  
After Screening  assessments are completed , eligible subjects will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_1240316] leukapheresis within 60 days of ra ndomization and will receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel -T at approximately 2-week intervals.  Subjects randomized to the control arm will 
be followed on AS  as described in the schedule of events ( Table 2 ).

  Proprietary and Confidential  During the Active Phase, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and control arms will complete:  
•  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires (Max -PC, SF- 12, EPIC -CP, and IPSS) annually 
(12-, 24-, and 36- month visits) post randomization.  PROs/Quality of life quest ionnaires 
should be collected prior to any procedures on these specified visits.  
• Two (2) systematic biopsies (Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2; ≥10 cores each) ) will be 
administered  as standard of care.  Additional cores may be collected by [CONTACT_886375] ; however, MRI targeted cores collected at baseline should be 
repeated for Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2 ( Appendix 7) . 
Biopsy [ADDRESS_1240321] randomization.  All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E ) and special 
stained slides will be assessed for histopathologic grading by [CONTACT_19377]. Slides from each biopsy 
will be considered as a group to determine the ISUP Grade Group as opposed to any single slide .   The BICR is blinded to a subject’s study arm randomization.  BICR will receive the local 
pathology staining methods and Gleason score.  All s ubject information should be redacted from 
the local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology reports and slides will be identified only by [CONTACT_886363].  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Post randomization, central pat hology requested formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE)  
tissue blocks identified by [CONTACT_886376] (IHC)  and genomic analysis .  All tissue 
blocks will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Follow -up Phase:  
Once a subject from either the sipuleucel -T or control arm s completes the end of Active Phase 
visit, they will enter into Follow -up Phase and will complete Follow -up Phase visits every [ADDRESS_1240322] enrolled completes Biopsy 2 and end of Active Phase visit or until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. All subjects will be assessed for:

9.0 SAFETY  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical 
studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819].   Safety reporting for t his trial will be conducted 
in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 as amended by [CONTACT_886387] 29, 2010 and detailed in the Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012).  S ponsor  will be the final arbiter, should a 
difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_886348], seriousness, severity, or relatedness of AEs.  
9.[ADDRESS_1240380] a causal relationship with sipuleucel -T.  An AE can, therefore, 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.[ADDRESS_1240381] administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or 
a continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at Screening  that worsen following the start 
of the study.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1240382] current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) will be used to score AE severity by [CONTACT_756395].  In general, the following severity definitions  apply:  
Mild (grade 1):  The AE results in mild, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic with clinical or diagnostic observations only.  Intervention is not usually indicated.  
Moderate (grade 2):  The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to interfere with some aspect of the subject’s normal daily activity.  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is required.  
Severe (grade 3):  The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, results in discomfort or dis ability which is 
incapacitating and prevents most normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886349].  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  The AE could reasonably be  expected to result in death 
unless immediate medical intervention is undertaken.  
Fatal (grade 5):  The AE results in death.  
 
9.1.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Sipuleucel -T  
The following categories will be used to determine relationship of AEs to sipuleucel -T: 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 58 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  None:  The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
Possible:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of sipuleucel -T, but could readily have been 
produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administered to the subject . 
Probable:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of sipuleucel -T and could not readily have been 
produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administere d 
to the subject.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1240383]’s last study visit.  AEs and SAEs  will be reported and recorded in the 
subject’s medical record and entered on their eCRF . 
All AEs and SAEs reported in either the sipuleucel -T or control arms will be followed by [CONTACT_194675], return to baseline, or the investigator determines that no further 
improvement is expected  until study completion.  The start and stop dates, description, 
seriousness, toxicity, relationship to study treatment, and outcome will be recorded.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse drug experience, subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An important medical event that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886350], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions tha t do not result in subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

control  arm, stratified by [CONTACT_886392] 1 or 2 and the number of biopsies showing the 
presence of disease prior to registration.  Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_886393]- to-treat 
(ITT ) principle.  Generally  statistical tests will be performed at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance 
level unless otherwise noted.  
The phrases ‘statistical analysis’ or ‘analysis’ will be used to mean inferential analysis (such as 
performing tests of significance , reporting p- values and confidence intervals).  When no 
inferential analysis will be performed, the phrases ‘descriptive analysis’ or ‘descriptive 
statistics’ will be used (for instance, producing summary tables of means, standard deviations, percentages of responders).   
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_35522].  A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined below.  Details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
10.1 Sample Size Considerations  
The primary endpoint will analyze a pproximately 450 subjects randomized (2:1 sipuleucel -T 
versus control arm ), and for each subject , is dichotomous with success defined as having been 
observed to be free of histopathologic  upgrade after 36 months  of follow -up.  Based on data 
available, it is estimated that the proportion of histopathologic  upgrading by 36 months  
following randomization for control  arm subjects will be approximately 0.30.  While there is no 
prior information on treatment response to sipuleucel -T in early stage disease available, a 
meaningful hypothesized reduction in this proportion is a reduction by 0.14, giving a projec ted 
outcome proportion of upgrading in the sipuleucel -T arm of 0.16.  The null hypothesis of both 
arms having a proportion of 0.70 (= 1-  0.3) being free from upgrading at 36 months  versus the 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 61 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  specific alternative hypothesis of a sipuleucel -T arm outcome of  0.84 (= 1-  0.16).  The odds 
ratio associated with the specific alternative hypothesis is 2.25 ( sipuleucel -T arm odds over 
control arm odds).  Based on an overall 1- sided alpha of 0.025 approximately 300 subjects in 
the sipuleucel -T arm and 150 subjects in the control  arm will provide 90% power to demonstrate 
the superiority of sipuleucel -T to control . 
10.2 Analysis  Populations  
The Safety Analysis Population is defined as all randomized patients; the Sipuleucel -T safety 
population must have begun the treatment process.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the subset of patients in the ITT population who 
have completed all assessment per the protocol.    
10.3 Efficacy  Analysis  
The phr ases ‘statistical analysis’ or ‘analysis’ will be used to mean inferential analysis (such as 
performing tests of significance, reporting p- values and confidence intervals).  When no 
inferential analysis will be performed, the phrases ‘descriptive analysis’  or ‘descriptive 
statistics’ will be used (for instance, producing summary tables of means, standard deviations, percentages of responders).  All efficacy analyses will be conducted on  the ITT population and 
the per protocol population.  
Unless otherwise specified, the statistical tests are based on the superiority hypothesis using a one-sided p -value of 0.025 (equivalent to two- sided 0.05 with a result in the hypothesized 
direction).  The final analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed t he [ADDRESS_1240388] -randomization biopsy.  Histopathologic  status is determined by [CONTACT_886394] -prostatectomy or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 62 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  other time -point.  Subjects upgrading  before 36 months , or those found as upstaged at Biopsy 
2, or those not observed at 36 months  (i.e., do not complete Biopsy [ADDRESS_1240389] 
randomization) will be regarded as failures in the primary analysis.  
The primary  analysis null hypothesis, H0: Ω ≤ 1, versus the alternative hypothesis, HA: Ω > 1; 
where Ω is the odds of success in the sipuleucel -T arm over the odds of success in the control 
arm.  The Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_886395] [ADDRESS_1240390] will be determined.  The category of subsequent prostate cancer treatment will be identified (e.g., surgery, radiation, androgen deprivation therapy).  Subjects  initiating alternative intervention will be regarded as 
sipuleucel -T treatment failure s.  These data will be summarized descriptively and compared 
between study arms using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  test.  
Quality of life data will be summarized descripti vely and compared between study treatment 
arms and in the aggregate within the efficacy population.  
Safety data will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_886396]. 
10.5.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
Immune response will be assessed at each specified time- point.  Immune response variables will 
be evaluated to determine if there is a correlation between the measures of immune response and upgrade or other changes t o the ISUP group grade of the subjec t’s prostate can cer.   
Subjects undergoing a radical prostatectomy will have the biopsy sample evaluated for 
histological status of the prostate cancer.  Histopathologic  change will be defined as any change 
in ISUP grade at baseline to an upgrade, no change in, or down- grade to a their ISUP baseline 
grade group  designation , or to a status indicating no prostate cancer disease identified.  These 
data will be summarized descriptively and compared between study arms.   
Biopsy results will be assessed to determine the rate of negative biopsy results.  This data will 
be summarized descriptively and compared between study arms.  
PSA velocity will be calculated as the slope of the simple linear regression of the natural log of 
PSA versus time.  
10.5.4 Biomarker Analysis  
The association of biomarkers with clinical response endpoints or survival may be assessed using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., analysis of variance [ANOVA], categorical or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 63 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  survival models) depending on the endpoints.  Other clinical covariates (such as baseline t umor 
characteristics and subject  demographics) may also be included in the model.  Association of 
biomarkers with clinical response or relevant time- to-event endpoints will also be explored in 
the overall population.  Results of these exploratory analyses will be presented in separate 
technical reports.  
10.5.5 Safety  
The safety parameters to be analyzed are the incidence, intensity, and type of AEs, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory results, and limited physical examinations (abnormalities will be recorded as AEs (Section 9.3).  Analysis of the safety parameters will be conducted on the safety population.

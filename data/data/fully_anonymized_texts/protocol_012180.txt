Primary Endpoint Primary Safety Endpoint: 
Freedom from Aneurysm-related Mortality Rate (ARM) at 5 years (1826 days).   
 
ARM is defined as death from rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm or from any 
procedure intended to treat the AAA. If a death occurred within 30 days of any procedure intended to treat the AAA, then it is presumed to be aneurysm related unless 
there is evidence to the contrary. Deaths  occurring after 30 days of any procedure 
intended to treat the AAA that are procedure-related should be aneurysm related. 
 
All deaths will be adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) to determine device, procedure and/or AAA relatedness.  
Additional Measures The following metrics will be evaluated:  1. Technical Success 
2. Major Adverse Events (MAE) rates within [ADDRESS_353447] Approval Study

Abnormal bulging of the abdominal aorta, called an abdominal  aortic aneurysm (AAA), 
is a potentially serious condi tion that can lead to death if the aneurysm ruptures.  
Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gain ed an increasingly im portant role in the 
management of AAA since its introduction in  the early 1990s.  The past [ADDRESS_353456] worked on the refinement of both the stent graft and its delivery system.  The profile/size of th e stent graft delivery system has decreased leading to fewer 
traumas to the vessel wall and enabling placemen t in patients with smaller iliac/femoral 
access arteries.  Devices with uncovered suprar enal stents also were introduced.  This 
development should lead to a more secure an chor to the perirenal aorta and reduce the 
tendency for distal migration.
[ADDRESS_353457] be considered in light of the patient’s anatomical an d physiological 
characteristics.  Endovascular devices vary in the type of stent used.

lengths.   
 The Endurant Stent Graft System is a next-g eneration modular system for endovascular 
repair of AAA.  The system was de signed with the fo llowing features:  
 
1. Designed for high flexibility and conforma bility to adapt straight and tortuous 
anatomies:  
a. The M-shaped proximal stent is specifically designed for improved wall apposition, minimizing the risk of in-folding and providing a 10mm seal 
zone 
b. The anchor pi[INVESTIGATOR_289768]. 
c. Limb stents and stent spacing designe d to prevent kinking in anatomies 
with increased iliac tortuosity. 
 
2. Accuracy and control with simple and c ontrolled deployment: Controlled release 
of suprarenal stent with anchor pi[INVESTIGATOR_289769]:  
a. The tip capture mechanism allows for precise positioning adjustments post deployment of the suprarenal stent. 
b. Rotation of the back-end wheel pr ovides controlled release of the 
suprarenal stent with anchor pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. 
c. Proximal radiopaque markers facilitate  accurate positioning in relation to 
the renal arteries, and the ‘e’ marker assists with the anterior/posterior 
view.  
3. A delivery system with a lower outer diam eter profile and h ydrophilic coating (on 
the graft cover surface) allows it to more easily access and track in small and 
tortuous anatomies.  
 Medtronic Vascular submitted a Pre-Market Application (PMA) to the FDA on June [ADDRESS_353459]-appr oval study (PAS), in collaboration with 
the FDA, to document the performance of th e Endurant Bifurcated Stent Graft System 
under a post-market setting. This study is re ferred to as ENGAGE PAS. This document 
describes the methodology of the ENGAGE PAS trial.  Medtronic Vascular submitted a Pre-Market Application Supplem ent (PMA-S) to the 
FDA on October 10, 2012, and received market  approval for the Endurant II AUI Stent 
Graft System on April 16, 2013. Medtronic committed that the Endurant AUI cohort will be incorporated as a separate arm into the existing ENGAGE PAS clinical study for 
follow-up through [ADDRESS_353460] Approval Study

Date: June 11, 2013  Page 13 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE  
 
The Endurant Stent Graft System is designed to treat infrarenal abdominal aortic or 
aortoiliac aneurysms using an endovascular  approach.  When placed within the 
aneurysm, the Endurant Stent Graft is design ed to provide a permanent, alternative 
conduit for blood flow within the patient’s vasculature by [CONTACT_289793].   
 
The Endurant Stent Graft System is comprise d of 2 key components:  the Endurant Stent 
Graft and the Endurant Delivery System.  The stent graft is constrained by [CONTACT_289794] (graft cover).  The preloa ded stent graft is advanced to the aneurysm 
location over a guidewire.  As deployment occu rs, the stent graft self-expands due to the 
superelastic properties of the nitinol stents .  Upon deployment, the proximal and distal 
ends of the stent graft conform to the shape and size of the proximal and distal seal zones 
due to the radial force of the stents.  
4.1.  ENDURANT STENT GRAFT COMPONENTS  
 
The Endurant Stent Graft (Fig ure 1) is a modular device  comprised of 2 primary 
components:  an aorto-iliac bifurcated co mponent and a contralateral limb component. 
The Aorto-Uni-Iliac (AUI) sten t graft component is intended for the treatment of patients 
whose vessel anatomy precludes the use of a bifurcated stent graft. Additional components include aortic and iliac extensions. After the placement of the stent graft, each additional component is introduced separately into the vessel and is mated in vivo  to 
the components already in situ .   
 All components are composed of nitinol stents sewn to a fabric graf t.  The suprarenal 
stents with anchor pi[INVESTIGATOR_289770] e nd are laser cut from a nitinol tube.  The 
bifurcated body component includes seal, body, contour, and limb stents formed from 
nitinol wire.  The stents are formed in a ri ng with opposing ends terminating together in 
crimp sleeves.  The suprarenal stents are sewn to the multifilament polyester (PET – Polyethylene Terephthalate) graft fabric usi ng ultra high-molecular weight polyethylene 
suture.  The wire formed stents are sewn to the graft fabric using polyester suture.  
Radiopaque markers are sewn onto each compone nt of the stent graft to facilitate 
visualization and accurate placement.  Radi opaque markers are located at the proximal 
and distal ends of each stent graft component, and at the bifurcation of the bifurcated stent grafts to help visualize the edges and locations of the stent grafts.  The nitinol stents can also be visualized under fluoroscopy.

4.1.[ADDRESS_353461] ent graft component is  deployed into the 
proximal neck and upper section of the aneu rysm.  All stents on the proximal aortic 
section of the bifurcated component are sewn to the outside of the graft fabric.  The proximal stent (suprarenal) of the aortic sectio n is not covered with graft fabric.  As such, 
this bare stent design allows the Endurant Sten t Graft to be fixed a bove the renal arteries 
without obstructing them with graft fabric.  Refer to Figure [ADDRESS_353462] Approval Study 
 
Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, [ADDRESS_353463].  The suprarenal stent is joined to the proximal edge of the graft by [CONTACT_289795]- 
molecular weight polyethylene suture.   
             Distally, the aortic section bifurcates into 2 smaller tubes:  an ipsilateral single iliac limb and a short contralateral stub leg.  In the ip silateral limb of the bifurcated stent graft 
component, the stents are sewn to the outside of the graft fabric providing a smooth inner 
lumen.  In the contralateral (stub) leg of th e bifurcated stent graft component, the stents 
are sewn to the inside of the graft fabric providing additional friction to give higher 
disjunction (separation) forces with the cont ralateral limb component.  Refer to Figure [ADDRESS_353464] and to provide sealing for the exclusion of the 
aneurysm.  The aortic sections of the bi furcated stent graft components should be 
oversized approximately 10% - 20% in relation to the actual measured vessel inner diameter.  The available aortic section sizes ar e able to be used in aortas with diameters 
ranging from [ADDRESS_353465] al limb portion of the 
bifurcated stent graft components range in diameter from 13 - 20 mm and can be used in 
iliac arteries with diameters ranging from 10 - 18  mm.  If a larger range of limb sizes is

A).   
 
4.1.2 Contralateral Limb  
 
The proximal end of the tube-like contralate ral limb component is deployed within the 
short contralateral stub leg of the bifurcated stent graft com ponent, while the contralateral 
limb component’s distal end is deployed in th e contralateral iliac artery.  The proximal 
section of the contralateral limb component  uses an open web configuration, which 
contains no graft material in the stent valleys of its proximal stent.  This is designed to reduce the chance of an endoleak.  The available distal diameter of contralateral limb components ranges from 10 - 28 mm with lengths ranging from 82 - 124 mm.  The contralateral limb component should be ove rsized by [CONTACT_3450] 10% - 25% in 
relation to the vessel inner diamet er and can be used in iliac arteries ranging from 8 - 25 
mm.  
4.1.3 Iliac Extension  
 
When additional distal length of the stent gr aft is required, iliac extension components are 
available.  The iliac extension component has a proximal end open web configuration 
similar to the contralateral limb component.  The diameter of the iliac extension 
components ranges from 10 - 28 mm with a cove red length of 82 mm.  Similar to the 
contralateral limb component, the iliac extens ion component is designed for oversizing of 
approximately 10% - 25% and can be used in  iliac arteries ranging from [ADDRESS_353466] ent graft is required, aortic extension 
components are available.  The aortic exte nsion components use the same proximal bare 
suprarenal stent with anchor pin design as the proximal stent of the aortic section of the 
bifurcated component.  The diameters of av ailable aortic extension components range 
from 23 - 36 mm with the aor tic extension having a covered length of either 49 mm or 70 
mm.  The aortic extension component should be oversized approximately 10% - 20% in 
relation to the actual measured vessel inner di ameter, and can be used in aortic arteries 
ranging from 19-32 mm in diameter.   
4.1.5 Aorto-Uni-Iliac Stent Graft  
  
The proximal section of the Aorto-Uni-Ilia c (AUI) stent graft component in use is 
deployed into the proximal neck and upper se ction of the aneurysm.  All stents on the 
proximal aortic section of the AUI component ar e sewn to the outside of the graft fabric.  
The proximal stent (suprarenal) of the aortic s ection is not covered w ith graft fabric.  As 
such, this bare stent design allows the Endur ant Stent Graft to be fixed above the renal 
arteries without obstructing them with graft fa bric.  Refer to Figure [ADDRESS_353467] Approval Study 
 
Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, [ADDRESS_353468].  The suprarenal stent is join ed to the proximal edge of the graft by [CONTACT_289796]-molecular weight polyethylene suture. 
 
Distally, the aortic section tapers down to a smaller diameter tube.  In the distal end of the 
tapered AUI stent graft, the stents are sewn to the inside of the graft fabric providing 
additional friction for higher disjunction (separat ion) forces with the contralateral limb 
component.   
The diameters of the available proximal aor tic section of the AUI stent graft components 
range from [ADDRESS_353469] and provide sealing for the exclusion of the aneurysm.  The aortic sections of the 
AUI stent graft components should be oversized  approximately 10% - 20% in relation to 
the actual measured vessel diameter.  The available aortic sections sizes can be used in 
aortas with diameters ranging from 19 - 32 mm.  The diameter of the distal end of the 
AUI stent graft component is 14 mm. 
 
 
4.2.  ENDURANT DELIVERY SYSTEM  
 The Endurant Stent Graft is loaded and held inside the Endurant Delivery System, which 
facilitates placement of the stent graft via the arterial vasculature, e.g., femoral arteries.  
Using fluoroscopic guidance, the Endurant Delivery System is properly positioned within 
the patient’s vasculature and th e stent graft is deployed.  
 The Endurant Delivery System consists of a single use, disposable catheter with an 
integrated handle to provide accurate and controlled deployment.  The catheter assembly is flexible and compatible with a 0.035-inch  (0.89 mm) guidewire.  There are 2 kinds of 
Endurant Delivery Systems.  The Endurant Aor tic Delivery System is for delivering the 
Aortic components, i.e., aortic extensions, bi furcated stent grafts and AUI stent grafts. 
The Endurant Iliac Delivery System is for de livering the Endurant contralateral limb and 
iliac extension stent grafts.

containing a nitinol inner member .  A stent stop (not shown in  figures) is attached to the 
distal end of the middle member shaft to en sure the position of the Aortic Stent Graft 
Component during deployment.  
 
The tapered tip attached to th e distal end of the nitinol i nner member, is depi[INVESTIGATOR_289771] 5 and 6.  A metallic spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853] (as shown in  Figure 6) is attached to the distal end of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853]-tube to hold the pr oximal end of the supr arenal stent axially stationary before 
release.  An atraumatic tapered polymeric tip is attached at the di stal end of the inner 
member to facilitate tracking through tortuous and calcified vessels.  Attached to the proximal end of the polymeric tip is a metal lic sleeve that holds the suprarenal stent 
constrained on the spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853].  The polymeric ta pered tip, stent stop, and ring marker on the 
distal end of the graft cove r are radiopaque and aid in fluoroscopic visualization.

consisting of 44 subjects, will be rolled in but analyzed separately. The primary statistical 
analysis will be based on freedom from Aneu rysm Related Mortalit y (ARM) at 5 years. 
For the bifurcated arm, it will be compared to a Performance Goal (PG), determined from 
literature. This comparison will be performed based on a Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis of 
the ARM. For the AUI group, the KM estimate  of freedom from ARM will be calculated 
without a hypothesis testing. 
By-sex/gender and by-race (white vs. non-white) subset 
analyses will be performed on the freedom from ARM rate at 5 years separately for the 
bifurcated arm (328 subjects) and the AUI arm (44 subjects)..  
 
In general, the number and percentage of  subjects reaching each of the additional 
measures will be given, along with confid ence intervals for those percentages.  
 Those acute procedural and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289774]-related outcomes that are categorical will 
be reported in frequency and percentage.  The outcomes that are continuous will be 
reported by [CONTACT_289798], mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum.   The primary analysis set used for these analyses will be the ITT population, which consists of all subjects enroll ed in the study.  For the purpose s of this definition, a subject 
is enrolled at the point when vessel access is achieved through a cut down or 
percutaneous approach with the inte ntion of implanting the stent graft. 
 
7.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
 The primary endpoint is freedom from ARM, measured at 5 years (1826 days). For the 
bifurcated arm, it will be compared to the Performance Goal (PG), determined from the 
literature as described in S ection 7.2.  ARM is defined as 
 
ARM is defined as death from rupture of th e abdominal aortic aneurysm or from any 
procedure intended to treat the AAA. If a death occurred  within [ADDRESS_353478] Approval Study 
 
Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, 2013  Page 25 The null hypothesis that will be tested is: 
 
H0:  ARMF5 ≤  92 %, 
 where ARMF5 is the 5-year freedom from ARM rate in the populati on of patients treated 
with the Endurant Bifurcated Stent Graft System and 92.0% is the PG.  The alternative hypothesis is:  
H1:  ARMF5 > 92 %, 
 where ARMF5 is as above.  This comparison will be performed based on a Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis of the ARM. 
All deaths will be adjudicated by a CEC to  determine device, procedure and/or AAA 
relatedness.  This study primary endpoint wi ll be also analyzed for th e AUI arm descriptively, 
calculating the KM estimate of 5-year fr eedom from ARM along with a 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval.  
7.2. BIFURCATED LITERATURE DERIVED PERFORMANCE GOAL (PG) 
 A comprehensive literature review of the journal articles reporting ARM rates, calculated by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier analysis or life-table an alysis for Endovascular Aneurysm Repair 
(EVAR) through five years from the period of 2004 to 2010 was performed using the PubMed search engine.   The key words (as single words or in combina tion) such as “Abdominal aortic aneurysm 
and aneurysm-related death” and “EVAR a nd aneurysm-related death” were employed. 
These chosen key words were deliberately broa d, to include as many articles as possible 
for review. Articles that appear ed relevant based on title and abstract were reviewed in 
detail.   Criteria for inclusion into the PG analysis were:  
 An ARM rate calculated by [CONTACT_289799]-M eier analysis or life-table analysis, 
with the ARM rate clearly indicated by [CONTACT_289800]. 
 The definition of ARM must be either expl icitly stated or co uld be deduced from 
the article.  
 The rate must be specific for the time frame to be analyzed (i.e., rates were not extended outwards to later time frames, but were within the specified time frame 
of the study and study analysis). 
 On the basis of the above search criteria, [ADDRESS_353479] Approval Study 
 
Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, 2013  Page 26 6385 subjects treated with EVAR were accounted  for in the 13 journa l articles reviewed 
for this analysis.  
 A definition of ARM inclusive of a death related to the implant procedure <30 days from 
implantation or >30 days after implantation if  the death is deemed procedure related in 
the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_289775].  After reviewing the articles, the weighted average freedom  from ARM by [CONTACT_257153] 
(as reported in EVAR literature)  is 95.99% (or 96%) at 5 years. With a clinical acceptable 
margin and variations reported in the literature, the PG for freedom from ARM at 5 year 
is set to be 92% with inputs from both clinician and FDA.  
 
7.3. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS  
 The sample size calculation is based on the primary analysis for the bifurcated arm as analysis for the AUI arm is descriptive. 
 
The statistical analysis of the 5-year pos t approval safety endpoint assumes a 97.3% 
freedom from ARM at 5 years and a 15% a nnual attrition rate. These assumptions are 
based on: 
 The current Vitality post-approval st udy results (P070027/R015), which show a 
96.9% freedom from ARM at 5 years as outlined in the 2012 study Annual 
Progress Report, and 
 The [ADDRESS_353480]-approval study re port (P100021/R005), which shows  a 
99.7% freedom from ARM at 3 years, and an 8.5% annual attrition rate during the 
first [ADDRESS_353481] s, will yield approximately 170 evaluable 
subjects at the 5
th year and this will provide a minimum of 90% statistical power for a 1-
sided test at a 0.[ADDRESS_353482] the Performance Goal (PG). 
Therefore, according to these assumpti ons, enrolling additional [ADDRESS_353483]

7.6. ANALYSIS METHODS  
 Statistical analyses for this post-approval st udy will take place after the final subject’s [ADDRESS_353485] to minimize the incidence of study deviations and missing data, and all subjects with assessable data will be accounted for. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) for 
Windows (Version 9.1 or higher) or other valid ated statistical or graphical software. 
 Data generated from the clin ical study will be analyzed as specified in the following 
sections. Subject data listings, tabular, and graphical repres entations will be provided. In 
general, for categorical vari ables, frequency and percenta ge will be presented as 
descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, a nd maximum will be reported. 
 
7.6.1 Data Analysis Subsets 
 All analyses will be constructed using an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population. This analysis set is defined as all subjects who were en rolled, i.e. when vessel access is achieved 
through a cut down or percutaneous approach  with the intention of implanting the 
Endurant Stent Graft System.  The ITT analys is set will be used for all safety and 
effectiveness analyses.    
 7.6.2 Analysis of the Primary Study Endpoint 
 
In the bifurcated arm, the statistical hypot hesis will be tested by [CONTACT_147572] a 1-sided 
95% confidence limit for the 5-year KM estimate and comparing it to the Performance 
Goal (PG).  The confidence limit will be based on the Greenwood standard error and 
using a normal approximation. If the lower confidence limit is greater than the Performance Goal (PG), then the null hypothesis (see Section 7.1) will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis and a higher than 92% fre edom from ARM rate at 5 
year will be concluded.  In the AUI arm, a KM estimate will be cal culated along with a 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the freedom from ARM at [ADDRESS_353486] Approval Study

visit / contact [CONTACT_289802].  
 
7.6.3 Analysis of the Additional Measures 
 For these additional measures, which are all proportions, a 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval will be constructed based on the binominal distribution, i.e., using the exact 
method.  Because these confidence  intervals are strictly descri ptive, i.e., no statistical 
hypothesis to be tested, no multiplicity adjust ment of the confidence level will be 
performed.   
7.6.4 Analysis of the Acute Procedural and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289777]. For duration of procedure, 
volume of estimated blood loss, length of time in intensive care unit (ICU) and length of 
time in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (from admission to discharge)  will be summarized using mean, standard 
deviation, median, min and max. For pr oportion of subject s undergoing general 
anesthesia and proportion of subjects requ iring blood transfusion, the number and 
percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. All ITT subjects with available data will be included in the analysis.   
7.6.[ADDRESS_353488] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum value for each. All ITT subjects 
with available data will be included in the analysis.  
 
7.6.6 Subset Analyses 
 
By-sex/gender and by-race (white vs. non-white) subset analyses will be performed on the 5-
year ARM rate separately for the bifurcated arm and AUI arm. A 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval based on a KM estimate of the rate will be calculated for each arm using the Greenwood standard error and normal approximation. In addition, this study will also attempt 
to better understand the overall outcomes in females and non-whites undergoing 
endovascular repair (EVAR) with the Endurant device. The study report will summarize the 
current research results of females and nonwhites having undergone EVAR, and a literature 
review and study outcome description of both females and non-whites will be provided with each regular post-approval study update. Publi cations to be examined will include single-
center experiences and multicenter trials. Specifically, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize literature derived outcomes in patients with the EVAR therapy, literature-derived

follow-up or withdraw.  For these exceptions, a nd to take into account all available data, 
the following rules and time windows will be app lied in the statistical analyses (Table 3).

5 Year 1826 1645 – [ADDRESS_353490] of the known year will be used. Fu rthermore, adverse events or death 
may be observed at any time during the study, so no time windows will be applied.  An 
event that occurs “within 1 month” is an even t that takes place between Days 0 to Day 30 
inclusive.  The same applies to events such as adverse events or death within 1 year, i.e., 
Day 0 – Day 365 inclusive.  
7.6.8 Patient Withdrawal and Missing Data 
 Intent-to-treat analysis allows for the eval uation of all subjects who enrolled the study, 
even though some may not comple te the study (e.g., subjects who are, for any reason, lost 
to follow-up, drop-outs, or term inated by [CONTACT_1697]).  The intent-to-treat principle 
means that analysis will be based on observed results of all subjects for the treatment as they are enrolled to receive. Imputation of  missing data will not be performed in the

9.1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
 
The study population will include those patien ts who are appropriate candidates for 
endovascular repair of abdominal aortic an eurysms (evidenced by [CONTACT_289807]-
enhanced CT or MRA) and who fulfill all of th e following eligibility cr iteria.  Data will 
be recorded on the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Form. 
 
9.1.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
 Age ≥18 years  
 Indication for elective surgical repair of AAA with an endovascu lar stent graft in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines on endovascular interventions and the 
Instructions for Use of the Endurant Stent Graft System  
 Signed consent form. The subject or legal re presentative has been informed of the 
nature of the trial and has consented to participate and authorized the collection and release of his medical information 
 Intention to electively implant the Endurant Stent Graft System 
 Ability and willingness to comply with the Clinical Investigational Plan (CIP). 
 
9.1.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
 High probability of non-adherence to  physician’s follow-up requirements 
 Current participation in a concurrent trial which may confound study results 
 Female of childbearing potential in whom pregnancy cannot be excluded or who 
is lactating. 
 
9.2. PATIENT SCREENING , ENROLLMENT , AND PRE-IMPLANT 
PROCEDURES  
 Investigators will assess potential patients with an abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysm for their suitability for enrollment in the study.  Initially, patient eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_289808]-enhanced CT /MRA.   If the patient appears to meet the eligibility 
criteria, then the investigator will disc uss the study with the patient and provide 
information relating to the potential risks a nd benefits, and required follow-up procedures 
per the informed consent process (Section 8.3 – Informed Consent).  After the patient 
voluntarily has signed and dated the informed  consent document, the patient will be 
considered a study candidate, i. e., subject, and move on to the screening phase of the 
enrollment process.  If a patient does not sign the informed consent document, then screening procedures for the ENGAGE PAS c linical study must not proceed.  To avoid 
subject selection bias, consecuti ve screening and enrollment will be expected. Subjects 
will be screened consecutively for stent graf t implantation and enrollment into ENGAGE 
PAS. Consecutive enrollment is strongly encourag ed in order to minimize selection bias.

 Test results that are within the timeframes specified below may be used even though the
 
actual test was done prior to a patient’s info rmed consent.  This may be done only for 
standard of care tests with the intent to mi nimize stress and discomfort to the patient and 
reduce costs.   Required screeni ng evaluations include the following. 
 
 Physical examination (within 1 month of index procedure). 
 Pregnancy test (for female  patients of childbearing pot ential).  Test must be 
completed at the time of screening (prior to) the index procedure.   Results must be 
negative. 
 CT or MRA with contrast of the abdomen  and pelvis (celiac to external iliac 
arteries) completed within 4 months prior to the index procedure.  This will be used to visualize and asse ss the characteristics, length,  and diameters of the AAA 
and the surrounding anatomy.   
 Laboratory tests (completed within 1 m onth prior to the index procedure) to 
include serum creatinine and INR. 
 Those patients who sign and date the informed  consent document, meet all of the study 
eligibility criteria, and complete and pass the screening evaluations will be eligible for 
enrollment into the clinical study.   
The subject will be considered to be enroll ed when vessel access is achieved through 
a cut down or percutaneous approach with the intention of impl anting the Endurant

Potential (anticipated) adve rse events that may be associated with endovascular 
implantation of an abdominal aortic stent graf t are listed in Section [ADDRESS_353503] actual diagnoses/syndromes a nd not merely clinical signs 
or symptoms, if possible.  For example, if ch est pain is recorded as an adverse event and 
the diagnosis is actually Myoc ardial Infarction, then the ev ent should be reported as a 
Myocardial Infarction.  Events reported shou ld represent a new onset  or increase in the 
severity of the condition from the time of  enrollment in the study (the subject is 
considered to be enrolled when vessel access is achieved through a cut down or 
percutaneous approach with the intention of  implanting the Endurant Stent Graft System). 
 Adverse events will be reported to Medtronic Vascular on the Adverse Event Form .  
Source documentation for adverse events must be collected and filed with the subject’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853].  Refer to Section 10 – Adve rse Event Definitions and Expedited Reporting 
for additional information.  Adverse events that are inherent to a surgic al procedure and expected to occur in most 
subjects for a projected duration according to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_289785].  Such events include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table 6.  These adverse events should not be reported during this study.

Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, 2013  Page 45 submitted.  When the death occurs at a non-in vestigational site, it is the investigative 
center’s responsibility to attemp t to retrieve information about the death.  If the death 
does not occur in an institution, then the in vestigator must submit a summary of the 
known events surrounding the death. All patient d eaths will be classified according to the 
following definitions of mortality.   
 
Aneurysm-Related Death 
Aneurysm-Related Death is defined as death from rupture of the abdominal aortic 
aneurysm or from any procedure intended to  treat the AAA. If a death occurred within 30 
days of any procedure intended to treat the AAA, then it is  presumed to be aneurysm 
related unless there is evidence to the cont rary. Deaths occurring after 30 days of any 
procedure intended to treat the AAA that ar e procedure-related should be aneurysm 
related. 
 
Perioperative Death 
Any death that occurs intraope ratively or within 30 days of  the primary procedure.  In 
addition, any death that occurs beyond 30 days while the patient is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289786] a perioperative death. 
 “Within 30 days” is defined as within 30 days of the procedure or at  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
whichever is longer.   In the event of a patient de ath, the Enduran t Stent Graft
 should be explanted (when 
feasible) and returned to Me dtronic Vascular for analysis.  Refer to Section 9.11 - 
Explanted Devices.    
9.11. EXPLANTED DEVICES  
 All explanted devices should be returned to Medtronic Vascular for analysis.  
Information pertaining to the explant procedure should be recorded on the Endovascular  
Procedure Form or Conversion to Open Repair Form .  Relevant information should 
also be recorded on associated case report forms, e.g., Adverse Event Form , Study Exit 
Form.  Detailed instructions are provided in Appendix K for explant of  the device and its return. 
An overview of the explant procedure follows.  
 Notify Medtronic Vascular when an explant has occurred.  Medtronic 
Vascular will provide a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_289787], which 
includes instructions and a return shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7801]. 
 Before the device is explanted, if possible, obtain an in situ  photograph of the 
stent graft.  At the time of removal, care should be taken to avoid excessive 
manipulation with metallic instrument s at the proximal and distal fixation 
sites.  Leave the stent graft as inta ct as possible and avoid deforming the 
device. 
 
 ENGAGE Post Approval Study 
 
Investigational Plan # 10012289:  Version 1D  Confidential 
Date: June 11, 2013  Page 46  When the explant is performed as pa rt of an autopsy or a postmortem 
procedure, the device should be carefully  excised with at least [ADDRESS_353505] 
tissue adjacent to the proximal and distal  fixation sites.  Do not disturb the 
inside surface of the stent graft. 
 Record the location of the site of the tissue removal relative to the position of 
the stent graft. 
 If possible, immediately after its removal, make photographic records of the 
explanted device and the explant site. 
 Clearly identify all components relative to surgical placement and orientation.  
Identify the proximal and distal ends.  The anterior portion of the stent graft 
should also be labeled.  Surgical clips and sutures can be used to label the 
explanted device.  A complete reco rd of labeling methodology should be 
made at the time of the explant procedur e and be included with the explanted 
product and any relevant reports. 
 Complete the Explant Form (non-CRF: located in Appendix K).  Labels are 
provided in the explant kit. 
 The subject undergoing explant as a sec ondary procedure will be followed for 
1 month subsequent to removal of the device. 
 A summary of the explant findings w ill be provided to the investigator. 
 
9.12. STUDY EXIT 
 
The Study Exit Form should be completed at the time a s ubject is exited from the study.  
A subject will be considered to have exit ed from the study for any of the following 
reasons.  
 Subject completes follow-ups requi red by [CONTACT_289813]. 
 Subject dies. 
 Subject requests to be withdrawn. 
 Physician requests that patient be wit hdrawn to protect the welfare of the 
patient. 
 Patient is lost to follow-up. 
 Other (specify). 
 A subject may elect to withdraw from the study at any time.  The subject should notify 
the investigator.  The investig ator and research staff shoul d encourage all subjects to 
return for required follow-up visits.  A subject is considered lost to follow-up if by [CONTACT_289814]-up visit. Only at this time s hould the subject be exited from the trial.   
 The site research staff should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_289815]-up visit, despi[INVESTIGATOR_289788].  The clinical objective may be jeopardized if  a large number of subjects are lost to follow-up or 
withdraw consent.

2. Medtronic Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) will continue  to contact [CONTACT_289816]-up visit to ensu re a visit has been scheduled. After the 
anticipated visit takes place, the CRA will again contact [CONTACT_289817]. 
3. Sites will be informed to promptly re schedule any missed patient visits, and to 
reinforce the necessity of a follow-up visits  to confirm proper stent graft function. 
4. If a scheduled visit is missed due to patient  illness, transportation issues, or travel, 
the site will be advised to: 
 a. Reinforce the necessity of follow-up visits;  b. Identify alternate transportation sources 
c. Identify alternate investigational sites to perform required imaging for device assessment 
5. For lost-to-follow-up subjects, sites will be requested to examine the Social Security Death Index to dete rmine subject status (only th e status will be sent to 
Medtronic, excluding subject identifying information). 
 
In addition to the aforementioned steps executed at the site level, Medtronic will evaluate 
follow-up compliance at each site, on a quarterly  basis, as the electronic data capture 
system can provide regular reports on site / subject follow-up compliance rates. Those 
sites which have reported several missed visits will be contact[CONTACT_289818] a root cause of the noncompliant visits . Once this cause is determin ed, CRAs will work with the 
site to help reinforce the importance of follo w-up visits. If the site  continues to deviate 
from the follow-up schedule, additional training w ill take place at the site level. Repeated 
follow-up compliance violations within the site ’s control may result in further actions, 
including but not limited to withdrawal of pe rmission to enroll subjects at a particular 
site, or denial of futu re study participation. 
 Medtronic is committed to patient safety and realizes that follow-up visits are essential in determining any device-related issues.   By [CONTACT_289819], Medtronic 
anticipates improved subject  follow-up and site compliance with the follow-up 
requirements of the protocol.

Date: June 11, [ADDRESS_353507] identification code (site 
number, subject number and subject initials) will be assigned and used to allow identification of all data reported for each subject.  This will also ensure that the 
information can be tracked back to the source data.   
Study data may be made available to third part ies, e.g., in the case of an audit performed 
by [CONTACT_12721], provided the data  are treated confidentially and that the 
subject’s privacy is guaranteed.  The identity of a subject will never be disclosed in the 
event that study data are published. 
 
Medtronic Vascular recommends that th e study sites comply with the subject 
confidentiality provisions of the Health In surance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Sites 
should maintain patient privacy in accordan ce to federal regulations (45 CFR Parts 160 
and 164), local regulations, and institutional requirements. 
 
9.15. DEVICE TRACKING  
 The investigator also is required to maintain adequate reco rds of the Endurant Abdominal 
Stent Graft Systems used in trial subjects. Th is information is recorded in the Device 
Disposition Form. 
 
Explanted product should be returned to Medtronic Vascular (see Appendix K).   
 
9.16. STUDY TERMINATION  
 
Medtronic Vascular and/or the US FDA have the right to terminate this study at any time 
and remove all study materials from the site .  Regardless of th e underlying reason for 
terminating the study, all subjects that have been enrolled up to the point of study 
termination will continue to be followed out to the 5 year follow-up time frame.  
9.17. STUDY CLOSURE  
 
Upon completion (when all patients enrolled ha ve completed the 5-year follow-up visit or 
previously exited the study, and the CRFs a nd queries have been completed) or 
termination (closure that o ccurs prior to meeting defined endpoints) of the study, 
Medtronic Vascular and/or its designees will no tify the site.  Study closeout visits will be 
performed.  All unused study devices and any unused study materials and equipment will 
be collected and returned to Medtronic Vascular and/or its designees.  The monitors will 
ensure that the investigator’s  regulatory files are up to date  and complete and that any 
outstanding issues from previous  visits have been resolved.  Other issues that will be 
reviewed at this visit include:  discussing r ecord retention requireme nts (refer to Section 
13.1—Investigator Records), device accountability, possibility of site audits, publication 
policy, and notifying the IRB of study closure, etc.

Date: June 11, [ADDRESS_353512] report device-related deaths, serious injuries/illnesses and 
malfunctions to the FDA whenever they beco me aware of information that reasonably 
suggests that the reportable event occurred (one  of their devices has or may have caused 
or contributed to the event).  
 A device complaint is defined as any (writte n, electronic or oral communication that 
alleges) deficiencies related to the iden tity, quality, durabilit y, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of a devi ce after it is released for distribution. 
 A device malfunction is defined as failure of  a device to perform as claimed by [CONTACT_13989]. This includes all performance sp ecifications and all claims made in the 
instruction for the device.  Serious injury/ Serious illness is defi ned as an injury or illness that 
 is life threatening. 
 results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure; or 
 necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of 
a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.

14.1. CLINICAL EVENTS COMMITTEE  
 
A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is a group of physicians independent of the clinical 
study with expertise and experience in the ar ea of AAA stent grafts .  The members may 
be interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, or 
interventional radiologists.  The CEC will review and adjudicate all major adverse events (refer to Appendix B), (except pr ocedural blood loss) through th irty days post-procedure.  
The CEC will review and adjudicate all deaths and any unanticipated adverse device effects that occur during the five year follo w-up period.  The CEC will also review and 
adjudicate any datapoints pertai ning to stent graft occlusio ns, device migrations, type I 
and III endoleaks and AAA sac enlargement that  require further clarification. The CEC 
will review events when the MCRI (Medtron ic Clinical Research Institute) Clinical 
Safety forwards the relevant documentation to  the members. These events are reviewed 
by [CONTACT_289828], proce dure related and/or 
aneurysm related.   The CEC will meet periodically and follow specific criteria to classify and adjudicate the aforementioned events and patient deaths.   A Manual of Operations will be developed 
that will detail the operations of the committee.   Results of the adju dication process will 
be recorded by [CONTACT_289829].

repeat endovascular intervention and/or open surgical repair.  Since the Endurant Stent Graft System is a significant risk device, a ll risks may not be known..   These risks are 
believed to be similar to those associated  with the existing commercial endovascular 
devices available as well as the risks associated with standard open surgical repair of AAA.  All efforts will be made to minimize thes e risks by [CONTACT_289830].  Also, risk minimi zation activities were performed during 
development and design verification tests of th e device.  Activities intended to minimize 
risks include the following. 
 Investigator and study personnel training will be conducted to share information 
regarding the design of the Endurant Stent Graft System , its application and pre-
clinical results. 
 Adherence to eligibility criteria and sc reening procedures will ensure that 
appropriate patients are enrolled.   
 Adherence to the Endurant St ent Graft System Instructions for Use packaged with 
the device (Appendix A). 
 The subjects will be carefully monitored throughout the study period.   
 The investigator will evaluate the subject adverse events during the course of the 
study. 
 Data submitted from the investigative centers will be monitored during the course 
of the study.   
 Monitoring visits will be conducted to ev aluate protocol compliance and data

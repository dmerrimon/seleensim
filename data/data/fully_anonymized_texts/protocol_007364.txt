2.1 Trial Design  
This is a single -arm, open -label, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti -PD-1 antibody 
MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with standard of care gemcitabine and cisplatin 
chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum -resistant ovarian cancer (encompasses  ovarian, 
peritoneal and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351]).  Subjects will receive [ADDRESS_642650] scan will occ ur at baseline and 
every 6 weeks (after each second  cycle)  during chemotherapy treatment and every 9 weeks during the 
maintenance phase (or earlier than every 6 -9 weeks as clinically indicated per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) .  The 
primary endpoint is efficacy as define d overall response rate by [CONTACT_119549] (RECIST v.1.1).  Secondary endpoints  for efficacy  include progression free survival at 6 and 
12 months, time to progression, duration of response and overall survival.  Safety and tole rability of the 
regimen will be determined by [CONTACT_499419] (CTCAE v.4).  Quality of life will be measured 
using the FACIT -TS-G and FACT -G (See APPEN DIX).

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information on MK -
3475.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_642651] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n has 
been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in vari ous mal ignancies  [1-3].  In particular, 
the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems 
to correlate with improved p rognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors  [4]. 
The PD -[ADDRESS_642652] hijacked by t umors to suppress immune 
control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_941] g ene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -
4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its 
ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD-L2) [5].  The structure of m urine PD -1 has been resolved .  PD -1 and family 
members are type I transmembra ne glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  
Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_642653] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules  
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_272446] t of signaling proteins .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  
Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T -cells 
as well as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues 
as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - 
and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known

Page 11 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  [ADDRESS_642654] notably 
on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting 
cells found in lymph oid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell 
function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers 
were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -
L1 pathway plays a critical rol e in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction  between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and 
PD-L2.  In September, 2014, KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) was approved in the United State s for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BR AF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.  KeytrudaTM was also granted 
accelerated approval in October 2015 by [CONTACT_499420] -small cell lung 
cancer whose disease has progressed after other treatments and with tumors that exp ress PD -L1. 
4.1.2  Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.[ADDRESS_642655] lethal of the gynecologic malignancies.  Wh ile 75% of patients with 
advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_499393] a clinical remission following surgical cytoreduction and 
platinum and taxane based chemotherapy, the vast majority will relapse and develop chemoresistant 
disease  [6].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_499394], fewer than 50% of patients 
with stage III or IV disease will surviv e longer than 5 years. There is a critical need  for more effective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_499395].  
In solid tumors including melanoma, lung, kidney, prostate and other cancers, modulation of the 
immune system is showing promise as an effective treatment strategy  [7].  This is an active area of 
research in many tumor types  and the optimal immunotherapy approach for  ovarian cancer patients  
has yet to be defined . 
Therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoin ts releases the silencing of cytotoxic T -cell responses and 
allows for effective anti -tumor immune responses.  In an earlier study, a ntibody treatment against PD -
L1 (BMS -936559) caused tumor regression and prolonged disease stabilization in heavily pretrea ted 
patients with a variety of solid tumors and also showed a milder toxicity profile compared to anti -CTLA -
4 antibody treatment [8].  However, in this trial, on ly 1 of 17 patients with advanced ovarian cancer 
demonstrated an objective response.  In 2015 , Hamanishi and colleagues reported data on the efficacy 
and safety  of an anti -PD-1 antibody  (BMS -936558, nivolumab) in patients with platinum -resistant 
ovarian ca ncer [9, 10].   Used as a single agent, the anti -PD-1 treatment was found to be well tolerated 
and asso ciated with a 15% best overall response rate and 45% disease control rate.  The median 
overall survival time was [ADDRESS_642656] chemotherapy, response rates to la ter-line agents range from 10 -20%.  
One of the more effective treatment o ptions in this setting has been the combination use of cisplatin 
and gemcitabine chemotherapy.  Laboratory studies demonstrate synergy between the compounds 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 12 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  and the ability of gemcitabine to reverse platinum resistance  [11].  There have been three clinical trials 
testing the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine in platinum -resistant ovarian cancer populations.  
The results are summarized below.  
1. Rose, et al.   Gynecol Oncol 200 3 [12].  In this single institution study, 36 platinum -resistant ovarian 
cancer patients (multiple prior chemotherapy regimens eligible) were tr eated with gemcitabine 750 
mg/m2 + cisplatin 3 0 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  There were 4 (11%) complete 
responses, 11 (31%) partial responses, 9 (26%) stable disease and 11 (31) progressive disease.  
Among the responders, the median duration of response was 11 months.  Progression -free interval 
was 6 months and median overall survival was 12 months.   Responses were seen, even in the setting 
of prior gemcitabine exposure.  Four of six patients who failed prior gemcitabine treatment were 
respond ers to the regimen.  
2. Nagourney, et al. Gynecol Oncol 200 3 [13].  In this single institution study, 27 patients with platinum -
resistant ovarian cancer (multi ple prior chemotherapy regimens eligible) were treated with cisplatin 30 
m/gm2 and gemcitabine 600 -750 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  There were 7 (26%) 
complete responses, 12 (44%) partial resp onses, 7 (26%) stable disease and 1 (4%) disease 
progression.  The median time to progression for objective responders was 8 months.  
3. Brewer, et al.  Gynecol Oncol 2006  [14].  In this multi -center cooperative g roup, GOG trial (GOG 
126-L), 59 patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer (eligibility limited to one prior platinum -based 
regimen) were treated with cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followe d by [CONTACT_35421] 750 mg/m2.  The dose of 
gemcitabine was reduced to 600 mg /m2 due to hematologic toxicity.  There were 4 (7%) complete 
responses, 5 (9%) partial responses, 31 (54%) stable disease and 12 (21%) progressive disease.  The 
median time to progression was 5.[ADDRESS_642657] that chemotherap y and immunotherapy could work synergistically 
when sequenced properly .  Established tumors employ  a number of powerful immunosuppressive 
mechanisms to escape immune surveillance  [5].  Chemothera py reverses suppression by [CONTACT_499421] T -regulatory cells and triggers  a “re-booting” of the  immune system that causes  T-cells 
to become more susceptible to antigen -recognition [15-19].  Removal of tumor burden relieves  the 
immune system from persistent antigen presentation  which subsequently removes tolerance and allows  
T cells to regain anti -tumor function [20].   
Cisplatin  and gemcitabine also have specific impacts on the immune system.  Cisplatin decreases T -
regulatory and myeloid derive d suppressor cells (MDSC)  and sensitizes  tumor cells to T cell -mediated 
lysis [21, 22]. Gemcitabine dow nregulates MDSC  and has direct immunostimulatory effects [23, 24].   
Clinical trials c ombining i mmune checkpo int inhibitors with chemotherapy have  recently been reported 
and the combination  demonstrate s anti-tumor activity with acceptable toxicity .  A phase I study 
combining nivolumab  (anti-PD-1) with platinum -based doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin/gemcitabine, 
cisplatin/pemetrexed, carboplatin/paclitaxel) in non -small cell lung cancer demonstrated antitumor 
activity, no dose -limiting toxicities during the first 6 weeks of treatment, an acceptable toxicity profile 
and encouraging 1 year overall survival (ASCO 2014,  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  [25].  Nivolumab and 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 13 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  [ADDRESS_642658] similar toxicity profiles [26].  As the safety of anti -PD-1 inhibition with cisplatin and 
gemcitabine has been demonstrated in this prior trial (no dose limiting toxicities), we p lan to study the 
combination of pembrolizumab with the cisplatin/gemcitabine platinum doublet  in this trial with a phase 
II design with early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106] .   
Additional research suggests that the phasing of immunotherapy with chemotherapy has an impact on 
efficacy of the combination.  A phase II study combining the anti -CTLA4 antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499396] -line treatment of advanced non -small cell lung cancer showed no 
improvement in progression -free survival (PFS)  when  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499397].  However, when ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499398] a phased regimen that allowed for antigen release to occur prior to 
immunotherapy expos ure, there was an improvement in PFS [27].   
Based on this prior experience, we will evaluate the impact of adding the anti -PD-1 antibody MK -3475 
(pembrolizumab) to standard of care cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy in the treatment of 
patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.  We will administer two cycles of chemotherapy to allow 
for tumor cytoreduction, tumor antigen release, decrease in suppressive T-regulatory and myeloid 
derived suppressor cells and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.  Pembrol izumab will be added 
to cycles 3-[ADDRESS_642659] meets withdrawal criteria .   
  
4.2.2  Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) has been  conducted by M erck to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were 
observed.  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  
No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest do se tested in PN001, will be the 
dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  
Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of 
MK-3475 and a less f requent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited 
volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been perfo rmed  by M erck using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_642660] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma ind ication.  The 
differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight 
based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for 
MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposu re margins are based on the notion of similar 
efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
(i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of  tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the 
NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.  
 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 14 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and co mparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors 
is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of pembrolizumab for both 
efficacy a nd safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor 
burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_499422]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab tar get engagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose 
of 20 0 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained 
with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure 
range established in melanoma as associated with maximal effic acy response and 3) will maintain 
individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and 
safe.  
4.2.3  Rationale for Endpoints  
We will  assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with cisplatin and gemcitabine c hemotherapy 
in patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.  We will evaluate  overall response rate as the primary 
efficacy endpoint and progression -free survival at 6 and  12 months, time to progression, duration of 
response  and overall survival  as sec ondary efficacy endpoints.  Efficacy will be determined by  [CONTACT_499423] d every 2 cycles  during chemotherapy and every 3 cycles  thereafter (or earlier as clinically 
indicated per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) until disease progression or treatment discontinuatio n.  Response will be 
determined by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_642661] .  To determine safety, we will repor t the frequency and 
intensity of adverse events by [CONTACT_499424] (CTCAE v.4 criteria) .

Page 19 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or 
several months after the  last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug -related 
toxicities and severe or lif e-threatening AEs as per Table [ADDRESS_642679] Guidance Document for supportive care guidelines, 
including use of corticosteroids.  
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical r easons not 
related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or 
holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the PI. The reason for interruption should be documented 
in the patient's study record.   
A maximum of two dose level modification  to chemotherapy is permitted before withdrawing the patient 
from further chemotherapy , although patient may continue on Pembrolizumab  monotherapy, should 
they not tolerate the combination treatment.

- Primary prophylaxis with a CSF s tarting with the first cycle and continuing through subsequent 
cycles of chemotherapy is recommended in patients who have an approximately 20% or higher 
risk for febrile neutropenia based on patient -, disease -, and treatment -related factors.  In 
addition t o chemotherapy regimen and type of malignancy, consider the following factors when 
estimating the patient’s overall risk of febrile neutropenia: age ≥ 65 years, advanced disease, 
previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, preexisting neutropenia or bone m arrow 
involvement with tumor, infection, open wounds or recent surgery, poor nutritional status, poor 
renal function, liver dysfunction (most notably elevated bilirubin), cardiovascular disease, 
multiple comorbid conditions.  
- Secondary prophylaxis with a C SF is recommended for patients who experienced a 
neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of chemotherapy (for which primary prophylaxis 
was not received).  
- CSFs should be considered in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for 
infecti on-associated complications or who have prognostic factors predictive or poor clinical 
outcomes.  High-risk features include expected prolonged (> 10 days) and profound (ANC < 
100 cells/mm3) neutropenia, age > 65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumo nia, 
hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499401].  
- Pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, tbo -filgrastim, and filgrastim -sndz (and other biosimilars, as they 
become available) can be used for the prevention of treatment -related febrile neutropenia.  The 
choice of agent depends on convenience, cost, and clinical situation.

Protocol Version 11:  [ADDRESS_642685] prior to cycle 3 of treatment (after receiving 2 
cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine), the patient will b e considered refractory to chemotherapy.  
Cisplatin and gemcitabine will not be administered for further cycles and the patient may continue on 
the trial and receive single agent pembrolizumab.   
Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce a nti-tumor effects by [CONTACT_128655] -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an approach 
can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of 
new lesions.  
After the  site has assessed the first radiographic evidence of progressive disease (PD) by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
after the addition of pembrolizumab to trial therapy (cycle 3 and beyond), tumor assessment may be 
repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_642686] with the opti on for continuing treatment while 
awaiting radiologic confirmation of disease progression.  
Subjects may continue to receive study treatment while awaiting confirmation of PD if they are clinically 
stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
- Absence of si gns and symptoms (including worsening of lab values) indicating disease 
progression  
- No decline in ECOG performance status  
- Absence of rapid progression of disease  
- Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomic sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention  
If repeat i maging shows SD, PR, or CR by [CONTACT_19393] , the subject may continue on study treatment and 
undergo regularly scheduled imaging assessments.   
Note: If a subject with confirmed radiographic progression (i.e. [ADDRESS_642687] 28 days apart 
demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved , and there is no further 
increase in the tumor dimensions at the confirmatory tumor image, an exception may be considered to 
continue treatment  upon consultation with the PI.  
 
5.2.3  Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have 
been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).   
The administration of da y 1 treatment may be adjusted +/ - 3 days to accommodate schedule changes . 
The administration of day 8 treatment may be  adjusted +/ - 1 day to accommodate schedule changes.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Gemcitabine  750 mg/ m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 will be given on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 -day treatment 
cycle for a total of 6 cycles.  To decrease the risk of hematologic toxicity, gemcitabine will be given prior 
to cisplatin.  Antiemetic agents may includ e, but are not limited  to ondansetron, granisetron, Ativan,

indicated .  A window of -10 minutes and +10 minutes is permit ted for chemotherapy administration.  
Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 will be administered IV over 30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes) .  Cisplatin 30 mg/m2 
will be administered IV over 60 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes) .   
Pembrolizumab [ADDRESS_642689] m eets withdrawal criteria.   
Every effort  should be made  to target  pembrolizumab  infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitt ed (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min .  The Pharmacy Manual 
contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration 
of infusion solution.  
5.2.4  Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, [COMPANY_006] , investigator , and subject will know the treatment 
administered.  
5.3 Randomization or Treatment Allocation  
This is a single -arm study.  No randomization will occur.  
5.4 Stratification  
Patients will be stratified based on number of prior chemothera peutic regimens (1 versus more tha n 1; 
prior cis/gem versus no prior cis/gem) .  
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the 
ongoing tri al.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  
The investigator should discuss any questions regardi ng this with the [COMPANY_006] C linical team .  The final 
decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_642690]’s welfare may be administered at 
the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -
the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the 
trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the 
CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_642691] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  5.5.2  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130970] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy o r biological therapy  not specified in this protocol   
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solit ary lesion may be allowed at the 
investigator’s discretion .   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_642692] dose of trial treatment and while participating in 
the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  An exception can be made to a llow for  the 
use of  decadon 10  or 20  mg IV as an antiemetic premedication prior to chemotherapy (section 
5.2.3).  Otherwise, t he use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after 
consultation with [COMPANY_006] . 
Subjects who, in the assessment by t he investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describ es other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.6.1  Supportive Care Guidelines  for pembrolizumab  
Subjects should receive appropriate supp ortive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the ECI guidance document. 
Where  appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid ta pering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive car e. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to 
follow the ECI re porting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in 
the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, can 
be found in the ECI guidance document.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  5.6.2  Suggested supportive care measures:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When sympt oms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks.  
▪ Pembrolizumab can be restarted when toxicity resolved to grade [ADDRESS_642693] dose or inability to reduce corticosteroid to 10 mg or less of 
prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.

5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.7.[ADDRESS_642704] -
feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered 
highly unlikely to conceive.  Highl y unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) 
postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year 
will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  The 
two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method 
to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from study Visit [ADDRESS_642705] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_47446]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will 
include any registered and mark eted contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they 
must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of  the study and during 
the follow -up period defined in section 7.2.[ADDRESS_642706]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the 
pregnancy will be reported  to the IRB and to [COMPANY_006] within 10 days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_499403].   If the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, 
or other disabling or life -threatening co mplication to the mother or newborn) , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_499404], will report within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] .  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the IRB.

7.1.2  Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
During the screening phase, subjects will sign consent and undergo evaluations for inclus ion and 
exclusion criteria, demographics, medical history, medication review, adverse event review, physical 
examination, vital signs and weight, ECOG performance status, laboratory evaluations (CBC with 
differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, ur ic acid, phosphorus, magnesium, direct bilirubin, 
urinalysis, coagulation studies, thyroid studies, CA125, urine or serum pregnancy test  (if indicated) , 
optional blood for correlative studies), CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and optional CT-
guide d biopsy of tumor if possible.  Pathology reports from the original surgery will be reviewed to 
confirm diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], peritoneal or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351].   
During the treatment phase, subjects will be monitored with history and physical  examination, vital 
signs, weight, assessment of adverse events and mediation review prior to each treatment cycle.  
These assessments may occur during a clinic visit in between cycles that is distinct from a treatment 
day.  Laboratory studies can be perfo rmed up to 72 hours prior to treatment .  Assessment of thyroid 
function and blood collection for correlative studies will be performed prior to every even cycle (cycles 
2, 4, 6).  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed after every secon d cycle during 
chemotherapy ( window of 10 -21 days after day 1 of cycles 2, 4, 6 ) and every 9  weeks thereafter  or as 
clinically indicated  (window of 10 -21 days after day 1 of cycles 9, 12, 15 , etc. ).  Similar assessments

significant labs will be repeated within 3 days.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening A Es as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  Adverse 
experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 1 1.2).  Toxicities wi ll be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  
For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated with 
pembrolizumab exposure should  be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the 
separate ECI guidance document regarding the identification, evaluation and man agement of potential 
irAEs.   
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full Physical Exam  
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening 
period.   Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history.  A full physical 
exam should be performed during screening .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investig ator or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment 
administration  either on the date of treatment or during a clinic visit preceding the date of treatment .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
The investigator or qua lified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of 
each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], weight and blood 
pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.

sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal pr oduct or protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associ ated with the use of [COMPANY_006] ’s product, is also an adverse event.

protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (inclu ding placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_78027]. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] ’s product in clinical trials or within the 
follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period as a

All adverse events  with the exception of grade 1 or 2 laboratory abnormalities  will be recorded from the 
time the consent form is signed through 30 days following cessation of treatment and at each 
examination on the Adverse Event case repo rt forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse 
events meeting any serious criteria is described in section [IP_ADDRESS].  
7.2.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
All non -hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE v4 is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
Mild (grade 1 ): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities.  
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.  
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or s ignificantly 
affects his/her clinical status.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
 
7.2.3  Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the IRB and 
to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose 
of pembrolizumab. Appropriate support ive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated

  7.3.3  Investigator  Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and to [COMPANY_006]  in accordance with 
all applicable global laws and regulati ons.  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
8.1 Trial Design  
The design for this one -arm phase II trial follows the classical two -stage design proposed by 
[CONTACT_52254] (1989) [31].  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ov erall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of 
patients who achieve a complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1 criteria [32, 33].  
- Compl ete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
- Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
- Stable disease (SD): Neither insufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD (see below), taking as reference the smallest sum diame ters 
while on study.  
- Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative  increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least [ADDRESS_642749] 6 cycles of 
therapy [33].   
A proportion of patients with a favorable response of less than 11.1% will be  of no interest.  The

8.4 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499410] a grade 3 or 4 pembroli zumab attributable  toxicity  that 
results in permanent discontinuation of the drug (see table 3 and section 5.6.1).   Let Pt be the 
true probability of an undesirable event. The trial will stop if there is statistical evidence that Pt 
exceeds 0.4. We will u se a Bayesian sequential design by [CONTACT_499435]. The decision rule is to stop the 
trial if the posterior probability that Pt exceeds the threshold is 0.95; for example, P ( Pt > 0.4 | 
data) > 0.95. A noninformative prior distribution for Pt will be used. Tables 7A and 7B give the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499411] [ADDRESS_642751], the true Pt = 0.40. This is the equivalent 
of the Bayesian t ype I error probability. The target type I error probability was set at 0.05.  
Table 7B gives the design operating characteristics under selected values of the true probability 
Pt. It gives the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499412], the expected 
sample size, and the average sample size given that the trial stopped. For example, if the true 
value of Pt is 0.7, then there is an 81% chance that the trial is stopped early and the average 
sample size is about 11.

of the expression levels of the selected biomarkers (PD -1, PD -L1, CD8, CD4, FoxP3 and Ki67), 
Pearson’s and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients will be used to assess the pairwise association 
between them. Univariate analys is based on log -rank test will be used to evaluate the association 
between biomarkers measured as categorical variables and time -to-event outcomes. Univariate Cox

11.0  DATA AND SAFETY MON ITORING  
11.1 Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
Adherence to the  protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and institutional policy will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_499414] (DRG) meetings or 
equivalent. In addition, the SOCCI CRO Quality Management Core (QMC) will  conduct the following:  
 
• Audit preparations (AP) prior to audit conducted by [CONTACT_499439] (i.e. NCI or 
FDA). The purpose an AP is to ensure adequate source documentation to support protocol compliance 
and data integrity are present and o rganized and to identify and correct any major findings prior to the 
external audit  
• A thorough review of selected subject cases, regulatory files, and IP accountability records (if 
applicable) within [ADDRESS_642759] is enrolled and ann ually thereafter while subjects 
are receiving investigational intervention.   
• Central eligibility verification for all subjects enrolled as described in protocol section 10.3.   
• Central review of all eligibility waiver requests by a SOCCI Medical Revie wer to assess 
appropriateness and risk to ensure quality data and ensure subject safety protections for investigator -
initiated research  
 
For any protocol, QMC has the authority to request more frequent reviews or closer safety monitoring 
if it is deemed ap propriate for any reason.

events and u nanticipated problems are not expected, but if they occur they will be documented and 
reported according to CSMC IRB policies and procedures. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_499415], enrollment may be held until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_292622] a 
modification to the study is necessary and/or the informed consent documents are updated accordingly.  
 
In addition, this protocol will  utilize oversight by a Safety Committee On Early Phase Studies 
(SCOEPS). Committee membership includes experts in the field of oncology and early phase studies 
and biostatistics. SCOEPS’ responsibilities are governed by [CONTACT_499440] .   
 
The SCOEPS will provide routine monitoring of safety and enrollment for all early phase investigator -
initiated trials (IITs). The committee meets routinely and is responsible for reviewing and adjudicating 
all dose -limiting toxicities, dose escalation s and appropriateness of the escalation, cohort expansion, 
subject replacements, select AEs, SAEs, and confirmation of attainment of maximum tolerated dose.  
 
The SCOEPS findings and recommendations will be reported in writing to the Principal Investigator.  A 
summary report will be forwarded by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee to the Cedars -Sinai 
Medical Center IRB.

exception most often involves a single subject  and is not a permanent revi sion to the research protocol. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_292626]/his designee is responsible for submitting a protocol exception  to the SOCCI Medical 
Director for review of the request and its supporting documentation to make a determination for further 
action. If the determination  is an approval, then the request must be submitted  in Webridge  to the 
CSMC IRB. If the request is acknowledged by [CONTACT_1201], then the   protocol exception/eligibility waiver 
may be implemented.  
Logistical deviations from the protocol (e.g., minor changes to the study schedule for an individual 
subject) do not require prior IRB approval unless the deviation has the potential to affect the subject’s 
safety. Such planned deviations that do not affect the subject’s safety should be noted in the subject’s 
research record.  Planned exceptions to the protocol that are more than logistical and/or have the 
potential to affect the subject’s safety o r study integrity may not be implemented without prior approval 
from the SOCCI Medical Director and IRB .

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  APPENDIX C: RECIST 1.1  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  Version 1.1  
C1. Measurability of tumor at baseline  
Measurable disease .  
Tumor lesions : must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plan e 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
- [ADDRESS_642774] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
- 10 mm caliper m easurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded  as non -measurable)  
- [ADDRESS_642775] x -ray 
Malignant lymph nodes : to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be ≥ [ADDRESS_642776] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be meas ured and followed.   
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions ). 
Lesions considered truly non -measurabl e include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses /abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_409576].  
C2. Methods of Measurements  
All measurements should be reco rded in metric notation, using  calipers  if clinically assessed . All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more th an 28 days before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  should always 
be done rathe r than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_461].   
C3. Baseline Documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline  and at the specified interval during treatment . Target lesions should be selected 
on the basis of their size ( lesions with the longest diameter) , be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  A sum 
of the diameter s (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . The baseline sum diameters  will be used as 
reference by [CONTACT_14218].  
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) sh ould be identified as non-target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required  and these 
lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  C4. Tumor Response Eval uation  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.   
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% dec rease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters  of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the b aseline sum if that is the smallest sum on 
study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions  is also considered progression.  
Stable D isease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.  
Special note on assessment of lymph nodes : When lymph nodes are included as target lesi on, the 
‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node 
is defined as having a short axis < [ADDRESS_642777] achieve a short 
axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the a ctual short axis measu rement of the nodes is to be inc luded 
in the sum of target lesions.   
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’ : If the radiologist believes the lesion has likely 
disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as [ADDRESS_642778] is able to provide 
an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.   
Lesions that split or coalesce on treat ment : When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters 
of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  As lesions 
coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter  
measurement of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that the are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter 
for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions  and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesions  and/or maintenance of tumor marker 
level above the normal limits , 
Progressive Disease (PD) : unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  or the appearance 
of one or more lesions.  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease or progressive disease.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  C5. Evaluation of Response  
 
When both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately.  Determination of tumor response at each assessment is summarized in the following table:  
Target Lesions  Non-target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No SD 
Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any response  PD Yes or No  PD 
Any response  Any response  Yes PD 
 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until the end of 
treatment  taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  To be assigned a status of PR or CR, 
changes in tumor measurements with responding tumors should be con firmed by [CONTACT_499442] [ADDRESS_642779] version 1 .1* will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or 
MRI may be utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.

Study Design:  
This Phase I clinical trial will evaluate w hether GLS -5700 administered via ID injection and 
followed by [CONTACT_151638] (EP) is safe, tolerated and able to generate an immune response 
against Zika virus in dengue virus -naïve participants and whether immune reactivity is dose-
dependent. Injections will be given in the deltoid muscle followed immediately by [CONTACT_151643]®-3P device.  
GLS -5700 contains plasmid pGX 7201 that encodes for a consensus sequence of the pre-
membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of Zika virus.  
Currently there are n o approved treatments or prophylactic vaccines for Zika virus . Nor have 
any vaccine candidates for Zika virus  been  advanced into human trials.   
Evaluation of ID administration of GLS -5700 :  
There are two arms for ZIKA -001. Participant s (n= 20 per group) will be administered GLS -
5700 at one of two  dose levels : 1 mg  or 2 mg DNA/do se. Vaccine will be administered as 0.1 ml 
ID injection s followed by [CONTACT_151644]®-3P device. Participant s will receive  one 
or two  injections  into the deltoid region at vacc ination at 0, 4, and 12 weeks (3 vaccination 
series) .  
Safety assessment : Participant s will be monitored for adverse events utilizing the “Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine 
Clinical Trials  (Appendix B)” with labs assessed as per site normal values. P ain will be assessed 
immediately after EP  and at [ADDRESS_174588] 
vaccinations. Adverse events, including assessment  of injection site reactions, will be monitored 
through 12 months after the final vaccination .   
In the event that a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151586] (Section 7.3.2), the study will not continue until  
a full discussion has been conducted with the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigator, and 
IRB/CER (if applicable) . 
Immunogenicity assessment : Blood will be obtained for Zika immune  responses at baseline; at 
weeks 1 , and 4; at [ADDRESS_174589] vaccination s; and at study weeks 36 
and 60. Serum will be separated and sent for  analysis for humoral responses (neutralizing and 
binding antibody titers). Whole blood will be processed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) for ELISpot and/ or ICS analysis.  Table S1: Dosing Arms and Regimens

the Pacific Ocean with an outbreak on Yap Island, Micronesia in 2007 [1], in French 
Polynesia in 2014  [2], and reaching Brazil in late 2014 or early 2015 [3, 4] . Although 
cases of Guillain Barr é syndrome (GBS) were documented in the French Polynesia n Zika 
outbreak  [5], it was not until cases of microcephaly were documented in October [ADDRESS_174595] documented a rate o f GBS of approximately 1 in 
5000 following Zika virus infection [6] and microcephaly affecting 1 -2% of fe tuses 
infected during pregnancy.  
Zika virus infection presents similarly to dengue or chikungunya with fever in most , rash, 
malaise, myalgias, conjunctivitis and retroorbital pain but may present with few , if any , 
discernable symptoms [7]. The propensity for neurologic sequelae coupled with the rapid 
spread across South A merica, Central America, and the Caribbean  has raised 
international alarm  [8]. Moreover, alternative non-mosquito -borne routes of Zika virus 
spread include through blood transfusion, breast milk [9], sexual transmission [10-12], 
and may  include  urine and saliva [13, 14] .  
Zika virus is spread primarily through Aedes  species mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, 
but can be carried and transmitted by [CONTACT_151648] [15]. Aedes  species 
mosquitoes also transmit other arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya . In fact , 
these infections are co -endemic in most regions and may cause concurrent infections [16-
18]. Most commercial flavivirus diagnostic assays are based on the NS1 protein, 
howeve r, there is significant cross -reactivity between the NS1 protein s of yellow fever , 
dengue, and Zika.  Whether prior exposure to any other arbovirus  may affect the clinical 
response to Zika virus , or vice versa,  is unknown.

Date: [ADDRESS_174597] Nile virus [21, 22]  and Dengue virus [20] have been tested as part of 
Phase I clinical trials without vaccine associated toxicity.  
1.1.3 Pre-clinical experience with GLS -5700 
The immunogenicity of pGX 7201, t he D NA plasmid that is the component comprising  
GLS -5700, has been studied in mice, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits , and rhesus macaques . As of 
this writing, challenge trials are in progress . Details are presented in the  Investigators 
Brochure and are summarized below.  
pGX7201 encodes for the pre -membrane and envelope (prME) structural proteins of the 
Zika virus. The coding sequence is a synthetic compi[INVESTIGATOR_151591] a statistical average 
of the amino acid sequence of African and Asian lineage strains published prior to  
December 2015, weighted towards the Asian lineage. The prME sequence is expressed from a modified pVAX1 expression vector, pGX0001. Expression, identity, and specificity were first determined in E. coli  following transfection into tissue culture. The 
gene tic structure of pGX7201 is such that prior work with West Nile virus and other 
flaviviruses has shown that proper folding of the envelope region occurs by [CONTACT_151649].  
Mice  were immunized  intramuscularly  (IM) into the quadriceps m uscle with either 12.5 
µg/dose or 25 µg/dose of pGX7201 at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Injection of vaccine was immediately followed by [CONTACT_151650] -3P device. Seroconversion was 
seen following a single vaccination with endpoint titers reaching ~1:10,[ADDRESS_174598] immunization. Immunization also induced neutralizing antibodies  titers of  ≥1:80 , 
(neutralizing titers ≥1:10 are considered as protective  for other viruses ).  pGX [ADDRESS_174599] based, high -level T cell responses ; ≥ 400 SFU/10
6 peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ). Based on the predicted crystal structure of the Zi ka virus 
mature pre- membrane and envelope proteins, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_151592] T cell response 
demonstrated responses  to multiple envelope domains (DI, DII, and DIII, and the carboxy 
terminal region) with minimal to no reactivity to the pre -membrane and membrane 
regio n.  
Specificity of the response was assessed by [CONTACT_151651] -reactivity of serum from 
pGX7201 (Zika virus vaccine) immunized mice against the envelope protein s of the four 
dengue serotypes; the Zika virus prME protein complex served as a positive control. 
There was no reactivity detected against any of the flavi virus dengue serotypes. 
Additional experiments to determine whether there was any cross -reactivity against the 
chikungunya envelope (chikungunya is an α arbovirus) similarly showed no reactivity  
over baseline at any titer. Thus, pGX7201 reactivity was specific to Zika virus with no 
cross -reactivity to the dengue flavivirus or other arboviruses such as chikungunya.  
These data demonstrate that the vaccine was able to generate levels of antibody and  T-
cell responses that would be predictive of protection from infection. Since the pre-membrane and membrane regions would be predicted to be conserved across flaviviruses, the lack of reactivity to this region would further support a Zika -specific respons e for 
GLS -5700 based on pGX7201.  
pGX7201 was also administered to  guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_151593] B and T cell 
responses, demonstrating its utility across multiple mammalian species.

-15- Non-human primates were immunized with pGX 7201 at either low dose ( 0.5 
mg/vaccination) or high dose (2 mg/vaccination) for three vaccinations spaced 3 weeks 
apart  by [CONTACT_151652]  (ID) or IM injection and followed by [CONTACT_151638] ( EP). 
These experiments are still in progress. Notably, after a single vaccination, [ADDRESS_174600] B cell 
responses versus only 1 of 10 animals dosed IM (5 animals in each dose group  (0.5 and 2 
mg)). All animals, whether injected ID or IM seroconverted after 2 injectio ns. 
Neutralizing activity has been detected with a single ID injection; quantification of the magnitude of the response has not yet been completed. pGX7201 also generated T cell 
responses in NHPs ; quantification of response is in progress.  
Importantly, as  Zika virus circulates with dengue and chikungunya, and  uses the same 
mosquito vectors  to spread the disease, co -immunization experiments are underway to 
assess the immunogenicity of  a single vaccine composed of DNA plasmid components 
against the Zika vir us prME (pGX7201), the four dengue serotypes , and chikunguny a 
virus in both guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_151594]- human primates.  
Challenge studies to assess whether pGX7201 is protective in mouse and primate models 
of disease  are underway. IF NAR mice (IFNα and IFNβ receptor knockouts) were first 
shown to be susceptible to Zika virus infection with mortality observed in approximately [ADDRESS_174601] the 
Usutu flavivirus [27]. Histopathology of IFNAR mice  infected with Zika virus following 
SQ administration demonstrates abnormalities restricted to the central nervous system, mimicking human disease. AG129 mice  (IFN α, β, γ receptor knockouts) have also been 
shown  to represent a lethal model for dengue virus [28], as well as for Zika virus 
infection  (unpublished). While  this mouse strain has been utilized to assess the response 
against a live -virus chimeric dengue virus vaccine  [29], its response to a DNA vaccine 
has been questi oned because of the complete loss of IFN responsiveness.

complications of infection are those occurring during fetal development and include 
microcephaly, intra -uterine growth retardation, cerebral calcificatio ns, ocular 
calcifications , and other ocular abnormalities – with an attack rate estimated at 1 – 2% of 
women who become infected during pregnancy. The rate of Zika virus -induced fetal loss 
resulting in spontaneous miscarriage is, however, unknown. In adult s, the most common 
complication of Zika virus infection is  Guillain Barré syndrome occurring at an estimated 
rate of 1 in 5,000 cases. Additional complications include  encephalomyelitis and acu te 
demyelinating encephalomyel itis (ADEM ). Zika has also result ed in deaths among adults 
with and without other complicating factors.  
Key target groups for a vaccine are therefore women of child -bearing potential, men who 
have sexual relations with women of child -bearing potential, non- immune women who 
become pregnan t, and adults in general – especially those with underlying severe disease. 
Additional implied groups are non -immune travelers to Zika endemic regions both to

to regi ons with permissive mosquito populations , to limit the spread of the virus globally.  
This clinical study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of GLS -[ADDRESS_174603] completed, human clinical trials.  Specific examples of 
DNA vaccine human experience include: Phase I and 2 trials of INO -3100, targeting the 
human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) that incorporates the HPV E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and 18 [25, 26]; and current studies of VGX -6150 Hepatitis C vaccine in patients with 
chronic infection ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), INO-4212 Zaire Ebola virus vaccine ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
and GLS -[ADDRESS_174604] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] ( MERS -CoV, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  E ach of these vaccine products use the same plasmid backbone but with 
different pathogen- specific antigen inserts. All of these products have been well tolerated 
and without vaccine associated serious adverse events ( SAEs ).

Experience with DNA vaccines using the modified pVAX1 plasmid backbone by [CONTACT_151653]. Ongoing collaborative clinical trials between Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Sci ence include a prophylactic 
vaccines against MERS -CoV  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and the Zaire strain of Ebola virus 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); and a therapeutic vaccine against genotype 1 hepatitis C virus 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Prior studies have also examined a DNA plasmid based vaccine against 
H5N1 Avian influenza ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Each vaccine construct has a similar structure: 
utilizing a pVAX1 expression vector with  an insert comprising a portion of the viral 
DNA representing a consensus sequence not found in nature. All of these vacci ne 
constructs have been administered either ID or IM and followed by [CONTACT_151654] (SSC)  buffer. In each case, 
there have  been no  vaccine- associated safety concerns; the primary adve rse event s 
reported are  transient injection site reactions.  
Many groups have also published on  DNA plasmid -based vaccine trial s. Use of DNA 
vaccines for treatment of advanced HIV infection was first published in 1998 [30] with a 
recent review  summarizing HIV related studies of greater than  1200 participant s with no 
serious DNA -vaccine associated adverse events  [31, 32] . Other notable studies include  
Phase I trials of DNA plasmid vaccines again st Ebola virus [33-35] , HPV  [25, 26] , HIV  
[36], and influenza [37]. In fact, a  DNA vaccine f or HPV has completed Phase II  and 
demonstrated the ability to reverse pre -cancerous changes of the cervix causing 
regression of cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN) grades 2 and 3 , and clearance of 
chronic HPV infection in affected women [26]. Thus  the DNA -based vaccine in this 
study,  INO-3100, is the first vaccine to achieve clearance of a chronic viral infection.

delivery of a DNA vaccine or therapeutic product, EP facilitates  entry o f the plasmid 
DNA into the target site  for antigen production: muscle or dermal cells. Following 
cellular uptake, there is efficient production of the defined pathogen- specific antigen 
proteins encoded by [CONTACT_151656]. The different EP  devices, each 
with varying electrical parameters and protocols, have been reviewed [38]. EP has been 
extensively used in large animal species, such as dogs,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], cattle, and NHP s to deliver 
therapeutic genes that encode for a variety of hormones, cytokines, enzymes or antigens 
[38], resulting in the  activation of both cellular and humoral responses in these animal 
models [39, 40] . Importantly, antigen- specific immune responses for DNA vaccines 
delivered with EP are far superior to administra tion without EP [40]. The IM delivery of 
DNA with EP is well studied and optimum conditions for plasmid uptake and expression are described for therapeutic indications , vaccines , and tumor animal model systems [41,

1.4  Risks/Benefit As sessment  
In accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), this study has 
been designed to minimize risk to study participants. Potential risks of study products and administration from studies using similar plasmids with the identica l DNA backbone are 
listed in Table 1.4.  
The potential side effects of treatment with the investigational products may include but 
not limited to discomfort related to the vaccine administrat ion and electroporation 
technique such as local edema, swelling, or pain. Systemic side effects observed with 
vaccines based on the identical backbone have been demonstrated to be generally minimal in more than [ADDRESS_174609] benefit is expected. The potential 
benefit is to determine whether this vaccine could  generate immune responses with 
potential to be sufficient as prophylactic treatment for those at risk for Zika virus  
infection.

4.4 Discontinuation/Withdrawal of Study Participant s 
A participant  will be considered to have completed t he study when he /she completes all 
scheduled  study treatments  and follow -up visits . If a participant  discontinues the study at 
any time after dosing, the investigator will make every effort to have the participant  
complete all assessments as indicated in Section 7.1 – Safety Parameters . The 
investigator will make every effort to have all scheduled immune assessment blood samples collected as indicated in the Schedule of Events, Table S2. 
Unless a participant refuses to continue participation, all follow -up visits and procedures 
should be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Events, Table S2 , following the last 
dose whether or not the participant has completed all doses .  
The reason for any discontinuation of investigational product will be discussed wit h the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and indicated on the study  forms. The primary reason for a 
participant discontinuing further dosing or withdrawal from the study itself is to be 
selected from the following standard categories:  
• Adverse Event (Adverse React ion): Clinical or laboratory events occurred that, in the 
medical judgment of the investigator, are grounds for discontinuation  for the best 
interest of the participant . This includes serious and non- serious adverse events 
regardless of relation to study d rug. 
• Death : The participant died.  
• Withdrawal of Consent : The participant  desired to withdraw from further 
participation in the study in the absence of an investigator -determined medical need 
to withdraw. If the participant  gave a reason for withdrawal,  it must be recorded on 
the case report form ( CRF ). This reason does not allow for further data collection or 
later study related procedures . 
• Protocol Violation : The participant failed to meet the protocol entry criteria or failed 
to adhere to the protocol requirements (e.g., treatment noncompliance, failure to return for defined number of visits). The violation should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to discontinuation of either study treatments or 
study withdrawal.

Date: [ADDRESS_174644] their participation discontinued by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_151601]/or tolerability issues are considere d intolerable and/or not 
manageable with symptomatic treatment. 
At a minimum, all assessments  from Week 14 visit should  be performed 
prior to withdrawal if not already completed .  
In the case of a fatal outcome, all relevant information (including cause of  
death, concomitant medication, and relationship to study treatment or 
underlying disease) will be collected.  
6.2 Timing and Evaluations  
6.2.1 Informed Consent  
Study personnel will meet with prospective study participants, explain the study, and provide them with an informed consent form (ICF) that describes the 
screening tests, eligibility criteria for entering the study, and study treatments and follow -up procedures. An informed consent must be signed prior to any study 
related procedures being performed.  A copy of  the signed and dated consent form 
will be given to the participant . 
6.2.2 Patient Identification Number  and Group Assignment s 
Each participant  who consents will be assigned a unique participant identification  
designation number (PID#) , which identifies the participant  for all study -related 
procedures that occur prior to receiving an allocation number. Once assigned, PID 
numbers cannot be reused for any reason. Information regarding participant’s 
PID#  and screen date will be documented on a screening log.  
Study p articipants will be allocated to each of the two dosing groups such that the 
initial 5 eligible participants at each of the three study sties will be assigned  to 
Group 1 at 1 mg/dose, the next 5 eligible participants at each study site will be assigned  to Group 2 at 2 mg/dose. The final study participants will be allocated  to 
the three study sites with 5 participants assigned to the 1 mg/dose group and 
allocated in a proportional manner between sites and the final 5 participants assigned to the 2 mg/dose gr oup and similarly allocated in a proportional manner 
between study sites. Sponsor reserves the right to revise allocations between study sites should unexpected delays occur or any site cannot meet recruitment goals.  
Medical History  
Investigators should do cument all significant illnesses that the participant  has 
experienced as Medical History. Illnesses’ first occurring or detected  during the 
study and/or worsening of an existing illness (es) that occur after the first 
vaccination  are to be documented as AEs  on the CRF. Prior treatments, defined as 
administered up to 8 weeks prior to the time of informed consent, will be recorded 
in the CRF as prior medications. Concomitant treatments, defined as continuing

GeneOne Life S cience, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
Date: 1 July 2016   v 1.2 
-33- or new treatments taken at or after the signing of the informed consent, will be 
recorded in the CRF as concomitant medications.  
Travel  History  
Investigators should inquire as to travel to any country or region to include the 
South Pacific Islands, South America, Central America, or the Caribbean .  
6.2.3 Safety A ssessments 
The following patient evaluations for safety will be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient self -evaluations 
Participant s record any post treatment reactions (local and systemic)  and 
enter this information in the Post Vaccination Memory Aid  (shown in 
Appendix A) on the evening of each dose and for [ADDRESS_174645] each dose. 
Local administration site reactions will be recorded using the supplied measuring tool . The study staff will review the memory aid ; the reported 
events will be assessed for clinical significance  and recorded on the CRFs 
as appropriate . Memory aids  are considered the property of the 
participants and are not collected nor considered as source documents . 
Study staff should evaluate each unique memory aid  entry according to 
“Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ”, issued in September  2007 
(Appendix B). Any  memory aid  entry determined to meet the criteria for a 
Grade [ADDRESS_174646] be documented as an adverse event. 
If the reminder diary entry does not meet the criteria of a Grade 1 or higher AE as per the toxicity  grading scale, clinical judgment can be used 
to determine whether the entry should be recorded as an AE. For cases where the reminder diary entry and final  AE reporting (i.e., grading) do 
not agree, the reasoning must  be recorded in the source documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Assessments and Targeted Physical Assessment  
A full physical examination will be conducted at screening. A targeted 
physical assessment will be per formed at other visits as determined by [CONTACT_151673]. The injection site is to 
be assessed by [CONTACT_151674] 30  to 45 minutes after EP, as 
well as at the follow up visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs including oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood pressure and 
heart rate will be measured at specified visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight and Height 
Weight (kg) and height (cm) will be collected at screening .

-34- [IP_ADDRESS] 12-L ead ECGs  
An ECG will be performed at screening for all partici pants to determine 
eligibility . The ECG should include measurements of ventricular  rate, PR, 
QRS, QT, QT c with assessment as to  whether the ECG is normal or 
abnormal. Abnormal  ECG s will be interpreted as clinically significant or 
not clinically significant. D osing will be delayed in the event of a 
clinically significant abnormal pre -dose ECG until it has been reviewed by 
[CONTACT_978], qualified PI [INVESTIGATOR_151602], Medical Monitor or Sponsor consultant 
cardiologist and deemed safe to proceed.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Evaluations 
At screening , Week 1, Week 6, and Week 14  (as indicated) blood samples 
will be taken to be tested for serum chemistry and hematology. 
Approximately 425 mL of blood will be drawn from each participant  
during the entire duration of the study.  
Hematology  
CBC: White blood cell (WBC) count  and differential count , Red 
blood cell (RBC) count , Hemoglobin , Hematocrit , Platelet count ;  
Serum Chemistry  
Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), glucose, ALT, AST, CPK ;
  
Serology (screening only):  
Antibody to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) , Hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) , and 
West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and  dengue virus antibodies; 
Pregnancy Test  
For female participant s of reproductive potential, a serum  
pregnancy test will be obtained at screening  with a negative result . 
Participants who have a screening pregnancy test that is positive will be considered as ineligible for the study. If a pregnancy test  is 
positive prior to completing the prescribed  regim en, additional 
doses of vaccine  must not be given. Every attempt should be made 
to follow  pregnant participants for the remainder of the study and to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy and to follow the outcome 
post- delivery for a year .

-35- Vaccinations will be delivered  ID into the deltoid region, followed immediately by [CONTACT_151658] 
(see Section  5.9 - Use of CELLECTRA® Electroporation Device) . Vaccinations  must not 
be given within 2 cm of a tattoo, scar, or active lesion/rash. The timing of the initial dose 
will be designated Day 0 with the subsequent doses scheduled for administration as per 
the Schedule of Events (Table S2). Within 48 hours following  each Study Treatment, 
data should be downloaded from the EP device and sent to the Sponsor ( GeneOne Life 
Science, Inc.) or  designee by [CONTACT_151679].  
For individuals assigned to Group 1, injections should be alternated side to side between 
vaccinations.  
For individuals assigned to Group 2 (2 mg per injection), injections should preferentially be given into both deltoid regions, i.e. at each vaccination both arms will have vaccine injections. If, however, o ne arm cannot be injected due to the reasons cited above, then 
injections should be given no closer than 3 cm apart.  
6.3.1 Management of anxiety and pain due to EP procedure  
Participant s will be offer ed an analgesic (e.g. ibuprofen, acetaminophen ) after 
injecti on/EP  or EMLA cream before the procedure; the latter applied at least [ADDRESS_174648] contraindications  for use of  ibuprofen  or 
acetaminophen may be offered a suitable alternative. 
6.4 Assessment of Laboratory Abnormalities  
Blood will be drawn for s erum chemistries and hematology assessments at the visits 
listed in  the Schedule of Events, ( Table S2) and as listed in section 6.2. 3.6.  
Laboratory AEs will be assessed and graded. See Section 7. 1.7 for details.  
6.5 Assessment of Clinical Adverse Events  
The injection site will be assessed by [CONTACT_151680] 30  to 45 
minutes after injection/EP. Participants will be given an oral thermometer and instructed 
to take and record their  oral temperature d aily (at the same time each day). Participants  
will also be advised to record local and systemic events for [ADDRESS_174649] Vaccination  Memory Aid  (Appendix A ). 
Participant s will also be queried regarding the occurrence of any adverse ev ents, 
concomitant medications and new onset chronic disease during their clinic visits. 
Participant s will be reminded to contact [CONTACT_151681]. These events will be recorded on the participant ’s case report form ( CRF ).  
6.6 Assessment of Injection Site Reactions  
The Study Treatment procedure consists of insertion of the CELLECTRA 
electroporation array needles (electrodes)  into the dermis,  followed by [CONTACT_151682]. This procedure is broadly described as administration because it involves more than the injection of a drug. Attributing any reaction (e.g. pain, erythema, 
GLS -5700      ZIKA -001 
GeneOne Life S cience, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
Date: 1 July 2016   v 1.2 
-36- or swelling) that is observed at or near the site of the Study Treatment procedure to 
injection of the study drug(s) versus  administration of the electroporation pulses will be 
difficult and is not necessary. Consequently, reactions arising from the Study Treatment 
procedure may be reported as administ ration site or injection site reactions. When 
evaluating administration (injection) site reactions throughout the study, it is most important to be as specific as possible by [CONTACT_151683] (see components below) and use the grading sc ale as outline d in Appendix B . Each injection 
site is considered as separate injection sites. The following observations, including grade 
of severity, will be recorded on the CRF:  
• Time of occurrence relative to dose (e.g., immediately after, 1 day after do se, etc.)  
• Site of injection  
• Components of administration (injection) site reactions:  
o Tenderness (present or absent and severity)  
o Pruritus (present or absent and severity)  
o Erythema (diameter in cm)  
o Induration/Swelling (diameter in cm)  
o Bruising (diameter in cm) 
• Resolution date  
• Pain (see Section 6.3. 1)

subtracted from the average in individual Zika virus  peptide wells and then adjusted to 
1x106 PBMCs for each Zika virus  peptide pool.  
6.8.4 Flow Cytometry  
Additional assessment of cellular immune activity may be performed  via flow cytometry  if 
sample volumes allow . Flow cytometric assays will include an examination of the influence of 
vaccination on the ability of patient T cells to exhibit phenotypic markers associated with 
cytolytic potential after short- term stimulation by [CONTACT_151684]  (hereafter referred to as “CTL 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”), the ability of patient T cells to remain active in the presence of long -term antigen 
exposure and efficiently synthesize proteins used in lytic activity (hereafter referred to as “Lytic Granule Loading”), and the ability of patient T cells to effectively employ Granzyme B for the purposes of lytic degranulation and killing of target cells expressing the S  antigen (hereafter 
referred to  as “Killing”). These panels may vary as new information becomes available. CTL 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_151603].

7.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in 
the structure, function, or chemistry of the body, or worsening of a pre -existing 
condition, temporally associated with the use of a product whether or not 
considered related to the use of the pro duct. In this study, such changes will be 
monitored, classified, and summarized, as Clinical or Laboratory AEs. Medical 
condition/diseases present before starting the investigational drug will be considered adverse events only if they worsen after starting study treatment. An 
unexpected  AE is one not identified in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or 
otherwise not expected from the characteristics of the clinical material.  
Study related AEs include the following:  
• Pre- or post -treatment complications that o ccur as a result of protocol 
mandated procedure during or after Screening (before the administration of study drug)  
• Any pre -existing condition that increases in severity, or changes in nature 
during or as a consequence of the study drug phase of a human clinical trial, 
will also be considered an AE  
• Complications and termination of pregnancy; see Section 7.1.8 for additional  
information  
• All AEs that occur from the study Day 0  visit onwards and throughout the 
duration of the study, including the follow -up of study drug period will be 
recorded as an AE  
Study related AEs do not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) performed; the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or 
detected before the first vaccination  that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or c onvenience admissions). 
• Overdose without clinical sequelae   
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the first vaccination  and not related to a protocol associated 
procedure is not an AE. It is co nsidered to be pre -existing and will be 
documented on the medical history CRF  
• Any laboratory abnormality that is considered as non -significant or considered 
as related to another non -study related condition  
• Uncomplicated pregnancy  
• An induced electiv e abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason

-39- 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that meets one of the following 
conditions:  
• Death during the period of surveillance defined by [CONTACT_760];  
• Is immediately lif e-threatening (e.g., participant  was, in the view of the 
Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred). This 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death;  
• An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151604] (including 
any overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], regardless of the length of stay, even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151605] a precautionary measure to  allow continued 
observation. However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096]) for continued treatment or assessment of a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened, does not constitute an SAE . NOTE: 
Evaluation in a physician’s office, or at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151606], non- admitted  status regardless of the time period of 
observation , does not constitute an SAE ; 
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
• Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Clarification of Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an adverse event in itself  
• The participant  may not have been on investigational medicinal product at the 
occurrence of the event. Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or 
interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  
• “Life -threatening” means that the participant  was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If a complication prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE

-40- • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151607] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time. This may or may not 
be overnight. Observation status or evaluation in an emergency department, 
urgent care setting, or outpatient office does not constitute an SAE.  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis 
of signs, symptoms, and/or other clinica l information. In such cases, the 
diagnosis will be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual 
signs/symptoms.  
Serious adverse events that are ongoing should be followed until resolution. The reporting period for SAEs is described in Section 9.6.2.  
7.1.3 Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAE)  
A medically attended adverse event (MAAE) is defined as an adverse event that 
leads to an unplanned contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider.  
7.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction (A DR) is a reaction for which  the nature or 
severity is not consistent with the applicable product information (Investigator’s Brochure). Until product information is amended, expedited reporting is required for additional occurrences of the reaction. Report s that add significant information 
on specificity or severity of a known, already documented SAE constitute unexpected events. For example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator's Brochure would be considered "unexpected.” Specific examples would be (a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis. 
7.1.5 Assessing Severity ( Intens ity) 
The investigator will grade laboratory  AEs and clinical AEs (based on discussions 
with study participants) as outlined in Appendix B .: 
• Mild (Grade 1)  
• Moderate (Grade 2)  
• Severe (Grade 3)  
• Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4)  
Adverse events will be captured on the CRF at the maximum severity re ported. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_174656] a suspected  relationship to the 
administration of the clinical material (GLS-5700) , and /or the investigational 
CELLECTRA
® device. An AE may also be assessed as  not related to the 
investigational product or device . The Investigator is responsib le for reporting 
GLS -5700      ZIKA -001 
GeneOne Life S cience, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
Date: 1 July 2016   v 1.2 
-41- adverse events and judging the relationship between the administration of the 
clinical material and a subsequent AE  because the investigator is knowledgeable  
about the participant  (e.g., medical history, concomitant medications), administers 
the investigational product, and monitors the participant ’s response to the 
investigational product. The Investigator  is aware of the participant ’s clinica l state 
and thus may be sensitive to distinctions between events due to the underlying 
disease process versus events that may be product related  and may have observed 
the event . The Sponsor will assess the overall safety of the investigational product 
and determine whether to report expeditiously to the regulatory agencies . 
Investigators should use their knowledge of the Study Participant , the 
circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating “yes” or “no” accordingly. Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_5256] “yes, related” or “no, unrelated” by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Yes – there is reasonable possibili ty that administration of the Study 
Treatment contributed to the event;  
• No – there is no reasonable possibility that administration of the Study 
Treatment contributed to the event and there are more likely causes.  
 
The following guidance should also be t aken into consideration:  
• Temporal relationship of event to initiation of study drug;  
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable);  
• Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments; 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study;  
• Presence of risk factors in the Study Participant  or use of concomitant 
medications known to increase the occurrence of  the event . 
7.1.7 Abnormal Laboratory Value 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, 
laboratory abnormalities (e.g., serum  chemistry, CBC, CPK ) independent of the 
underlying medical condition that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to investigational medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessme nts (e.g., electrocardiogram, x -rays, vital signs) that ar e 
associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_174657] the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia) not the laboratory result (e.g., decreased hemoglobin).  
Any laboratory abnormality that is new in onset or worsened in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded as an AE:

• Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_151687] 7.1.[ADDRESS_174658] the 
participant’s permission to query pregnancy outcome and follow each participant 
to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . Result s will be summarized in the 
clinical study report (CSR).   
Participant s who become pregnant at any point during the study will continue to 
be followed for safety assessments without receiving fu rther investigational 
product . Procedures that are contraindicated during pregnancy, including 
additional treatment s, must not be performed. Investigators should use clinical 
judgment regarding subsequent study -related blood collection based on the 
presence or absence of anemia in each participant . Participant s who are not 
withdrawn will continue to be followed fo r safety assessments to study discharge  
per protocol.  
All pregnancies that occur from the time of first screening procedure through  the 
follow up visits must be reported. Monitoring of the participant  and the outcome 
of the pregnancy will be followed by [CONTACT_093].  If the end of the pregnancy 
occurs after the study has been completed, the outcome will be reported directly 
to the study team an d the medical monitor . 
Male participant s will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to 
immediately inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant through till  
the end of follow -up period. A Pregnancy Form will be completed by [CONTACT_151688] [ADDRESS_174659] and report details of the course and 
outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male participant  exposed to Study 
Treatment. The pregna nt partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and 
Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her 
pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the investigator will update 
the Pregnancy Form with additional informatio n on the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy. An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_151689], to support an informed decision in c ooperation with 
the treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
Participant s who are detected as pregnant as part of the screening laboratory 
assessment, but who have not received study product, will not be enrolled into the

Date: [ADDRESS_174660] be 
reported for participant s on study (including any protocol -required post -treatment 
follow -up). 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs beyond the follow up period for participant s. However, if the investigator learns of an AE or SAE that 
occurs after the completion or termination visit and the event is deemed b y the 
investigator to be probably or possibly related to the study treatment, he/she should promptly document and report the event to the study team and medical 
monitor . 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Collection and Recording of Safety Data  
0-6 days after each dose : Study participant s will be directly observed by [CONTACT_151690] [ADDRESS_174661] their oral temperature daily at the same time and to note and 
characterize in their own words any local or systemic AEs they experience which are to 
be reviewed at the next study visit. 
Throughout the Study : In addition to the daily record of oral temperature, injection site 
reactions, and systemic complaints recorded for [ADDRESS_174662] contain the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_151608].

-44- 7.3 Safety  and Toxicity Management  
The Medical Monitor will be responsible for the overall safety monitoring of the stu dy. 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_151609]. The Safety Monitoring Committee will 
review safety laboratory studies as delineated in Section 3.1.  
Safety assessments include the following:  
• Incidence of all adverse events classified by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred 
term, severity, and relationship to study treatment  
• Changes in safety laboratory parameters ( e.g., hematology, serum  chemistry, and 
urinalysis ) 
• Local and systemic injection s ite review ; special attention will be paid to the 
examina tion of the  injection site. Administration site reactions and the participant's 
complaints will be documented.  
7.3.1 Events Requiring Expedited Reporting  
Events requiring expedited reporting (ERER) will be defined as any Adverse Event of Special Interest (see section 7.1.3) regardless  of intensity or relationship 
to Study Treatment or any Study Treatment -related adverse events that follow:  
• Grade 3 or greater administration site erythema, and/or induration recorded ≥ 
2 hours after Study Treatment;  
• Grade 4 o r greater administration site pain, tenderness recorded ≥ 2 hours 
after Study Treatment; 
• Grade 3 or greater fever;  
• Grade 3 or greater systemic symptoms, including generalized prurit us;  
• Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities  
As per the Toxicity Grad e for Healthy Adults (Appendix B) .  The most  severe 
grade for that particular event is to be documented in the CRFs.  
Sites will inform the Sponsor of any ERER within 24 hours to discuss whether 
dosing to the participant  should continue.  
7.3.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (Criteria for Pausing of Study) 
If any of the following situations occur then further enrollment and Study 
Treatments will be halted immediately until a thorough investigation has been conducted by [CONTACT_151691] [INVESTIGATOR_72616] /REC (if 
applicable):  
• One third (1/3) or more participants experience an ERER assessed as related to 
Study Treatment;  
• Three or more participants in the same treatment arm discontinue due to an AE 
related to the Study Treatment;  
• Any participant  experiences  a potentially life threatening AE,  Grade 4 AE or 
death  assessed as related to Study Treatment;  
• Two or more participant s within a treatment arm experience the same or 
similar grade 3 or 4 adverse event, assessed as related to Study Treatment;  
• Seven or mo re participant s across all treatment arms experience the same or 
similar grade 3 or 4 adverse event, assessed as related to Study Treatment;

Treatment.  
Upon conclusion, the sponso r or designee will notify all investigators and IRBs/EC 
(if required) regarding the outcome of any investigation stemming from a Study 
Pause.  
Any SAE or death assessed as related to Study Treatment will lead to an immediate halt of study enrollment and St udy Treatments.  
Guidelines for assessing relatedness are detailed in Section 7.1.6.

percentages.  
Analysis populations will include:  
Per-protocol (PP) analysis to comprise participants who receive all Study Treatmen ts 
and have no protocol violations . Participant s in this sample will be grouped to 
treatment arms as randomized.  
The modified intention to treat (mITT) analysis includes all participant s who receive at 
least one Study Treatment. Participant s in this sample will be grouped to treatment 
arms as randomized. Analyses on the mITT sample will be considered supportive of the corresponding P P analyses.  
The safety analysis set includes all participant s who receive at least one Study 
Treatment. Participant s will be analyzed as to the treatment they received.  
Participant s who do not complete the study will not be replaced.  
8.2 Demographic  and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline data, vital signs, medical history, concomitant illnesses , and 
current  medications/treatments will be summarized by [CONTACT_151692]: 
continuous variables as mean, median , standard deviat ion, and interquartile ranges and 
categorical variables as frequencies and percentages , stratified by [CONTACT_151693].

significance of the differences in frequency between groups.  These frequencies 
will be pr esented separately by [CONTACT_151694], i.e.  based on pooled doses , and 
will depi[INVESTIGATOR_151610], by [CONTACT_151695], the number and 
percentage of participant s affected. Additional frequencies will be presented with 
respect to maximum s everity and to strongest relationship to Study Treatment. 
Multiple occurrences of the same AE will be counted only once following a worst -case approach with respect to severity and relationship to Study Treatment. 
All serious AEs and administration site ev ents will also be summarized as above.  
For the purpose of summarizing the safety all active vaccine groups will be grouped together. The proportion of participants experiencing grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events following the vaccine will be presented. The precision with which 
this sample result estimates the rate of similar adverse events in the population represented by [CONTACT_151696] 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the sample proportions. This will provide 95% confiden ce 
that the rate of severe adverse effects is not greater than the upper limit of the CI 
around the proportion of participants with grade 3+ events in the study sample. 
 
 
Table 8.3.1 illustrates the confidence intervals for a range of hypothetical 
proporti ons of adverse events.  This table shows (e.g.) that a sample finding of no 
grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events in a total evaluable sample of 40 participant s 
would provide 95% confidence that the rate in the population from which the sample was drawn is no g reater than 8.8%.  
 
Table 8.3.[ADDRESS_174665] 1 adverse event of a given 
type and/or level of severity in the study sample, given a range of hypothesized rates in the population from which the sample was drawn. The table demonstrates that the probability of observing one or more events in a sample of 40 participants  
is >70% with events whose population probabilities are at least 2%, while the 
probability of observing two or more events is >34% for events whose population 
probabilities are at least 3%.

The main summary of safety data will be based on events occurring within 14 
days of admi nistration of Study Treatment (as specified in Section 9.6.1).  
8.3.2 Laboratory Data  
Continuous response variables per time point and changes from baseline will be 
summarized with mean, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical response variables will be summarized per time point with percentages. These 
will be calculated according to treatment arm.  
8.4 Immunogenicity analysis  
Data classified as positive/negative or responder/non -responder will be analyzed as the 
frequency of response for each assay w ithin treatment arm at each time point at which an 
assessment is performed.  For secondary immunogenicity outcomes, estimates of 
proportions and exact 95% binomial CIs and 95% CIs for the differences between the groups (proportions and geometric mean test ( GMT ) ratio) will be calculated. We will 
use the chi -square test to evaluate the significance of the differences between groups. For 
GMT and mean fold increase in GMT, we will calculate the mean and 95% CI for the log10 -transformed titers and then transform ed back to the original units by 
[CONTACT_151698]. We will use the t test to compare the GMTs between groups . The 
proportion of participant s meeting the criteria for immunologic response following 
vaccination will be presented for each study arm. The precisi on with which this sample 
result estimates the rate of immunologic response rates in the population represented by [CONTACT_151696] 90% CIs around the sample proportions. This will provide 95% confidence that the rate of immune  response is not less that the 
lower limit of the proportion of study participant s meeting immune response criteria. The 
primary immunogenicity analysis will include all subjects having evaluable data.

immunologic response. This table shows (e.g.) that a sample finding of 30 (75%) 
responders in the total sample of 40 participant s would provide 95% confidence that the 
rate in the population from which the sample was drawn was no lower than 62%.  
The rate of response in arms will be compared using the chi -square test. Comparison 
between treatment arms will be carried out using a Mann Whitney U test for continuous 
variables, and a Fisher's Exact Test or Pearson's Chi -square Test for categorical factors. 
Because the study is small the study is underpowered for comparisons between arms.

9.6 Adverse Experience (AE) Reporting  
To assure the safety of the participants, information about all AEs (s ee Section 7.1 Safety  
Parameters for definitions), whether volunteered by [CONTACT_2299], discovered by 
[CONTACT_151703], or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded in th e participant ’s source 
documents and followed as appropriate. 
In addition to AE reporting, a summary of the study’s overall progress will be forwarded 
to regulatory agencies according to the local requirements (e.g., every 6 months, annual ). 
9.6.1 Study Reporting Period of Adverse Events  
All solicited and unsolicited adverse events will be collected throughout the study 
and recorded on the CRFs. The Study Report will analyze and summarize all  
adver se events throughout the study.  U nsolicited AEs will be summariz ed for the 
14 day period following each administration of Study Treatment. S ee next section 
for SAEs.  
9.6.2 Study Reporting Period of Serious Adverse Events  
The reporting period for SAEs (without regard to causality) is the entire period following the signing of  the informed consent form until the end of the study.  
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria. If the AE is considered serious, the investigator should record this event to GeneOne 
Life Science within 24 hours of becom ing aware of the event. The investigator 
may also directly report this event to the clinical site  IRB/EC per standard 
operating procedures within 24 hrs .  
Expectedness of SAEs will be determined by [CONTACT_151704] ’s Brochure. An event 
may qualif y for expedited reporting to regulatory authorities if it is an SAE, 
unexpected per reference safety information and considered related following the guidelines in Section 7.1. 4  (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction, 
S[LOCATION_003]R) in line with relevant legislation. All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant S[LOCATION_003]R reports. The investigator should notify the Ethics Committee as soon as is practical, of serious events in writing where 
this is required by [CONTACT_31665], and in accordance with the local institutional policy.   
At any time after completion of the SAE reporting period, if an investigator becomes aware of an SAE that is suspected by [CONTACT_151705], the event will be reported to the Sponsor or its designee . 
If the investigator becomes aware of  an SAE, an AESI, or an MAAE  in a study 
participant after the last scheduled follow -up visit, and considers the event rela ted 
to prior Study Treatment, the investigator will report it to GeneOne Life Science.

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) c urrent thinking on this 
topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind 
FDA or the public.  You can use an altern ative approach if the approach satisfies the 
requirements of the applicable st atutes and regulations.  If you want to discuss an alternative 
approach, contact [CONTACT_151718].  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff,

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Preventive vaccines are usually developed to prevent disease in a hea lthy population.  The Office 
of Vaccines Research and Review, 
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, regulates 
preventive vaccines under authority of section [ADDRESS_174684] (42 U.S.C. 
262), as well as specific sections of the Fe deral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and reviews 
investigational new drug applica tions (INDs) and biologi cs license applicati ons (BLAs).  (See, 
for example, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR) Parts 312, 600, and 601).  Most of the 
clinical trials of preventive vaccines conduc ted to support INDs and BLAs enroll healthy 
volunteers in all phases of vaccine  testing.  The enrollment of hea lthy volunteers warrants a very 
low tolerance for risk in those clinical trials.  This guidance provides you, sponsors, monitors, and investigators of vaccine trials, with 
recommendations on 
assessing the severity of clin ical and laboratory abnormalities in healthy 
adult and adolescent volunteers enrolle d in clinical trials.  The grading system described in the 
table can also be useful in de fining a particular study’s stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (e.g., a certain number of 
adverse events, as defined in the table, may call for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]).  Less extreme 
observations (e.g., mild) may not require disconti nuing the study vaccine but can still contribute 
to evaluating safety by [CONTACT_151719].  
Uniform criteria for categorizing toxicities in healthy volunteers can im prove comparisons of 
safety data among groups within the same study a nd also between different  studies.  We, FDA, 
recommend using toxicity gradi ng scale tables, provided below, as a guideline for selecting the 
assessment criteria to be used in a clinical  trial of a preventive vaccine.  We recommend 
incorporation of such appropria te, uniform, criteria into the investigational plan, case report 
forms, and study reports and correspondence with FDA, sponsors, monitors, investigators, and 
IRBs.  This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated April 2005 (70 FR [ZIP_CODE], May 
2, 2005).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guid ance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be 
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  
The use of the word should  in FDA’s guidances means that  something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required.   
II. BACKGROUND 
 
Standardized toxicity assessment scales have be en widely used to evaluate products treating 
specific diseases. 
 For example, the National Can cer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria Scale 
and the Division of AIDS’ Toxici ty Grading Scale standardize th e evaluation of adverse events 
among patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS, respec tively (Refs. 1, 2).  The defined toxicity 
parameters in those scales are designed for pa tients who may already experience mild, moderate, 
or severe adverse clinical or laboratory events  due to the disease process, and may not be 
appropriate for healthy volunteers.  In the development of the toxicity grading scal es for healthy volunteers, we chose parameter 
lim
it values based on published information, when su ch values were available (Refs. 1-6).  For 
example, the Brighton Collaboration has developed case definitions and guidelines to evaluate some adverse events associated with administer ing vaccines (Ref. 3).  In some cases, parameter 
limit values were based on clinical experience and experience reviewing v accine clinical trials 
that enroll normal healthy subjects.  Toxicity grading scales for laboratory abnor malities 
 should consider the local laboratory 
reference values when the parameter limit values are defined.  The charac terization of laboratory 
parameters among some populations of healthy adu lts and adolescents may require the exercise 
of clinical judgment, for example, consideration of the potential for ethni c differences in white 
blood cell (WBC) counts or gender differences  in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values. 
  
III. TOXICITY GRADI NG SCALE 
 TABLES 
 
Adverse events in a clinical tria l of an investigational vaccine must be recorded and monitored 
and, when 
appropriate, reported to  FDA and others involved in an  investigation (sponsors, IRBs, 
and investigators).  (See, for example, 21 CFR 312.32, 312.33, 312.50, 312.55, 312.56, 312.60, 312.62, 312.64, 312.66).  Although the use of a toxicity grading scale for a dverse events would 
not replace these regulatory requirements, using a scale to categorize adverse events observed 
during a clinical trial may a ssist you in monitoring safety  and making required reports.  
Nonetheless, we believe that ca tegorization or grading of data as outlined in this document is 
supplementary to and should not replace full and complete data analysis.  These guidelines for toxicity grading scales are prim
 arily intended for healthy adult and 
adolescent volunteers.  The parameters in the tabl es below are not necessarily applicable to every 
clinical trial of healthy volunteers.  The parameters monitored should be appropriate for the specific study vaccine.  For some preventive vaccines under development, it may be appropriate 
2

to include additional parameters to be monitored during a clinical trial or to alter the choice of 
values in the toxicity table.  For example, a dditional parameters might be added based on one or 
more of the following:  safety signals observed in pre-clinical toxicology studies, the biological 
plausibility of the occurrence of  certain adverse events, or previous experience with a similar 
licensed product.  As discussed above, the tables do not represen t a recommendation to 
 monitor all the listed 
parameters in all clinical tria ls of healthy volunteers, nor do the tables represent all possible 
parameters to be monitored.  In addition, thes e tables do not represen t study inclusion or 
exclusion criteria.  We recommend that the pa rameters monitored be appropriate for the study 
vaccine administered to healthy volunteer s participating in the clinical trial.

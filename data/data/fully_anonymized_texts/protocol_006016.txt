Precis/Abstra ct: 
 
Hyperparathyroidism is an increasingly significant medical and public health condition. The most 
common technique for preoperative localization is a SPECT/CT, utilizing Tc -99m-sestamibi as a 
radiotracer.  However , the reported sensitivity and specific ity is only 80%. Thus there is a need 
for more accurate preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas. Anti-1-amino -3-
[18F]fluorocyclobutane -1-carboxylic acid ( anti-3-[18F]FACBC) is a synthetic amino acid analog for 
positron emission tomography (PET) which has demonstrated promise for the staging and 
restaging of carcinoma . There is some preliminary evidence that amino acid transport may be 
upregulated in parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia. We pla n to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] [ADDRESS_1124720] preoperative evaluation for biochemically 
confirmed hyperparathyroidism. Patients will undergo anti-3-[18F]FACBC  PET-CT. [ADDRESS_1124721], and validated to truth by [CONTACT_812277]. Results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_812268].

A. Introduction and Background : 
 
Hyperparathyroidism is an increasingly significant medical and public health condition.  In the 
past two decades, the incidence of hyperparathyroidism has increased 3 00%, and currently the 
disease affects at least 30,000 new patients each year in the [LOCATION_002].  Parathyroid 
adenomas, parathyroid hyperplasia in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and 
parathyroid carcinomas all are increasing in frequ ency . Primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in 
one out of 500 -1000 people and is caused by a single adenoma in 85% of cases  (1).  The 
mechanisms responsible for the increased i ncidence of hyperparathyroidism are not known.  
Environmental factors such as ionizing radiation exposure have been suggested by [CONTACT_812278].  Multiple organs are affected in patients with hyperparathyroidism; notably, a 
worsening of the severity of o steoporosis and accelerated arteriosclerotic disease and 
hypertension.  Parathyroid carcinoma no longer is a rare illness.  There is no effective oncologic 
therapy for parathyroid carcinoma, and it is often fatal.   
 
 Surgery is the only effective manageme nt for primary hyperparathyroidism.  Preoperative 
localization of the adenoma allows unilateral neck exploration for removal of the tumor  (2, 3).  
Since this approach decreases duration of surgery and morbidity, preoperative localization is 
gaining more importance.  However, pre -operative and intra -operative parathyroid tumor 
localization can be challenging, in part  because current imaging methodologies are sub -optimal, 
failing to identify the parathyroid tumor in as many as 30% of patients  (4).  In reoperative 
parathyroidec tomy for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, localization plays an even 
greater role (5). Unfortunately current multiple imaging modalities fail to local ize 10 -15% these 
of tumors.   
 
The most common technique for preoperative localization is a SPECT/CT, utilizing Tc -99m-
sestamibi (MIBI) as a radiotracer. 99mTc MIBI early and delayed (dual phase) imaging with 
Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) or SPECT/CT has be come the 
standard of care  (4). 99mTc MIBI is an isonitrile compound wh ich tends to accumulate in 
mitochondria and has a short half life of 6 hours , physical character istics  ideally suited for 
imaging with a Gamma camera.  99mTc MIBI concentrates both in thyroid and parathyroid tissues  
but wash es out faster from thyroid  tissue than parathyroid tumors, allowing dual phase imaging 
to localize  the parathyroid tumors  (6). SPECT imaging improves the contrast and facilitates 
location of  the parathyroid tumors,  while  SPECT/CT provides three -dimensional  localization  (7).  
However , the reported sensitivity and specificity is  only 80% (4, 8). Parathyroid glands usually 
are located close to the thyroid and 99mTc MIBI concentrates both in thyroid and parathyroid 
tissue. Hence there is a need for  a tracer/imaging tool that concentrates in the parathyroid but 
not in the thyroid.  
A more sensitive and specific radiotracer/tra cking agent would markedly improve our ability to 
identify parathyroid tumors preoperatively , and thus offer more patients a minimally invasive 
parathyroidectomy.

Revised 12 -15-11 
Revised 8 -6-2012  
Revised 11 -22-13 Amino a cids are involved in many aspects of human nutrition including the synthesis of protei ns. 
Amino acid metabolism has been demonstrated to be upregulated  in many tumors including 
prostate carcinoma (9). A number of amino acid radiotracers have been uti lized to study 
carcinoma and other tumors including naturally occurring L -[11C]methionine , L-3-[123I]iodo -
alpha -methyl tyrosine (IMT),  and L -[1-11C]5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP).  Anti-1-amino -3-
[18F]fluorocyclobutane -1-carboxylic acid  (anti-3-[18F]FACBC) is a non -natural amino acid analog 
with low renal excretion and high pancreatic concentration. In some manner it may be 
transported similar to the amino acid leucine. anti-3-[18F]FACBC  has demonstrated promise for 
the staging and restaging of prostate carci noma (10) and has demonstrated utility for cerebral 
neoplasia (11). anti-3-[18F]FACBC  biodistribution studies demonstrate  that radiotracer 
concentration in the thyroid is less than that in the muscle  (12).  
Paratho rmone is a 
peptide hormone , and 
the bioactive 
conformation includes  a 
long helical dimer 
containing 10 Leucine 
residues.  Our initial 
work with anti-3-
[18F]FACBC  in primary 
cultures of human 
parathyroid cells  (Figure 
1) have shown 
significant specif ic 
uptake of anti-3-
[18F]FACBC  by [CONTACT_812279].   anti-
3-[18F]FACBC  
incorporation in 
parathyroid tumor cells in vitro was as sayed by [CONTACT_812280] .  Specific uptake of anti-3-
[18F]FACBC , an L-leucine analog, was shown by [CONTACT_812281] L -type transporter inhibitor 
(BCH) and a multiple amino acid inhibitor (ACS), while an A -type inhibitor (MeAIB) did  not block 
uptake.  Hence we hypothesize that parathyroid cells will concentrate anti-3-[18F]FACBC , and 
thus anti-3-[18F]FACBC  can be used as a trace r for positron emission imaging . 
 
Figure 2 is an example of the biodistribution patterns of anti-3-[18F]FACBC , but with no 
significant normal uptake within thyroid. We will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_812269] a larger study of clinical utility.   
 
In addition, we have constructed a microarray examining genetic expression of amino acid 
transporters (AAT) via RT -PCR analysis, to determine which amino  acid transporters may be 
responsible for anti-3-[18F]FACBC  uptake within parathyroid adenomas, if any. If imaging results

Version 9 -6-11 
Revised 12 -15-11 
Revised 8 -6-2012  
Revised 11 -22-13 are promising, we will utilize this microarray on the adenoma tissue obtained from surgical 
excision. This will be followed by [CONTACT_812282].

B. Objectives  
 
Accurate preoperative identification of parathyroid adenomas is critical in enabling appropriate 
minimally invasive surgery and in identifying ectopic adenomas that would necessitate a change 
in surgical approach.  
 
Our overarching goal is to establish if amino acid analogue imaging with the positron e mission 
tomographic radiotracer  anti-3-[18F]FACBC demonstrates sufficient uptake within parathyroid 
adenomas to make a more comprehensive study worthwhile.  Future studies may be directed at 
a larg er clinical trial . In addition, we will examine the proteomics of amino acid transport 
mechanism via gene array, RT-PCR , as well as immunohistochemistry of resected adenoma 
tissue to help determine the mechanism of uptake of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  PET-CT, and t o 
correlate with Sestamibi positive or negative status .  
 
The primary aim of this study is to determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC  PET-CT demonstrates uptake 
within parathyroid adenomas and to understand time -activity studies in a dynamic manner to 
record prelim inary data of uptake kinetics if present.  
 
 
Specific Aims  
 
Specific Aim 1. To evaluate the presence or absence of uptake of  anti-3-[18F]FACBC  in 
parathyroid adenomas and uptake kinetics if present , and if this uptake varies with sestamibi 
avidity of the a denomas .  
 
Specific Aim 2.  To evaluate uptake mechanisms and specific amino acid transporter regulation 
of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  in parathyroid adenomas.  

Version [ADDRESS_1124722] developed an amin o acid a nalogue PET 
radiotracer  at Emory which may exploit amino acid transport mechanisms in parathormone 
receptor activation or via upregulation of amino acid transport in parathyroid adenomas and 
hyperplasia compared to normal parathyroid tissue. Our initial wo rk with anti-3-[18F]FACBC  in 
primary cultures of human parathyroid cells  (Figure 1) has shown significant specific uptake of 
anti-3-[18F]FACBC  by [CONTACT_812283].    
 
The specific hypothesis in this proposal is that amino acid transport in parathyro id adenoma and 
hyperplasia is upregulated compared with normal parathyroid tissue and that this elevated 
uptake can be exploited for lesion identification by [CONTACT_812284]. 
The most comprehensive manner to assess our hypothesis is to undertake a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_812270] 99mTc 
MIBI SPECT -CT.  
 
We propose assembli ng a dedicated multidisciplinary team of experts in amino acid radiotracer 
synthesis and imaging as well as surgical therapy of hyperparathyroidism . Outcomes will be 
validated by  [CONTACT_812285] . We will 
also in Specific Aim 2, examine potential mechanisms of uptake via gene array, RT-PCR 
analysis and immunohistochemical techniques.  
 
C. Study design and methods  
 
Experimental design . We will undertake a study  with [ADDRESS_1124723] patient evaluation or delay therapy . Patients will receive  one additional study 
using the amino acid analogue with anti-3-[18F]FACBC . Within the group of 12, we will choose 6 
patients with low MIBI uptake and 6 with high uptake since amino acid uptake could also vary in 
each sub -population. Dynamic im aging will be performed for 60 minutes . 
 
All patients will undergo routine preoperative imaging including dual phase 99mTc sestamibi 
scanning and other imaging as appropriate such as ultrasound , MRI,  and/or contrast enhanced 
CT scanning.  
 
We will investiga te amino acid transport kinetics and conspi[INVESTIGATOR_812271]-3-[18F]FACBC  PET-CT (Specific Aim #1). We will compare various uptake 
parameters to that of standard of care imaging with dual phase 99mTc sestamibi SPECT -CT and 
validate to truth via surgery and histologic analysis. Resected t issue will also undergo gene

Revised 8 -6-2012  
Revised 11 -22-13 array, RT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry as appropriate to investigate amino acid 
transport mechanism and other factors  in uptake (Specific Aim #2). 
C.1 anti-3-[18F]FACBC  Radiolabeling  
Methods. We will prepare anti-3-[18F]FACBC  by [CONTACT_79490] J. 
McConathy and M.M. Goodm an (13) as outlined in Figure 3 . The automated radiosynthesis of 
anti-3-[18F]FACBC  will be carried out in a chemical process control unit (CPCU) with a computer 
interface. The two -step reaction sequence will involve incorporation of no -carrier -added 
potass ium [18F]fluoride into a protected triflate precursor and deprotection using aqueous 
hydrochloric acid. The crude reaction mix will be passed in series through ion -retardation resin, 
an alumina -N SepPak®, an HLB cartridge and a 0.[ADDRESS_1124724] will be 
determined by [CONTACT_79491].  Additional chemical solvent purity will be measured by [CONTACT_812286] (GC). The total time for synthesis of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  after delivery of 
18[F]fluoride will be ~70 minutes, and the average decay -corrected yield of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  
will be 24 ± 4 % (n = 40 runs, average ± standard error) in over 99% radiochemical purity . This 
procedure will provide 140 -200 mCi of an ti-[18F]FACBC at the end of synthesis. We have 
prepared greater than [ADDRESS_1124725] images will be acquired on a GE Discovery DLS (8 slice), DST (16 slice),  MV600 (16 
slice), MV690 (16 Slice) or similar PET -CT scanner  as described in the literature (14).  Quality 
control scans are performed every morning and the scanner is calibrated by [CONTACT_812287].  All studies will use measured attenuation correction (routinely acquired through 
the initial CT portion of the scan).  Dead time, detector efficienc y and scatter corrections will be 
applied using the routines supplied by [CONTACT_3455]. The resulting images will be 
quantitatively calibrated and have [ADDRESS_1124726] acquisition parameters of approximately 80-120 mA  to be 
utilized for anatomic imaging and correction of emission data (approximately 1 minute).  anti-3-
[18F]FACBC  (10 mCi) will be injected into an antecubital vein in a slow bolus infusion over 1 -2 
minutes. Subsequently, 2 -3 consecutive 2 -4 minute per bed position (depending on scanner

the heart for one hour.  
 
Summary of PET -CT Scanning Procedure  
1) The patient will be placed in the tomographic ga ntry for a CT scan of the chest (80-120 mA) 
to be utilized for anatomic imaging and correction of emission data (approxi mately 1 minute).  
2) The patient will then receive a bolus of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  injected IV over 1 -2 minutes  
3) The dosage will be app roximately 10.0 mCi (370 M Bq). 
4) A [ADDRESS_1124727] of 
the acquisition to include the anterior border of the heart .  
5) 2-3 bed positions will be obtained which should cover the neck  through the anterior border of 
the heart .  
6) This sequence will be repeated for 60 minutes of dynamic imaging . 
7) The  entire study including injection of radiotracer should take approximately 60 minutes.  
 
C.4 Image Analysis of anti -[18F]FACBC PET -CT 
Methods. The methods of image analysis to be used for the anti-3-[18F]FACBC  PET-CT are as 
follows:  
1) Images will be recons tructed with iterative technique and hardware fused (PET to CT) on a 
GE AW or MimVista workstation which enables SUV (mean, maximum) as well as standard size 
measurements of lesions. Whenever possible we will use [ADDRESS_1124728] (ROI) to encompass the entire structure under question such 
as a lymph node or prostate bed.  
2) Visual inspection of the PET -CT images  in separate sessions by a  board certified nuclear 
medicine physicians/nuclear rad iologist  will take place  with calculation of SUVmax, SUVmean, 
total lesion activity  of target lesions within parathyroid lesions (either at typi[INVESTIGATOR_812272]) . In addition, we 
will derive sim ilar measurements of background structures from key organs including thyroid , 
muscle ( pectoralis  muscle), bone marrow ( T5), and blood pool (aorta at arch). Tumor to 
background values will also be calculated. All measurements will take place over multiple t ime 
periods, including but not limited to 15min, 30 min, 45 min and 60 min in order to also calculate 
retention indices of tracer. More formal time -activity curves will also be constructed on separate 
specialized platforms.  
3) Subsequent to analysis of the  FACBC PET images, results of dual phase sestamibi study will 
be unblinded to the original reader and results correlated to sestamibi imaging as well as other 
imaging that may have been acquired such as ultrasound , MR, and/ or contrast CT of the neck .  
 
C.5 Comparison to “Truth”  
Results of the amino acid PET imaging will be measured against surgical findings and histologic 
proof. Both size of adenoma, cellular density, as well as other pathologic criteria will be 
correlated to various uptake parameters descr ibed above.

Revised 11 -22-13 C.6 Followup  
Success of surgery (and thus confirmation that all adenomas or hyperplasia have been 
resected) will be by [CONTACT_812288]/or post -
operative PTH levels. But this will be done as  part of routine standard of care  without special 
visits required of the patient . 
 
C.[ADDRESS_1124729] constructed a genotypic microarray for amino acid 
transporters. These include  but are not limited to : LAT1, LAT2, LAT3, ASCT1, ASCT2, BAT1, 
PAT1, xCT, yLAT1, and yLAT2. Tissue will be micro dissected from the adenoma and normal 
parathyroid tissue and sent for analysis. If we determine overexpression of candidate AAT, the 
samples will then undergo IHC analysis utilizing commercially available antibodies to candidate 
transporters . In addition, depending on imaging and preliminary analysis, resected samples may 
undergo more generic gene array (DASL) and other IHC analyses to better understand biologic 
mechanisms involved with and correlating to varying degrees of anti-3-[18F]FACBC  and 
Sestamibi u ptake .

F. Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Any patient death that may be due to the study procedure (i.e. severe radiotracer  reaction), 
unanticipated problem, or protocol deviation/non -compliance would be promptly reported to the 
Emory  IRB office.  Additionally any patient death not associated with the study procedure or 
serious anticipated event (i.e. radiotracer  allergy) will be reported to the Emory IRB and FDA 
upon continuing review.  This radiotracer is studied under IND [ADDRESS_1124731] been  studied 
without adverse events . 
G. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP):  
Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_812289]/reactions.  They will be given contact [CONTACT_812290] (i.e. problems with the IV site, any allergic reaction symptoms).  They 
will be followed routinely by [CONTACT_812291], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812274] [ADDRESS_1124732] of Drs. Weber, Galt, Schuster, Halkar, and Sharma will 
meet formally i f an adverse event has been reported.   Any serious adverse events (see above) 
will be communicated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_812275].   
 
H: Pharmaceutical, biologic, and device information  
 
Radiation Dosimetry. The stud y will be approved by [CONTACT_812292]. The maximum number of PET studies a patient will receive in this 
protocol  is [ADDRESS_1124733] absorbed dose. This organ is referred to as the critical organ. Often the 
limit for an individual organ dose is reached before the limit established for the whole -body. The 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration in Title 21 CFR Part 361 limits the whole body 
radiation dose to adult research subjects to less than 3 rem (30 mSv) for a single injection and 5 
rem (50 mSv) e ffective dose equivalent (EDE) annually. A single organ cannot receive more 
than 5 rem (50mSv) in a single injection and 15 rem (150 mSv) effective dose equivalent 
annually. These constraints on dose will limit the maximum number of injections for research  
subjects. The studies proposed in this application fall within these guidelines.  
 
Whole -body human biodistribution studies of FACBC show that it  is retained in liver and 
pancreas. A 10 mCi (370 MBq) injection of FACBC results in a whole -body effective dos e 
equivalent of 0.52 rem (5.2 mSv) and a critical organ absorbed dose of 1.9  rad (19.3 mGy) to 
liver (12). 
 
The level of radiation for the PET scan is the same as received in widely used diagnostic 
studies such as the currently used 18F -FDG and is equal to or less than 2 0 percent of the 
amount allowed a radiation worker in a year (5 rem). The calculated whole body exposure to the 
individual will be less than 0.[ADDRESS_1124734] scan, which is .5 rem at 80 -120 mA for 
the limited body area covered (chest only).  
 
The radiotracer used in this study is governed by [CONTACT_812293] [ADDRESS_1124735]. David Schuster.

Isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_852219]: [REMOVED]  
Document Date: 11/ 7/[ADDRESS_1185044] for 
participants, and it will allow us to ask critical information about the potential participant’s willingness and 
ability to commit to the frequency of clinic visits as well as the assessment of in clusion criteria. If a 
participant passes the Internet Prescreen, they will be directed to a scheduling platform called You Can 
Book Me. Participants will sign up for a time slot for the phone screen.  
 
Phone Screening.  The phone screen is an opportunity for research assistants to give potential participants 
more information about the study and to further assess inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research assistants will 
follow a phone screen script (see attachment) which incl udes the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS; see Measures). If there is evidence of a suicidal risk, the trained research assistants will follow 
the Suicidality Standard Operating Procedures (see attachments). Participant responses will be stor ed on 
REDCap. Participants who are interested and eligible will schedule an additional phone screen with the 
study nurse, [CONTACT_852249], to discuss their medical history. Participants who are not interested, or 
ineligible will be provided with smoking tre atment referrals (see phone screening script).  
 
Baseline Survey. The Baseline survey will be administered during CET 1 during the waiting period for the 
study drug. This will include further demographic measures, medical questions, and baseline smoking 
measures such as the Smoking Cue Appeal Survey (SCAS) and Overall An xiety Scale (OASIS). Previously, 
all of these questions were included in the Internet Prescreen survey . The  Internet Prescreen  has been 
shortened to more effectively recruit participants.  
 
In-Person Physical Exam. The ICD will be sent to participants via REDCap before the appointment so that 
they have time to read through the form and give their informed consent by [CONTACT_852236] a 
mouse or mouse pad. Upon arrival, if the participant has not signed the ICD, they will first read the ICD on a 
computer or iPad and provide their signature [CONTACT_852246]. A study coordinator will be 
available to answer any questions the participant may have about the study and participation. If the 
individu al chooses to sign the informed consent, he or she will proceed with the physical exam. Study 
personnel trained in advanced health assessment (PI, Cara C. Young, PhD, RN, FNP -C or other qualified 
study personnel under the supervision of [CONTACT_99780]) will con duct a cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_852220]. In addition to a cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_852221], vital signs to include temperature (Temp), pulse (P), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), a nd 
blood pressure (BP) will be obtained. Participants will be immediately excluded from the study if any 
abnormal findings are identified within the cardiac or respi[INVESTIGATOR_852222]. Vital signs outside normal 
limits will be handled thusly, (a) BP < 90 /60 or >140/90, BP will be reassessed in 5 minutes. If BP is still 
outside limits participants will reschedule their physical exam within 1 week. If upon return BP is < 90/60 or 
>140/90 participants will be excluded from the study; (b) P < 60 or >100, rech eck in 5 minutes. If P is still 
outside limits, participant will reschedule their research session within 1 week. If upon return P is < 60 or 
>100 participant will be excluded from the study; (c) RR >20, RR will be reassessed in 5 minutes, if RR is 
still o utside limits, participants will reschedule their physical exam within 1 week. If upon return RR is >20 
participant will be excluded from the study; (d) Temp > 100.4, participants will reschedule their research 
session within 1 week. If upon return Temp is  >100.[ADDRESS_1185045] of the visit which includes introduction to the goals of research study, and an explanation of data 
collection documents. Research personnel will also discuss the potential side effects of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_852223].   
 
Randomization   
Santiago Papi[INVESTIGATOR_852224]+ISR or CE+PBO conditions. 
Both participants and study personnel will be blind to study condition, and study medication will be labeled 
by [CONTACT_5640] “A” or “B” by [CONTACT_852237]. A random number 
generator will be used to assign individuals to either condition. Only [CONTACT_852250][INVESTIGATOR_852225]. Perrone will have the 
information necessary to break the blind. Prior to data analyses, [CONTACT_852251] will check  the balance of 
randomization and control for any factors that are imbalanced.  
 
Intervention Modules  
Abstinence Challenge. Eligible participants will be required to abstain from smoking beginning [ADDRESS_1185046] CE session and  up until the time of t he second 
session. Abstinence status will be verified by a Vitalograph Breathco Carbon Monoxide monitor (≤4 ppm). If 
a participant is not abstinent at the time of the physical exam and CE session 1, the participant will be 
asked to re -schedule within 1 week. In order to ensure compliance with alcohol abstinence 24 hours prior to 
CE session 1 and 24 hours after CE session 1, abstinence status will be verified by [CONTACT_852238] 1 and the beginning of CE session 2. If a participant is not 
abstinent at the time of CE session 1, the participant will be asked to re -schedule within 1 week.  
 
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Eligible participants will be asked to respond to surveys 
delivered via text message or email up to 15 times per day 24 -hours prior to the physical exam and up until 
the time of Cue Exposure Session 2 (48 hours total). Participants will be asked various qu estions related to 
smoking craving, behavior, and cues (see attached Short Smoking Log).  
 
Cue Exposure (CE). The two 60 -minute CE sessions will be conducted to expose participants to 
interoceptive and situational cues for tobacco use and craving (see Cue Exposure Therapy Protocol 
attachment). In the first session, participants will receive a dose of ISR or PBO an d begin the CE session 
after waiting 75 minutes. The overarching goal of CE is to expose participants to triggers that will produce 
high cravings, and to repeat exposure to those triggers in a controlled setting in order to allow the craving to 
come down o n its own. Because not all smokers respond equally to the same triggers, clinicians are trained 
to apply a variety of approaches. These can include exposure to slides, videos (on a traditional flat screen 
as well as in 360 video headsets) depi[INVESTIGATOR_852226] (visual exposure), exposure to emotions and 
imagined situations that most reliably triggered an urge to smoke (emotional/imaginal), and exposure to a 
participant’s own cigarettes (in vivo). The second session will be conducted [ADDRESS_1185047] craving throughout the CE sessions (see Reported Craving 
During CE attachment).  
 
Isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_99568].  All capsules will be identical in appearance to maintain the blind design of the 
study. Study capsules will be prepared containing: (a) 15 mg immediate release isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] (b) pi[INVESTIGATOR_852227]. Individual doses of study medications, prescribed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Young, will to be dispensed to patients by 
[CONTACT_3462] 75 minutes prior to CE 1 and patients will be asked to remain in the clinic until session 
time. Because all pi[INVESTIGATOR_852228], no pi[INVESTIGATOR_852229]. The drug will be prepared at Abrams Royal ([ADDRESS_1185048], Dallas, TX 
[ZIP_CODE]). All medications will be stored in a locked refriger ator. Upon completion of recruitment, unused 
medication will be returned to the pharmacy for proper disposal.

race/ethnicity, level of education, etc.) as well as history of medical problems. This will be collected in the 
online prescreen.  
 
Suicide.  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS; Posner, Oquendo, Gould, et al. 2007) is a 
standardized measure of current and past self -injurious behavior, suicidal intent, and suicidal behaviors. 
The C -SSRS has demonstrated good reliability and validi ty (Hammad et al., 2006; Posner et al., 2007). The 
C-SSRS will be administered as part of the diagnostic interview in order to assess for a history of suicide 
attempts or current suicidal thoughts or plans. This will be collected during the screening visit . The IRB -
approved standard operating procedures for individuals who pose a suicide risk will be followed (see 
attached Suicidality SOP).  
 
Vital Signs.  Temperature (Temp), pulse (P), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), and blood pressure (BP) will be obtained. 
This will be collected during the screening visit, CE visit 1 and 2.  
 
Medical evaluation . A study advanced practice nurse will review the patient’s medical history and conduct a 
complete physical examination if deemed necessary.  This will be collected during the screening visit.  
 
Overall Anxiety Scale (OASIS) : The OASIS is a 5 question self -report instrument that measures 
transdiagnostic anxiety symptoms (Norman et al., 2006).  
 
Measures of smoking behavior, nicotine dependence , withdrawal symptoms, and sleep measures  
   
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) . The FTND is a 6 -item scale designed to assess 
gradations in tobacco dependence (Heatherton et al., 1991). This measure will serve to quantify nicotine 
dependence, which will be used as a covariate in the primary analyses. This will be collected during th e 
screening visit.  
 
Minnesota Withdrawal Scale (MWS) . Given its potential relation to outcome, we will monitor withdrawal 
severity using the Minnesota Withdrawal Scale, a reliable and sensitive 10 -item scale (Hughes & 
Hatsukami, 1986). This will be collected at CE visit 1 and 2.  
 
Smoking Cue Appeal Survey (SCAS).  The Smoking Cue Appeal Survey (Murray, McHugh, Rowley, Sirota, 
& Otto, 2010) measures cue appeal to sensory smoking cues. An initial study demonstrated good 
psychometric properties associated with smoking status and craving (Murray et al., 2010). This will  be 
collected during the screening visit, CE visit 1 and 2.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) and Sleep Diary . The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] ( Buysse, 
Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer,  1989) is  a self -reported questionnaire which assesses sleep quality 
and disturbances. The question items group into seven component scores: sleep quality, sleep latency, 
sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency,  sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime 
dysfunction. In addition, a short self -report sleep diary will be administered in order to record the previous 
night’s sleep. The sleep measures will be used to examine the impact of sleep on the ef ficacy of exposure 
therapy and may also be used as a covariate in primary analyses. The PSQI will be collected at CE visit 1 
and the Sleep Diary will be collected at CE visits 1 and 2.    
 
Perceived Treatment.  A single self -reported item will be asked to examine whether the participant believes 
they received the active treatment study drug or a placebo.  
 
Measures of research integrity, safety, and acceptance  
Vital Signs. Participants’ blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed. This will be collected during the 
screening visit, CET visit 1 and 2.  
 
Patient Adherence . Patient adherence will be assessed by [CONTACT_613097].  
 
Researcher  Adherence . Each session (for those participants who give consent to be videotaped) will be 
videotaped and 10% will be rated shortly thereafter by [CONTACT_613098][INVESTIGATOR_613071], 
and competence with, the experimental protocol. Participants are n ot required to be videotaped and will 
indicate on their ICD whether or not they are willing to participate in the recording of sessions. Sessions 
from CE visit [ADDRESS_1185050] 24 hours prior to administration of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 24 hours after administration of 
isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. This will be collected during the screening visit, CE visit 1 and 2.

Data A nalyses  
Specific Aim 1: Effect on Long Term Craving  
To examine effects on the target of engagement, we will test the hypothesis that CE+ISR, 
compared to CE+PBO, will have a greater reduction in reduce subjective craving to smoking cues 
in a subsequent medication -free cue exposure conducted 24 -hours later (C E 2).  
Analytic approach:  A mixed factorial ANOVA will be used to test whether reduction in craving over 
the course of CE session 2 significantly differ across groups (CE+ISR vs. CE+PBO). More 
specifically, a 2X2 mixed (within -between) factorial ANOVA will be conducted with Group (2 levels: 
CE+ISR vs. CE+PBO) as the between -subject variable and Trials (2 levels: the first and last trials 
during the CE session 2) as the within -subject variable to examine the Group X Trial interaction 
effects on craving. A separate analysis (ANCOVA) for the same model will be conducted, 
controlling for sex  and baseline nicotine dependence . In addition, potential moderating roles of 
sex and baseline smoking severity on the effect of CE+ISR (vs. CE+PBO) on craving at the first 
trial during the CE session [ADDRESS_1185051] the Group X 
Moderator interaction s or linear regression models with Group X Moderator interaction term s.  
Specific Aim 2: Feasibility and Acceptability of I mplementation:  Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for the questionnaire to assess  overall clinic staff views of feasibility , acceptability , and 
ease of implementation . A q ualitative descriptive approach81 will be used to analyze semi -
structured interview transcripts using content analysis  to systematically code and categorize for 
trends and patterns in the textual data to remain as c lose to the s taff’s experiences as possible82. 
We have successfully used similar  approach es in prior studies .83–85 
C3g.  Sample size and power considerations  
Based on the sample size calculation using G*Power, a total sample size of 102 (n=51 for each 
group) will be sufficient to detect a small effect size (f=0.1) in Group (between -subject) by [INVESTIGATOR_529212] 
(within -subject: craving ratings for the first and last trials during CE session 2) interaction on 
craving using mixed (within -between) factorial ANOVA/ANCOVA, with 80% power, an alpha of 
0.05, and a correlation coefficient between repeated measures (the first and last tri al)  of 0.75.  
D. Limitations and alternative considerations  
While a variety of indirect measures of craving have been proposed for humans, including 
behavioral indicators (e.g., rate and latency of consumption, inter -puff-interval ), 
psychophysiological measures (e.g., startle eye -blink, skin conductance response, and heart 
rate) and cognitive measures (e.g., attentional and cognitive biases to drug cues), the 
advantages of these over subjective report is not clear.[ADDRESS_1185052]:  Isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_852230]: Cara Young, PhD, The University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin

Invitation to be Part of a Research Study  
You are invited to be part of a research study. This consent form will help you choose whether or 
not to participate in the study. Feel free to ask if anything is not clear in this consent form.  
 
Important Information about this Research Study  
Things you should know:  
 
• The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of 15 mg of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_852232].  
• In order to participate, you must be deemed eligible based on a  brief phone screen with the 
study advance practice nurse, [CONTACT_852249], to discuss your medical history.   
• If you choose to participate, you will be asked to choose a quit day to quit smoking for [ADDRESS_1185053] in -person Cue Exposure Therapy (CET) session immediately after 
the physical exam. The second session will occur in -person the following day. The first i n-person 
session  is 2.5 hours, the second in-person session is 1 hour.  
• Risks or discomforts include withdrawal due to smoking abstinence, possible side effects of 
isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (described in detail below), possible discomfort due to exposure to smoking cues in a 
360 degree  
 
• Taking part in this research is voluntary. You do not have to participate, and you can stop at 
any time.  
More detailed information may be described later in this form.  
Please take time to read this entire form and ask questions before deciding whether to take part 
in this research study.  
What is the study about and why are we doing it?  
The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of 15 mg of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_852233] (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_852234]) for tobacco craving reduction.  
 
What will happen if you take part in this study?  
The objective of  the medical phone screen is to review your medical history to determine your 
eligibility for participation in this research study. If you agree to participate, the first part of your 

in-person visit is a [ADDRESS_1185054]. Cara 
Young, will review the report to ensure that there is no risk for isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_413244]. 
Together, these procedures provide the info rmation required for the study advance practice 
nurse to determine whether you can safely participate in this research study.  
 
If you qualify for the study based on the outcome of the screening assessment, you will be 
enrolled in the study. Inclusion in the study will involve:  
 
• Choosing a quit day. Because we want to measure craving during nicotine withdrawal, you will 
select a day in which you will have the physical exam. You will be required to stop smoking [ADDRESS_1185055] Cue Exposure 
Therapy Session (CET) will  take place immediately after the physical exam.  The second 
session  will occur 24 hours later (two consecutive days). Together, you will have to remain quit 
for 48 hours. We will verify abstinence on both days with a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor.  
 
• Complete short smoking logs 24 -hours prior to each visit. You will receive up to 15 notifications 
per day to complete the short smoking log prior to the two visits. You will be asked to complete 
the logs as soon as you receive them. Each log should take less than 30 seconds to complete.  
 
• Attend two consecutive visits. The purpose of the Cue Exposure Therapy (CET) is to measure 
your craving levels while we show you smoking related cues. In the first visit only, after the 
physical exam , you will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_667833] a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] [ADDRESS_1185056] a 1 in 2 chance of 
receiving the study drug. Please note: A placebo is an inactive substance given  in the same 
form as the active drug (like a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ). The second session will take place [ADDRESS_1185057] visit will take 
approximately 2.5 hours (due to 75 -minute medication wait period) and the second visit will take 
approximately 1 hour.  
 
Neither you nor the study personnel will be able to choose your group. The study will be 
"double -blinded," meaning that neither participants nor study personnel will know which kind of 
tablets the participants are taking. However, in case of an emergency, study personnel can find 
out which dose you are taking.  
 
It is unlikely that you will experience any symptoms from taking this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. In case you do 
experience any side effects, a clinician, Cara Young, PH.D., will be available to answer any 
questions or concerns you may have (cell phone number: 816 -596-6056).

How long will you be in this study and how many people will be in the study?  
Participation in this study will last approximately four and a half hour s and 102 subjects will be 
enrolled in the study.  
 
What risks and discomforts might you experience from being in this study?  
There are some risks you might experience from being in this study. The physical exam  is 
designed to evaluate the safety of the procedures, your medication use, and drug allergies. 
There are minimal risks associated with the screening procedures or devices. If you have any 
discomfort you should notify the investigators as soon as possible.  If the discomfort cannot be 
relieved, the session may be stopped. We will provide referrals to psychological services in the 
area.  
 
There are minimal risks associated with the questionnaires such as possible discomfort involved 
in answering some of the questions. You will not be forced to do anything you do not want to do, 
and you can terminate any of these procedures at any time.  
 
The possible side effects for isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_236596]: edema, tingling of hands or feet, unusual weight 
gain or loss, chest pain, difficult or labored breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath, 
dizziness/faintness/lightheadedness, fast/irregular/pounding/racing pulse, feeling of warmth, full 
or bloated feeling, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/constipation, pressure/soreness in the stomach, 
swelling of abdominal or stomach area, tightness in chest, unusu al tiredness or weakness, 
blurred vision, confusion, flushing, sweating, headache. However, most of these side effects 
occurred as commonly as with placebo in placebo -controlled trials. Edema, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, 
and flushing appear to be dose related, particularly at doses >[ADDRESS_1185059] made the l ikelihood that 
this will occur extremely small. Mild to moderate physical discomfort as a result of cyber 
sickness, a form of motion sickness may occur. Symptoms can include blurred vision, sweating, 
eyestrain, salivation, headaches, vertigo, dizziness, na usea, and vomiting. Symptoms are 
temporary and resolve within a few minutes to a few hours. Each exposure to the 360 video is 
for a short duration (maximum of 5 minutes) making cyber sickness significantly less likely than 
if the exposure were for a longer  period of time to occur. Researchers will be trained in the case 
of a participant experiencing cyber sickness, and participants will be free to terminate the 
experiment at any time should they experience any discomfort. Cue exposure therapy and/or 
isradip ine may involve risks, which are currently unforeseeable. The researchers will let you 
know about any significant new findings (such as additional risks or discomforts) that might 
make you change your mind about participating in this study.  
 
How could you benefit from this study?  
There are no direct benefits to participants for participating in this study. All participants will 
receive brief treatment with CET, a type of psychotherapy that has previously been shown to 
reduce cigarette cravings in some individuals.  
 
What will happen to the samples and/or data we collect from you?  
The electronic and self -report data obtained will also be assigned an ID number and will be 
stored on the lab's hard drive, which will be password protected.  
 
If you choose to participate in this study and grant the staff permission, your sessions will be 
audio recorded. The recordings will be heard or viewed only for research purposes by [CONTACT_852241]. Any audio recordings will be stored securely and only the 
research team w ill have access to the recordings. Recordings will be kept for three years and 
then erased.  
 
How will we protect your information?  
The study is confidential. In order to protect your confidentiality, any information about you 
obtained as a result of participation in this research will be kept as confidential as legally 
possible. However, your research records, just like hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85961], may be subpoenaed by 
[CONTACT_852242]. A record of your participation 
will be kept in a confidential form, such that your name [CONTACT_852247]. By [CONTACT_852243], information you provide cannot  be directly linked to your name. Furthermore, information 
with identifying information, such as the consent form, will be kept separately from data that has 
been assigned an ID number. All of the information you provide will be double -locked (in a 
locked cabinet, within a locked lab) at all times.  
 
 We may share your data with other researchers. Your data may be used for future research 
very different than this research study. If we share your data we will remove any information that 
would let others know that these data came from you. However, we wi ll not come back to you to 
ask for your consent if we share your data. We plan to publish the results of this study. To 
protect your privacy, will not include any information that could directly identify you.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72188] (Cara Young, Ph.D.), other designees of the research 
team, and representatives from the Institutional Review Board and regulatory authorities, will be 
granted direct access to your research records for verification  of research procedures and use 
of data. If it becomes necessary for the Institutional Review Board to review the study records, 
information that can be linked to you will be protected to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Your 
research records will not be relea sed without your consent unless required by [CONTACT_7720] a court 
order.  
 
Information about you may be given to the following organizations:  
• The study sponsor and/or representative of the sponsor  
• Representatives of UT Austin and the UT Austin Institutional Review Board  
 
A description of this study will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov as required by U.S. 
law. This web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the web site will 
include a summary of the results.  You can search this web  site at any time.  
 
What will happen to the information we collect about you after the study is over?  
We will keep your research data to use for future research purposes not detailed within this 
consent form. Your name [CONTACT_852248].   
 
What if we learn something about your health that you did not know?  
As part of this study, we may learn medically relevant information about you. If we learn 
something that you and your doctor did not know, we refer you to the relevant healthcare 
services and/or communicate relevant health information to your doctor, under the guidance of 
the study advance practice nurse, [CONTACT_852249].

Amendment 8  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to gain greater safety exposure to the fasinumab 1 mg 
dose in the main safety study. Patients will be enrolled into the main study and randomized to 
fasinumab 1 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W), 1 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or placebo. This will 
increase the size of the fasinumab safety database for potentially clinically relevant doses and, 
thus, will contribute to the  overall fasinumab safety assessment.  Minor edits and corrections 
have also been made. The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the 
affected sections:

CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 7  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to incorporate an urgent safety measure, which 
requires discontinuing the 3 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 6 mg every 8 we eks (Q8W) dose 
regimens.  The recommendation by [CONTACT_9572] (DMC) to 
discontinue these dose regimens was made following a review of unblinded data from this 
ongoing study and was based on an imbalance in clinically relevant ad verse events including 
time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend towards early fractures in 
the 6 mg Q8W group.  Based on the independent DMC review, study of lower dose levels 
(eg,1 mg Q4W) may continue to be evaluated in t his population.  With this amendment, patients 
randomized to the [ADDRESS_935706] typos.

previously into a local version of the protocol, R475 -PN-1523.04EU  
 Update the doses, dosing schedule, and the rationale for dose selection for the main 
study (1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6 mg Q8W ) and sub -study (1 mg Q8W, 1 mg 
Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6 mg Q8W)  
 Add an end of study phone contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] [ADDRESS_935707] dose of study drug 
to determine whether a joint replacement (JR) was performed or is scheduled (or the 
patient is on a waiting li st) 
 Update the number of patients enrolled and the randomization allocation  
 Update the language that refers to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_689774] a dose arm, the study or the 
program  
 Clarify the safety objectives and update the associated endpoints and statistical 
methods

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -blind, Multi -Dose, 
Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the Long -Term Safety 
and the Effica cy of Fasinumab in Patients with Pain Due to 
Osteoarthritis of the Knee or Hip  
Site Locations  North America, Latin America, Europe, and 
Asia/Pacific/South Africa  
Objectives  Primary Objective : 
To describe the safety and tolerability of fasinumab, including 
adverse events of special interest (AESIs), in patients with 
pain due to radiographically -confirmed OA of the knee of hip  
Additional Objectives for the 
Efficacy Sub -study  The objective of the sub -study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
fasinumab c ompared with placebo when administered to 
patients with pain due to radiographically -confirmed OA of 
the knee or hip . 
Study Design  The study consists of a screening period of up to 30 days 
(Screening Period), followed by a 7  to 10 day 
pre-randomization period (Pre -Randomization Period), a 
16-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
treatment period (Treatment Period 1), a 36 -week, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled treatment period (Treatment 
Period 2) in which non -NSAID standard -of-care pain 
medi cations can also be used in the event of inadequate pain 
relief for OA pain, a [ADDRESS_935719] dose of 
study drug to determine whether a joint replacement (JR) has 
been conducted or  is scheduled (or the patient is on a waiting 
list).  
A subset of patients will also participate in a 16 -week 
sub-study to characterize the efficacy of fasinumab. Efficacy 
assessments will be performed during treatment period 1, 
which will be followed by t he 36 -week treatment period 2, 
and the 24 -week follow -up period.  
Study Duration  Total duration of participation will be up to 105  weeks, 
including the screening and pre -randomization periods.  
Patients who discontinue study drug will be requested to 
return for all scheduled study visits and to complete all 
planned assessments, includi ng phone contacts.

fasinumab Q8W, 1 mg fasinumab Q4W, 3 mg fasinumab 
Q4W, 6 mg fasinumab Q8W or matching placebo Q4W.  
Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_15249] K -L score (2 -3, 4) 
and by [CONTACT_1617] (North America, Latin America, 
Europe, or Asia/Pacific).  For the sub -study, stratification was 
also by [CONTACT_689809].  After the 16 week sub -study, patients will 
then continue in the main safety study, in which dosing will 
continue through week 48.  
  Rescue Treatment  
 Route/Schedule:  Paracetamol/acetaminophen is the study -provided rescue 
medication for OA pain and may be taken as needed, with a 
maximum daily dose of 2500 mg in Europe and 2600 mg in 
non-European countries throughout the entire treatment 
period. Sub -study patients should discontinue use of 
paracetamol/a cetaminophen 24  hours prior to the start of the 
randomization visit (baseline) and subsequent study visits with 
efficacy assessments.  
Beginning at week 16, patients may take non -NSAID 
standard -of-care therapy in the event of inadequate pain relief 
for OA p ain. Though use of NSAIDs should generally be 
avoided, limited use is allowed for non -OA related pain or 
fever after week 16.  
Endpoints   
 Primary:  The primary endpoint is safety monitoring including adverse 
event (AE) incidence, serious adverse event (SAE) incidence, 
AESI incidence, changes in safety laboratory analyses, and 
incidence of anti -fasinumab antibody formation from baseline 
to week 52 (treatment period 1 and 2) and to week 72 (end of 
follow -up period).  
Additional Endpoints for the 
Efficacy Sub-Study   
Primary:  In addition to the main study endpoints, the following 
co-primary endpoints will be evaluated for the efficacy 
sub-study:  
 Change  from baseline to week 16 in the WOMAC pain 
subscale score  
 Change from baseline  to week 16 in the WOMAC 
physical function subscale score

CONFIDENTIAL  Secondary:  Key secondary efficacy endpoints for the sub -study are:  
 Change from baseline to week 16 in the Patient Global 
Assessment  for OA score  
 The percentage of patients who had a response at 
week  16, with response defined as an improvement by 
≥30% in WOMAC pain subscale scores  
PK and ADA variables:  The pharmacokinetic (PK) variable is fasinumab 
concentrations in serum at specified sampling time points.  
The anti -drug antibody (ADA) variables include ADA status 
(posi tive or negative) and titer.  
Procedures and Assessments  Physical examinations, medical history, concomitant 
medication assessment, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), imaging, laboratory assessment, neurologic 
evaluations, and orthostatic hypotension assessment will be 
performed and the joint pain questionnaire and autonomic 
nervous system survey will be administered to assess safety. 
Adverse events, SAEs, and concomitant medications will be 
assessed at each study visit. Samples to determine serum 
conc entrations of functional fasinumab and anti -fasinumab 
antibodies will be collected at predetermined time points. 
Efficacy will be assessed in sub -study patients using the 
WOMAC sub scales, the Patient Global Assessment of OA, 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ave rage walking index joint 
pain, and use of rescue medication.  
Radiographs and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will 
be performed on any joint following a report of clinically 
significant worsening or exacerbation of pain in that joint. 
Potential events o f adjudicated arthropathy (AA) and 
sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored 
during the course of the study.  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the 
treatment or follow -up periods, they will be discontinued from 
study drug and asked to return to the study site for a 
preoperative visit, and for follow -up safety evaluations [ADDRESS_935721] to JR surgery (if patient 
underwent, is scheduled for, or is on a wait list for JR 
surgery). Patients who had an AA will have an MRI 
performed of the affected joint(s).

CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical Plan  This study will contribute to  the overall assessment of 
fasinumab safety in patients with pain associated with OA.   
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 
treatment -emergent AESIs will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Differences in event rate for AESIs between 
fasinumab and placebo will be estimated using exact binomial 
confidence intervals.  
The sample size of the efficacy sub -study was selected to have 
a sufficient number of patients to allow treatment comparisons 
of sub -study primary efficacy endpoints.  The ef fect size for 
WOMAC pain subscale score, WOMAC physical function 
subscale score and Patient Global Assessment were 0.46, 0.46, 
and 0.36, respectively as observed in the phase 2 study 
R475 -PN-1227.  Assuming a dropout rate of 15% at week  16,

adjustment for missing data due to treatm ent discontinuation 
for the reasons of lack of efficacy or AEs assuming the 
WOMAC scores would on average return to baseline values. 
The missing data for patients who discontinued treatment due 
to lack of efficacy or AEs will be imputed with values 
centere d at the mean baseline value of the treatment group that 
patients were randomized to. Data collected after 
discontinuing treatment up to week 16 will not be used in the 
primary efficacy analysis, but used in a treatment policy

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1. Background  
Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects a large portion of the global populati on. A significant cause 
of chronic musculoskeletal pain is due to osteoarthritis (OA). Osteoarthritis is a progressive, 
chronic disease which is caused by [CONTACT_689811], knees, hands, feet , and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. It is characterized by [CONTACT_689812], osteophyte 
formation at the joint margins, thickening of the joint capsule and mild synovitis. Symptoms and 
disabilit y increase with increasing age. The prevalence of OA in patients aged 65 and older is 
60% in men and 70% in women, and continually rising.   
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment in patients with 
mild-to-moderate OA. T heir efficacy is well documented, although modest ( Bjordal 2004 ), but 
their use is not without risk. Many patients with acute and chronic pain do not receive adequate 
pain relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_689783], either 
because the medications are not effective in all patients, or because their use is limited by 
[CONTACT_689813]. The risks associated with long -term NSAID therapy have been well 
characterized and include gastro intestinal bleeding and increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
In some patients (eg, those with hypertension and pre -existing renal or gastrointestinal disease), 
the chronic use of NSAIDs may be contraindicated (see current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure). Guidelines suggest that opi[INVESTIGATOR_73385], intolerable, or otherwise contraindicated.  However, opi[INVESTIGATOR_689784]. These include drowsiness , dizziness, 
gastrointestinal tolerability and motor imbalance, all of which can have serious consequences in 
older patients. There is data to support the efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_689785] a short 
duration; however, long -term efficacy has not been evaluated. Furthermore, there is no evidence 
to support superiority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_329076]. Additionally, opi[INVESTIGATOR_689786]. 
Inadequate pain relie f has a profound impact on the quality of life for millions of people 
worldwide with an associated substantial cost to society, including healthcare cost and loss of 
productivity.  
As a result, there remains an unmet medical need for alternative treatment o ptions with more 
effective analgesia and/or with an improved side -effect profile. This is an important need since 
there are a significant number of patients who are intolerant to or do not get adequate pain relief 
from the currently available treatment opt ions.   
Neurotrophins are a family of peptide growth factors that play a role in the development, 
differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non -neuronal cells ( Chao 2006 ).  Nerve 
growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrop hin to be identified, and its role in the development 
and survival of both peripheral and central neurons during the development of the nervous 
system is well characterized ( Smeyne 1994 , Crowley 1994 ).  In th e adult, NGF is not required as 
a survival factor but acts as a pain mediator that sensitizes neurons ( Pezet  2006 ).  Nerve growth

CONFIDENTIAL  factor activity is mediated through 2 different membrane -bound receptors, the high -affinity 
tyrosine k inase type 1 (TrkA) and the low -affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors.   
By [CONTACT_73438], the NGF/TrkA system appears to 
play a major role in the control of pain.  Administration of NGF has been shown to provoke pain  
in both rodents ( Lewin 1994 ) and humans ( McArthur 2000 ), while NGF antagonists have been 
shown to prevent hyperalgesia and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic and chronic 
inflammatory pain ( Ramer 1999 ).  Humans with mutations in TrkA (hereditary sensory and 
autonomic neuropathy IV) or NGF (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy V) have been 
identified with a loss of deep pain perception ( Indo 1996 , Einarsdottir  2004 ).  In addition, NGF 
is known to be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other types 
of arthritis ( Aloe 1992 , Halliday 1998 ), and to  be up -regulated in injured and inflamed tissues in 
conditions such as cystitis, prostatitis, and chronic headache ( Lowe 1997 , Miller 2002 , 
Sarchielli  2001 ).   
Fasinumab (also known as  REGN475) is a fully -human high -affinity monoclonal antibody 
directed against NGF. By [CONTACT_73439], fasinumab has the potential to be effective 
in modulating NGF -associated pain  without some of the adverse side effects of other analgesic 
medica tions, such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_173671] -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Following 
an evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the antibody in a single -ascending -dose 
first-in-human study (study  R475 -PN-0817), a proof -of-concept study evaluating the  effect of 
fasinumab on pain in 217  patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee was completed (study 
R475 –PN-0901, see current version of the Investigator’s Brochure). Three intravenous (IV) 
doses of fasinumab were evaluated (0.03,  0.1, 0.3 mg/kg every 8  weeks [Q8W]), all of which 
were associated with statistically significant improvement in pain compared with placebo when 
evaluated by [CONTACT_73440], the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC), and the Patient’s Global I mpression of Change questionnaire. Additionally, an 
interim analysis of the R475 -PN-1227 osteoarthritis study was conducted and revealed 
significant efficacy in the WOMAC pain subscale score for each of the doses of fasinumab 
evaluated (1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, a nd 9 mg each given every 4 weeks [Q4W]) compared to placebo 
(data on file). Results from recent clinical studies with other anti -NGF antibodies, tanezumab 
([COMPANY_007]) and fulranumab (Janssen), also support the role of NGF in pain modulation in patients 
with p ain due to OA of the knee and hip ( Lane 2010 , Hefti 2006 , Brown  2010 , Sanga  2011 ) and 
in patients with chronic low back pain ( Kivitz 2013 , Katz 2011 ).  
In all clinical studies completed to date, fasinumab was generally well tolerated, although 
joint-related events have occurred more frequently in fasinumab -treated patients than in 
placebo -treated patients. Additionally, arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, hypoesthesia, 
and myalgia were more frequently reported in fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated 
patients. In neurological evaluations, abnormalities in vibration se nse were more frequent in 
fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients. These adverse events (AEs) or 
physical examination abnormalities associated with fasinumab were generally mild to moderate 
in intensity and were transient in nature (see  current version of the Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from studies of tanezumab and fulranumab demonstrated these molecules were associated 
with an increased risk of destructive arthropathy (DA), a unique clinical form of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_689787]. Analyses of 
the tanezumab data by [CONTACT_23662], defined by [CONTACT_689814]-RIM-00071798-1.0 Approved - 22 Apr 2019 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  obtained on joint replacement (JR), showed that the risk of DA increases with tanezumab dose 
and is further increased with the concomitant use of chronic NSAIDs (>90  days) ( Lane 2010 ). 
Most cases of DA occurred in joints with a documented history of OA.  
Based on the potential risk of DA identified with tanezumab and fulranuma b, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) placed the class of anti -NGF antibodies on clinical hold in 2010. 
Following review of anti -NGF antibody clinical data in March 2012, the FDA determined that 
clinical studies of anti -NGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689788]. To address concerns about potential events of DA, a risk -mitigation 
approach is being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . This 
approach includes sensitive, prospective, and rigorous radiologic screening and monitoring for 
certain changes in joint structure. Patients who develop these changes, termed ‘adjudicate d 
arthropathy’ (AA), are required to discontinue study therapy.  
Since the removal of the FDA clinical hold, Regeneron has conducted or initiated several clinical 
trials of fasinumab.  In all clinical studies to date, fasinumab was associated with a low ra te of 
discontinuations due to adverse events.  Patients treated with fasinumab generally had more 
frequent events than did placebo -treated patients of arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, 
altered peripheral sensation (eg, paresthesia, dysesthesia) , and myalgia.  
In 2012, non -clinical studies of the sponsors of other anti -NGF monoclonal antibodies identified 
adverse changes in the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals of several species (rat and 
non-human primate). These effects included a re versible decrease in neuron volume. To date, no 
statistically significant or consistent effects of fasinumab on the sympathetic nervous system 
have been detected in animal studies with up to 6 -months of treatment. Based on the potential 
risk of sympathetic  nervous system toxicity identified in non -clinical studies of other anti -NGF 
monoclonal antibodies, a risk -mitigation approach is being implemented for all fasinumab 
studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
In the phase 2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to  OA of the knee or hip 
(R475 -PN-1227), 26 AA events occurred in 24  patients.  There was an increase in AA events 
that appeared to be  related to greater fasinumab dose.  Although these events were milder than 
the severe DA events presented at the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, in consideration 
of the lack of an observed dose response for efficacy in OA, the benefit -risk ratio wa s deemed 
unfavorable for the fasinumab 6  mg Q4W and 9  mg Q4W doses in patients with OA, in 
comparison to the other fasinumab doses that were studied, (ie, 1 mg Q4W and 3 mg Q4W).  
Accordingly, 6  mg Q4W and 9 mg Q4W were removed from the present study  in an  amendment 
issued in June  2016.  The dose regimens that were being evaluated in the phase 3 studies for OA 
pain in the knee or hip included 1 mg Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6  mg Q8W.  In 
April  2018, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommen ded discontinuing 
6 mg Q8W and 3  mg Q4W (expected to have similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) based on a review 
of unblinded data in the present study.  Subsequently, a small Regeneron team reviewed the data 
and agreed with this recommendation.  The DMC noted im balances in clinically relevant adverse 
events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend towa rds 
early fractures.  The phase  [ADDRESS_935734] dose regimen of 1 mg Q4W, which is supported by [CONTACT_689815] a favorable benefit -risk profile.

CONFIDENTIAL  Osteoarthritis is a condition that results in significant morbidity and disability, as well as marked 
loss of productivity for those affected (see current version of the Investigator’s Brochure ). For 
those patients affected, fasinumab represents an effective anti -NGF therapy which has the 
potential to help those patients who do not achieve adequate pain relief, are unable to tolerate 
existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or have absolute or relative contraindications to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.2. Summary of Risks and Benefits to Patients Participating in this 
Study  
As discussed above in Section  1.1, there are potential risks and benefits to patients participating 
in the study. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure and Informed Consent Form (ICF) for 
additional detailed information and analysis of the p otential risks and benefits associated with 
fasinumab administration.  Pain due to OA is a condition that results in significant morbidity and 
disability as well as marked loss of productivity. There is a significant unmet medical need for 
treatments with this condition. In Study R475 -OA-1523, patients with pain due to OA will be 
randomized to fasinumab or placebo; each of these treatment groups presents potential benefits 
and risks to patients as described below.  
 Fasinumab  
Fasinumab represents a potentiall y effective therapy that may be beneficial to patients who do 
not achieve adequate pain relief, are unable to tolerate existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or have absolute or 
relative contraindications to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73395].  Previous 
fasinu mab study (R475 -PN-1227) results have further confirmed earlier efficacy observations 
and demonstrate that fasinumab provides significant pain relief compared to placebo in OA 
patients across all doses administered.  Some common side effects seen in patien ts treated with 
fasinumab are joint -related events such as joint pain, joint/limb swelling, joint damage, new or 
worsening OA and occurrence of joint replacement surgery, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  
The joint damage that has been observed usual ly occurred in a knee or hip and sometimes in 
multiple joints.  The joint damage occurred with or without increased joint pain and, at times, 
was more rapid and more severe than what is normally seen with OA.  Some patients treated 
with fasinumab who devel op this joint damage have had a higher chance of undergoing joint 
replacement surgery.  In addition, this higher risk of joint replacement surgery has also been 
noted in fasinumab -treated patients who did not develop joint damage.  Further, this joint 
dama ge occurred more frequently in patients who received NSAIDs along with drugs of the 
group of anti -NGF and, therefore, concomitant administration of fasinumab and NSAIDs, apart 
from low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], is restricted in this study.  Other adverse effects that have been seen in 
patients taking fasinumab include a risk of bone fracture and altered peripheral sensation, 
including hypoesthesia and paraesthesia.  Some patients had pain, numbness, or tingling in their 
wrist/hand and found to have carpal tunnel syndro me, which was sometimes treated with a 
surgical procedure.  Finally, events associated with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction are 
being closely monitored due to findings from animal studies, although to date, this hasn’t been 
observed in patients trea ted with fasinumab.  
Throughout the entire fasinumab clinical development program, the potential risks noted above 
are being mitigated by [CONTACT_689816].  These mitigation activiti es are described in detail in Section  7.6.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL  Finally, the selected dose of fasinumab has been chosen to also contribute to the further 
maintenance of a favorable risk -benefit.   
In summary, the overall benefit risk profile for fasinumab in this study is favorable.  
 Placebo  
The main potential risks associated with placebo are the lack of, or inadequate pain relief.  
Measures taken to minimize the risks associated with placebo use are as follows:  
 Availability of rescue medicatio n (acetaminophen/paracetamol).  
 Patients can withdraw from the study at any  time if pain persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_73396]/paracetamol at the recommended dosage.  
Please refer to Section  1.[ADDRESS_935735] a history of inadequate pain relief 
with paracetamol/acetaminophen, and a history of inadequate pain relief or intolerance to oral 
NSAIDs, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]. During the initial [ADDRESS_935736] -of-care pain 
medications will be prohibited with the exception of paracetamol/acetaminophen, which will be 
provided as a rescue medication. Following the first [ADDRESS_935737] -of-care pain medicat ion including limited use NSAIDs (for non -OA pain or fever), as 
well as paracetamol/acetaminophen (Section  5.2.2 ), in addition to study drug. Theref ore, this 
study will also provide safety data on the concomitant use of fasinumab with other analgesics, 
including limited use NSAIDs.  
A subset of patients will participate in an efficacy sub -study, in addition to participation in the 
main long -term safet y study. In the sub -study, efficacy parameters will be assessed over the 
[ADDRESS_935738] (AESI) (adjudicated arthropathy, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, 
peripheral sensory  AEs, and JR surgery). Since this study is enrolling patients who have failed or 
are intolerant to NSAIDs or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and who have inadequate pain relief from 
paracetamol/acetaminophen, there are limited other therapeutic options available, supporting

1.3.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous versions of this protocol randomized patients to receive fixed -dose, subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of fasinumab at 6 mg Q8W (amendment 3 onwards in the main study) and 1 mg Q8W, 
1 mg Q4W, 3  mg Q4W, 6  mg Q8W (amendment 5 in the efficacy sub -study), or matching 
placebo.  The purpose of the 1  mg Q8W dose regimen is to aid in the determination of a 
minimally e ffective dose.  An independent DMC recommended discontinuing 6 mg Q8W and 
3 mg Q4W (expected to have similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) following a review of unblinded 
data from this ongoing study.  The recommendation was based on an imbalance in clinically 
relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia 
and a trend towards early fractures in patients administered 6 mg Q4W (dose discontinu ed in 
amendment 3, issued on 20  June 2016) or 6 mg Q8W.  Based on the indepen dent DMC review, 
study of lower dose levels (eg,1 mg Q4W) may continue to be evaluated in this population.  
Under amendment 7, issued on 24  May 2018, all patients previously randomized to 3 mg Q4W 
or 6 mg Q8W under earlier versions of the protocol were dis continued from study drug but 
encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and study procedures in the follow -up period, 
and the end of study phone call.  Given the discontinuation of the 3 mg and 6 mg doses, greater 
exposure to the fasinumab 1 mg dos e is required to increase the size of the fasinumab safety 
database for potentially clinically relevant doses.  Under amendment  8, issued on 11 Jul 2018 , 
patients will be in a 3:3:1 ratio to fasinumab 1  mg Q8W, 1 mg Q4W or placebo.  This 
randomization rati o was chosen based on the need to enroll more patients on the 1  mg dose 
regimens and the need to include placebo patients for blinding purposes.  
Patients originally randomized to 6 mg Q4W or 9 mg Q4W were transitioned to 6 mg Q8W in 
amendment 3 (issued on  20 June 2016).  These patients and patients on matching placebo were 
subsequently discontinued from study drug in amendment R475 -PN-1523.04EU (issued on 
12 January 2017) and a mendment 5 global (issued on 16  March  2017), but encouraged to 
otherwise continu e all protocol visits and complete all study procedures with the exception of 
receiving study drug.  This decision was based on data from the phase 2/[ADDRESS_935740] doses 
evaluated (6 mg and 9  mg Q4W).  
Supportive trials include data from 2 completed fasinumab phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers 
(R475 -PN-0817 and TD -[ZIP_CODE]), as well as data fro m the completed fasinumab phase  2 
proof -of-concept study in patients with pain due to OA of the knee (R475 -PN-0901), results

CONFIDENTIAL  from the phase 2 study in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee (R475 -PN-1227), and the 
single -dose, proof -of-concept study in patients with sciatic pain (R475 -PN-0908), as well as 
pharmacokineti cs (PK).  
Single subcutaneous (SC) doses of fasinumab of up to 30  mg were well tolerated in healthy male 
and female subjects (study TDU -[ZIP_CODE]). Single IV doses of up to 1  mg/kg were also studied in 
healthy male and female subjects (study  R475 -PN-0817). In this study, fasinumab was generally 
well tolerated at all but the highest IV dose (1  mg/kg). Neurosensory AEs, which were transient 
and not severe, led to expansion of the 1  mg/kg IV cohort and a decision to not dose -escalate 
beyond this level.  
In the R47 5-PN-0901 phase  2 proof -of-concept study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee, multiple IV doses of up to 0.3  mg/kg administered Q8W demonstrated efficacy 
with regard to pain relief and were well tolerated in Caucasian subjects. All 3 d oses of fasinumab 
(0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg IV Q8W) were associated with greater improvement 
compared to placebo in walking index knee pain, standardized total WOMAC score, WOMAC 
subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and Patient’s Global Im pression of Change. However, it 
was noted that pain relief had the slowest onset with  the lowest (0.03 mg/kg) dose.  
In the R475 -PN-1227 phase  2 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the hip or 
knee, all SC doses (1  mg, 3  mg, 6mg, and 9  mg Q 4W) demonstrated efficacy in pain relief and

term safety study.  
The study consists of a screening period of up to 30  days (Screening Period), a 7 to 10 day 
pre-randomization period (Pre -Rando mization Period), a 16 -week randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled treatment period (Treatment Period 1), a 36 -week, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled treatment period (Treatment Period 2) in which non -NSAID standard -of-care 
pain medications can also be used in the event of inadequate pain relief for OA pain, a 24 -week 
follow -up period with in -clinic visits (Follow -up Period), and an e nd of study phone contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] 
[ADDRESS_935744] for JR surgery 
(Figure  1).  
 Screening Period (up to 30 days before the pre -randomization period): After 
informed consent has been signed, eligibility for enrollment will be determined based 
upon parameters assessed during the screening and pre -randomization periods. X -rays 
of the shoulders, hips and knees will be performed during th e screening period. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the index and contralateral joint must be 
performed and assessed by [CONTACT_9251]. Any knee or hip joint with a K -L score 
of ≥[ADDRESS_935745] been completed and the central 
reader confirms that there are no exclusionary findings. During the screening period, 
all patients may continue to take their current treatment regimen for OA pai n. 
 Pre-Randomization Period (7 to 10 days before the randomization/baseline visit 
[day  1]): Patients who meet the initial eligibility criteria, as assessed in the screening 
period, may enter the pre -randomization period. An in -office pre -randomization visi t 
will occur for patients enrolled in the sub -study while a phone visit will occur if 
patients are only in the safety portion of the trial without the sub -study.  The 
pre-randomization phone call or visit occurs 7 to 10 days before the randomization 
visit.  Patients will stop taking/washout of their standard -of-care pain me dications for 
OA during the pre -randomization period.  In the event of inadequate OA pain relief, 
patients may take paracetamol/acetaminophen according to local standard -of-care, 
with a ma ximum daily dose of 2500 mg in Europe and 2600 mg in countries outside 
of Europe. Sub -study patients should discontinue use of paracetamol/acetaminophen 
24 hours prior to the start of the randomization visit (baseline).  
For any patient who had an MRI of a ny joint during screening, confirmation that 
there are no exclusionary findings on MRI must be received from the central reader 
before the patient can be randomized.

CONFIDENTIAL  Treatment Period 1 (starts with day 1 and continues through week 16): The 
initial 16 -week treatment period (treatment period 1) will begin at the randomization 
visit (baseline/day  1) and continue up to the week  16 visit.  All patients will undergo 
baseline assessments at the day  1 visit and will be randomized to receive one of the 
ongoing stu dy drug dose regimens (1 mg Q4W, 1 mg Q8W, or placebo).  Patients 
randomized to 1 mg Q8W will receive alternating placebo injections at the monthly 
visits where active study medication will not be given to maintain the blind.   
During treatment period 1, p atients will be supplied with paracetamol/acetaminophen 
as the study -provided rescue medication.  All patients will record rescue medication 
use in their diaries from the randomization visit through treatment period 1.  All use 
of NSAIDs during treatment p eriod 1, including oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_29899], is 
prohibited (except up to 150  mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA, which is permitted for cardiac 
prophylaxis per local guidelines).  Patients may be withdrawn from the study after 
appropriate counseling if they conti nue to use NSAIDs during treatment period 1.   
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period 1, as 
outlined in Table  1.  Potential events of adjudicated arthropathy will be monitored via 
clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain during the study (eg, using the 
joint pain questionnaire and imaging).  Potential events of sympathetic nervous 
system dysfunction will be  monitored throughout the study through physical 
examination, AE reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension and via the Survey 
of Autonomic Symptoms.   
Efficacy assessments will be performed for patients participating in the sub -study as

 Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W (patients will receive placebo injections at the study visits 
where fasinumab is not administered)  
 Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W  
 Placebo SC Q4W  
Prior to amendment 7 (urgent safety measure), patients were randomized to 6 mg Q8W or 
placebo in the main study (after amendment 3), and to the following tre atment arms in the 
efficacy sub -study (amendment 5):  
 Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W (included in the efficacy sub -study only; patients will

 Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W  
 Fasinumab 3 mg SC Q4W  
 Fasinumab 6 mg SC Q8W (patients will receive placebo injections at the study visits 
where fasinumab is n ot administered)  
 Placebo SC Q4W  
Enrollment into the efficacy sub -study was completed prior to amendment 7.  
All patients previously enrolled into the main study had completed treatment prior to amendment 
7.  Under amendment 7, patients randomized to 3 mg Q4 W or 6 mg Q8W in the efficacy 
sub-study were discontinued from study drug for the remainder of the study.  All patients who 
were discontinued from study drug immediately entered the follow -up period.

paracetamol/acetaminophen may be taken as needed according to local standard -of-care, with a 
maximum daily dose of 2500 mg in Europe and countries with 500 mg tablets/capsules or 
2600  mg in countries outside of Europe wit h 325 mg tablets/capsules.  Sub -study patients should 
discontinue use of paracetamol/acetaminophen 24  hours prior to the start of the randomization 
visit (baseline) and prior to the start of scheduled study visits during treatment period  1 in order 
to mini mize the confounding effects of the rescue medication on efficacy measurements.  
The amount of paracetamol/acetaminophen used in the preceding 24  hours will be reported by 
[CONTACT_689821] (day 1) using the patient diary. All patients w ill record 
rescue medication use starting at the randomization visit. Paracetamol/acetaminophen 
accountability will be conducted at each site visit starting at the week  4 visit. 
Paracetamol/acetaminophen will be sourced by [CONTACT_689822] s ponsor unless 
country -specific regulations and customs require a different approach.  
Patients should be cautioned to avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking 
paracetamol/acetaminophen and to take no more than the maximum daily allowable dose.  For 
additional information regarding rescue medication, please refer to the study pharmacy manual.  
5.2.2.  Paracetamol/Acetaminophen and Non -Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory 
Drugs  - Weeks >16  
Study -provided paracetamol/acetaminophen is the only study -provided rescue t reatment for OA 
pain during treatment period 2, with a maximum daily dose of 2500 mg in Europe and other 
countries where 500 mg strength tablets/capsules are available and 2600 mg in any countries 
outside of Europe where 325 mg strength tablets/capsules ar e available.   
Beginning at week 16, patients may take non -NSAID standard -of-care therapy in addition to 
study drug, in the event of inadequate pain relief for OA pain.  Patients may also use limited -use 
NSAIDs for non -OA related pain or fever after week  16.   
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs will be provided as tablets or capsules.  The daily dose of 
NSAIDs should not exceed the recommended maximum daily dose per the product labeling, and 
their use will be limited to:

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary D iscontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued due to medical need, as determined by [CONTACT_1275]. Study drug will be temporarily withheld while awaiting imaging adjudication for 
worsening joint pain or when routine imaging suggests adjudicated arthropathy and prompts the 
need for additional imaging (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), or for patients who are determined to have 
orthostati c hypotension or determined to have new or worsening symptoms suggestive of 
sympathetic nervous system dysfunction while awaiting evaluation by a specialist 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Study drug should not be re -started until the next study visit unless 
imaging/evaluation results are available within the current visit window.  
5.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
5.4.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and me dication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use for injections performed at the study site.  All injection reactions must be 
reported as AEs (as defined in Section  7.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in 
Section  7.5.[ADDRESS_935771] ions following  injection of study drug SC should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
5.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Under amendment 8  and amendment 9 , patients will be randomized  into the main safety study in 
a 3:3:1 ratio to receive fixed -dose, SC injections of fasinumab at 1 mg Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, or 
placebo.  Patients randomized to 1  mg Q8W will receive alternating placebo injections at the 
monthly visits where active study drug wil l not be given to maintain the blind.  Randomization 
will be performed according to a predetermined central randomization scheme generated by a 
Regeneron Statistician and provided to the study site personnel by [CONTACT_689826] (IVRS).   Randomization in the study is stratified by [CONTACT_25059] K -L score (2 -3, 4) and 
geographic region (such as North America, Latin America, Europe, or Asia/Pacific/South 
Africa).  
There were no patients enrolled into the main safety study under amendment 5 or a mendment 6.  
The patient allocation for the efficacy sub -study for all patients randomized to amendment 5 
global or amendment 6 was 1:1:1:1:1 to 1 mg of fasinumab Q8W, 1  mg of fasinumab Q4W, 
3 mg of fasinumab Q4W, 6 mg of fasinumab Q8W, or matching placebo  Q4W.  Randomization 
was performed according to a predetermined central randomization scheme generated by a 
Regeneron Statistician and provided to the study site personnel by [CONTACT_21926].  Randomization in 
the study was stratified by [CONTACT_25059] K -L score (2 -3, 4) and geographic region (such as North 
America, Latin America, Europe, or Asia/Pacific/South Africa).  For the sub -study, stratification 
was also by [CONTACT_689809] (knee, hip).

in regular contact [CONTACT_689827].   
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used.  In order to 
maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individual s involved in study conduct.   
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) results will not be communicated to the sites before the end of the 
study, and the sponsor operational team will not have access to results associated with patient 
identification until after the final  database lock.   
No study personnel involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access to 
unblinded data before the database is locked for this study.   
5.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a medical emergency 
or any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
 If unblinding  is required:  
 Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
 Only the affected patient will be unblinded.  
 The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient  
 The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or d esignee before unblinding the 
patient, whenever possible  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true em ergency.  In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
5.5.3.  Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting Purposes  
Treatment assignments for certain patients may b e unblinded to Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management personnel for the purpose of regulatory reporting of suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
                                        VV-RIM-00071798-1.0 Approved - 22 Apr 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_935773] lot numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_25006] (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging.  In order to maintai n the blind , these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug (fasinumab and its placebo) will be refrigerated at the site at a temperature of 2°C to 
8°C; refrigerator temperature will be logged daily.  Storage instru ctions for study drug will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.   
5.6.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug (fasinumab and its placebo) will be shipped at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C to the 
investigator or designee at regular intervals or as needed du ring the study.  At specified time 
points during the study (ie,  interim site monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and 
following drug reconciliation and documentation by [CONTACT_25007], all used and unused study 
drug will be destroyed or retur ned to the sponsor or designee.   
5.6.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records for blinded fasinumab and its placebo, and study -provided rescue 
medications must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all used and unused s tudy drug and rescue 
treatments.  These records should contain the dates, quantity, and study drug:  
 dispensed to each patient , 
 returned from each patient  (if applicable), and  
 disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee.  
All accountabilit y records must be made available for inspection by [CONTACT_25008]; photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_24897].  
5.6.4.  Treatment Compliance  
All drug compliance records must be kept current and must be m ade available for inspection by 
[CONTACT_28795].   
5.6.5.  Patient Drug Accountability  
Patients will be asked to bring in their study -provided supplies of paracetamol/acetaminophen to 
each study visit (starting at the week  4 visit thro ugh the week  52 visit), and remaining 
medication will be counted to calculate medication use and compliance.   
Patients will be asked to bring in their study -provided supplies of NSAIDs to each visit starting 
at the week  20 visit until their end of treatme nt visit/early termination visit.  Patients will also be 
instructed to report the daily use of these medications using their diary.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.7. Concomitant Medications  
Any treatment administered from screening until the end of the follow -up period or early 
terminati on is considered concomitant medication.  This includes medications that were started 
prior to the study and are ongoing during the study.  Prior to randomization, all 
paracetamol/acetaminophen will be recorded as a concomitant medication.  Starting from t he 
randomization visit, paracetamol/acetaminophen will be recorded as rescue medication in the 
patient diary.   
5.7.1.  Permitted Therapy  
Patients receiving chronic medication therapy must be on a stable dose of such medication for at 
least the [ADDRESS_935774] 4  weeks prior to the screening visit and 
throughout the planned duration of the patient’s participation in the study.   
Low-dose (up to 150  mg per local guidelines) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA for cardiac prophylaxis is also 
permitted.  Paracetamol/acetaminophen taken acutely for treatment of non -OA pain is also 
permitted.  Paracetamol/acetaminophen taken for non -OA pain relief should be reported as 
concomitant medication.  Other permitted medications are glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and 
rescue treatments (discussed in Section  5.2).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_689794] -NSAID analgesics 
are also permitted.  During treatment period [ADDRESS_935775] labeling.  Muscle relaxants 
such as Skelaxin® (metaxalone) are permitted.  Prohibited muscle relaxants are listed in 
Section  5.7.2 .   
Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture) are 
permitted during the trial provided that patients were on a stable regimen prior to entering into 
the trial and pro vided that they anticipate that they will maintain this regimen during the trial.  
5.7.2.  Prohibited Therapy  
Patients will be required to discontinue all non -study pain medication (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]; except up 
to 150 mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA, which is permitted for c ardiac prophylaxis, per local 
guidelines) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_73409], starting at the pre -randomization phone call/visit.   
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_73409] (including tramadol) are prohibited through week  16. Patients will 
be directed not to take concom itant medications that contain NSAIDs (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], except up 
to 150 mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA, which is permitted for cardiac prophylaxis) during treatment 
period 1. Patients may take non -NSAID standard -of-care therapy (see Section  5.2.2 ) in addition 
to study drug, in the event of inadequate pain relief for OA pain, starting after the week  16 visit 
(see Section  5.2.2 ). Though use of oral NSAIDs should generally be avoided, a limited use is 
allowed for non -OA related pain or fever after week 16. A list of medications containing 
NSAIDs will be p rovided in the study reference manual. The dose of oral NSAIDs may be

1. HIV and/or hepatitis testing will  be performed on a country -by-country basis, according to local guidelines if required by [CONTACT_689828]  
2. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics sub -study.  The sample should be collected at  the baseline visit, but may 
be collected at any subsequent visit during the study.   
3. After the patient has otherwise met study eligibility criteria assessed during the screening period, an MRI must be performed  before the pre -randomization 
phone call for the index and contralateral joint as well as any knee or hip joint that has a baseline K -L score ≥3. Confirmation from the central reader that 
there are no exclusionary findings on the MRI must be received before the patient can be randomized.  
4. At the scree ning visit, the WOMAC pain sub -scale will be evaluated for both knees and both hip joints.   
5. Study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing visit, and will be done after all laboratory samples have  been collected and all study 
assessme nts and procedures are performed.  Patients should be observed in the clinic for approximately 1  hour after administration of study drug for 
evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.2. Study Visit Descriptions  
6.2.1.  Screening Period (Up to 30 days)  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.  After informed consent 
has been obtained, patients may be screened for eligibility.   The screening window is 30  days 
from the time the informed consent has been signed.  If the patient has not met screening 
eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_2671] 30 -day screening window, the patient will be identified as a 
screen failure.  Patients who sc reen fail may rescreen per Section  6.2.2 .  Laboratory assessments 
used to determine eligibility may be repeated during the screening period.  The procedures 
outlined in the schedule of events should be completed during the screening period ( Table  1).   
When applicable, all pain assessments at the screening visits and subsequent visits should be 
completed prior to the physical examination.  The patient reported outcomes assessments should 
be completed prior to all other efficacy assessments.   
After the p atient has otherwise met study eligibility criteria assessed during the screening period, 
an MRI will be performed prior to the pre -randomization phone call/visit for the index and 
contralateral joint and well as any knee or hip joint with a K -L score ≥3. Confirmation from the 
central reader that there are no exclusionary findings on MRI must be received before a patient 
can be randomized.  
6.2.2.  Rescreening  
Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria may rescreen  once  and only after approval of the 
sponsor or designee. Rescreening may occur if it is believed by [CONTACT_689832] a condition that would resolve or could be treated, or a laboratory 
value that minimally exceeded the cut -off value and is not clinically re levant. Patients cannot 
rescreen if they have screen failed due to not meeting the WOMAC criteria or have orthostatic 
hypotension. Rescreening can be completed for patients who fail to meet the screening visit 
window requirements or who are unable to compl ete all imaging assessments within the 
specified screening period. Patients who screen failed under amendment 3, [ADDRESS_935786] re -consent for study participat ion and repeat all screening procedures with the exception of 
imaging assessments.  Any imaging assessments need to be repeated only if they were taken 
more than 60 days from when previous screening X -rays and MRI assessments were completed.

the patient should be withdrawn from study drug and should be asked to return to the clinic for 
all remaining study visits per the visit s chedule (see Section  5.3.2 ).   
The date of the first dose of study drug is designated on day 1.  All subsequent visits should be 
scheduled based on this date.   
6.2.5.  Week 1 through Week 16  
Complete visits and assessments are outlined in the schedule of events ( Table  1 and Table  3).  
For sub -study patients, the patient -reported outcomes should be completed prior to all other 
assessments.  At dosing visits, all study proce dures should be completed before administration of 
study drug.  Patients who discontinue study drug should complete the end of treatment visit per 
the schedule of events and return for the remaining study visits, if possible.  If patients are not 
able to c ontinue study participation, they should return for an early termination visit, per the 
schedule of events.  The amount of paracetamol/acetaminophen used in the preceding 24  hours 
will be reported by [CONTACT_689821] (day 1) using the patient diary.   
If patients proceed into treatment period 2, all patients, including sub -study patients, will 
continue to follow the same schedule of events.

Patients will also be ask ed to submit pre -operative imaging (X -ray and MRI, if available) for 
adjudication. Patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected joint(s). If the 
affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Procedures to be P erformed Only in the Event of a Joint Replacement Surgery  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, he 
or she will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return for a pre -operative visit, and for 
follow -up safety evaluations 4 weeks and 20 weeks after surgery (see Table  5).  
In the event that the pre -operative visit is not performed, standard -of-care pre -operative images 
of the joint with the JR must be obtained and submitted to the central imaging vendor. Imaging 
of all other joints per the pre -operative visit procedures will be done post -operatively at the first 
JR follow -up study visit ([ADDRESS_935794] surgery) if not done before surgery.  
All available medical history/information for patients who undergo JR surgery must be collected, 
including the results of histopathologic examination.   
Full details of these assessments are provided in the study  reference manual.

During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), to the health authorities, IECs/IRBs  as appropriate, and to the 
investigators (in a blinded manner).  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information section of the 
Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be considered as unexpected. Any worsening of 
or new onset of symptoms related to OA that occur during the screening period prior to study 
drug administration will be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report all other SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably 
related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IE Cs/IRB as appropriate.  
7.3. Definitions  
7.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign ( including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in freque ncy and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
7.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear  to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that h ad it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.

7.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patients at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound.  The study monitor will be supported by [CONTACT_31599] (eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data 
Management).  Safety monitoring will be performed on a n ongoing basis (eg, individual review 
of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.   
                                        VV-RIM-00071798-1.0 Approved - 22 Apr 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_935803]  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adjudicated Arthropathy  
Adjudicated arthropathy is an umbrella term that encompasses the following conditions:   
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_73405] 1 and 2  
 Subschondral insufficiency fractures  
 Primary osteonecrosis  
In addition, adjudicated arthropathies will be evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for 
destructive arthropathy.  
Potential events of adjudicated arthr opathy will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of 
worsening joint pain (joint pain questionnaire), AE monitoring, and routine imaging.  
Clinically significant worsening of joint pain during the course of this study is defined as 
worsening of pain  in any joint despi[INVESTIGATOR_689796] (see Section  5.2), which is 
inconsistent with the normal progression of OA and that lasts at least 2  weeks (or less at the 
discretion of the investigator).   
If a patient reports an increase in joint pain, as  described above, then study drug administration 
will be withheld.  Imaging of the affected joint will be performed, as well as any additional 
imaging deemed appropriate to understand the cause of the worsening pain ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
The decision to perform imaging after patient reports of worsening joint pain will be documented 
in the respective CRF page.  Images, along with any other radiographic evaluation, will be 
submitted to the Adjudication Committee for review ( Section  3.4). The investigator may 
consider aspi[INVESTIGATOR_689803].  
If routine imaging suggests one of the forms of adjudicated arthropathy, then study drug 
administration will be withheld. Any additional imaging deemed appropriate will be obtained. 
Images, along wi th any other radiographic evaluation, will be submitted to the Adjudication 
Committee for review (Section  3.4).  
If the adjudication does not confirm  the case as adjudicated arthropathy according to the 
adjudication criteria, study drug may be restarted.  
Patients with findings that suggest adjudicated arthropathy will have their dosing terminated and 
will be referred for orthopedic consultation, and once confirmed by [CONTACT_247664], 
the case must be reported as an AESI ( Section  7.3.3  and Section  7.4.3 ).   
Patients should be encouraged to return to the clinic for remaining study visits. Prior to the 
scheduled JR, the patient should complete the pre -operative study visit and week [ADDRESS_935804]-operative study visits ( Section  6.2.11  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Pre -operative images, along 
with any other radiographic evaluation will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee for 
review ( Section  3.4).  
Details of data collection for adjudication of events will be provided in the adjudication charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Sympathetic Nervous System Dysfunction  
Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored throughout the study through 
physica l examination, AE reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of 
Autonomic Symptoms ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). New onset or worsening of  signs and symptoms of 
autonomic dysfunction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093].  Sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction will only be diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a 
neurologist and/or cardiologist.  
In cases where new or worsening symptoms consistent with sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction are moderate to severe or are clinically significant and do not resolve or return to 
baseline in 2  weeks (or less at the discretion of the investigator), study drug will be wi thheld and 
the patient will be referred to a specialist. If the evaluation by [CONTACT_73489], study drug may be restarted. If the specialist’s 
evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous sy stem dysfunction then study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI (Section  7.4.3 ). 
Orthostatic hypotension may be a manifestation of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. If a 
patient is determined to have orthostatic hypotension, study drug should be withheld and the A E 
should be entered in the eCRF. The following procedures should be followed:  
 If the patient is symptomatic and a clinical explanation for orthostatic hypotension is 
identified (such as a new medication or dehydration due to exercise or illness or 
excessiv e heat exposure), study drug will be withheld, and the patient should return to

[IP_ADDRESS].  Peripheral Sensory Adverse Events  
Altered peripheral sensation (eg, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia) is an important identified risk 
with fasinumab (see Investigator’s Brochure) and other anti -NGF compounds. Any peripheral 
sensory AE that, per t he investigator’s judgment, requires a neurology or other specialty 
consultation must be reported as an AESI. If any peripheral sensory event persists for [ADDRESS_935806] be 
reported as an AESI (Section  7.4.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Joint Replacement Surgery  
An end of study phone contact [CONTACT_689841] [ADDRESS_935807] undergone or are scheduled for JR surgery as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Any elective JR surgery planned before completion of the ICF 
would be part of the exclusion criteria and would not be considered an AE.  
After signing of the ICF, report JR surgery as an AESI  if the JR surgery is an elective event that 
is not associated with a new/worsening AE.  
Do not report JR surgery as an AE/AESI if the JR surgery is for the treatment of a new or 
worsening AE. In this case, the new or worsening AE should be the reported AE/ AESI term.  
7.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron or its designee will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well 
as in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the 
relevant requirem ents for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the 
medicin al/investigational product).

9.1. Statistical Hypothesis for the Sub -Study Population  
The primary treatment comparison for the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores 
is declared superior only if the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical 
function subscale scores.  Hence, there are 6 hypotheses t o be tested between the primary and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints.  A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the 
overall type I error rate at 0.05 for the 2 co -primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints 
across t he 2 dose regimens.  Th e hierarchical testing order will be detailed in the SAP.  The 
hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H11:  There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in 
WOMAC pain or physical function subscale scores at week 16 versus there is 
treatmen t difference in WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores at 
week  16 
 H12:  There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 16 versus there is treatment difference in 
Patient Global A ssessment score  at week 16  
 H13:  There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in 
the proportion of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale 
scores at week 16 versus there is treatment difference in proportion of patients with 
≥30% improvement in WOMAC pain at week 16  
 H21:  There is no treatment  difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q8W and placebo in 
WOMAC pain or physical function subscale scores at week 16 versus there is 
treatment difference in WOMAC pain and physi cal function subscale scores at 
week  16 
 H22:  There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q8W and placebo in 
Patient Global Assessment  score at week 16 versus there is treatment difference in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 16  
 H23:  The re is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q8W and placebo in 
the proportion of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale 
scores at week 16 versus there is treatment difference in proportion of patients with

will be provided in the SAP.   
9.5.2.  Efficacy Analyses for the Sub -Study Population  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy variab les will be analyzed using a multiple imputation approach with 
mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on the FAS with adjustment for 
missing data due to treatment discontinuation for the reasons of lack of efficacy or AEs assuming 
the WOMAC s cores would on average return to baseline values.  The missing data for patients 
who discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy or AEs will be imputed with values centered 
at the mean baseline value of the treatment group that patients were randomized to.  Missing data 
will be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets.  Each imputed data set will be 
analyzed using the MMRM with terms for baseline score corresponding to the primary efficacy 
variable (eg, WOMAC pain subscale score at baseline for  the analysis of change from baseline in 
WOMAC pain subscale score), treatment, randomization strata, visit, and treatment -by-visit 
interaction.  The MMRM will be performed using the MIXED procedure in the Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS) with an unstruct ured covariance matrix to model the within -patient 
errors.  Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward -Roger’s 
approximation.  The results from the 50 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae 
(PROC MIANALYZE).  The least -squares  means estimates for the mean change from baseline 
to week  16, as well as the difference of the estimates between fasinumab and placebo, with the 
corresponding standard error, p -value and associated 95% confidence interval will be provided.  
Hypothesis tes ting will be performed as specified in Section  9.1 to control for multiplicity.  Data 
collected after discontinuing treatment up to week 16 will not be used in the primary efficacy 
analysis, but used in a treatment policy sensitivity analysis  
Additional sensitivity analysis using tippi[INVESTIGATOR_689804] -at-random 
(MNAR).  Multiple imputation will be based on monotone missing data structure of the change 
from baseline score using regression option in PROC MI.  Monotone missing data structure will 
be achieved using MCMC option of PROC MI.  After each imputation, a fasinumab patient's 
imputed data will subtract k (e.g., 20%, 40%, 100%, …) times the treatment effect at each 
corresponding time po int.  By [CONTACT_689842] k, the sensitivity analysis will 
explore the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], ie, the upper bound on the critical value of coefficient k at which 
conclusion from the primary analysis will be overturned (p>0.05).  Additional sens itivity 
analyses will be performed the same way for the primary and selected secondary endpoints using 
the PPS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For analysis of continuous variables in secondary endpoints, the analysis method is the same as 
for the primary vari ables. For analysis of categorical variables in secondary endpoints (if 
identified later), the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel approach stratified by [CONTACT_689843] -response.

Page 1 Study 003: Extension of Study 002, carbidopa-levodopa in neovascular AMD 
Study Design: Prospective, open-label, fixed dose  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_108401] W. Snyder, MD, PhD  Protocol Version 1 Date: June 24, 2017 IND Number: 132078 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT 03197493  Overview of extension study: If a patient completes Study [ADDRESS_328119] of care, as in 
protocol 002, with the same criteria for injections. Measurements and procedures at each visit will be the same as in protocol 0 02. This will allow evaluation of the safety of carbidopa-
levodopa over an entire year of treatment.         
Study 00 3 Protocol  
Version 4 June 24, 2017 
Page 2 Objectives:  
1. To determine whether L- DOPA- carbidopa supplementation can improve visual function, 
within 12 months, in patients with choroidal neovascular AMD (nAMD) , by [CONTACT_269575]- corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ). 
2. To determine whether L- DOPA-carbidopa supplementation in daily doses, 
approximating those used in Parkinson’s disease, is well tolerated for 12 months in our 
target group of patients with nAMD in one eye.  
3. To determine whether L- DOPA-carbidopa supplementation can improve the anatomic 
findings on optical coherence tomography ( OCT ), within  a total of  [ADDRESS_328120] of carbidopa-levodopa on anti- VEGF injections.

Treatments:   
Study 00 3 Protocol  
Version 4 June 24, 2017 
Page 4 Patients will receive open label carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg one tablet TID , in the morning, 
with supper and at bedtime for 9 months, or two tablets TID , in the morning, with supper and at 
bedtime for 9 months (300- 600 mg of levodopa daily). This is the regimen the patient was taking 
at the end of protocol 002. If the patient was able to complete protocol 002 without a serious 
adverse event, but had bothersome symptoms in protocol 002, he or she will receive the intermediate dose (carbidopa-levodopa 25-100, 1 tablet TID) in the extension. Each patient will be evaluated at monthly (25-35 day) intervals and in conjunction be evaluated by [CONTACT_269576] -VEGF injection, based on 
clinical practice standard of care.  
What are the risks of taking  carbidopa -levodopa? 
• Body as a whole: chest pain, feeling weak and fatigued. 
• Cardiovascular: irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, low blood pressure immediately 
upon standing, high blood pressure, fainting, vein inflammation and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. 
• Gastrointestinal: dark saliva, ulcers, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, heartburn, dry mouth, altered taste and gastrointestinal bleeding. 
• Hematologic: anemia, low white blood cells, low platelets.  
• Hypersensitivity: skin rash, itching, face or throat swelling. 
• Musculoskeletal: back pain, shoulder pain, muscle pain. 
• Nervous system/Psychiatric: delusions, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, dizziness, 
• sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], abnormal dreams, insomnia, abnormal sensations, headache, depression, abnormal movements, mental difficulties, urge to gamble, increased sexual desire, problems with impulse control. 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: shortness of breath, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].

• Urogenital: urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, dark urine. 
Dealing with Adverse Events:  
Study Participants will be asked about any adverse events at each visit, and asked to tell the study doctor or study staff right away if they have any side effects, or if they have any other problems with their health or the way they feel during the study, regardless of whether or not they think these problems are related to the study drug. The answers will be recorded in the source documents. For minor and easily tolerated events, the participants will continue in the study, unless they request to be withdrawn from the study. For serious or poorly tolerated events, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.  Appropriate medical care will be instituted for any serious adverse events. Number of subjects:  52 completed 
Duration:  Up to 9 months of treatment.   
Measurements and Activities:  
• Written informed consent at Visit 1.  
• Ophthalmic history and comprehensive eye examination; including visual acuity, with 
current refraction, using an EDTRS chart, in each of both eyes separately, and 
ophthalmoscopic examination, and SD- OCT.   
• Repeat assessment of visual acuity using an EDTRS chart, ophthalmoscopic examination, and SD- OCT at monthly visits.  
• Subjective Vision Questionnaire at monthly visits.  
• Demographics obtained at Baseline in Study 002 or Study 001. 
•Medical History, Vital Signs and Physical Examination at Baseline in Study 002 or Study
001.
•ECG, CBC, Chem 20 and HbA 1C at Baseline in Study 002 or Study 001.
•Dispense study medication at monthly visits.
•Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269573]
•Non-directed assessment of adverse events at each visit, including classification as to
severity, seriousness and body system.
•Concomitant medications at each visit.
•If a patient had the baseline evaluation in Study 001, that will be used as the baselineevaluation for this study. If the patient entered directly into Study 002, that will be usedas the baseline evaluation for this study.
Criteria f or repeat  anti-VEGF i njections:  
This will be based on monthly evaluation of: BCVA (decrease of 5 letters from previous visit); 
increased macular thickness (compared to normal and previous visit as measured by [CONTACT_66309]- OCT; 
new blood (hemorrhage) on direct retinal examination; or subjective decrease in vision. If any of 
these c riteria a re me t, or if, in the  opi[INVESTIGATOR_269574] S pecialist, the  patient requires a nti-
VEGF therapy, the patient will have an anti-VEGF injection administered. If none of these 
criteria are met at monthly visits with patient agreement, an anti-V EGF  injection will not be 
performed, and the patient will be reevaluated. 
Result sharing with subjects:  
After the conclusion of the study, patients will be notified of the results, regarding safety, 
tolerability and vision-related outcomes.

TITLE Randomized Study of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_672695]  1:1000 dilute hypochlorite  solution (0.005%) administered to the 
skin prior to daily radiation therapy  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S)  The primary objective is to determine whether prophylactic 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_672696] E  radiation dermatitis as scored on the Stanford 
Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS)   
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVE(S)  Secondary objectives are: 
- To determine whether this agent delays th e time to 
development of Grade E radiation dermatitis  
- To determine whether this agent improves quality -of-life 
and pain scores associated with radiation dermatitis  
TREATMENT SUMMARY  Eligible patients will be randomized to daily application of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_672697] [ADDRESS_909211] of care.  Patients will complete the 
Modified Brief Pain In ventory at study entry, at 40-50 Gy 
through the radiation treatment course,  at the end of  radiation 
treatment, and  at the follow-up visit 3-12 weeks after radiation 
treatment.  
SAMPLE SIZE  170 Patients (85 patients per arm)  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  Sample Size Calculation: From prior clinical experience, we 
anticipate that 8 0% of patients will experience Grade E  radiation 
dermatitis  with standard skin care. In order to d etect a 20 % 
reduction in patients with Grade E  dermatitis (80% vs 60 % in 
those treated with dilute hypochlorite solution)  with a two -sided 
alpha of 0.05 a nd beta of 80% , 170 patients  will be enrol led.  
 
Primary endpoint: The proportion of patients in each arm  who 
develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (as defined by [CONTACT_672710]) during a course of 
radiation therapy will be assessed using a multiple logistic 
regression mode l adjusting for type of chemotherapy (c isplatin, 
cetuximab, non e). 
 
Secondary endpoints : Time to development of Grade E  radiation 
dermatitis in each arm will be assessed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model a djusting for type of chemotherapy . 
QOL/Pain scores will be analyzed using a repeated measures 
model adjusting for type of chemotherapy .

1.1. Primary Objective   
The primary objective is to determine the proportion of  patients who develop Grade E radiation 
dermatitis (as defined by [CONTACT_672711], See APPENDIX B) as an 
adverse effect of radiation therapy or chemo radiation therapy for a head and neck cancer when 
initiating the use  of prophylactic  HOCl at the start of therapy  (experimental arm)  compared to placebo 
(control arm).  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives include the time to development of Grade E radiation dermatitis and the 
quality-of-life and pain levels (as assessed by [CONTACT_672712]) in the control arm 
versus the experimental arm.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
 Radiotherapy is often used in combination with surgery and systemic therap y for the treatment of 
various malignancies . [1]. Although t echnological advances have allowed  for more precision and 
accuracy in targeting malignant tissues, normal tissues unavoidably  receive some radiation dose. For 
example, the skin overlying the target area receives incidental radiation , and up to 95% of patients can 
develop an acute reaction called radiation dermatitis  [2, 3].  Radiation dermatitis develops when the 
skin is unable to repair itself in a timely manner upon repeated exposures to radiation [3-5]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_672699], aloe vera, or corticosteroids can offer some relief of pain and irritation , 
however several randomized trials have demonstrated that they unfortunately do not prevent the onset 
of radiation dermatitis [1, 6-12]. For moderate -to-severe cases of radiation dermatitis, a break in the 
radiation treatment regimen is often required to allow time for the skin to heal. In addition to skin 
irritation and breakdown, patients can also experience significant pain and discomf ort during this time . 
The only agent that  has been shown in a randomized trial to significantly reduce the severity of skin 
reactions is a silicone dressing ( Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_672700] ) [8]. While this was shown to reduce the incidence of 
moist desquamation in women undergoing radiotherapy treatments for breast cancer, it can cost up to 
$85 for a package of 10 dress ings, making this type of treatment unaffordable for many patients  [13]. 
Thus, significant improvements in the treatment  of radiation dermatitis , a common sid e effect of 
radiation treatment,  are needed . 
 
 For patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, chemoradiation has become standard of 
care [14-19]. Cisplatin is the standard agent for concurrent  therapy; however, cetuximab, a molecular 
inhibitor of EGFR , is used as an alternative [20]. The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiation 
treatment has resu lted in increased rates of Grade 3-4 radiation dermatitis  ranging from 2-35% 
compared to 4-21% with radiation alone [14-20]. In addition, cetuximab is notorious for  its significant 
skin toxicity and may potentiate radiation derma titis as well with Grade 3 -4 toxicity affecting 16 -60% 
of patients undergoing concurrent  treatment with radiation [21-23].  
 
 Radiation dermatitis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_672701]. A severity of Gra de [ADDRESS_909213] desquamation in the head and neck region causes 
significant morbidity for patients: pain at the nec k leading patients to alter their clothing at the neck 
line, inability to shower, lack of restful sleep, discomfort while eating, and feeling self -conscious when 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_909214] desquamation (regardless of Grade 2 or Grade 3 
scoring by [CONTACT_3989]) is dilute hypochlorite applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_672702]. In 
this context, this treatment is given primarily for its antimicrobial properties.  
  
 Recently, Leung et al discovered a nother potential mechanism of action for dilute hypochlorite 
baths [9]. HOCl functions as an oxidant and can disrupt cellular signaling processes by [CONTACT_672713] [24]. Nuclear f actor-κB (NF-κB) is a protein complex that plays a central role in 
many different processes, including inflammation, aging, skin development, and radiation response 
[24]. Radiation injury activa tes NF-κB, which drives the cellular responses that can ultimately lead to 
radiation dermatitis [25, 26]. NF-κB plays a role in normal skin homeostasis as well [12 -17]. NF-κB is 
also influenced b y intracellular reduction -oxidation (redox) conditions [27]. NF-κB’s role in skin 
homeostasis and radiation injury suggests that it will be an attractive target for the treat ment of 
radiation dermatitis. Because NF -κB is a master regulator of inflammation, we hypothesize that dilute 
hypochlorite baths may function as an anti -inflammatory agent by [CONTACT_672714] -κB signaling and 
inflammatory responses in the skin [24]. 
   
 Leung et al found that HOCl inhibits intracellular NF -κB signaling by [CONTACT_672715] .  In the skin of mice, a 
single brief exposure to topi[INVESTIGATOR_672703]-κB signaling . An established mouse 
model of radiation dermatitis was then used to assess whether hypochlorite could ameliorate acute 
radiation dermatitis.  Radiation de rmatitis was reproducibly induced on the backs of 4 -week-old 
C57BL/6 female mice with 6 Gy irradiation for 10 days. Mice were randomized to receive a 30 -minute 
bath in water (control) or dilute HOCl prior to each exposure to ionizing irradiation.  Skin was  
examined daily and assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria, which grades 
skin ulceration as the highest score (grade 4). Skin ulceration is defined as round excavations that 
result in the complete loss of epi[INVESTIGATOR_672704].  Compared to the control 
group, HOCl treated animals had a significantly lower RTOG score with scores of 1.8 ± 0.24 and 4.0 ± 
0 with and without HOCl treatment, respectively, by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  While all control animals developed skin 
ulceration  by [CONTACT_4475] 20, none of the HOCl -treated animals developed skin ulceration even by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  
Histological analysis of skin biopsies taken on day 14 revealed that the skin of irradiated control 
animals exhibited classical signs of radiation dermatitis, including a lichenoid infiltrate, loss of skin 
appendages, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915]/dermal swelling. In contrast, the skin of HOCl -treated animals was largely 
normal, with retention of skin appendages and a mild increase in dermal cellularity . Finally, irradiation 
of mice skin induced the expression of five well -established NF -κB–dependent genes, and HOCl 
exposure significantly diminished this response .  From clinical, histological, and molecular 
perspectives, it appeared  that dilute bleach baths attenuated acute radiation derma titis in mice.  
 
 HOCl is a safe, well -characterized, inexpensive, and widely available topi[INVESTIGATOR_168842].  The rationale 
for the starting regimen  of this study  is based on the methods from the prior mouse work  and prior 
published human studies . At dilute concen trations, hypochlorite is safe for human skin contact [CONTACT_672716] a prior clinical trial using the same concentration [ 18].  Hypochlorite is  stable under 
normal use and storage conditions  [28]. It is a strong oxidizing agent and does react with household 
chemicals such as toilet bowl cleaners, rust removers, vinegar, acids, and ammonia containing products 
Protocol Version 6 10  to produce hazardous gases, such as chlorine and other chlorinated species  [28]. Encounters with such 
products is not planned nor anticipated  for this study.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_909215] of care, simulation for radiation 
treatment and the treatment planning process will be performed over two weeks. Patients can be 
consented prior to or within 3 days following the start of radiation treatment. After consent, a baseline 
clinical skin assessment will be performed, and patients will be  stratified by [CONTACT_672717] 
(cisplatin, cetuximab, or none)  randomized to the control arm or the experimental arm. Randomization 
will be performed by [CONTACT_672718]. The experimental  arm will apply daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_672705] e HOCl for 10 minutes within 3 hours 
prior to radia tion treatment. The control  arm will apply daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_6842] ( water) for [ADDRESS_909216] desquamation 
within the radiation treatment field,  requiring treatment (not prophylaxis) with topi[INVESTIGATOR_672706], the 
patient will have met the endpo int of the study, and the patient will be switched to standard -of-care 
treatment for radiation dermatitis consisting of topic al dilute HOCl applied  daily. For pat ients who do 
not develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis during the radiation treatment course, a  final skin assessment 
will be performed +/- [ADDRESS_909217] day of the radiation treatment course  +/- 10 days, and at 
the follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after the completion of the radiation treatment c ourse. 
 
There is currently no external sponsorship or funding for this protocol.  
 
2.3.1 Modified Brief Pain Inventory  
Patients with moderate -severe radiation dermatitis often experience significant pain and discomfort 
until the skin heals, which can sometimes take up to 2 -3 weeks. In order to assess patient reported 
levels of pain, patients will be asked to complete the Modified Brief Pain Inventory ( MBPI) at the time 
of randomization , at 40-[ADDRESS_909218] day of radiation treatment  +/- [ADDRESS_909219] follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after completion of the radiation treatment course . The MBPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_672707]. There are seven pain severity items and seven pain interference items rated on a 0 -10 
Likert scale. It will take approximately 5 minute s to complete (ref; Appendix  D).

4. TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Description of Treatment Plan  
 
Patients will be screened for study eligibility by [CONTACT_672719].  If eligible and willing to participate, patients will sign informed consent 
and be enrolled in the study.   
 
Baseline 
 
 Patients will undergo a clinical skin assessment by [CONTACT_1963]. Patients will also 
complete the MBPI , and photograph s will be taken of the neck to represent their baseline  skin. Patients 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_672720] .   
 
During Radiation Therapy  
 
Prior to each radiation treatment, the study agent or placebo  (depending on randomization arm) will be 
applied to the  area of the skin to be irradiated  for 10 minutes  within 3 hours of the patient’s daily 
scheduled radiotherapy treatment . A nurse or qualified research member will instruct the patient on its 
application on the day of trial consent . After this initial instruction , the patient will self -apply the 
solution t o their skin prior to treatment when he/she arrives  to the radiation treatment area. There  are 
clinic rooms  that the patient can utilize to self -apply the solution prior to their daily radiation 
treatment. A nurse or qualified research member will check in with the p atient once per week and

A clinical skin assessment by [CONTACT_672721] +/ - [ADDRESS_909223] Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System and 
the CTCAE Scoring System. Photographs  will also be taken  at 40-50 Gy of radiation treatment and at 
the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days. 
 
Patients will also complete the Modified Brief Pain Inventory at the time of randomization, at 40 -50 
Gy of radiation treatment, at the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days, and at the follow -up visit 3-12 
weeks after the completion of the radiation treatment course.  
 
Follow Up  
 
During the patient’s follow up appointment  3-[ADDRESS_909224] skin care as recommended by [CONTACT_24018].  
 
4.3 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from the study if the patient experiences a severe allergic reaction in the 
treatment area  and/or there is a significant worsening of dermatitis according to clinical assessment at 
the patient’s current radiotherapy dose . If the patient is removed from the study, they will no lo nger 
receive the study  agent concurrently with their radiotherapy, however, they may continue to undergo 
radiotherapy per standard of care and clinical assessment . 
 
4.4 Alternatives  
This study is optional. The alternative is to not participate in the study and receive standar d radiation 
therapy without the study  treatment .  
 
5. STUDY AGENT INFORMATION  
 
5.1  Study Agent  
The study  agent is hypochlorite (HOCl) at a concentration of 0.0 051%, otherwise known as modified 
Dakin’s solution . Clorox bleach will be diluted to attain this concentration.  
 
5.2 Availability  
The dilute HOCl  solution will be provided to the patient.  
 
5.3 Agent Ac countability  
The dilute HOCl  solution will be stored in a locked cabinet in the Cancer Center.  
Protocol Version 6 13   
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
There will be no d ose modifications during this study.  Patients will be removed from the study  if they 
experience  a significant worsening of dermatitis according to clinical assessment at the patie nt’s 
current radiotherapy dose.  The study  agent will be discontinued and they will continue with 
radiotherapy alone  and standard of care management for radiation dermatitis . 
  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND  REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Potential risk s associated with dilute HOCl are skin itching and skin irritation.  Prior human clinical 
trials demonstrated no significant risk of dilute 0.0 05% hypochlorite.  One patient had itching and m ild 
skin irritation.  Because we are diluting the hypochlorite, we do not have significant concern for using 
concentrations that are too high.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_909225] Radiation Dermatitis Scoring 
System.  Both Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation 
and listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will 
assess each Adverse Event (AE) to dete rmine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed 
Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until [ADDRESS_909226] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by [CONTACT_90398], events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB 
using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for deaths or life -
threatening experiences.

In addition to standard management, all patients enrolled on this study will be required to have photos 
of the neck taken at four time po ints: at the time of randomization, at 40 -50 Gy of radiation treatment, 
at the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days, and at the follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after completion of 
radiation treatment. To ensure consistency, photos will be taken with standardi zed equipment.  
 
10.2 Inter -Rater Reliability  
 
Patients enrolled on this study will be treated by [CONTACT_672723]. Inter -rater 
reliability will be established by a run -in training session. Prior to opening the study for accrual, these 
physicians will undergo a training session for the grading of radiation dermatitis. The training session 
will involve the physicians’ review of [ADDRESS_909228].  
 
If the kappa statistic of 0.8 is not met, a jurisdiction will be held every three months during the accrual 
of the trial. The jurisdiction will involve both physicians reviewing every photo of every patient 
enrolled since the previous jurisdiction (or start of the trial in case of the first jurisdiction). For the 
photos on which there is disagreement, the physicians will meet to discuss and come to a consensus 
grade for each photo. The consensus grade will be recorded as the final grade for that photo.

11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the 
study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_241689] (SRC).  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_14226].  
The Protocol Direc tor will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating 
investigators.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_909231] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the monitoring 
entity for this study. The DS MC will audit study -related activities to determine whether the study has 
been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the following type s of documents 
participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source 
documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and protocol 
deviations associated with the research to ensu re the protection of human subjects.  Results of the 
DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of 
continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Randomization Method  
Block randomization will be used to stratify by  [CONTACT_672717]: cisplatin, cetuximab, no 
chemotherapy . 
 
12.2 Sample Size J ustification  
The primary endpoint is the proportion  of patients who develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (a s 
defined by [CONTACT_672711]) in each arm during a course of radiation 
therapy. From prior clinical e xperience, we anticipate that 80 % of patients will experience Grade E  
radiation dermatitis with standard sk in care. In ord er to detect a 20 % reduction in patients with Grade 
E radiation dermatitis (80% vs 60 % in those treated with dilute hypochlorite solution) with Type I

12.3 Primary A nalysis 
The primary endpoint is the proportion  of patients who develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (as 
defined by [CONTACT_672711]) in each arm during a course of radiation 
therapy. A multiple logistic regression model w ill be used controlling for type of chemothera py 
(cisplatin, cetuximab, none).  
 
12.[ADDRESS_909232] for type of chemotherapy and other patient characteristics 
should they prove to be significant.  
 
12.5  Accrual E stimates   
We estimate that approximately 2  patients with head and neck cancer start radiation therapy in a given 
week in our department. Assuming that 2/3 of these patients would be eligible for this study and would 
provide consent  with a 10% attrition rate , we estimate that this study will comple te accrual of 170 
patients in 142 weeks (or 36  months).

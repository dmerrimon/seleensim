Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. in both men and 
women. Although biological sex is an important determinant of CVD pathophysiology, a major knowledge gap remains regarding sex differences in CVD prevention and treatmen t. A key early event in CVD development is endothelial dysfunction, 
characterized by [CONTACT_145298] -mediated dilation (FMD). Aging progressively impairs 
endothelial function which independently predicts CVD progression and events. Therefore, strategies to optimize endothelial function in aging are clinically important. Regular aerobic exercise ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in healthy older men, but the data in healthy postmenopausal women are inconsistent with many studies showing no effect. The mechanisms underlying these sex disparities are unknown. Higher intensity exercise is thought to be required for chronic endothelial adaptations in postmenopausal women, but this has not been investigated. We have developed a novel exercise strategy by [CONTACT_403593]- intensity interval training (HIIT) on a non-
weight -bearing all -extremity (NWA) ergometer. We have demonstrated that our 
innovative NWA -HIIT is feasible and safe in older adults. The primary objective of this 
study  is to examine sex differences in acute and chronic endothelial responses to NWA -
HIIT in older men vs. postmenopausal women. Our overarching hypothesis is that acute and chronic endothelial responsiveness to aerobic exercise is influenced by [CONTACT_403594].  
4. Background  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. in both men and women. Although biological sex is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of CVD development, progression and outcomes, a major gap remains regarding sex differences in CVD pathophysiology, prevention and treatment. A key early event in CVD development is endothelial dysfunction, characterized by [CONTACT_403595] -mediated 
dilation (FMD)
1, 2. In women, the onset of endothelial dysfunction begins a decade later 
than in men, but the rate of decline is steeper3. Aging progressively impairs endothelial 
function which independently predicts CVD progression and events4. Therefore, 
strategies to optimize endothelial function in aging are clinically important but should account for the potential impact of sex.
 
Aerobic exercise is often prescribed to reduce CVD risks; however, controversy exists regarding the optimal exercise prescription for preserving or restoring endothelial function in older adults. Moderate- intensity aerobic exercise ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in 
older men, but the data in postmenopausal women are inconsistent, with most studies showing no effect (reviewed in Seals et al
5). The mechanisms underlying these sex 
disparities in healthy aging are unknown. A recently introduced theory of exercise- induced 
hormesis proposes that an acute exercise bout that generates an optimal level of stress can stimulate adaptations to increase resistance against subsequent stressors; if the exercise -induced stress does not reach this threshold, then adaptation will not occur. 
Consistent with this theory, higher exercise intensity is thought to be required to induce chronic endothelial adaptations in postmenopausal women, but this has not been

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   investigated. High intensity interval training (HIIT) is receiving considerable attention as 
an innovative strategy for cardiac rehabilitation, but data in sedentary aging are limited 6, 
7. HIIT involves short periods of vigorous exercise, mainly “uphill” treadmill walking, 
interspersed by [CONTACT_403596]- intensity exercise. However, weight -bearing HIIT is 
often problematic in older adults due to musculoskeletal issues. We have recently 
developed a novel alternative by [CONTACT_403597] a non -weight -bearing all -extremity 
(NWA) ergometer; our innovative NWA -HIIT allows compensation for lower extremity 
weakness/fatigue.  We have established in sedentary older adults that NWA -HIIT is 
feasible, well- tolerated and safe8. Our preliminary data suggest that 8- week NWA -HIIT 
improves endothelial function in older men, but not in postmenopausal women. Our preliminary studies also indicate substantial sex differences in acute endothelial responsiveness to HIIT; there is a trans ient attenuation in endothelial function in older 
men following an acute bout of HIIT, but this is absent in postmenopausal women. We postulate that in men, NWA -HIIT presents an optimal challenge to endothelial 
homeostasis thereby [CONTACT_403598]; in  contrast, the stimulus is 
inadequate for chronic adaptations in postmenopausal women.  Accordingly, acute 
responses to exercise may provide keys to understanding sex -related differences in long-
term endothelial adaptive responses to exercis e. 
Our overarching hypothesis is that acute and chronic endothelial responsiveness to aerobic exercise is influenced by [CONTACT_403599] . Our experimental 
model of acute and chronic responses to NWA -HIIT presents a unique tool to test this 
hypothesis and explore the underlying mechanisms  in healthy sedentary older adults . Our 
translational approach will examine, for the first time, sex differences in endothelial responses to exercise at multiple levels spanning from the molecular and cellular to the organism level. Identifying the defective adaptive pathways in women may lead to novel therapeutic targets.  
 
5. Specific Aims  
1. To study sex differences in chronic endothelial adaptations to aerobic exercise  
2. To study sex differences in acute endothelial responses to aerobic exercise and if acute 
endothelial responses are predictive of chronic endothelial adaptations .

Study Procedures for Aims 1 and 2  
• Medical history.  Subjects  will complete a medical history form.  
• Physical exam.  A clinician on our team will perform a physical examination. This will 
consist of review of medical history and check of general physical condition including examination of the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, nerves, muscles, joints and skin. The Allen test which evaluates blood circulation to the hands will be performed to screen out subjects for whom intra- arterial cannulation is contraindicated.  
• 24-hour questionnaire.  We wi
 ll ask questions regarding sleep, food, drink, tobacco, 
alcohol, caffeine and medication intake and physical activity over the last 24 hours. We will also ask if subjects are experiencing any health problems (e.g., sore throat, 
head cold, upset stomach, etc.).  
• Height.  We wi
 ll measure height using a ruler attached to a wall.  
• Weight.  We will measure body weight using an electronic scale.  
• Heart rhythm.  We will record heart rhythm.  
• Blood pressure.  We will measure blood pressure with a cuff around the  ankles. We 
will also measure blood pressure with a cuff around the  upper arms.  
• Body composition and circumferences.  We wil l measure waist and hip circumferences 
using a tape measure. We will also measure body composition including body fat and 
fat free weight , as well as bone density, using a non- invasive dual -energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scan as we have previously published8. This test requires that 
subjects  lie very still on a padded table that gives off low -level X-ray radiation. The 
“arm” of the machine will slowly pass over the  body to make the measures. This should 
take less than [ADDRESS_509026]. Carl Pepi[INVESTIGATOR_403585] .

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   o To investigate the chronic effects of exercise on body composition and 
circumferences, these tests will be performed: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Physical activity habits.  We wi
 ll ask questions regarding how hard, how often and for 
how long subjects perform a variety of physical activities. We will also ask subjects  to 
wear an activity monitor over their hip for 4 days to track their  activity.  
o These measures will be performed: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lif
estyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Dietary habits.  We w ill ask questions regarding what subjects ate and drank on the 
previous day.  
o This information will be collected: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lif
estyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Quality of life questionnaire.  We will a sk questions about perceptions of health and 
ability to perform daily activities.  
o This information will be collected: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lif
estyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Maximal exercise test on treadmill.  An inc remental maximal exercise test will be used 
to measure maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max) on the treadmill and screen out 
subjects with cardiovascular problems as we have previously published 8. ECG and 
blood pressure responses will be monitored by [CONTACT_403600] s  and 
oversight will be provided by [CONTACT_403601] ([CONTACT_403621][INVESTIGATOR_050]). VO 2max will be 
measured using open- circuit spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]8. To measure oxygen consumption, subjects 
will breathe through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_403586] a nose clip. The treadmill will begin slowly and the speed (pace) will gradually increase based on their walking ability and 
their heart rate. Upon completion of a 6- min warmup, the speed will remain the same 
while the treadmill will slightly tilt every [ADDRESS_509027] of going up a small hill until they  reach their maximal exercise capacity (usually 12 to 15 min excluding 
the warm -up period). At certain times during the test, we will ask them to point to a 
scale which tells us how hard they  feel they are working. If they  have a problem 
walking on the treadmill they may perform the test on a stationary bicycle.  If any 
abnormalities occur during the test, they  will be referred to their primary care physician 
for further testing.  
• Maximal exercise test on all -extr
 emity cycle.  This test will measure the  maximal ability 
to perform all -extremity cycling. H eart rhythm, blood pressure and oxygen 
consumption will be measured throughout the test as described above. Subjects  will 
complete a 6- min warmup by [CONTACT_403602] -extremity cycling at a moderate pace. 
Upon completion of the warmup, the pace will gradually increase every 2 min until they reach their  maximal exercise capacity (usually about 12 to 15 min excluding the 
warmup). Prior to t his visit they will be given an opportunity to practice all -extremity 
cycling and breathing through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].

and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• 6- min walk test.  The p urpose of this test is to assess the ability to walk for [ADDRESS_509029]’s  pace, walking back and forth between [ADDRESS_509030] will be perfor
med: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 
weeks of exercise training.  
• Blood vessel tests . Our  primary outcome is brachial artery FMD, an established non-
invasive measure of endothelial function10. FMD will be determined via 
ultrasonography as we have previously described11, [ADDRESS_509031] data will be coded to 
ensure blinding during data analysis.  
o To investigate the chronic effects of exercise on blood vessel function, these tests will be performed: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
o To investigate the acute effects of HIIT on blood vessel function, these tests will be performed: 1) at rest; 2) at the end of a HIIT session; 3) after 1- hour 
recovery; and 4) after 24- hours recovery.  To examine how chronic exercise 
training affects the acute responses of exercise, these tests will be performed at the beginning and end of the 8 weeks of exercise training.  
o To investigate the acute effects of maximal exercise on blood vessel function, these tests will be performed: 1) at rest; 2) at the end of the maximal exercise test on treadmill (described above); 3) at the end of the maximal exercise test on all -extremity cycle (described above); and after 1- hour recovery. To 
examine how chronic all -extremity exercise training affects the ac ute 
responses to maximal exercise test on all extremity cycle, these tests will be performed at the beginning and end of the 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Nitroglycerin test . Endothel
 ium-independent dilation, a measure of vascular smooth 
muscle responsiveness to a nitric oxide donor (0.4 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablet ; 
an FDA approved drug which causes blood vessels to relax)  will be determined as we 
have previously described 15. Brachial artery images will be recorded using 
ultrasonography before nitroglycerin administration and for up to [ADDRESS_509032] will be performed: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   • Blood draw . The amount of blood drawn over study participation ( 6-7 months ) will total 
25 TBSP, which is less than a whole blood donation which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731].  Subjects 
will be informed not to donate blood during study participation or within 2 months of 
completion.  
o To perform general blood tests including comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel , ins 
ulin and blood cell count with differential,  a TBSP of blood will be 
collected: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
o To investigate the chronic effects of HIIT, 2 TBSP of blood will be collected to measure circulating markers of oxidative stress and infl ammation and 
endothelial function, vasoconstrictor and sex hormones and to isolate peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells to investigate protein and gene expression of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and endothelial function: 1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
o To investigate the acute effects of HIIT, 2 TBSP of blood will be collected to measure circulating markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and 
endothelial function and to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate protein and gene expression of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and endothelial function: 1) at rest; 2) at the end of a HIIT session; 3) after 1- hour recovery from HIIT; and 4) after 24- hours recovery 
from HIIT. To examine how chronic exercise training affects the acute responses of exercise, these tests will be performed at the beginning and end of 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Endothelial cell collection and analysis . We hav
 e the experience, resources, and 
access to experts to support the proposed endothelial cell measures. The proposed study will lay the foundation upon which we will base future studies focusing on dissecting in vivo  the sex -specific effect of exercise on mechanisms of endothelial 
dysfunction. The procedures for studying endothelial cells have been described in detail by [CONTACT_184539]
16-18, and by [CONTACT_27156] 11, 19-22. A clinician on our team  from the 
Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Cesar Trillo -Alvarez , MD , who has extensive  
experience with intra- arterial catheterizations  (~1500 procedures over 15 years)  will 
perform the procedure. He will place a standard 20 gauge arterial catheter  with no 
sheath at the radial artery guided by [CONTACT_403603]. No vasodilators will be used. Once the catheter is secure, four small (0.018- inch diameter) sterile J -shaped guidewires  will be sequentially advanced 
(~4 inches) through the radial arterial catheter and retract ed to collect a small number 
of endothelial cells . Following the cell collection  and blood draw , the catheter will be 
removed and hemostasis will be achieved by [CONTACT_403604] . The 
physician will monitor  bleeding at 5, [ADDRESS_509033] been described previously by [CONTACT_403605] #:  201902165  Page 10  of 23

new pathways that lead to sex differences in endothelial responses to exercise in older 
adults.  
o To investigate the chronic effects of HIIT, cells will be collected and analyzed : 
1) at baseline; 2) after 8 weeks of normal lifestyle; and 3) after 8 weeks of exercise training.  
• Protein and mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) . Prot
 ein and 
mRNA levels will be determined for key factors associated with oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and endothelial function and sex hormone receptors . Ficoll- Paque will 
be used to isolate the mononuclear cells from whole blood by [CONTACT_7891]. Protein levels will be analyzed using Western blots. RNA isolation will be performed using the RNAqueous (Ambion) kit and gene expression will be measured using RT -PCR
23.  
o To investigate the acute effects of HIIT on protein and mRNA levels, these tests will be performed: 1) at rest; 2) at the end of a HIIT session; 3) after 1-hour recovery; and 4) after 24- hours recovery.  To examine how chronic 
exercise training affects the acute responses of exercise, these tests will be performed at the beginning and end of the [ADDRESS_509034] of Procedures and Duration by [CONTACT_403606] (1.5 hrs)

 7.  Possible Discomforts and Risks 
• Flow mediated dilation - Inf
 lating the blood pressure cuff on the forearm during 
this procedure may cause a mild to moderate intensity “pi[INVESTIGATOR_184514]” sensation that goes away as soon as the cuff is deflated.   
• Body composition (DXA) scan- The radi
 ation exposure from each DXA scan is 
equal to about 3 millirem, which is comparable to about 4 extra days of natural background radiation to which people in the [LOCATION_002] are exposed to during their lives.  The risk from this radiation exposure is considered to be 
extremely low when compared to other everyday  risks.  
• Maximal graded exercise test - Arr
 hythmia (<1%); minimal risk of myocardial 
infarction (<0.05%) and death (<0.02%); small risk of syncope and fatigue.  
Protocol #:  201902165  Page 16  of 23  
IRB version:  03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   • Exercise training- When one begins a new exercise program there is a risk that 
it may lead to fatigue or muscle or joint soreness, or injury. There is a small risk 
of irregular heart rhythm and very rarely heart attack or stroke which could potentially lead to death. In general, exercise does not lead to heart problems or stroke in individuals who have completed health screening and are free of heart disease.  To allow monitoring of the  exercise responses using the wearable 
device, the location option on the tablet must be turned on. Neither the study 
team nor the company that manufactures the wearable device will have access to the location information. But there is a small risk that an unauthorized person 
may get access to this information, while the tablet  is in use . 
• Intrav enous catheter  and bl
 ood draw - Discomfort at the site of puncture; 
possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection or blood clot; and, uncommonly, faintness from the procedure.  
• Intra-arterial catheter  and 
 cell and blood collection- Discomfort associated with 
lidocaine injection.  Discomfort from needle stick and placement of catheter at 
the time it is inserted or after it has been removed. Possible bleeding, bruising, and swelling around the puncture site. Rarely local blood clot, infection, 
significant blood loss, nerve or artery damage, tissue injury and damage of surrounding tissue and extremity . Pain from compression of puncture site if 
severe bleeding occurs. The risks related to the cell collection are similar to 
those associated with an intra- arterial catheter, although the risk of blood clot, 
infection or blood vessel damage may be slightly greater compared to having intra-arterial catheter placement without cell collection.   
• Lidocaine- Lidocai
 ne will be used for numbing the area prior to arterial 
cannulation. Expected sensation of coolness or numbness at injection site; 
likely mild temporary skin irritation including burning, redness or swelling at injection site; unlikely but possible reactions include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, ringing in ears, nervousness and blurred or double vision; extremely rare allergic reaction.  
• Nitroglycerin  test
 - The oral administration of nitroglycerin ( 0.4 mg sublingual 
tablet ) is expected to cause a small transient decrease in arterial blood 
pressure. The subject may experience increased heart rate, lightheadedness, tingling on the tongue and in the arms and legs, light headache, and at the extreme, fainting. In rare cases heart rate may decrease in response to the nitroglycerin pi[INVESTIGATOR_403590]. The dose of nitroglycerin used is considered safe and is commonly used in patient populations to relieve angina. With any drug used in testing, there is a small risk of an unforeseen life-
threatening allergic reaction. The on- site study clinician  will confirm that there 
are no contraindications for nitroglycerin administration ( e.g., systolic blood 
pressure <100 mmHg, phosphodiesterase inhibitors including Sildennafil ) 
before administer ing the drug and will monitor the subject until ready to be 
released.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/[ADDRESS_509041] Risks  
In general, risks will be minimized by:  
• allowing only individuals  who meet the inclusion criteria to participate 
• screening for contraindications for nitroglycerin administration, maximal graded 
exercise testing or intra-arterial catheter placement  
• providing clinical supervision, including ECG and blood pressure monitoring, for 
the maximal graded exercise test s and nitroglycerin administration  
• ensuring constant personal monitoring of each experimental session by [CONTACT_473]  
• using only safe, well -established procedures, and having only qualified and 
experienced personnel perform the procedures  
• following UF guidelines for reducing the risk of COVID -19 
• having available emergency equipment/medications and well -planned 
emergency procedures  
• providing complete confidentiality

Co-Investigator and experienced clinician at the UF Health Division of Pulmonary and 
Critical Care.  These include:  
• Limiting the number of people in a room and social distancing whenever possi
ble. 
• Frequently sanitizing laboratory surfaces and hands .  
• S tudy personnel wearing KN95 masks and  shield s, disposable gowns and 
gloves and participant s wearing a surgical mask . 
• Upon arrival  at the Center for Exercise Science for a scheduled visit , 
participant s will be screened for history and symptoms of COVID -19 and body 
temperature will be taken using a contact[CONTACT_403611]. If they answer yes to any of the screening questions and/or 
their temperature is greater than 100.4 degrees , then they  will need to 
reschedule the visit. Participant s will be given a surgical mask and a 2 oz. bottle 
of hand sanitizer. They  will be asked to wear the mask and use the hand 
sanitizer prior to entering the building and frequently sanitize their  hands during 
the visit and social distance whenever possible.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   Specific risks associated with nitroglycerin:  Risks related to nitroglycerin administration 
will be minimized by p roviding adequate clinical supervision and by [CONTACT_403612]. An intravenous catheter will be inserted in a peripheral vein prior to 
nitroglycerin administration, in case the effect of nitroglycerin necessitates the administration of fluids or medication. ECG will be monitored continuously. Blood 
pressure will be monitored prior to nitroglycerin administration and post -administration 
as frequently as deemed necessary. For individuals whose systolic blood pressure is <100 mmHg, nitro glycerin will not be administered. Subjects will remain in bed for 30 
minutes after nitroglycerin administration to allow blood pressure to return to baseline before ambulating. Nitroglycerin has been administered safely in our laboratory for more than 10 years, and in other laboratories, a nd clinical situations worldwide.  
 
Risks associated with intra -arterial catheter and cell collection:  Risks related to intra -
arterial catheter insertion and cell collection will be minimized by [CONTACT_403613], [CONTACT_403624] -Alvarez, 
perform the procedure. [CONTACT_403625] will use  ultrasound imaging to guide the cannulation to 
avoid injury to nerves and surrounding structures . Subjects will be screened for 
contraindications including absent pulse at the location of the artery, history of Raynaud’s Syndrome, insufficient collateral perfusion based on Allen test , 
coagulopathy, recent use of thrombolytic , anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs , and partial 
or full thickness burns over the proposed cannulation site.  Up to  two attempts to insert 
the arterial catheter will be performed; attempts will be aborted if any complications are expected. [CONTACT_403625] will monitor the patient until the arterial line procedure and cell 
collection are completed and no complications are noted.   
 
Specific risks and complications will be mitigated and managed as follows:  
a. Radial Artery Spasm (RAS)  
i. Subjects will be monitored for RAS clinically by [CONTACT_403614]. Initial management:  
1.  Subjects scheduled to receive nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (as per 
study protocol to assess endothelium -independent dilation) will 
receive the dose of nitroglycerin as per study protocol and RAS will be reevaluated (at 10- min intervals up to 30 min). If no improvement, 
then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
2. Subjects not scheduled to receive nitroglycerin will be monitored for severity of RAS. If moderate or severe by [INVESTIGATOR_22333], then the patient will receive a single dose of nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual and RAS will be reevaluated (at 10- min interv als up to 30 min). If no 
improvement, then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
b. Thrombosis  
i. Mitigation of risk:   
1. Cancel procedure if subject has history (or present during evaluation) of Raynaud’s phenomenon  
2. Catheter will stay inserted for less than 5 min  
3. No use of large bore catheters, only 20G or smaller

IRB version:  03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]:  08/30/2022   4. No insertion if patient has low cardiac output (by [CONTACT_969])  
5. No insertion if patient has history of severe peripheral artery disease  
6. No insertion if blood vessel is considered too small for cannulation  
ii. Initial management: If moderate or severe by [INVESTIGATOR_22333], then the 
patient will receive a single dose of nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual and RAS 
associated with thrombosis will be reevaluated (at 10- min intervals up to 30 
min). If no improvement, then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
c. Dissection, pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula  
i. Mitigation of risk by [CONTACT_403615]  
1. Continuous clinical monitoring at 10- min intervals up to 30 min.  
2. Local pressure to control bleeding and hematoma  
3. If present and no improvement with initial local pressure, then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
d. Infection  
i. Mitigation of risk:   
1. All sterile insertion as per usual guidelines. Use of mask, caps, gowns, sterile gloves, and chlorhexidine (or equivalent if patient allergic) to prepare the skin.  
2. Catheter will be inserted for less than 5 minutes.  
e. Blood loss  
i. Mitigation of risk:   
1. No arterial puncture will be attempted in any subject with systemic anticoagulation.  
ii. Initial management:  
1. Bleeding will be controlled by [CONTACT_403616]; monitoring at 5, 10, and 15 min after removal of arterial catheter. If bleeding persists continuous pressure and evaluation at 10- minute intervals up to 30 
min. 
2. If bleeding present and no improvement with initial local pressure, then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
f. Neuropathy  
i. Mitigation of risk:  
1. Use of ultrasound guided technique to avoid nerve injury.  
2. Abort procedure if producing pain or neurological injury.  
ii. Initial management:  
1. If severe neurological injury noticed, then escalation to higher level of care will be initiated.  
 
Procedure for escalation of care after initial control in research laboratory:  
 
Local initial first aid, including pressure to stop bleeding and vital signs monitoring. The patient will be transferred to University of [LOCATION_012] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403591]. If emergent we will contact 911 for immediate support and transport. We will immediately refer patient to 
University of [LOCATION_012]/Shands Medical Center for any complications for further evaluation and therapy.

Risks associated with exerc ise training:   
In general, risks related to exercise training will be minimized by:  
• adhering to the exercise training guidelines published by [CONTACT_403617]  
• providing thorough health screening to ensure there are no contraindications for exercise training  
• providing remote live supervision of exercise training via Zoom   
 Minimizing specific risks associated with exercise training:  
Cardiac risks during exercise will be minimized by [CONTACT_403618]. Subjects with signs of cardiovascular disease or those at elevated risk for cardiac complications will be excluded from the study (see exclusion criteria). A physical examination will be 
conducted, and medical history and resting ECG will be reviewed for contraindications to exercise. Prior to exercise testing, heart rate and blood pressure will be obtained while the subjects rest supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting and standing to screen for cardiac autonomic 
dysfunction. Baseline maximal exercise tests will be performed to rule out the presence of silent myocardial ischemia. Because the exercise level during the diagnostic test s will 
be maximal, it should allow identification/exclusion of individuals who are likely to develop ischemia during the exercise training. In addition, subjects will be educated on how to recognize cardiovascular disease symptoms such as angina, dizziness  and 
excessive shortness of breath. They will be asked to inform the research team immediately if they experience any of these symptoms during the diagnostic exercise test or the exercise sessions. If participants experience a medical emergency during an exercise session, we will call [ADDRESS_509044] from the extensive testing performed for screening purposes  (i.e., medical information derived from physical 
examination, diagnostic exercise test, blood pressure measurements, body composition analysis including bone density, aerobic fitness, physical activity and dietary analysis, and general blood tests including comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, insulin, complete blood count with differential ).  Although individual responses may vary, exercise training 
has been shown to lead to many health benefits that may improve quality of life or lower the risk for heart disease including higher fitness level, improved heart function, healthier blood vessels, lower blood pressure, lower body fat and blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], reduced stress and depression.

escalation design will be done for olaparib at doses of 200mg BID and 300mg BID (tablet 
formulation) with standard ramucirumab dosing of 8 mg/ kg every 2 weeks. After the 
recommended phase 2 dose is determined, the ph ase 2 part of the study will begin. In phase 2, 
patients will be enrolled and trea ted with olaparib twice daily and ramucirumab 8 mg/kg every 2 
weeks. Response assessment scans will be done  every 6 weeks (imaging should include the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis), and treatment wi ll continue until di sease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients that remain on treatment for > 6 months may decrease the 
response assessment scan interval to every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) at the discretion of the 
investigator. All patients will undergo a biopsy prior to treatment, which will be used for 
integrated biomarker analysis with the BROCA-HR panel to assess for the presence of mutations 
in homologous repair genes. The patients in pha se [ADDRESS_215629] treatment PDX. Within the 
BROCA-HR panel we estimate the 17 genes charac teristic of homologous  repair deficiency 
(HRD) to be present in 30-40% of our study population. Deleterious mutations in the following 
genes will be considered a positive result for the BROCA-HR biomarke r: ATM, ATR, BARD1, 
BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, MR E11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, RBBP8, SLX4, XRCC2, CDK 12. Because we do not know the true distribution of our 
biomarker, we will proceed with this [ADDRESS_215630] the BROCA-HR biomarker to be 
positive in approximately 35% of cases and we will enroll to 40 patients in phase 2 and proceed as follows:   
1. If there are 6 or more BROCA-HR+ patie nts (34 or less BROCA-HR- patients): 
If there are no responses in BROCA-HR+  patients and no response in BROCA-

is estimated that were will be 26,370 new case s of gastric cancer, and 16,910 new cases of 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]

 9esophageal cancer, the majority of which are GEJ– centered adenocarcinomas, in the United Stats 
in 2016 [1]. Global gastric cancer incidence has declined with improved sanitation, food 
preparation and infection contro l, but the most recent global  incidence remains high with 
951,600 cases in 2012 [2]. The five-year survival rate of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is 
<30% for all stages and < 4% for metastatic disease [3, 4].  It’s estimated that were will be 310 
deaths attributed to gastroesophageal cancer fo r Connecticut in 2016 [5]. Thus, gastric and GEJ 
adenocarcinomas remain highly lethal with earl y propensity for metastatic spread, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_182530], improvement in su rvival has been modest [4].  
 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for metasta tic gastroesophageal 
adenocarcinoma recommend a platinum containing doublet or triplet in th e first line setting, but 
median survival is less than 1 year [6]. Approved second-line re gimens include ramucirumab as 
single agent or in combination with paclitaxel [ 7, 8]. Targeted therapy fo r HER2 positive disease 
with trastuzumab has been effective [9], but the role for other targeted agents remains unclear. 
Olaparib in combination with paclitaxel has shown mixed results  in gastric cancers expressing 
low levels of the ataxia telangiectasia (ATM ) protein and further study is ongoing [10]. Low 
levels of ATM protein are t hought to be a sign of defec tive double stranded DNA repair 
mechanisms through inter action with BRCA [10]. Gastric cancer  cell lines have demonstrated 
sensitivity to olaparib, which is even more pr onounced with low levels of ATM expression [11]. 
 Defective DNA repair is a widely known mechan ism for cancer devel opment. BRCA mutations 
result in defective DNA repair  by [CONTACT_182590] e rror-free homology- directed double 
strand break repair. Cells must then rely on the more error prone non-homologous DNA repair, 
which results in increased mutational burden within  cells and predisposes to breast, ovarian, and 
pancreatic cancer. While the association between  BRCA mutation and gastri c cancer is weaker 
than the association with breast and ovarian can cer, recent data reveals that evidence of 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) ma y be present in up to 12% of non-BRCA 
mutated gastric cancers as determined by a mole cular signature [CONTACT_182682]. This observation is 
discussed further in Corr elative Studies Background, section 2.5.2  [12].  
 
Additional evidence supporting de fective homologous repair in the pathogenesis of gastric 
cancer relates to mutations in reported in th e DNA repair gene ATM. Mutations in ATM have 
been reported in 11% of gastric cancers, and fo und to be expressed at low levels in 14% of 
patients in a prospective study [10, 13, 14]. The BROCA-HR mutation panel developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Swisher at the University of Washington is a gene  panel that has been va lidated and is available 
to assess for the presence of mutations in [ADDRESS_215636] been reported in more th an 40% of gastric cancers reported in the 
cosmic database, and details regarding the panel are discussed further in the Correlative Studies 
Background, section 2.5.1  [15, 16]. The use of the BROCA-HR panel and the use of mutational 
signatures both present opportuni ties as biomarkers to identify tumors with defective 
homologous repair that may be more susceptible to the combination of ramucirumab and 
olaparib. The rationale for this co mbination is further described in section 2.[ADDRESS_215637] assay, measures homologous recomb ination in tumor cells. Homologous repair 
is measured by [CONTACT_182591]: loss of he rozygosity, large-scale state transitions, and 
telomeric allelic imbalance [17]. The Myriad assay is currently under review for validation for 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/[ADDRESS_215638] cancer, but also presents an opportunity for use as a biomarker for defective 
homologous repair in gastric patients [17, 18].  2.2 CTEP IND Agent(s)  
 2.2.1 Olaparib (AZD 2281) 
 
Olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436) is a potent oral i nhibitor of polyadenosi ne 5’diphosphoribose 
polymerase (PARP). PARP inhibi tion is a novel approach to targeting tumors  that have 
homologous recombination DNA repair pathway de ficiencies. In HRD tumors, single agent 
treatment with olaparib can lead to tumor regr ession by a process known as  synthetic lethality- a 
result of the accumulation of un-repaired  DNA double-strand breaks  and an unsupportable 
increase in genomic instability. In synthetic leth ality, neither the deficien cy in homologous repair 
nor PARP inhibition is cytotoxi c by [CONTACT_5071], but the combination of both leads to cell death. 
 Olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor approved by [CONTACT_182592]. In 
the US, the FDA has approved olaparib as mo notherapy for patients with deleterious or 
suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated (as de tected by [CONTACT_13247]-approved test) in patients 
with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of 
chemotherapy. Additionally, the European Medi cines Agency (EMA) approved olaparib as 
monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with  platinum-sensitive relapsed 
BRCA-mutated (germline and/or so matic) high grade serous epi[INVESTIGATOR_182531], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
primary peritoneal cancer who ar e in response (complete resp onse or partial response) to 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  The majority of completed studies were perform ed with the capsule fo rmulation of olaparib. 
However since 2012/[ADDRESS_215639] new studies, including the phase II I registration studies, are 
being performed with the tablet formulation which was designed to  deliver the therapeutic dose 
of olaparib in fewer dose units than the capsule.   Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of action for olaparib activity has been proposed to involve the trappi[INVESTIGATOR_182532]-strand breaks prev enting their repair and generating a potential 
block for cellular DNA replication [19, 20]. An important consequen ce of this is that processing 
of trapped PARP-DNA complexes a nd/or the stalling of replicati on forks, or collapsing of 
replication forks leads to the generation of more serious DNA double stranded breaks [19, 20]. 
Under normal circumstances thes e double stranded breaks would be  repaired by [CONTACT_182593]51, 
BRCA1, and BRCA2 (Olaparib IB v. 14). However,  when homologous repair  is not functioning 
cells must rely on the more er ror prone base-excision repair  system, which requires PARP 
function. Homologous repair dysfunc tion sensitizes cells to PARP inhibition leading to further 
chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and ap optosis [21]. In cases where DNA repair defects 
may not result in the same level of sensitivity as  BRCA mutations single agent olaparib may not 
be sufficient to induce cell kill through synthetic lethality. Howeve r, it may still be possible to 
induce tumor cell death through comb inations with ionizing radiat ion or chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_182533]. Pre-clinical  studies support these 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 11 findings, showing that other BRCA  mutant, but not wild-type, human cell lines are highly 
sensitive to olaparib [22].   
 Nonclinical Pharmacology and Efficacy  
Olaparib was developed as a PARP inhibito r from a targeted screening program of 
pharmacophores with the aim of enhancing killing actions of certain existing cancer 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_182534] I inhibitors and alkylating agents. Olaparib is an agent 
that has potential both as monotherapy as well as  in combination with other cancer treatments 
[22].    Multiple tumor cell lines have been  investigated using colony form ation assays for sensitivity to 
PARP inhibition with olaparib as a single ag ent. These cell lines have shown wide-ranging 
cellular activity from low nM to 10 ȝM. The effective concentration for inhibiting cellular PARP 
activity in cancer cells by >90% is approximate ly [ADDRESS_215640] MCF-7, and colorectal SW620. These 
concentrations led to significant ablation of PARP activity (based on the inhibition of PAR 
formation), with maximal PARP-1 inhibition oc curring at around 100 nM. C onsistent with this, 
maximal potentiation of an a ppropriate DNA SSB-inducing chemot oxic agent (MMS) was also 
seen in vitro at 100 nM, which equates to 43.4 ng/mL. 
 Following single oral doses, absorption was ra pid (maximum plasma concentration Cmax <2 
hours in mice, rats and dogs) while  bioavailability was <60% in ma le and female mice, <20% in 
male and female rats and ~79% in male dogs (Ola parib IB v. 14). Low oral bioavailability in rats 
may have been due to poor abso rption or rapid first pa ss metabolism. Distribution of olaparib is 
in the gastrointestinal tract and in tissues as sociated with the metabo lism and elimination of 
foreign compounds. Further investig ations are still ongoing. Excreti on is primarily via the feces 
(65% to 75%) and, to a lesser exte nt, the urine (20% to 30%).  
 Investigations in human in vitro systems indicated metabolism of olaparib was CYP mediated 
and that CYP3A4 and 3A5 were the dominant me tabolic enzymes (Olaparib IB v. 14). Similar 
studies indicated flavin m ono-oxygenase-[ADDRESS_215641] inhibition assays, olaparib WRȝ0ZDVDZHDNLQKLELWRURI&<3$,&

 Nonclinical Toxicology  
Non-clinical safety evaluation st udies conducted with olaparib in clude single dose oral and iv 
studies in mice and rats, repeat dosing oral studies of up to 1 m onths duration in mice, pi[INVESTIGATOR_182535] 6 m onths duration in rats and dogs, a battery of in vitro and in vivo 
genetic toxicity studies and re productive toxicology studies in rats, which are summarized in 
section 4.3 (toxicology) of the Olaparib IB  v. 14. There were no noted effects on the 
cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_182536], autonomic, or 
motor effects in the rat. Toxicol ogy studies indicate that the target  organ of toxicity is the bone 
marrow. Ex vivo work has confirmed that olaparib is also active against human marrow. The 
cytotoxic effect becomes evident at a higher conc entration than required to fully ablate PARP 
activity. 28-day dog and rat studies demonstrate a reversible myelotoxic effect that is mild to 
moderate. Platelets are first affected, followed by [CONTACT_182594]. In 26-week repeat-dose 
studies in rats, doses were well tolerated in male  rats, with hematological effects and increased 
spleen weights observed at all dosages. In fema le rats, doses of 15 mg/kg/day resulted in 
significant reduction in body weight . Hematological effects and increased spleen weights were 
again observed at all dosages. The difference between  sexes was considered to be due to the fact 
that females had greater plasma exposure levels than males. In  26-week repeat-dose studies in 
dogs, olaparib was well tolera ted. Hematological changes we re observed, characterized by

concentrations declined in a biphasic manner  with an average terminal elimination t

hours (Sd 5.31 hours) and 13.02 hours (Sd 4.16 hours) . The Gmean apparent oral plasma 
clearance was approximately 7.95 L/h and 6.36 L/h. The volume of distribution was greater than 
total body water indicating that olaparib was distributed into the tissues, 146.2 L and 112.1 L. 
The observed variability in e xposure was moderate to high, th e Gmean %CV for AUC and Cmax 
following 300 mg single dose olaparib ranged from 24.3% to 67.4%.  The relative bioavailabilities of the tablet formula tion (compared to capsule) at the 3 dose levels 
studied are shown in Table 10 in  the Olaparib Investigator’s Brochure, 2015. At the 2 lower 
tablet doses (25 and 50 mg), fo llowing normalization fo r dose, although the Cmax achieved after 
dosing with the tablet formulation tended to be higher than that w ith the capsule, the AUC values 
for the [ADDRESS_215643] tablet dose (250 mg), 
the exposure delivered by [CONTACT_182596] (both dose-normalized Cmax and AUC) was 
higher than that delivered by [CONTACT_182597]. The tablet and the capsule  formulations cannot 
therefore be considered  to be bioequivalent.

dose of olaparib in fewer dose units than the capsule. Of the 4475 patie nts, 2109 received the 
capsule formulation, 2341 receiv ed the tablet formulation, an d 25 received both capsule and 
tablet. In the [COMPANY_008]-sponsored, interventi onal studies, olaparib  was given either as 
monotherapy (2618 patients) or in  combination with chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents, 
including studies where patient s received monotherapy and combination therapy sequentially 
Q    
 Data from the available pre-clinical studies a nd subsequent clinical development programme 
demonstrate that olaparib appears to be active an d generally well tolerated in patients with solid 
tumours including those with BRCA  mutated cancers. In  ovarian cancer, responses have been 
seen in all patient groups, including pl atinum resistant and refractory cancer.  
 From the available data to date in patients with advanced cancer, there is no evidence of any unexpected toxicity following long-term ol aparib (capsule) monotherapy exposure.  
 
Adverse laboratory findings and/or clinical diagnoses considered to be associated with 
administration of olaparib monotherapy include hematological effects (anemia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, MCV elevation and increase in  blood creatinine), nausea and 
vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dyspepsia , stomatitis, upper abdo minal pain, dysguesia, 
fatigue (including asthenia), headach e and dizziness. Most of these events were generally mild or 
moderate in intensity.   In a relatively small number of patients, pne umonitis, MDS/AML and new primary malignancies 
have been observed. Evidence from across the development programme for olaparib does not 
support a conclusion that there is a causal relatio nship between olaparib and these events. There 
are important potential risks for olaparib and are being kept under close surveillance.  
  Data from studies of olaparib in combination with various chemothera py agents indicate an 
increase in bone marrow toxicity (anemia, neutro penia, thrombocytopenia) greater than expected 
if the agents had been administered alone. Th e effects are generally transient but treatment 
delays are common and alternative administratio n schedules/toxicity mana gement processes are 
currently being evaluated within so me of these studies. When this ty pe of toxicity has occurred it 
has been managed by [CONTACT_182598], dose reductions, 
intermittent dosing and/or the use of supportive care measures, including G-CSF. Currently, all 
ongoing olaparib combination studies  are being closely monitored fo r myelotoxicity. Results of a 
Phase II study in combination with carbopla tin/paclitaxel (Study D0810C0041) showed that 
addition of olaparib to carboplatin AUC 4 + paclitaxel in the chem otherapy phase had a 
generally similar tolerability profile to carbopla tin AUC 6 + paclitaxel. Th e regimen of olaparib

and manageable tolerability profile in patients with recurrent serous ova rian cancer. Olaparib 
tolerability during the monotherapy maintenance phase was consistent with the previously 
known safety and tolerability profile. In Study D0810C00039 and Study 081BC00004, olaparib

anemia on the olaparib + paclitaxe l combination arm than the plac ebo + paclitaxel arm and more 
dose interruptions, reducti ons and discontinuations. 
 Important potential risks  
Myelodysplastic syndrome/ acute myeloid leukemia: 
The incidence of MDS/AML in patients treated in clinical trials with olaparib monotherapy, 
including long-term survival follow-up, was <1.5 % and the majority of  events had a fatal 
outcome. All patients had potential contributi ng factors for the development of MDS/AML, 
having received previous chemotherapy with pla tinum agents. Many had also received other 
DNA damaging treatments. The majority of report s were in germline BRCA mutation carriers 
and some of the patients had a history of prev ious cancer or of bone marrow dysplasia. If MDS 
and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with  olaparib, it is recommended that olaparib 
should be discontinued and the pa tient be treated appropriately. 
 
New Primary Malignancies other than MDS/AML: 
New primary malignancies have been reporte d in <1% of patients . There were other 
contributing factors/potential alternative explan ations for the developm ent of the new primary 
malignancy in all cases, includ ing documented BRCA mutation, tr eatment with radiotherapy and 
extensive previous chemothera py including carboplatin, taxanes, anthracyclines and other 
alkylating and DNA damaging agents.  Pneumonitis: Pneumonitis has been reported in <1.0% patients treate d with olaparib monot herapy in clinical 
studies. Reports of pneumoniti s had no consistent clinical pattern and were confounded by a 
number of pre-disposing factor s (cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary 
disease, smoking history, and/ or previous chemotherapy and ra diotherapy). When olaparib was 
used in clinical studies in combination with othe r therapi[INVESTIGATOR_182538] a fatal 
outcome. If patients present with new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_124662], 
cough and fever, or an abnormal chest radiologic  finding is observed, olaparib treatment should 
be interrupted and prompt investigation initiate d. If pneumonitis is confir med, olaparib treatment 
should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
 Laboratory toxicities:  
From the completed studies, there are no safe ty concerns noted for the renal or hepatic 
parameters measured and no clinically signific ant changes of concern relating to coagulation 
parameters. Changes observed in the hematol ogical parameters (dec reased hemoglobin, 
neutrophils, thrombocytes and lymphocytes) ar e known to be associated with olaparib 
monotherapy and/or can be explained by [CONTACT_3252]-e xisting conditions/previous chemotherapy. Mean

 Clinical Efficacy:  
 The regulatory approvals of olaparib were based on study D0810C00019. This was a Phase 2, 
randomized, double-blind, multicente r study to assess the effica cy of olaparib (capsule 
formulation) in the treatment of patients with pl atinum sensitive serous ovarian cancer, following 
treatment with 2 or more plati num containing regimens [23]. Patie nts that responded to platinum 
based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to maintenance therapy with either placebo or 
olaparib at a dose of 400mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was PFS according to the 
RECIST guidelines. Of the 265 patients randomi zed into the study, all olaparib (136) and 
128/129 placebo patients received study treatment . PFS was significantly longer with olaparib 
than with placebo (median, 8.4 months vs. 4.8 months from randomiza tion on completion of 
chemotherapy; hazard ratio for progression or de ath, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 
0.49; P<0.001). Subgroup analyses of PFS showed that , regardless of subgroup, patients in the 
olaparib group had a lower risk of progression. The investigators concluded that olaparib as 
maintenance treatment significantly improved PF S among patients with platinum-sensitive, 
relapsed, high-grade serous ovari an cancer. Interim analysis show ed no overall survival benefit. 
The toxicity profile of olaparib in this population was consistent w ith that in previous studies.  
 Fong et al reported the result of  a phase 1 study in a study populat ion enriched in carriers of a 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [24].T he investigators enrolled and treated 60 patients; 22 were 
carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mu tation and 1 had a strong fam ily history of BRCA-associated 
cancer but declined to undergo mutational te sting. The olaparib dose and schedule were 
increased from 10 mg daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 mg twice daily continuously. 
Reversible dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one  of eight patients rece iving 400 mg twice daily 
(grade 3 mood alteration and fa tigue) and two of five patients  receiving 600 mg twice daily 
(grade 4 thrombocytopenia and gr ade 3 somnolence). This led to enrollment of another cohort, 
consisting only of carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, to receive olap arib at a dose of 200 
mg twice daily. Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the mutation carriers. Pharmacokinetic data indicated 
rapid absorption and eliminati on; pharmacodynamic studies c onfirmed PARP inhibition in 
surrogate samples (of periphera l-blood mononuclear cells and pl ucked eyebrow-hair follicles) 
and tumor tissue. Objective antitumor activity wa s reported only in mutation carriers, all of 
whom had ovarian, breast, or pr ostate cancer and had received multiple treatment regimens.

 16 In an expansion phase in BRCA-de ficient ovarian cancer at a dose of olaparib 200 mg BID, fifty 
patients were treated, including 48 with BRCA-defic ient germline mutations and two patients of 
unknown status or significance. Twenty (40%) pa tients achieved comple te response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_182600]/or GCIG-CA125 criteria.  An additional three patients 
experienced stable disease (SD)  for more than four cycles [25]. A multicenter phase 2 study

and recurrent advanced ovarian can cer to receive olapar ib continuously at a dose of 400 mg BID 
(Cohort 1) or 100 mg BID (Cohort 2) [26]. Responses  were observed in 33% (11 of 33) patients 
enrolled in the 400mg BID cohort an d 13% (3 of 24) patients enro lled in the [ADDRESS_215648] cancer

 Kaufman et al reported the re sults from the phase 2 study of ol aparib monotherapy in patients 
with advanced solid cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutation [28]. Olaparib was given 400mg 
twice a day and the primary endpoint was tumor response rate. A total of 298 patients received 
treatment and were evaluable. The tumor res ponse rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 
31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to  38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 
23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in

ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively.  
 Lee and Kohn and colleagues have examined olap arib with carboplatin in two schedules in 
BRCA1/[ADDRESS_215649] and/or ov arian cancer and women w ith high grade serous 
ovarian cancers[29]. They also observed clinic al activity with over 80%  of ovarian cancer 
patients attaining either SD or PR lasting up to 18+ months. Additional phase 1 and 2 trials in both BRCA-deficient and BRCA-competent ovarian cancer are currently ongoing.  
 
 
2.3 Other Agent: Ramucirumab (Cryamza) 
 Pathways that mediate angiogenesis are considered  important targets in cancer drug development 
and drugs that target this pa thway have been correlated with  multiple outcomes. Vascular 
endothelial growth factors (VEGFs; incl uding VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and 
placental growth factor) have emerged as key re gulators of angiogenesis and the expression of 
VEGFs has been correlated with poor prognosis in  several solid tumor types, including gastric 
adenocarcinoma.  A comprehensive clinical development program to  assess ramucirumab in the treatment of solid 
tumor malignancies was initiated following Ph ase 1 studies evaluati ng dose, schedule, and 
toxicity. The clinical development has focuse d on tumors where VEGF ligands (including 
VEGF-A) and VEGF-R2 are overexpressed and wher e the unmet medical need is high [30, 31]. 
  
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 17 Mechanism of Action 
 Ramucirumab is a human receptor- targeted antibody that specifically binds VEGF Receptor 2 
(VEGF-R2). The binding of ramu cirumab to VEGF-R2 prevents it s interaction with activating 
ligands, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D  [31, 32]. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand-
stimulated activation of VEGF-R2, thereby [CONTACT_182601]-induced proliferation, downstream 
signaling components including Er k1/Erk2, and migration of human  endothelial cells [33, 34]. 
Preclinical data for DC101, a neutralizing rat anti-mouse mAB specific for murine VEGF-R2, 
demonstrate antitumor activity  in multiple tumor models. 
 Nonclinical Pharmacology, Efficacy and T oxicology (Ramucirumab Investigator’s 
Brochure 2014)  The pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of ramu cirumab were determined in 
cynomolgus monkeys. The PK behavior of ra mucirumab in monkeys was typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a 
monoclonal antibody. The PK was nonlinear and showed antibody acc umulation with repeated 
doses. The formation of antidrug antibodies (ADA)  was assessed in all primate studies, and 
generally indicated the presence of ADA in indi vidual animals; however, the predictive value of 
this finding for the occurrence of immunogenicity  in humans is unclear. Formal studies to 
characterize the disposition, excretion, and metabolism of ramucirumab have not been 
conducted. As a monoclonal antibody, ramucirumab will be largely c onfined to the extracellular 
space and elimination is primarily by [CONTACT_182602].  
 
PK and TK of ramuciru mab in cynomolgus monkeys was obtai ned in 5 and 39 week repeat-dose 
toxicology studies. Animals were administered IV doses of 0, 4, 12, or 40 mg/kg ramucirumab 
DP weekly and blood samples for ramucirumab concentration anal ysis in serum were obtained 
after the first dose.   Non-compartmental analysis of  the contentration-vs-time da ta from the monkey toxicology 
studies indicated that the PK behavior of ramucirumab was n on-linear over the 4-50 mg/kg dose 
range. Ramucirumab half-life increased and clearance decreased with increasing dose. The steady-state volume of distributi on was approximately equal to th e vascular space at each dose 
level. Mean ramucirumab AUC in the 50mg/ kg group increased between the first and [ADDRESS_215650] ramucirumab were detected in 
the 4, 12, and 40 mg/kg dose groups in the 5 week  study and in the 5, 16 mg/kg dose groups in 
the [ADDRESS_215651] of ramucirumab was also assessed in an 
incisional model of wound heali ng after a single IV dose, and no impairment in wound healing 
was observed. Focal muscle fiber degeneration and mononuclear cell  infiltration were seen in 
skeletal muscle in ramucirumab treated animals only, but were conclude d to not be treatment 
related due to the focal nature of lesions and lo w incidence in females. No ramucirumab related 
adverse events were evident in the routine toxicological assessmen ts. Treatment of monkeys with 
ramucirumab for 39 weeks resulted in renal toxic ity at doses of 16 and 50 mg/kg and thickening

 18 and osteochondropathy of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_182539] 5 mg/kg and above. Thus a no 
observable adverse effect level for ramucirumab was not established when administered to monkeys once a week for 39 weeks.   Nonclinical in vitro pharmacodyna mics studies demonstrated th at ramucirumab possesses high 
affinity for VEGF receptor 2 and that pi[INVESTIGATOR_182540]. Thus ramuciru mab potently inhibits VEGF-mediated VEFR2 
activating, signaling, and biologic effects in endothelial cells. These responses include cell 
migration, proliferation, and survival. Pharmaco logical proof-of principle experiments that 
validated targeting VEGFR2 as an antiangioge nic strategy depended on the use of a surrogate 
antibody, DC101.   The preclinical pharmacodynamics da ta demonstrated that ramuci rumab binds specifically and 
with high affinity to human VEGFR2, and not to  murine VEGFR2 or the related human VEGF 
receptors, VEGF receptor 1 and VEGF Receptor 3. Additionally, ramucirumab is capable of 
inhibiting the relevant in vitro biological co nsequences of VEGF stimulated activation of 
VEGFR2. The antiangiogenic and antitumor e ffects observed in mice treated with DC101 
provide the basis to anticipate pot ent antiangiogenic effects of ra mucirumab in human cancers.   
 Clinical Pharmacology  Serum ramucirumab concentrations were determined  using either an original bioanalytical assay 
or a modified bioanalytical assay. The original PK  assay was modified and validated to meet the 
industry bioanalytical assay standards. Only data  using the modified as say are considered the 
primary source for ramucirumab PK ch aracterization and are presented.  
 For gastric cancer, trough concentr ations (or minimum concentrations) were collected in both the  
Phase [ADDRESS_215652] and RAINBOW clinical tr ials. Using the dosing regimen

respectively.   In a pooled analysis of 11 studies involving 1639 patients across multiple cancers revealed the 
volume of distribution at  steady state (Vm) and terminal half life we re 0.0147 L/h (30.0%) and 
5.4L (15.0%) and 14 days (20.0%) resp ectively. Results from this po oled analysis indicate that 
the PK of ramucirumab followi ng 8 and 10 mg/kg dose administrat ions were linear and time 
independent. Covariate analysis indicate that ramucirumab is not affected by [CONTACT_18694], sex, 
age, serum albumin, race, hepati c status, and renal function. 
 Two dedicated studies were conduced to asse ss the effect of concomitant ramucirumab 
administration on the PK of paclitaxel and doc etaxel. In study 14T-IE-J VCA was demonstrated 
that concomitant administration of ramuciruma b had no effect on the dose normalized AUC and

 20 Several factors provided rationale  for further clinical development of ramucirumab in gastric 
cancer; these include co ntribution of angiogenesis to cance r pathogenesis, and preclinical 
evaluations of the rat antibody to murine VE GF-R2, DC101. Ramucirumab does not cross react 
with the murine VEGF-R2, and for this re ason DC101 was used in murine models, and 
preliminary evidence of potential activity of othe r antiangiogenic agents in gastric cancer [35, 
36].   Clinical activity was seen early in the development of ramucirumab. In Phase 1 studies, ramucirumab was generally well tolerated and e xhibited preliminary evid ence of anti-tumor 
activity in patients with solid tumors. The ma ximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ramucirumab was 
identified to be 13 mg/kg when given once w eekly in the phase 1 dose-escalation study, Study 
14T-IE-JVBM (JVBM). Preliminary activity was obs erved across a range of doses, including the 
2-mg/kg weekly dose. Every-2-week (6 to 10 mg /kg) and every-3-week (15 to 20 mg/kg) dose 
regimens were evaluated in an additional dose-ranging st udy, 14T-IE-JVBN (JVBN). No MTD 
was identified for every-2-week or every-3-week  dosing; all dose regimens  were well tolerated, 
and preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy  was observed across a range of dose/schedule 
cohorts  [7].  
 Two dose regiments, 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 10 mg/kg were selected in the subsequent 
phase 2 and phase 3 studies. The ramucirumab do se of 8 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_215657] study:

 2.4 Rationale for the Combination of Olaparib and Ramucirumab 
 The process of DNA damage repair is complex, and additional altera tions beyond BRCA 1 and 2 
play a role in sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Th is has led to the concept of “BRCAness,” and we 
propose that the BROCA-HR panel can help identif y patients with the BRCAness phenotype in 
addition the more typi[INVESTIGATOR_182541]. Preclinical work ha s shown that hypoxia may induce 
BRCAness, which can potentially be taken adva ntage of through the combined effects of 
VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR ) and PARP inhibition.  
 Hypoxia has been shown to down regulate BRCA 1 expression through promoter modification 
by E2F4 complexes, which result s in decreased homologous repa ir in human cancer cell lines 
[37-39]. Subsequent work has shown that ge ne silencing of BRCA 1 can occur through 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_182542] H3K9 methylation of the BRCA 1 promoter, which is potentiated 
under hypoxic conditions [38]. These modifications result in geneti c instability, as cells then 
must rely on non-homologous DNA repair, which is more error prone. Similar findings have has 
also been reported for RAD51, another gene involved in the homologous repair pathway  [38, 40-
42].   As expected the exact opposite changes we re seen in VEGF expression under hypoxic 
conditions, which further supports  the potential synergy for PA RP and VEGF/VEGFR inhibition 
[38]. Data also exists that PARP inhibitors themselves likely inhibit tumor angiogenesis [43]. 
The argument for synergy was strengthened by [CONTACT_182604] [44]. Subsequently, VE GFR3 inhibition in ovarian cell lines has also been shown to 
result in reduced BRCA expression [45].   Based on these pre-clinical observations, a phase  2 trial comparing olaparib and cediranib to 
olaparib alone for metastatic ovarian cancer wa s recently completed. Significant improvement in 
progression-free survival was seen with the co mbination of cediranib and olaparib, and the 
benefit was observed for both BRCA mutated an d non-BRCA mutated individuals [46]. A phase 
[ADDRESS_215660] 
supportive care.   As noted above, the olaparib and cediranib combination resulted in high response rates 
regardless of the presence of BRCA mutations. Based on this we anticipate responses in both

 23 biomarker positive and negative cohorts given the proposed synergy with this combination 
therapy. Thus, we propose an open-label single arm study of olaparib in combination with 
ramucirumab for metastatic gastric adenocarcino mas with the use of the BROCA-HR integrated 
biomarker, which is described in further detail below in section 2.5.1 . 
 
2.5  Correlative Studies Background 
 2.5.1 BROCA-HR Panel 
Aim: To determine whether mutations in HRD ge nes confer sensitivity to ramucirumab and 
olaparib. 
 BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2 ) are tumor suppressor genes, in which inherited loss-of-function 
mutations confer a high lifetime risk  of breast and ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1/2  are key 
components of the BRCA-Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is critical to homologous 
combination-mediated DNA repair. Other genes in this pathway ( BRIP1/FANCJ, 
PALB2/FANCN, RAD51C/FANCO, RAD51D ) also contribute to hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer [47-51], and as our sequenc ing efforts have increased mutati ons in these same genes have 
been recognized in other cancers, including ga stric cancer. The Cancer  Genome Atlas Network 
(TCGA) suggested that up to half of serous  ovarian carcinomas have  homologous recombination 
defects (HRD), but that estimate was based on a variety of molecula r findings, many with 
uncertain impact on DNA repair fu nction[52]. PARP inhibitors (P ARPi) demonstrate synthetic 
lethality in cells with HRD, including cells deficient in BRCA1/2 [21, 53] . Recurrent ovarian 
carcinomas in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_215661] an approximate 40% response rate to PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_182543]-based chemotherapy [54]. Importantly, 
approximately 25% of serous ovari an cancers that are wildtype for BRCA1/2  also respond to 
PARPi [27].  Germline BRCA1/[ADDRESS_215662] [21, 53]. 
BRCA1 and BRCA2  somatic mutation occur in approximate ly 6% of ovarian cancer cases and 
also appear to confer sensitivity to PARPi [ 55]. Of note, PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_182544] (HR) genes including RAD51D, NBN, 
ATM, and CHEK2 [47, 56] .  Germline and somatic mutations in BRCA1/2  and other BRCA-FA 
genes in ovarian carcinomas are associated with improved respons e to primary platinum therapy 
and longer overall survival [57]. Germline a nd somatic BRCA-FA mutations are not limited to 
high-grade serous ovarian carcinom as, but can be found in all hist ological sub-types with the 
exception of mucinous carcinomas [57].   In order to respond to a PARPi, can cer cells need to be deficient in  HR but also proficient in the 
alternative error prone non-homol ogous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway [58, 59]. Thus, 
loss of HR is not, by [CONTACT_5071], sufficient for PARP i sensitivity, and an accur ate predictor of PARPi 
[INVESTIGATOR_182545] s of both the HR and NHEJ 
pathways. A more efficient assay, which would not require a prior knowle dge of the critical 
elements in these DNA repair pathways, woul d instead measure DNA repair capacity. Recent 
evidence suggests that BRCA1/2  deficient cancers exhibit gl obal DNA alterations termed 
“genomic scarring” that are cons istent with their reliance on the NHEJ pathway [60-62]. This 
genomic scar could serve as a downstream functiona l output to measure DNA repair capacity, 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/[ADDRESS_215663] HR as well as genomi c scarring will also be evaluated as exploratory 
biomarkers.    Relevance  
 
The marked susceptibility of patients with BRCA-mutated cancers has validated germline BRCA 
mutations as a predictive biom arker for PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_163792] [63]. Other mechanisms of HRD may 
be a functional biomarker for response to DNA damaging agents and PARPi. Thus, it is 
important to identify the subset  of patients have germline or somatic mutations in HRD genes 
and to examine their potential as predictive bi omarkers. Additional expl oratory biomarkers for 
HRD will include BRCA1  methylation, BRCA1  protein expression, and genomic scarring. We 
hypothesize that the BROCA-HR test will identify subsets of gastri c cancer patients with HRD, 
and may yield biomarkers with potential to guide  administration of this combination regimen. 
Preliminary Data 
BROCA-HR and genomic scarring 
BROCA is a targeted capture and massively pa rallel sequencing assay that is capable of 
identifying all classes of mu tations including gene rearrange ments [51, 64]. Using BROCA, 
Walsh et al demonstrated that  nearly one-fourth of women with ovarian carcinoma have 
germline loss of function mutations in at least 12 genes [51]. Furthermore,  most of these genes 
are in the BRCA-FA pathway. After BRCA1/[ADDRESS_215664] common genes mutated in women with 
ovarian cancer are BRIP1 (FANCJ), RAD51D, RAD51C (FANCO), and PALB2 (FANCN) [51, 
65].  Pennington et al applied BROCA to dete ct somatic mutations in tumor DNA from [ADDRESS_215665] to 31%, in cluding 23% with germline  and 9% with somatic 
mutations in FA/HR genes (and 1%  with both somatic and germline  mutations). The presence of 
either a germline or somatic FA/HR mutation is highly predictive of an improved primary response to platinum chemotherapy (p <0.0005) and longer overall survival (p  3HQQLQJWRQ
Swisher et al manuscript in progress). Germline  and somatic loss of function mutations were 
identified in all of the 13 FA/HR genes evaluated.  
[CONTACT_111602]’s laboratory has developed a new version of BROCA (BROCA-HR) that includes 
many additional DNA repair genes (84 total gene s), and 3000 single nucl eotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs). Similar sequenci ng accuracy and sensitivity sequenci ng DNA is obtained from formalin 
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE), fresh blood a nd flash frozen specimens. BROCA-HR includes 
genes that are targets of both somatic and germline mutations . The BROCA-HR includes genes 
that regulate HR or NHEJ that , if mutated, could mediate re sistance to PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_182546]53BP1[66-68]  . The BROCA design is flexible and can be altered to incl ude any genes of 
research interest. The current design for BROCA-HR includes the following genes:

2.5.2 Signature 3 
Aim: To determine whether a mutational signatur e characteristic of HRD confers sensitivity to 
ramucirumab and olaparib. 
 Evidence of defective homologous repair has be en reported in up to 12% of Gastric Tumors 
based on mutational signature [CONTACT_182683]. Alexandrov et al. ut ilized whole genome sequencing, 
followed by [CONTACT_182605] [ADDRESS_215666] mutational signatures 
across 30 cancer types [69]. Cancer genomes generally carry a larg e number of somatic 
mutations, which for the most part are passe nger mutations [70]. However the frequency and 
distribution of these single ba se somatic mutations creates an imprint on the cancer genome, 
which can provide insight into th e pathogenesis of a particular tu mor [71]. For example, previous 
work has shown that C:G > A:T substitutions occur at higher frequencies for smoking-associated lung cancers [72]. Alexandrov’s work has taken th is a step further by [CONTACT_182606] 6 classes of base substitutions (C:G > A:T, C:G > G:C, C:G > T:A, T:A > A:T, T:A > 
C:G, T:A >G:C), which including the 5’ and 3’  bases yields 96 possi ble combinations [69]. 
Whole exome sequencing data from more than  [ADDRESS_215667] mutational signatures across the 30 
cancer types through the applica tion of validated mathematical  algorithms [61, 69, 71]. This 
same mathematical modeling allows for the quan tification of each signature [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a particular 
cancer genome as multiple signatures may contri bute to a different propo rtion of the mutations 
detected in a specific tumor [70, 71]. Helleday et  al. uses the analogy of a human face to help 
explain; the aggregate of all the somatic substitu tions would represent the face, while the facial 
features such as the eyes, nose,  and mouth would represent the extracted individual mutational 
signatures [71]. Some signatures we re notable for a very specific  base substitution, and others 
had a more homogenous distributi on of the [ADDRESS_215668] strong 
associations to specific cancer s and known driver muta tions [70]. In additi on to the distribution

 26 characterized by a homogenous distribution of ba se substitutions [69]. Additionally, increased 
numbers of indels with overlapp ing microhomologies at break points were identified in signature 
3 tumors [12, 69]. These findings st rongly suggest that signature [ADDRESS_215671]. Subsequently, signa ture 3 has been described in 7-12% of 
gastric cancers with the major ity being non-BRCA mutated, which i ndicates a separate defect in 
the homologous DNA repair pathway or additiona l mechanisms of BRCA silencing [12]. This 
offers a novel biomarker to identify tumors with defects in the homologous double-stranded 
DNA repair pathway that may benefit from agents  targeting DNA repair pathways, specifically 
PARP inhibitors.  2.5.3 Immunoassay for poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) products:  
 Aim: To assess the effectiveness for olaparib and ramucirumab to  inhibit DNA repair in gastric 
carcinoma.  
 Because the product of the PARP enzyme is  poly-ADP-ribosylated (P AR) molecules, an 
immunoassay to quantify the amount of cellular PAR was developed as a clinical biomarker of 
PARP inhibition. Abbott Laboratories and the NC I-Frederick laboratorie s developed and cross-
validated a quantitative immunoassay for PAR [ 73].  The validated assay is a sandwich enzyme 
chemiluminescence immunoassay em ploying commercially obtaine d antibodies to PAR, and 
pure PAR as a standard. Assay dynamic range is  31 to 2000 pg/ml PAR, with a lower limit of 
quantitation of approximately 15 pg/ml PAR. Th e standard curve is linear throughout the range 
(with an adjusted R2 typi[INVESTIGATOR_182547] 0.98) . The assay uses high, midr ange, and low controls 
produced from the human melanoma line Colo8 29. Specimen handling was optimized for both 
PBMCs and tumor needle biopsies (18 ga), and ha rmonized for use with the same standards and 
controls. Specimens could be subjected to at leas t 3 freeze-thaw cycles wi thout a detectable loss 
of antigen binding. Assay precision was determined at both Abbott and the NCI-Frederick, to be 
better than 80% (estimated total imprecision at A bbott, 7% or less). Accuracy, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_182548],  was 100% +/- 20%. Assay dilution linearity was 
established for the Colo829 controls and tumor lysates, although deviations from linearity are 
observed in some tumor homogenates, and assay condi tions are controlled to compensate for that 
lack of linearity. The validate d assay was used to measure PA R levels in PBMCs of healthy 
donors, in animal models after administration of  a single and multiple  dosing of ABT-888, and 
will be used to measure PAR in PBMCs and tumor biopsies in the proposed protocol.  
2.5.4 Novel Genomic assay for “BRCAness” 
Aim: To build a genomic assay for identifying BRCAness in clinical samples to identify 
genomically-driven mechanisms of sensitivity to PARP inhibition. 
 Homologous recombination pathways have been  described in great detail, both in model 
organisms as well as in human cancer. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_182549]-based repair , assays that reliably detect 
homologous recombination repair deficiency are still lacking. Therefore we will develop and 
perfect a sensitive DNA sequencing-based diagnostic of HR defects. Towards this goal, we will 
obtain whole-exome sequencing (WES) in various cancer that harbor mutations (germline or bialleleic somatic) in key DNA-repair genes.

2.5.5 Factors demonstrating synthetic lethality wi th PARP inhibitors in gastric cancers. 
Aim 1: Investigate the role of key signal tran sduction pathways in regulating the DNA damage 
response pathway in gastric cancer cell line models. Aim 2: Unbiased iden tification of modifier s of responsiveness to  PARP inhibitors.  
Aim 3: Test effects of PARP i nhibitors alone or in combinatio n with other agents (based on 
results of Aims 1 and 2) in pa tient-derived xe nograft models. 
 It has become clear that signaling through onc ogenic pathways result  in activation of DNA 
damage checkpoint response pathways. For exampl e, acute expression of  oncogenic RAS results 
in activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pa thways, which is mediated by [CONTACT_182607], CHK 1/2 [74, 75]. In agreement with this, inhibition of CK1 
activation results in enhanced  sensitivity to DNA-damaging cy totoxic agents [76]. Emerging 
evidence demonstrates that components of th e DNA damage checkpoint response are regulated 
through RAS effector pathways. In particular the PI3 kinase pathway has been demonstrated to 
regulate ATM activity. This effect  was enhanced by [CONTACT_751]-inhibition of MEK and PI3 kinase in a 
melanoma model [77]. A possibl e role of the RAF-MEK-ERK pa thway in regulating DDR is 
further supported by [CONTACT_182608]-Phase Pr otein Analysis. In contrast to other cancers of the GI system, 
RAS oncogenes are rarely mutated in gastric cancer s and the role and regulation of specific DDR 
components through oncogenic signal transduction pr ocesses in this disease is poorly understood 
[14]. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will investigate th e role of key signal transduction pathways in 
regulating the DNA damage response pathway in gastric cancer cell line models. We will further 
seek to identify new markers of sensitivity to PA RP inhibition in gastric cancer in an unbiased 
fashion. Previous work performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ashw orth and colleagues identified such markers 
(including NBS1, TDG, XPA, and MK2 ) in breast cancer models using a multi-dimensional set of 
genomic and RNA expression data [78] . Since this correlative approach  is limited in its ability to 
predict causality, we will focus in Aim [ADDRESS_215673] the effects of PARP inhibitors al one or in combination with other agents in PDX 
models. These models overcome limitation of  cell line derived in vivo models (loss of 
characteristics of the parent tumor, lack of clin ical annotation, and the limited representation of 
genotypes and subtypes) and closely resemble co nditions in human tumors. As part of an 
ongoing effort, [CONTACT_182688]’s gr oup at Memorial Sloan Ketteri ng Cancer Center (MSKCC) has 
been able to implant 131 tumor samples from patients with esopha gogastric cancers in mice were 
so far, with 32 resulting in established PDX tu mors. Engraftment rates were 46% (orthotopic) 
and 26% (subcutaneous). Both normal and tu mor patient DNA from patients and PDX tumor 
DNA are being analyzed by [CONTACT_182609]. Data so  far demonstrate 
consistently that primary and PDX tumors exhibit similar hist ology, mutational profile, and copy 
number plots, suggesting that P DXs represent the tumo rs from which they are derived. To date, 
[ADDRESS_215674] been analyzed with tumo rs clustering with the CIN subtype, 1 with the

representing BRCAness genotypes.  2.5.6 T Cell receptor diversity. 
Aim: To define the T cell receptor diversity of gastric cancer patients with and without BRCAness.  
Humans generate T cells with a circulating divers ity of > [ADDRESS_215675] this hypothesis, we will perform 
next-generation T-cell receptor sequencing on bot h fresh tumor samples and blood from patients 
with gastric cancer to assess both  of these compartments. T cells see antigen through their TCR, 
which is comprised of two subunits, Įand a ȕ. Each is generated by a VDJ recombination event 
resulting in a broad range of T cell cl ones with different specificities. The ȕ subunit has greater 
clonal diversity. We have used next-gen eration sequencing of the T cell receptor ȕ chain (TCR ȕ) 
to define the diversity and frequency of T cell cl ones in the blood of cancer patients. The Fong 
lab has demonstrated that CTLA -4 blockade induces global rem odeling of the T cell repertoire 
[79]. We found that anti-CTLA -4 administration promotes active turnover in the T cell 
repertoire, which increases with sequential treatments, and a net result of increased repertoire diversity overall. These change s occurred both in naïve and non-na ïve T cells, the latter of which 
includes the antigen-exper ienced effector T cell population. In terestingly, maintenance of high-
frequency clonotypes (greater than 1 in 1000) wa s associated with cl inical response and 
improved overall survival foll owing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. We have sin ce sequenced blood from patients 
with localized prostate cancer, metastatic castr ation resistant prostate  cancer, or age-matched 
healthy men without cancer. We find  that men with prostate can cer have a significantly more 
diverse T cell repertoire (i.e. lowe r clonality index). This finding would indicate that cancer can 
induce the diversification of the pool of circulating T cell clon es in these patients. In this study, 
TCR diversity will be measured by [CONTACT_182610] r of unique TCR, the distribution of TCR 
frequency, and the Shannon’s diversity index [79]. We will also determin e through these studies 
whether the circulating T cell repertoire is reflective of the T cells within the tumor 
microenvironment.

4.3 Patient Registration 
 4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS 
 
Patient enrollment will be fa cilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web-based registration syst em available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System  for regulatory and ro ster data interchange 
and with the Theradex Interactive Web Respons e System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, 
Medidata Rave.  For trials with slot reservation requirement s, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availa bility.  Registration staff s hould ensure that a slot is 
available and secured for the patient  before completing an enrollment.  
 The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmati on of registration and 
treatment information.  Pl ease print this confirmati on for your records.

For the phase 1 dose escalation, olaparib dosing will be increased in a 3+3 dose 
escalation with doses of 200mg and 300mg twic e daily (See 6.0). In phase 2, after biopsy 
for the BROCA-HR panel patients will receiv e olaparib dose TBD within [ADDRESS_215706] udy due to P450 interactions.  
 If difficulty tolerating oral me dications and vomiting occurs  the vomited dose should not

to take the dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that normally scheduled dose time, but 
if greater than 2 hours the patient should wait until their next allotted dose time.

5.1.3 Ramucirumab 
 
For both the phase 1 dose escalation and the phase 2, ramucirumab will be dosed at 8 
mg/kg on day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Ramuciru mab at the appropriate dose level will be 
delivered intravenously over 60 minutes (+/- 15 minutes) through either  a peripheral IV 
or central line. (Please refer to the ramucirumab package insert). 
 5.1.4 Premedication for Ramucirumab 
 Premedication is required for all patients prior to each infusion of ramucirumab. The 
recommended agents are hista mine (H1) antagonist s, such as diphenhydramine chloride. 
Additional premedication may be  given at the inve stigator’s discretion (please refer to 
ramucirumab package insert). All premedicati on administered must be  documented in the

 5.2  Dose Escalation 
 A 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used for olap arib in phase 1 with a plan to only escalate by 
[CONTACT_30560]. A definition of adverse events is included at the bottom of this section. 
Management and dose modifications  associated with adverse ev ents are outlined further in 
Section 6 . With a 3+3 dose escalation design if no dos e-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed a 
total of [ADDRESS_215707] cohort the study would de-escalate the dose. There are 2 
dose levels below the starting dose (dose level -1  and dose level -2), and this could take a 
maximum of 18 patients if DLTs were seen at all dose levels. A schema for the 3+[ADDRESS_215708] udy will be an increase of one dose level to 
olaparib 300 mg twice daily, which is the maximu m tolerated dose per the olaparib IB. Even if 
no DLTs are observed, the dose of olaparib wi ll not be increased be yond 300 mg twice daily 
(dose level 2) in this study.   The DLT evaluation period is 28 days and dose escalation will proceed according to the 
following scheme and DLT definitions are define d below. A patient is evaluable for DLT if 
he/she receives 2 doses (100%) of  ramucirumab and 45 doses (80%) of olaparib within the first 
28 days OR he/she experiences a DLT. If this minimum amount of treatment is not reached due 
to treatment related AEs, this is considered a DLT. However, patients who fail to achieve this minimum amount of treatment  due to reasons that are clearly unr elated to treatment (e.g. error on 
part of patient or outside physician) would be replaced. 
 Due to the non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_182552] 15 to 25%. The doses of olaparib and ramuciru mab will not be increased beyond 
the previously established maxima lly tolerated doses as described in the respective investigator 
brochures. In the REGARD study, which evaluated ramucirumab mono therapy in gastric cancer, 
it was well tolerated with no increase in  grade 3 AEs as compared to placebo. Similarly in

  5.5 Safety Monitoring 
 
x Laboratory safety assessment:  Full hematology assessments for safety (hemoglobin, red 
blood cells [RBC], placelets, mean cell volume [MCV], mean cell hemoglobin 
concentration [MCHC], mean cell hem oglobin [MCH], white blood cells [WBC], 
absolute differential white cell count (neu trophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils 
and basophils) and absolute neutrophil coun t or segmented neutrophil count and Band 
forms should be performed at each treatment  visit and when clinically indicated. If 
absolute differentials are not available, please provide % differentials. Coagulation 
[activated partial thromboplastin time {APTT} and international normalized ratio {INR}] 
will be performed at baseline and if clinically  indicated unless the patient is receiving 
warfarin. Patient taking warfarin may partic ipate in this study; however, it is 
recommended that prothrombi n time (INR and APTT) be monitored carefully at least 
once per week for the first month, th en monthly if the INR is stable. 
 
x Biochemistry assessment for safety (sodium , potassium, calcium, magnesium, glucose, 
creatinine, total bilirubin, gamma glutamy ltransferase [GGT], alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], urea or blood urea 
nitrogen [BUN], total protein, albumin and l actic dehydrogenase [LDH]). All should be 
performed at each treatment visit.  
 
x Urinalysis by [CONTACT_182616]. A urine dipstick for protein 
should be performed for on treatment  visits or full urinalysis may be obtained if clinically 
indicated. Microscopic analysis  should be performed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local laboratory if 
required.   
x Bone marrow or blood cytogenetic samples should be collected for patients with 
prolonged hematologic toxicities. 
 
These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local laboratory. Additional analyses may be 
performed if clinically indicated. Any clinical  significant abnormal laboratory values should

EKGs are required within [ADDRESS_215718] 5 minutes in each case.  The investigator or designate d physician will review the paper 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_76326] 12-lead EKGs on each  of the study days when they are collected. 
 
EKGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec. All EKGs  should be assessed by [CONTACT_182617] / not clini cally significantly abnormal. If 
there is a clinically significan t abnormal finding, the Investigator will reco rd it as an AE. The 
original EKGs must be stored in the patient medical record as source data. 
 
x Serum or urine pregnancy test: 
 
Two pregnancy tests on blood or urine samp les will be performed for pre-menopausal 
women of childbearing potential, one within 28 days pr ior to the start of  study treatment, and 
the other on Day 1 of the study prior to comm encing treatment. Tests will be performed by 
[CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local laboratory. If results are positive the patient is ineligible/must be discontinued from the study. In the event of a suspected pregnancy dur ing the study, the test 
should be repeated.  
 
x Bone marrow or blood cytogenetic analysis:  
 
Bone marrow or blood cytogenetic analysis may be performed according to standard 
hematological practice for patients with prol onged hematological t oxicities. Bone marrow 
analysis should include an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_182555], cytogeneti c analysis and flow 
cytometry, and a score biopsy for bone marrow cellularity. If it is not possible to conduct 
cytogenetic analysis or flow cy tometry on the bone marrow aspi [INVESTIGATOR_337], then attempts should be 
made to carry out the tests on a blood sample . If findings are consistent with MDS/AML, 
study drug should be discontinued a nd a full description of findi ngs should be submitted with 
an SAE report. Presence or absence of blood  cytogenetic abno rmalities and flow cytometry 
will be documented on the clinical database.

 Events of nausea and vomiting ar e known to be associated with  olaparib treatment. In study 
D0810C00019 nausea was reported in 71% of the olaparib treated patients and 36% in the 
placebo treated patients and vomi ting was reported in 34% of the olaparib treated patients and 
14% in the placebo treated patients. These events  are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE grade 
1 or 2) severity, intermittent and manageable on continued treatment. Th e first onset generally 
occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea  and within the first 6 months of treatment for 
vomiting. For nausea, the inciden ce generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting at 
around 6 to 7 months.  As per international guidance on anti-emetic use in cancer patients (ESMO, NCCN), generally a 
single agent antiemetic should be considered.

 57 Hemorrhage and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) 
Hemorrhage and arterial thromboembolic even ts have been observed with ramucirumab. 
Ramucirumab will be permanently discontinued in  patients who experience these types of 
events.  Management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms   If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dys pnoea) or radiological abnormalities occur in 
the absence of a clear diagnosis , an interruption in study treatme nt dosing is recommended and 
further diagnostic workup (including a high resolution CT scan ) should be performed to exclude 
pneumonitis. Following investigation, if no evidence of abno rmality is observed on CT imaging and symptoms 
resolve, then study treatment ca n be restarted, if de emed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. If 
significant pulmonary abnor malities are identified, these need  to be discussed with the Study 
Physician.”  Olaparib adverse events of special interest  Adverse events of special interested [AESI] are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the further understanding of ol aparib’s safety profile and re quire close monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_182622]. An AESI  may be serious or non-serious. Adverse 
Events of Special Interest for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks of MDS/AML, new 
primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis.  
 ANY event of MDS/AML, new primary malignanc y, or pneumonitis should be report to CTEP 
whether it is concered a non-se rious AE [eg non-melanoma skin cancer] or SAE, and regardless 
of investigator’s assessment of causal ity or knowledge of the treatment arm. 
 A questionnaire may be sent to any investigator reporti ng an AESI, as an aid to provide further 
detailed information on the even t. During the study th ere may be other events identified as 
AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help characte rize the event and gain a better 
understanding regarding the relationship between the event and study treatment. 
 There are currently no identified OAEs for olaparib.   Overdose of olaparib  There is currently no specific treatment in th e event of overdose with olaparib and possible 
symptoms of overdose are not established.  Olaparib must only be used in accordance with  the dosing recommendations in this protocol. 
Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen specified in this protocol 
should be reported as an overdose. Adverse reacti ons associated with overdose should be treated 
symptomatically and should be managed appropri ately. An overdose with associated AEs should 
be recorded.

    Interruptions for intercurrent non-toxicity related events 
 Study treatment dose interruption fo r conditions other than toxicity  resolution should be kept as 
short as possible. If a patient cannot started study treatment within 4 weeks for resolution of 
intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or toxici ty, the case should be discussed 
with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_182567].  All dose reductions and interruptions (includi ng any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions are to be recorded. Study  treatment should be stopped at least 3 days 
prior to planned surgery. Afte r surgery study treatment can be  restarted when the wound has 
healed. No stoppage of study treatment is re quired for any needle biopsy procedure. 
 Study treatment should be discon tinued for a minimum of 3 days  before a patient undergoes 
radiation treatment. Study treatme nt should be restarted within  4 weeks as long as any bone 
marrow toxicity has recovered.   Because the AEs related to olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, patients should 
be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if thes e symptoms occur.  
   7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Sections 7.2 and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires ex pedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) in  addition to routine reporting.  
 7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks Lists (CAEPRs)  
 The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE)  associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].  In additi on to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs, 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Re porting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text.  The SPEER is a list of  events that are protocol-
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, 
NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDev elopment/adverse_effects.htm for further clarification.  
 
NOTE :  The highest grade currently reported is no ted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.  Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditious ly.  If this CAEPR is part of a

A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigationa l agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 CTEP requires all secondary mali gnancies that occur fo llowing treatment with  an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CT EP-AERS.  Three options are available to 
describe the event:   
x Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
x Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
x Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer trea tment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.

7.6 Second Malignancy 
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to th e treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the init ial malignancy).  Sec ond malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified.   8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION

iron oxide black.  Storage: Store in a secure locatio n below 30° C (86° F).  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return olaparib (AZD2281) to room 
temperature and quarantine the supplies.  Provide  a detailed report of th e excursion (including 
documentation of temperatur e monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
[EMAIL_087]  for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:  Shelf-life studies are ongoing. Sites are not permitted to re-package tablets. Sites are 
not permitted to re -package tablets. Once the bottle is opene d, olaparib tablets must be used 
within 3 months of the opening date; unused tablet s should be discarded. Inst ruct patients not to 
open a bottle until they are ready to use it.  Route  and Method  of Administration:   Oral. Take tablets with out regard to meals.  
 Potential Drug Interactions:  In vivo  data indicate that CYP3A4/5  is important for olaparib 
metabolism and clearance in  humans. For this reason, avoid co ncomitant administr ation of strong 
and moderate CYP 3A4/5 inducers and inhibitors .  Consult the protocol document or study 
investigator prior to making a ny dose adjustments related to potential drug-drug interactions. 
 In vitro data shows olaparib is a substrate for P-glyc oprotein (P-gp), but not for organic anion-
transporting polype ptides (OATP1B1 and OA TP1B3), organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), multi-
drug resistance protein 2 (MRP-2) efflux transporte r or breast cancer resi stance protein (BCRP). 
Administration of strong P-gp inhibitors and indu cers should be avoided wi th concurrent olaparib.   
 
Based on in vitro  data, olaparib inhibits CYP 3A4 and UGT1A1 enzyme systems and induces CYP 
1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 and potentially induces CY P 2C9, 2C19 and P-gp . Therefore, avoid 
concomitant administration of se nsitive substrates, particularly those with narrow therapeutic 
ranges.   
 
Olaparib is also an inhibito r of P-gp, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT 2, OAT3, multi-drug and toxin 
extrusion proteins (MAT E1 and MATE2K) and a w eak inhibitor of BRCP, but  not an inhibitor of 
OATP1B3 or MRP-2. In vitro  studies suggest that olaparib may increase exposure of substrates of 
these transport systems, although the clinical relevance is not clear. The manufacturer recommends 
that statins, in particular, sh ould be administered with caution when given concomitantly with 
olaparib.  Live virus and live bacterial vacc ines should not be administered whilst the patien t is receiving 
study medication and during the 30 day follow up pe riod. An increased risk of infection by [CONTACT_182626] a nd bacterial vaccines has been observed with conventional 
chemotherapy drugs and the effects with olap arib are unknown. The efficacy of hormonal

 67 contraceptives may be reduced if co administered with olaparib. 
 Patient Care Implications: Pre-clinical data indicate that olap arib adversely affects embryofetal 
survival and development. Therefore,  women of child-bearing  potential and their partners should 
agree to use two (2) highly effect ive forms of contraception throug hout study participation and for 
at least one (1) month after the last  dose of olaparib.  It is not kn own whether olaparib is found in 
seminal fluid, so as a precaution,  male study participants must use a condom during treatment and 
for three (3) months after the last  dose and should avoid fathering a child or donating sperm during 
this same time period. Th e study investigator shou ld discuss the most appropriate forms of highly 
effective contraceptive me thods for each patient.  
 Lactation is a protocol exclusion criterion and not advised since there is potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breastfed in fants. Advise lactating women to not breastfeed during study treatment and 
for one (1) month after receiving the last dose of olaparib.  
 Because the adverse events related to olaparib  may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, 
patients should be advised to use cau tion while driving or using machinery. 
 
There are no data on the effect of olaparib  on wound healing, therefore as a precaution, 
olaparib treatment should be stopped at least 3 days prior to planned surgery. After surgery 
olaparib can be restarted when the wound has heale d. No stoppage of olapar ib is required for any 
needle biopsy procedure. 
 
Study treatment should be discon tinued for a minimum of 3 days  before a patient undergoes 
therapeutic or pal liative radiation treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks 
as long as any bone marrow  toxicity has recovered.

use. Keep the vial in the outer ca rton in order to pr otect from light. DO NOT FREEZE OR 
SHAKE  the vial. 
 
 
Solution preparation  (how the dose is to be prepared):  
Inspect vial contents for particul ate matter and discolor ation prior to dilution. Discard the vial, if 
particulate matter or disc olorations are identified. Store vials in a refrigerat or at 2°C to 8°C (36°F 
to 46°F) until time of use. Keep  the vial in the outer carton in  order to protect from light.  
• Calculate the dose and the requ ired volume of ramucirumab n eeded to prepare the infusion 
solution. Vials contain either 100 mg/10 mL or 5 00 mg/50 mL at a concentration of 10 mg/mL 
solution of ramucirumab.  • Withdraw the required volume of ramucirumab and further d ilute with only 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection in an intravenous infusion co ntainer to a final volum e of 250 mL. Do not use 
dextrose containing solutions.  • Gently invert the container to ensure adequate mixing.  
• DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other solutions or 
co-infuse with other elect rolytes or medications.  
• Store diluted infusion for no more than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) or 4 hours at 
room temperature (below 25°C [77°F]).  • Discard vial with any unus ed portion of ramucirumab. 
 Route of administration:  Visually inspect the diluted solu tion for particul ate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration. If particulate matter or discolorations  are identified, discard 
the solution. Administer diluted ramucirumab infusion via infusion pump over 60 minutes (+/- 
15 minutes) through a separate in fusion line. Use of a protein sparing 0.22 micron filter is 
recommended. Flush the line with sterile sodium ch loride (0.9%) solution for injection at the end 
of the infusion.  Prior to each ramucirumab infusion, premedicate a ll patients with an intr avenous histamine H1 
antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride). Fo r patients who have experienced a Grade 1 
or 2 infusion-related reaction, also premedi cate with dexamethasone (or equivalent) and 
acetaminophen prior to e ach ramucirumab infusion.

 9.1 Integral Laboratory or Imaging Studies 
Not applicable  
 9.2 Integrated Correlative Studies 
 9.2.1 BROCA-HR  (Integrated Biomarker) 
To assess correlation of response and effect of  homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) 
status, the BROCA-HR assay, esta blished by [CONTACT_182627]. In addition 
to testing the tumors, a blood sample will be  obtained at baseline for germline BROCA-HR 
testing. Somatic BROCA-HR testing will be done using the baseline tumor biopsy tissue on all 
pre-treatment biopsy specimens. The prevalence of biomarkers and correlation with response 
will be used to plan subsequent study as described in section [ADDRESS_215741]. Thus, loss of HR is not by [CONTACT_182628], sufficient for sensitivity to a PARP 
inhibitor, and an accurate predictor of res ponsiveness could require assessment of many 
components of both the HR and non-homologous end joining pathwa ys. A more efficient assay, 
which would not require a prior knowledge of the critical elements of these DNA repair 
pathways, would instead measure DNA repair  capacity. Recent ev idence suggests that 
BRCA1/BRCA2 deficient cancers exhibit global DNA alterations termed “genomic scarring” 
that are consistent with their reliance on non-homologous end joining. Th is genome scar could 
serve as a downstream functiona l output to measure DNA repair capacity, indicative of both HR 
deficiency and non-homologous end joining profic iency. The BROCA-HR panel will be applied 
to the tumor samples as an integrated biomarker to  evaluate if “genomic scarring” is present in 
the tumor samples. Additiona l detail is provided in 2.4.1. 
 DNA will be extracted from peri pheral blood mononuclear cells and FFPE archived tumor tissue 
containing at least 30% tumor nuclei. A target ed capture and massively  parallel sequencing 
approach called BROCA-HR will be applied to sa mples. For the proposed study, the most recent 
version of BROCA-HR panel with [ADDRESS_215742]. Paired-end libraries with

custom pool of oligonucleotides targeting genomic regions as pr eviously described using the 
SureSelectXT enrichment system on a Bravo liq uid-handling instrument (Agilent). Following

 9.3 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies 
 9.3.1 Immunoassay for Poly-ADP-Ribosylated (PAR) Substrates 
 The immunoassay for PAR substrates will be pe rformed on all [ADDRESS_215745] treatment biopsy 
specimens. The PARP enzyme creates poly- ADP-ribosylated (PAR) molecules, thus an 
immunoassay was developed to measure PAR as  a surrogate for PARP inhibition. Abbot 
Laboratoies and the NCI-Frederick developed a cross-validated quantitative immunoassay for 
poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) substrate. The assa y dynamic range is 31-2000 pg/ml PAR with a 
lower limit of quantitati on of 15 pg/ml PAR. The assay uses high, midrange, and low controls 
produced from the human melanoma line Colo8 29. Specimen handling was optimized for both 
PBMCs and tumor needle biopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (18 gauge), and harmonized for use with the same standard 
and controls. Specimens could be subjected to at least 3 freeze-thaw cycles without a detectable 
loss of antigen binding. Assay preci sion was determined at both A bbott and the NCI-Frederick to 
be better than 80%. Accuracy, as assessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_182574] 100% +/- 20%. Assay dilution linearity was established for the 
Colo829 controls and tumor lysa tes, although deviations from linearity are observed in some 
tumor homogenates, and assay conditions are contro lled to compensate for the lack of linearity. 
The validated assay has been used to measure PA R levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
in healthy donors, and will be used to measur e PAR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
tumor biopsies in the proposed protocol.

 9.3.2 Signature 3  
Collection, Handling, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_25481]: 
 Signature 3 testing will be done on all pre-trea tment biopsies for anal ysis as a potential 
biomarker. The results of signatu re 3 testing will be correlated  with ORR, and other potential 
biomarkers including the BROCA-H R panel and signature 3 testi ng The following description of 
the biomarker testing for this was prepared at the recommendation of Drs. James Tricoli and Tracy Lively at the NCI, who were consulted about the form this part of th e protocol should take.  
Because much of the DNA-Based Mutation Assay Template does not fit next generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor DNA, they suggested that  a separate, full desc ription of the proposed 
testing be submitted along with a copy of th e DNA-Based Mutation Assay Template competed to 
the extent possible for a study involving NGS. 
 
Whole exome screening of DNA from gastric tumors  for the signature 3 mu tational pattern will 
be performed in the Yale Clinical Molecu lar Pathology Laboratory (YCMP Lab) on tissue 
microdissected from histologic sect ions of gastric tumor specimens. These sections will be cut 
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE ) blocks and mounted unstained on glass 
microscope slides.  One of the se ctions adjacent to those cut fo r microdissection will be stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin and ex amined by a pathologist ([CONTACT_162310]) to assess tumor content, 
location of the tumor cells within the section, and the extent, if pr esent, of necrosis, hemorrhage, 
or any other potentially interfer ing features or conditions.  Th e areas containing concentrated 
tumor cell populations in the stained slide will be circled and the corresponding regions in the 
unstained slides manually microdiss ected with a sterile scalpel blad e.  In cases for which manual 
microdissection is not ade quate, for instance, due to small cl usters of tumor cells distributed 
within stroma or other non-malignant tissue, la ser-capture microdissection will be carried out.  
The goal for this pre-analytic part  of the testing is to obtain, ei ther by [CONTACT_182630]-capture 
microdissection, starting material th at is enriched for tumor cells to the level of at least 70% 
tumor.  Enrichment of tumor prior to sequencing increases th e sensitivity of the sequencing, 
which will be important because of the reduced read depth inherent in whole exome sequencing 
(WES). 
 
DNA will be extracted from these tissues using the Qiagen FFPE DNA Tissue Kit.  Additionally, 
normal DNA from the patient will be obtained from buccal swabs or  from histologically normal 
tissue, free of tumor.  WES of tumor and normal DNA will be conducted in parallel using the Ion 
Torrent whole exome platform.  Libraries of DNA fragments for sequenci ng will be constructed 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 73 by [CONTACT_182631].  
Libraries for tumor and normal DNA will be built separate ly incorporating s hort oligonucleotide 
sequences at the end of the fragments to “bar code” the DNA fragments from the two sources.  
(Since the libraries generate d from tumor and normal DNA w ill be mixed and sequenced 
together, barcoding is necessary to disambiguate  the results for tumor and normal DNA when the 
sequence results are analyzed.)  Input for the initial amplification dur ing library building (18 
cycles of PCR) will be 60 ng of genomic tumor DNA and 20 ng of normal DNA (lower for 
normal DNA because of less need for read depth and analytic sensitivity ), distributed among [ADDRESS_215747] oplets within water-oil em ulsions (all performed 
using the Ion Chef instrument), su ch that the great majority of beads are decorated with a pure, 
clonal population of amplicons.  Sequencing of the DNA amplicons on beads will be carried out 
with P1 v3 sequencing chips (each containing >165 million sensor well s each capable of 
sequencing amplicons attached to a single bead) on a Proton sequencer, or with Ion [ADDRESS_215748]; however, the greater likelihood is that the P1/P roton system will be used becau se it is cheaper.  With highly 
efficient sequencing chip loading that achieved in the YCMP Lab (occupation of ~90% of wells 
in the P1 chip), the mean read depth is expected to exceed 200x for the tumor DNA and 
proportionately lower for the norma l control.  Using the newer HiQ chemistry, average fragment 
lengths should be about 250 nucleotides for a bout 3.2 megabases of total DNA, covering about 
98% of the exome.   
 
The raw sequencing results will be aligned to  the hg19 reference genom e and variants called 
using Torrent Suite, Ion Reporter,  and custom software develope d at Yale.  Those variants 
deemed somatic by [CONTACT_182632], will be 
evaluated for signature 3 sequences, using an algo rithm designed in house,  specifically for this 
purpose.  Mutations in critical genes and a sa mpling of signature 3 mu tations (a sampling only 
because of the high volume of such mutations e xpected per case) will be manually checked as a 
quality control, in addition to review of overall quality metrics produced by [CONTACT_182633].  
 
The Ion Platform system affords a particular a dvantage relative to Illu mina sequencing for the 
research proposed in this LOI. Ion Torrent ha s pi[INVESTIGATOR_182575] (for instance,  ~24,,000 amplicons per 
primer pool to cover the entire exome).  This approach generally  means that smaller amounts of 
starting DNA are needed for sequencing, includi ng for WES—a critical consideration when 
dealing with clinical samples, which often consis t of core needle biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_182576] r a variety of diagnostic tests and analyses.  The theoretical 
disadvantage of Ion Torrent is lo wer throughput.  To increase read  depth and horizontal coverage 
across the exome, an entire sequenci ng chip will be used for each ca se (tumor plus paired normal 
control from the same patient).  Illumina flow cells accommodat e more cases per run, but this 
difference is negated by [CONTACT_3433] e fact that cases for th e proposed trial will come  in one at a time and 
batching will not be possible, to achieve a turnaround time for returning sequencing results 
within 10 days of receipt of the specimen in th e YCMP Lab, which is the intent for biomarker 
analysis in this trial.  Both Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing are asso ciated with systematic 
sequencing errors—Illumina related to CG-ri ch regions and Ion Torrent related to

 74 homopolymeric regions of seque nce.  The YCMP Lab has ex tensive experience with the 
bioinformatics to interpret Ion Torrent sequencing and the identifi cation of artifacts, both through 
the development out of the Yale Tumor Profil ing Lab (see below), from which the YCMP Lab 
was spun off, and through the NCI-MATCH trial for which the YCMP Lab is one of the four 
national sequencing centers.  Furthermore, the pa rallel sequencing of nor mal paired DNA permits 
discrimination and elimination of many of th ese artifacts encountered with Ion Torrent 
sequencing. 
 
Validation for feasibility, clinical sensitivity, sp ecificity, limit of detec tion, reproducibility, and 
fit for purpose will be carried out using control samples that are available to the YCMP Lab from 
the Yale Tumor Profiling Lab, which was founde d by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sklar six years ago, and performs 
routine clinical NGS of tumor DNA using a variet y of gene panels, including a 409-gene panel 
that contains analyzes most known cancer-rela ted genes. Among the cases that have been 
sequenced and are available as controls, ar e a sizable number that contain verified BRCA1/2  
mutations or lack mutations in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_215749] number of potential varian ts that are possible within the human genome 
presents a problem for validati on of biomarker detection by [CONTACT_077], compared, for instance, to 
validation of a single variant or small set of vari ants located within one or two genes.  We will 
take two approaches to this problem.  One will be to sequence the DNA from 12 FFPE samples 
(preferably gastric carcinomas), the DNA of which has either been large gene panel sequenced or 
undergone WES.  We will select these cases to cont ain a variety of differe nt types of mutations: 
VLQJOHQXFOHRWLGHYDULDQWV619V VPDOOLQVHUWLRQVDQGGHOHWLR QVLQGHOVEDVHSDLUVODUJHU
indels (>4 basepairs), and gene am plifications.  However, for this  validation and trial, the most 
relevant variants will be SNVs because signat ure 3 mutations represent a subset of SNVs.  
Additionally, six of the FFPE cases will be ones that contain mutations of BRCA1  or 2, both to 
confirm that mutations in these genes can be detected in FFPE tissues and that the signature 3 
pattern of mutation normally associated with muta tions of BRCA1/2 can be  accurately discerned. 
 
The second approach will be to perform WES on DNA of eight from established HAPmap cell 
lines in which all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been determined previously and 
are available from commercial and other sources.  Some of them have been used in the NCI-
MATCH sequencing validations and ar e already in the lab.  These cel ls lines will be prepared as 
cell pellets, fixed in 10% buffere d formalin, and embedded in paraff in, to simulate FFPE tissue.  
The rationale for using HAPmap cell lines is to evaluate the sequenc ing system being utilized as 
efficiently and thoroughly as pos sible for its ability to detect  variants thro ughout the exome. 
 
Validation for specificity will be combined with sensitivity testing to show that false negative 
variants are detected at a minimum  in the 20 samples studied for cl inical sensitivity by [CONTACT_38245].  A 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 75 sampling of apparent false negative varian ts that cannot be eliminated by [CONTACT_182634]. 
 
Limit of detection will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_182635] (e.g., 50%, 25%, 12.5% , 6.25%, and 3.12%) to determine the lowest 
concentration at which confirme d variants within the FFPE D NA can still be detected.  The 
expected level is 5-10%, given th e mean average read depth of 200x. 
 
Validation of reproducibility will be conducted by [CONTACT_182636].  
These three repetitions will be performed on differ ent days, which is required due to the capacity 
of the Proton sequencer, but also serves as a tr uer test of reproducibilit y.  Additionally, over the 
course of the trial, DNA from th e same HAPmap sample will be analyzed after every twentieth 
case to check for cont inued reproducibility.  
 
Fit for purpose validation of the entire biomarker workflow will be carried out by [CONTACT_182637] 10-day window.  Optimally, we will try to have 
this performed on samples that have been extens ively sequenced elsewhere.  Alternatively, we 
can mail to ourselves samples from which the DNA has previously  been sequenced at Yale.

 Through our involvement in the PanCancer genomic s project, we have direct access to the 
combined germline and somatic data form 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types [80] [81] . 
These are exome data derived from TCGA. A pproximately 150 of th ese exomes are form 
germline carriers of mutant BRCA 1/ [ADDRESS_215751] that can 
identify not only germline variants in BRCA family genes, but to also identify genomic scarring 
based on LOH/HRD we need a test with suffic ient coverage to do both. We will run three 
algorithms on the TCGA germline BRCA 1/2 de ficient and disease-matched controls: The 
number of telomeric allelic im balances (NtAI), large scale transition (LST), and homologous 
recombination deficiency score (HRD-LOH) [82-84].  We will run all three assays on SN P data from the aforementioned  300 case / control sets and

forward first to the down sampling set, described below.  The most ideal scenario would be  if we had enough sequence data in  the panels that we use for 
allocation to clinical trials, such as that c onduced herein. This tria l will use the BROCA-HR 
panel, and whole exome sequencing data will be available for the signature [ADDRESS_215753](s) will then be validated by [CONTACT_182639]. DNA 
extracted from tissue sample s will be analyzed for the HR defe ct signature [CONTACT_182685]-associated genes identified by [CONTACT_3019]

cancer estimates that around 20% of  samples will score in the upper quartile of all three of these 
assays [85]. These estimates will then be availa ble for further analysis  such as supervised 
analytics looking at response to PARP, platinum , and other clinically observed characteristics. 
 Expected results: This aim will determine the ap plicability of clinically deployed sub-exome 
sequencing panels for the assessment of BRCAness using genomic measurements. 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]/alternative appr oaches: It is possible that the DNA footprint generate d by [CONTACT_182641]. In particul ar, the NtAI may not 
perform well because it requires telomeric seque nces, which are not well captured on sub-exome 
panels. If this were the case, and further fundi ng were obtained we coul d begin work on building 
a targeted addition to these tests, but that w ould increase costs and not be ideal for large 
population screening at major cancer centers.

results of this initial screen, a subset of cel ls with low and high DNA repair response to DNA

reproduce down-regulation of DNA repair activity by [CONTACT_976]3 kinase inhibitors, we will assess 
efficacy of these inhibitors in combination wi th PARP inhibitors +/- DNA damaging agents.

aims 1 and 2, in mice harboring xenograft tumors, we will assess treatment t oxicity in NOD scid 
mice. Groups of three mice will be treated wi th solvent (DMSO), single inhibitors (e.g. 
talazoparib or PD0325901), or the co mbination of both at three diffe rent dose levels. In the case 
of talazoparib and PD0325901, mice will be treated at dose levels 0.1, 0.22, and 0.33 mg/kg of 
talazoparib and 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg of PD0325901 resu lting in a 4 x 4 matrix requiring 32 mice 
per study. The maximum doses of both inhibitors that can be administere d without occurrence of 
severe toxicity will be chosen for subse quent studies. We will then proceed with 
pharmacodynamics studies to va lidate target inhibition by [CONTACT_182643]. Per individual tumor model, subcutaneous tumors will be 
generated in 6 mice and allowed to grow to a volume of 300 mm

the compounds (for example tala zoparib and PD0325901) or vehicle control buffer fo r three days 
at doses that were found to be safe in the toxi city studies. Animals will be sacrificed for hours 
following the last drug administration. Tumors a nd adjacent normal tissue will be harvested and 
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in buffe red formalin. Proteins will be extracted from 
frozen tissues using protocols esta blished at our laboratory. Phosphor ylation of effector proteins, 
including pERK, pAKT, and pPRAS40 will be dete rmined by [CONTACT_182644] (Odyssey, Licor). PARP inhibition will be assessed 
using the PARP in vivo PD Assay II kit (Trevige n). If no evidence of target inhibition is 
observed in any model for a given inhibitor, the respective experi ment will be repeated at a 
modified dose based on the toxicity study. Othe rwise, apoptosis induction will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_182645]. A Student t-test will  be used to determine statisti cal significance of differences 
between treated and control groups. Efficacy stud ies in primary PDA xenograft tumors will also 
be conducted. Having established optimal doses for efficient target inhibi tion, we plan efficacy 
studies in the selected PDX models. Endpoints for these studies will be tumor response rate and 
overall survival. Tumor size will be calculated  with biweekly caliper  measurements. Compounds 
will be administered daily by [CONTACT_182646]. Experi ments will be terminated on day [ADDRESS_215756] dimension. Relative tu mor growth inhibi tion (TGI) will be

treated with control (i.e. DM SO), single agents (for exampl e talazoparib and PD0235901), and 
drug combination. We will enroll [ADDRESS_215757] a 33% or greater growth inhibition with 80% power 
at a 5% level of significance. Experiments will be repeated once. Differences in response rates 
will be determined using Satterwaite’s t-test (une qual variances) with 1-sided 5% Type I error. 
Kaplan-Meier survival data will be analyzed using a log rank test. 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]/alterative appr oaches: The proposed experiments are likely to reveal new mechanisms 
involved in DNA homologous recombin ation repair that can be e xploited therapeutically. Our 
findings related to the intera ction of the RAF-MEK-ERK pa thway and PARP inhibitors 
sensitivity are an example of successful ap plication of the candidate pathway approach. 
However, the pathways of interest are highl y interconnected. Based on the findings of the 
experiments described, we might ex pand mechanistic analysis to be able to interpret findings. In 
such case we will utilize Reverse Phase Protei n Lysate Array technology as we have done 
before. We expect that CRISPR anal ysis will be technically feasib le and reveal new regulators of

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]/alternative appr oaches: As we have seen in panc reatic adenocarcinoma, BRCA2 carreirs 
can possess a higher number of neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. We anticipate that patients with the highest 
neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_182577] (e.g. with BRCAness phenotype) wi ll have a lower clonality indices (i.e. 
greater TCR diversity) in both the blood and the tumors. The tetramer sorting experiments will 
allow us to determine the relative contribution of  virus-specific T cells to the modulated immune 
responses with PARPi. However, the circulating T cell repertoire may not reflect what is going 
on in the tumors. Our approach will allow us to  determine whether the TCR repertoire in the 
blood can serve as a surrogate for the TCR repert oire in the tumor. We  may find that a high 
neoantigen burden could actually lead to increased clonality (i.e. decreased diversity) in tumors due to focusing of the immune response to th ese immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_182578]. Nevertheless our 
approach will be able to as sess for this alte rnative hypothesis. We do not anticipate any 
difficulties in performing these as says. These results would lay ra tionale for combinations with

with measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_182654].  For the purposes of this study, 
patients should be re-evaluated every week for th e first 3 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory s cans will also be obtained ever 6 weeks following 
initial documentation of an objective response. Patients on tr eatment for > 6 months may 
decrease the response assessment in terval to every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) at the discretion of the 
investigator.  11.[ADDRESS_215764] – Solid Tumors

leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleu ral/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast diseas e, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable.  Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurab le nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic me tastases can be considered as measurable

cystic lesions are present in the same patient,  these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.

 84 Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions shoul d be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the larg est lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circum stance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of th e diameters (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be in cluded in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the su m.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any ob jective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) in cluding any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target  lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measur ements of these lesions  are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of  Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and reco rded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be  performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than  4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same te chnique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_182656](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will onl y be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm FP  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.   Chest x-ray   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as  measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline ha s defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than  5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twi ce the slice thickness.  MRI is  also acceptable in certain 
situations ( e.g. for body scans).

resolution; however, there are many image acq uisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_182579], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is vari able globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Fu rthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.   It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters fo r all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type  of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 PET-CT  At present, the low dose or atte nuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal dia gnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can doc ument that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in  accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or  serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not usef ul in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound exa minations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date  and, because they ar e operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same techniqu e and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_182657], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is conc ern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used inst ead of CT in sele cted instances. 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of  these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such t echniques may be useful  to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtaine d or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be  used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal li mit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.   Specific guidelines for both  CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurren t prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Ca ncer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_215768]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be  used to differentia te between partial 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 86 responses (PR) and complete re sponses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic  origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable  tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between res ponse or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessme nts need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-P ET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (par ticularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified acco rding to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a posit ive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of  disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at  follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressi ng on the basis of the an atomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnorma lity is thought to re present fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this  circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol a nd supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both appr oaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or  non-target) must have reduc tion in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm).  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decreas e in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At  least a 20% increase in th e sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the sm allest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 87 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolu te increase of at le ast 5 mm (0.5 cm).  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more ne w lesions is also considered progressions). 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as refe rence the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions  and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  A ll lymph nodes must be non-pa thological in size (<10 mm 
[<1 cm] short axis).  Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patien t to be considered in co mplete clinical response. 
 Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or  more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above th e normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more ne w lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-ta rget lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump targ et lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase. 
 Although a clear progression of “non-target”  lesions only is ex ceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_182580] d prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_182658] (or Principal 
Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response  recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements record ed since the treatment star ted).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the ach ievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of  health status requir ing discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of di sease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be  made to document the 
objective pro gression even after discon tinuation of treatment.

 11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of  overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (w hichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is  objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurem ents recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, ta king as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 This is a phase [ADDRESS_215779] dose ra mucirumab. The primary 
objective of phase 1 is to deter mine the safe dose of olaparib w ith ramucirumab. Olaparib will be 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date: 6/2/2022  
 94 increased up to 300 mg twice daily in tablet  dosing. Based on published toxicity profiles for 
olaparib and ramucirumab outlined in section 5.2  the probability of DLT is in the range of 0.15 
to 0.25. The primary objective of phase 2 is to measure the ef ficacy for olaparib plus 
ramucirumab by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR). In pha se 2, 40 patients will be enrolled as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_182581] a biom arker stratification de sign in a larger study. 
Incidence rates for the BROCA-HR biomarker will be measured in all enrolled patients for both stages. If the incidence rate of the BROCA-HR biom arker is too low (<10%) or efficacy is seen 
it is unlikely we would not proceed to a larger  study. The historical control for ramucirumab 
monotherapy is an ORR of 3%, and we will assume a null hypothesis of 5%.   Primary Endpoints: Phase 1 : Dose limiting toxicity for olaparib in co mbination with ramucirumab and the maximum 
tolerated dose (or the maximum safe dose).  
Phase 2: Objective response rate by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 crit eria for combined therapy with olaparib 
and ramucirumab.  Analytic Plan for Primary Endpoints: Phase 1: A 3+3 dose escalating approach will be used  to determine what dose is the safe dose 
and should be used in the Phase 2 portion of the study. 
 Phase 2:   Because we do not know the true distribu tion of our biomarker we will proceed with 
this [ADDRESS_215780] in the BROCA-HR biomarker to be posi tive in approximately 35% of cases. These 
genes are: ATM, ATR, BARD1, BLM, BRCA 1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, 
PALB2, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D , RBBP8, SLX4, XRCC2, CDK 12. Based on the proposed 
prevalence of these genes we will enroll to 40 patients and proceed as follows: 
 Sample Size Justification: 
 
1. If there are 6 or more BROCA-HR+ patient s (34 or less BROCA-HR- patients): If 
there are no responses in BROCA-HR+ pa tients and no response in BROCA-HR- 
patients, then it is unlikely we will proceed to a larger study with this combination.

2. If there are 6 or more BROCA-HR+ pa tients (34 or fewer BROCA-HR-): For 
BROCA-HR- patients, the study  will require at least [ADDRESS_215781] 26 BROCA-HR- patients (65% incidence rate). The probability of 4

very unlikely the incidence rate of  BROCA-HR- will be less than 50%. 
 
3. If there are less than 6 BROCA-HR+ patients (35 or more BROCA-HR- patients):

Based upon the results in the above scenarios we will discuss with CTEP on the plan to proceed 
to a larger study.  Analysis Plan: 
 The objective response is define d as a complete or partial response, as determined by 
[CONTACT_182668] v 1.1 and confirmed by [CONTACT_182669] > 4 weeks 
after initial documentation. Patient s with missing or no response a ssessments are classified as 
non-responders. The ORR will be estimated using the 95% confidence interval (CI) based on 
Wilson’s method. A 5% 2-sided alpha will be used.  
The Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fi sher’s exact test will be ap plied to study the association 
between the response status and the continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The 
generalized non-linear model and l ogistic regression will be a pplied for multivariable data 
analysis. The adjusted p-value and 95% CI of the odds ration (OR) will be reported. 
 For the PAR assay and PDX generation involving bi opsy samples, the findings will be primarily 
hypothesis generating and will use descriptive stat istics. In addition, with the proposed sample 
size of 20, the half-width of the 90% CI will be  less than 20% with respect to the binary 
endpoint. It has at least 85% power  to detect a correlation coeffici ent > 0.5 with one-side type I

 13.3 Stratification Factors 
 
The patients will not be stratified by [CONTACT_182670], and all biomarkers are either integrated or 
exploratory. Subset analysis of primary, sec ondary, and exploratory endpoints will also be 
performed based on the presence or ab sence of the integrated biomarkers. 
 13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 Analytic Plan for Secondary Endpoints: 
x For lifetime data analysis, e.g., progression free survival and overall survival, the 
BROCA-HR status will be compared for dur ation of response surv ival with Kaplan-
Meier estimates and log-rank tests. The Rothma n confidence interval (CI), which is based 
on Greenwood’s variance, Thomas and Gr unkemeier CI, and the simultaneous 
confidence bands by [CONTACT_182671], will be reported. In addition, the 
possible risk factors wi ll be compared for survival with  log-rank test. For multivariate 
analysis, the proportional hazards Cox model wi ll be applied to investigate potential 
prognostic factors, such as age and stage of  disease of the PFS data. The adjusted p-
values of the hazard ratios and the adjusted 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]

 97 x Toxicity rates will be tabulated by [CONTACT_182672]. Ninety -five percent confidence in tervals will be calculated 
for each of these. 
 Analytic Plan for Exploratory Endpoints: 
x The association of BROCA HR assay with Signa ture 3 will be assessed using a series of 
contingency table analyses. For instance, we can examine the association of the presence 
of an individual mutation from the BROCA HR  panel with the signature 3 (yes/no) using 
Fisher’s exact test. Next, using a Cochran Mantel Haenzel test we can examine the 
relationship across the measures. Finally, we wi sh to examine the rela tionship of each of 
these measures with response. To do this mult iple logistic regressi on models can be fit 
with the response (CR/PR vs SD/PD) consider ed as the outcome variable and the 3 assay 
measures can be used predictors. This mode l can include interactions among the assays. 
Additional covariates including patient level charac teristics (age, gender) and group can 
be included in these models. These anal yses are exploratory therefore no formal 
adjustment for multiple comp arisons will be performed, however it is understood that 
these tests will be considered hypothesis generating primarily.  
 
x Tumor cells for PDX model, and biobanke d tumor tissue and peripheral blood will be 
used for future studies.

are major protocol treatment devi ations or if they are inelig ible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive  disease, 5) early death from  malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], cat egory 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
 All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response categori es 4-[ADDRESS_215784] a 
treatment failure (disease progr ession).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories 4-9 will be protocol specific.   All conclusions should be based on all eligib le patients.  Subanalyses may then be

discontinuation of treatment,  major protocol violations , etc.).  However, these 
subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment 
efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patien ts from the analysis should be clearly 
reported.  The 95% confidence interv als should also be provided.

Version Date: 6/2/[ADDRESS_215789]  Information for Patients, Their Caregivers, a nd Non-Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drug s and Herbal Supplements  
 The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug, olaparib. This clinic al trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_6808].  This form is addressed to the pati ent, but includes important information for others 
who care for this patient.   These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know: 
  Olaparib interacts with certain specific enzymes in  the liver and can effect  the ability to process 
other medications, and other medica tions can affect the ability of your body to  process olaparib. 
 Olaparib interacts with a certain specific enzy me in your liver called CYP 3A4 isoenzymes. The 
drug itself induces the CYP3A4 isozymes, and olaparib is broken down by [CONTACT_182680]. 
 Olaparib may also interact with P-glycopr otein, organic anion-tr ansporting polypeptide 
(OATPB1), organic cation transporter 1 and 2 (OCT1 and OCT2), OAT3, multi-drug and toxin 
extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K), and BRCP. Administration of strong inhibitors and 
inducers of these proteins shoul d be avoided while on olaparib. The manufacturer recommends 
that statins, in particular, s hould be administered w ith caution when given concomitantly with 
olaparib.  To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the 
attached information card in your wallet .   
 
Olaparib may interact with othe r drugs which can cause side effe cts. For this reason, it is very 
important to tell your study docto rs of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this 
clinical trial.  It is  also very important to tell your doc tors if you stop taking any regular 
medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part  in this study.  When you talk 
about your current medications  with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over-the-counter re medy), or any herbal suppleme nts such as St. John’s Wort. 
Avoid ingesting grapefruit, grap efruit juice, Seville oranges, and Seville orange juice while 
taking olaparib. It is helpful to  bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with 
you.  Many health care providers can write prescriptions.   You must tell all of your health care 
providers (doctors, physician assist ants, nurse practitioners, pharma cists) you are taking part in a 
clinical trial.   These are the things that you and they need to know:

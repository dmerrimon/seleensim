A. ABSTRACT  
 
Although numerous interventions have aimed to reduce re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748218] -dwelling older 
frail patients, fewer systematically developed interventions have aimed to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748219] (NHs) . One such program, the Interven tions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) 
program was designed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Joseph Ouslander and his colleagues. INTERACT is a comprehensive, multi -
level nursing staff training and quality improvement program designed to : help staff identify common 
clinica l signs that are precursors of conditions that frequently cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; communicate 
residents’ clinical conditions concisely and accurately to the physician ; and examine potentially 
avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. A multi -state evaluation of [ADDRESS_1023494] 
found an overall 17% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748220] a 24%  reduction  among the [ADDRESS_1023495] program for reducing avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], it has not been 
adapted to or tested in VA Community Living Centers (CLCs) . Such a program is ripe for implementation 
in the VHA because it is an integrated delivery system without conflicting payment incentives across 
providers. The goal of this study is to implement and evaluate an intervention in VHA CLCs that is 
designed to improve the care of Veter ans using CLCs who experience acute changes in their condition 
and at the same time reduce their rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We are guided by [CONTACT_748439] s’ clinical problems earli er, 
help evaluate and safely initiate management of acute conditions in the CLC, communicate more 
effectively with physicians about Veterans’ conditions and thereby [CONTACT_748440][INVESTIGATOR_059]. To 
test these hypotheses, the following specific aims w ill be undertaken:  
1. To characterize VHA CLCs in terms of alternate measures of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748221] -acute 
care Veterans, including Medicare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and to examine regional variations in these rates 
over the period 2007 thru 2012;  
2. (a) To modify, for VHA implementation, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_748222] ; and   (b) T o implement the INTERACT quality improvement program  as the intervention  in 8- 
[ADDRESS_1023496]  quality 
improvement program  in order to characterize the fidelity with which CLCs in the intervention pairs 
participated in training, engaged in regular conference calls, undertook root cause analyses identifying 
why hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748223];  
4. To test the effect of the  implementation of  INTERACT   as an intervention  on the rate of reduction in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748224] s in the intervention as compared to the matched control facilities and to 
determine via a formalized “structured implicit  review” whether the intervention was associated with a 
reduction in “avoidable” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748225];  
5. To conduct a Budget Impact Analysis of the cost of the intervention relative to the “sav ings” associated 
with fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748226] 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 3 of 43 
Amendment 15  B. INTRODUCATION/ BACKGROUND  
 
Elderly individuals with long -term care (LTC) needs are at particular risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; more than 
25% of long -stay nursing home residents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748227] 6 -month period. [12] Reducing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748228]. A 
clinical practice to transfer when indications are unclear is not optimal because the stress of transfer 
and the risk of nosocomial infection and other iatrogenic complications are not tri vial for frail LTC 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_748229]. A number of studies suggest 
that many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748230], as outcomes among those 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748231]. [13-15] While financial incentives across 
providers may vary, the cost to society of inpatient treatment is almost always more expensive than 
treatment elsewhere. Reducing potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748232] h outcomes while simultaneously reducing overall costs for an important segment of 
the population.   
 
While reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748233], there is compelling evidence that 
interventions based on readily available clinical practice guidelines and care paths could have a large 
impact on overall re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]. For example, a majority of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748234], cardiac and pulmonary conditions and acute renal failur e or 
dehydration. [11, 16, 17] Not surprisingly, many interventions designed to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748235], but some components of these interventions have potentially wider applicability 
across diagnoses.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748236]. [5, 
18, 19] Some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748237] a chron ic condition. For example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748238], heart failure (HF), 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could be avoided if proper diet, exercise, and 
medication management are maintained. A separate but related distinction ca n be made between 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748239], once an adverse health event has 
occurred. [5, 18] While hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748240], transfer to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748241] y for other conditions such as pneumonia and dehydration. 
In the discretionary cases, the decision to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748242]’ clinical status. [20] Reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748243]/or discretionary events.  
 
A recent report from the Research Triangle Institute examined the dually eligible (Medicare and 
Medicaid) population in community NHs and found that more than one -third of these dually eligible 
beneficiaries were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748244], totaling almost 1 million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22331]. [21] Of 
these, 382,846, or 39%, may have been avoidable, either because the condition might have been 
prevented or because the condition might have been treated in a lower level of care setting than a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. These potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748245] 241,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (63%) originating 
from a Medicaid -covered NH stay, 73,000 (19%) from a Medicare -covered SNF stay. In both Medicare 
covered SNF stays and Medicaid covered nursing facility stays, pneumonia accounted for over 30% of 
potentially av oidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 
To our knowledge no comparable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748246] -acute care (PAC), 
approximately ½ of the CLC population. In community NHs, re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748247], PAC patients 
is increasingly recogn ized as a major issue; however, these rates may differ between community NHs

Amendment 15  and VA CLCs. Case -mix adjusted regional and facility variation in the rate of re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748248]’ policies, faci lity resources and medical 
staff engagement. [7] VHA CLCs have medical and administrative staff that are under central control and 
therefore, at least theoretically, have the same organizational incen tives as does the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140319]. 
These aligned incentives could mean that efforts to reduce re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748249].  
     
One systematic review of interventions to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748250], altered provider incentives, identified high risk patients and introduced 
changes into the system of care. [22] Although changing the financial incentives co uld decrease 
avoidable transfers, it can also result in inadequate care if the infrastructure to manage residents with 
acute changes doesn’t exist. Disseminating and implementing interventions that can assist NH staff 
manage acute changes in resident clini cal status are critical to reducing avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748251].  
 
Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) is a quality improvement program involving a 
set of evidence -based clinical practice tools and strategies initially de veloped under a Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contract to Georgia’s Medicare Quality Improvement Organization. 
The original INTERACT tools were developed with input from a panel of expert NH clinicians and pi[INVESTIGATOR_748252].  More recently, INTERACT II was evaluated in 
25 NHs in three states in a 6 -month quality improvement initiative that provided tools, on -site 
education, and teleconferences every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_708623] . There was a 17% 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748253] 25 NHs from the same 6 -month period in the previous year. 
The group of 17 NHs rated as engaged in the initiative had a 24% reduction, compared with 6% in the 
group of eight NHs rated as not engage d and 3% in a comparison group of [ADDRESS_1023497] of 
the 6 -month implementation was $7,700 per NH while the projected savings to Medicare in a 100 -bed 
NH were approximately $125,000 per year. [11] 
 
Significance to the VHA : In conjunction with our GEC partners, this project i s being proposed as one 
component of a general effort to improve care and enhance the medical capacity of CLC nursing and 
medical staff.  If the INTERACT training program is effective, GEC anticipates expanding investment in 
the on -line training system and  identifying local champi[INVESTIGATOR_748254].  The training of CLC nursing and medical staff in INTERACT is completely compatible with, but 
expands upon, VHA “culture transformation” efforts. Reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] f rom CLCs has 
immediate positive benefits on the experience of Veterans since they would be spared the trauma of 
unnecessary transfer  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . In addition, INTERACT training advances several principles central to 
culture transformation by [CONTACT_748441]-directed advance care planning and training staff to 
understand  Veteran patterns of daily activities  to better identify early warning signs and symptoms of 
decline.   
 
Impact of Findings on the VHA : We expect that, compared to c ontrol -CLCs, intervention -CLCs which 
fully implement  INTERACT will reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175978] 20%,  identifying avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
This figure is lower than the 25% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748255] n.[11]  Consistent with fin dings from community NHs, these reductions in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748256]. From 
the VAMC perspective, this means hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748257].

Amendment 15  C. STUDY PROCEDURES  Overview :  
 
The INTERACT program, training curriculum and tools will be refined to be appropriate for 
implementation in a VA setting both in relation to standard CLC operating procedures and VHA language 
and policies.  
 
Based upon merged VIReC and Medicare inpatient and outpatient data and CLC nurse staffing and other 
organizational data, we will match CLCs in terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103], proximity to their VAMC 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , admissions per bed  and the mix of short and long stay CLC Veterans they serve.   Up t o [ADDRESS_1023498] a  minimum of 8 of the facilities approached to accept, 
adopt and implement the program over the 6 m onth training period and the additional 24 month  
implementation and  data collection  period  (encompass ing:  a [ADDRESS_1023499] data monitoring) .  
Both  members of the CLC matched pairs will be dropped from the study if the CLC that is randomly 
selected to be offered the INTERACT program declines to participate.  During the [ADDRESS_1023500] Analys is (BIA).  Additionally, quality 
improvement tools applied by [CONTACT_748442] “avoidability” of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644222] [ADDRESS_1023501] .   
 
Data Sources: To estimate the impact of the INTERACT on the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748258]  a variety 
of administrative d ata will be used . Our strategy for merging data is described below.  
 
VHA Utilization and Costs :  VA utilization will be obtained from the national automated datasets 
maintained at the Austin Automation Center. The VHA Medical SAS Datasets are national administrative 
data for VHA -provided health care utilized primarily by [CONTACT_68847]. The datasets are provided in SAS 
format by [CONTACT_60937] (Oct. 1 - Sept. 30). These data are extracted from the National Patient Care 
Database (NPCD).  Two particular d atasets will be used: the “Bed Section” dataset for acute and 
extended (nursing home) utilization. The “Bed Section” files (as opposed to the Main files) will allow us 
to differentiate between acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748259], which is n ecessary for the 
creation of the Residential History File (see below) as well. These datasets will be used to obtain specific 
dates of admission and discharge that will enable us to define study outcomes. They also contain 
variables describing patient demo graphics, primary/secondary diagnosis, length -of-stay and up to [ADDRESS_1023502]. Phibbs and staff at HERC (Health 
Economic & Resource Center) we will use HERC cost data based upon standardized cost accoun ting 
rules.  
 
 Medicare Claims :  Medicare data for Veterans are available to VA researchers with approved 
projects. The VA Information Resource Center , VIReC , prepares the data and attaches it to VA's 
Scrambled Social Security Numbers, which allows research ers to link VA and Medicare healthcare 
utilization data. The data are distributed to VA researchers as SAS datasets. The  VIReC cohort, first 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023503] recent source files to produce a cumulative finder file. Currently, files include claims 
from 1999 through 20 11, and are updated continually.  
 
Medic are's routine administrative databases include detailed demographic, financial and clinical data.  
The enrollment files include demographic data (birthdate, age, gender, race, and place of residence), 
eligibility information (Medicare Part A and B eligibil ity and periods of HMO enrollment) and vital status 
(date of death).  Claims files are maintained for all beneficiaries not enrolled in HMOs. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748260] a record for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including DRG, multiple diagnoses, procedures , ICU 
days and reimbursements by [CONTACT_748443]). Other part A standard analytic files (SAF) include Skilled 
Nursing Facility, Home Health, and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748261], charges, and 
the Outpatient file containing data on ou tpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748262]. Physician 
claims are part B claims and include dates, diagnoses, procedures and payments. All records in the 
claims and enrollment files include unique identifiers for Medicare enrollees that allow longitudi nal 
linkage. Medicare claims are not available for beneficiaries, including Veterans, who enroll in a Managed 
Care plan, now constituting 25% of all Medicare beneficiaries.  We are very conscious of the incomplete 
data resulting from this, but the proporti on of long term care users who are covered by [CONTACT_748444]; whether this is true for the VA is 
not known at present.  
 
Nursing Home Assessments: Minimum Data Set (MDS) : The MDS resident assessme nt instrument 
(RAI) is a required clinical assessment done upon admission and periodically thereafter. In this study we 
will use the data elements included in the MDS as independent variables designed to adjust CLC 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748263]’t 
adversely affect patient functioning. Repeated evaluations of the reliability of the MDS reveal that with 
proper training, 92% of the identification and background items are reliable with an averag e reliability 
estimate of 0.71, and all diagnoses in the MDS are reliable with an average reliability of 0.74. [24] Inter -
rater reliability data on over 6000 residents drawn  from 209 facilities in 10 states were assembled on 
100 different MDS data elements, average Kappa values exceeded .7 in over 90% of the items. The 
validity and reliability of summary scales measuring dependence in physical and cognitive functioning, 
mood,  etc. have been documented in comparison with research instruments and other criteria. [25-34]   
 
As of January 1st, [ADDRESS_1023504] of the MDS 3.0 so we are confident that we’ll be in a position to work effectively with these 
data. [35, 36]  
 
Facility Level Data : Facility information on CLCs is constructed by [CONTACT_748445]’ location.  Specifically, we will create 
facility level aggregate measures of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s from a CLC as well as the proportion of short and 
long stay residents in the facility and the proportion or residents with primary psychiatric diagnoses.  
Finally, geographic proximity to the VAMC inpatient  unit will be obtained from GEC as part of the CLC 
matching process.

Amendment 15  Data on staffing in th e CLCs will be obtained from VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)  accessed 
through VINCI and stored locally on the secure research server in the designated restricted study drives  
through an existing DART request .  This will be used to characterize the intervention and control CLCs in 
terms of the level of skilled and u nskilled staffing at each CLC.  This will help us to interpret the results of 
the comparison of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748264].   
 
 Residential History File (RHF) : Intrator and colleagues have constructed algorithms that concatenate 
the MDS and Medicare Claims files into individual patient histories able to document trajectories as 
patients move in and out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748265]. Continuous days of health ca re utilization at the 
same health care location are assigned in calendar time. In the case of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_398550], a hierarchy 
(inpatient claims, SNF, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], and home health) is used to assign location of care. Prior experience has 
found that very few clai ms have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_748266] (less than 0.05%), reflecting the ongoing 
error checking CMS does.  More recently, under a current VA IIR, Intrator has applied the RHF to the 
combined VA -Medicare data, making it possible to track daily health care uti lization of Veterans.  This 
algorithm makes it possible to count the number of patient days at risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748267] a CLC during any period of time.  It is this feature of the RHF that makes it possible for us to 
precisely measur e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748268].  
 
Implicit Review of Potentially Avoidable Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] :  To estimate whether the rates of 
avoidable and inappropriate transfers changed with implementation of INTERACT, we will conduct a 
Structured Implicit Review  (SIR) of the appropriateness of a sample of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748269]. To account for the heterogeneity and complexity of the CLC 
population s between sites , as well as the wide variety of factors that may influ ence the transfer 
decision, we will use SIR methodology to measure the appropriateness of transfer.  SIR specifies key 
data sources for review and guides reviewers to consider specific domains in evaluating care. SIR has 
been shown to have acceptable relia bility where data elements have not been specified in a manner 
that fully supports explicit reviews and where consideration of care elements requires clinical 
synthesis. [5]  
 
[CONTACT_748497] will assist the research team in recruiting up to [ADDRESS_1023505]. Saliba has experience in training clinical 
reviewers in performing SIR. Training will include reviewers independently completing a SIR on 
standardized practice chart s. This will be followed by [CONTACT_37126] -to-face meetings among reviewers to discuss 
their judgments and to clarify definitions and the information sources necessary to support a particular 
position viz. the potential “avoidability” of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Practice charts will be reviewed with the 
group discussion continuing until sources of disagreement have been resolved.  
 
Reviewers will return to their facility where they will be assigned records to review from a nested 
random sample of the records of 163 residen ts transferred from the intervention facilities prior to the 
intervention compared to a nested random sample 1 63 residents transferred during the supported 
routine care phase (i.e. after the 6 month training period has been completed). Each reviewer will b e 
asked to review up to [ADDRESS_1023506] monthly calls with the reviewers to  encourage completion of reviews and to clarify 
questions or issues arising during reviews.

Amendment 15   
CLC Selection,  Matching and Random Assignment:   We will match up to [ADDRESS_1023507] -acute care patients and the geographic proximity of the CLC to the VAMC inpatient unit.   
Additionally we will rely on two main types of characteristics : the monthly count of patient days alive in 
a CLC and the  monthly re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748270]. W e restricted the analysis to [ADDRESS_1023508] 50 beds, and were in operation during 2012. In addition, to calculate the matches we will 
only use data from 12/2007  to 12/2012.  
The matching was accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, we partitioned CLCs into 10 groups 
using k -means clustering, based on the pattern of the monthly number of patient days alive in each CLC. 
The number of clusters (10) was chosen based on a change in the sum of squared error (SSE) of the 
scree plot.  This step ensured that all of the CLC s within a cluster will have similar number of patient days 
alive which also corresponds to the size of the CLC. In the second stage CLCs were matched within each 
of the clusters defined in step 1, based on the monthly re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748271]. The 
matching algorithm within each cluster is of the greedy type that searches for the pair of CLCs with the 
smallest Euclidean distance, which is calculated based on the re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748272]. Once two of these CLCs are declared to be a “match ”, they are removed from further 
consideration. The algorithm continues to find the closest pair remaining, and remove s from 
consideration once identified. The process continues until all possible CLCs are match ed. This two stage 
process ensures that matched CLCs have relatively similar sizes as well as other characteristics  including 
relatively similar historical re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285].  
 
Once CLCs  are matched, the randomly selected  CLC will be approached to s olicit their participation with 
the strong endorsement of GEC leadership. We will approach the randomly selected experimental CLCs  
until  up to [ADDRESS_1023509] agreed.  If a CLC declines to participate, both members of the pair of matched CLCs 
will be dropped from consideration.  The matched “control” case of those CLCs that agree to participate 
in the INTERACT program will not be approached. The “control” status of a CLC will be known to no one 
outside of the project research team and will not be divulged in any pr oject description or publication.  
 
Patient Selection:   We do not anticipate excluding any Veterans in CLCs from the population to 
be included in the outcome analyses. The CLC is the unit of random assignment, meaning the 
intervention changes the skills of CLC staff.  For each CLC agreeing to adopt the INTERACT  program, it 
will be as if the CLC is introducing a focused quality improvement program  to their staff . As such, no 
individual patient consent will be requested. We will separately examine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748273], but this will be regardless of their clinical condition or diagnoses.  
 
Outcome Measures :  The primary outcome (on which our statistical power estimates were 
based) will be the overall  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748274] 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023510]. 
Intrator’s current HSR&D IIR.  The measure will be constructed covering the period from at least the [ADDRESS_1023511] standardization by [CONTACT_748446][INVESTIGATOR_059]. [See the Statistical Considerations section 
below for a detailed presentation of the ARIMA model.]  
 
An alternate version of the outcome is a per-person, risk adjusted, probability of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748275].  In 2007 , 32% 
of Veteran’s were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748276], ranging from under 10% per 
CLC to nearly 50%.  However, since each Veteran had a different number of person months of 
observation, something that varies across CLCs, these individ ual probabilities will be examined 
separately for short and long stay patients.  For short stay patients, we’ll calculate the proportion with a 
30 day re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], adjusting for patient characteristics on the admission MDS and the originating 
hospit al diagnosis and length of stay.  For long stay residents (those who are residents of a CLC for at 
least 100 days), we will calculate the likelihood of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308998] a [ADDRESS_1023512] system to rate states’ health care 
system. [2][[37]] 
 
The unde rlying intent of the intervention is to decrease transfers by [CONTACT_748447], appropriately 
managing acute change or decline in the CLC, and improving the use of advance care plans. Transfer 
rates alone do not tell us whether these kinds of changes occur red in association with the focused 
intention of the intervention , i.e. to reduce the rate of potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  We will 
therefore also examine the overall rates of potentially avoidable and inappropriate transfers  prior to 
the interv ention compared to these rates during the consolidation phase of the intervention (among 
only the CLCs exposed to the INTERACT program), using a tested and reliable structured implicit review 
process.  The Structured Implicit Review (SIR) yields numerous j udgments about the need for 
transferring the Veteran to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748277].  The final outcome variable is 
an ordinal variabl e ranking the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748278] “avoidability”.  
 
To ensure that adoption of the INTERACT intervention does  not result in an excessive reduction in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748279], we will  adhere to the Data S afety Monitoring 
plan approved by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB).  See Data Safety Monitoring Section, on

front -line CLC staff to  (see adjacent Figure) :  1.) identify acute conditions early in their course, thereby 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_748280] ; 2.)  provi de 
communicati on and decision support tools that assist with the safe and effective management  of certain 
conditions in the  CLC without transfer to the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ; and 3) educat e CLC staff in advance care 
planning  and discussions about end -of-life and comfort care plans, thus increasing the use of advance 
directives, comfort care measures, and palliative and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748281].  
 
INTERACT will be implemented as a quali ty improvement initiative in each participating CLC. Completion 
of Quality Improvement tools, Communication Tools and tracking hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (including those which 
may have been avoided ) are  critical components of the INTERACT program.  The Quality Impr ovement 
Tool guides the CLC staff in a review of the acu te change in Veterans’ condition.  This is  documented by 
[CONTACT_748448] (Stop & Watch and SBAR Progress Note) , what was done in the CLC  to 
evaluate and manage the resident  and decision  making around transfer to the  acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748282] .  
 
Local adoption of new practices such as INTERACT requires a stable management team .  Pair matched 
facilities will be initially reviewed by [CONTACT_748449] s that 
would make the CLC a poor candidate for adopting INTERACT as a quality improvement program.  The 
leadership at the pair matched CLC randomly selected to be offered INTERACT will be sent introductory 
material and will be called shortly thereafter by [CONTACT_748450].  We have made provisions 
for the possibility that up to  [ADDRESS_1023514]  
constructed 17 matched pairs; both members of the pair are dropped from consideration if the one 
randomly selected intervention site declines  to participate .  Site visits may be conducted (depending on 
project timing, enrollment uptake and geographic prox imity to study staff) to some or all  CLCs agreeing 
to participate in order to meet and orient facility -based leadership and the project Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s. CLCs  will 
be asked to sign a research agreement enumerating the expectations of the facility and facility  
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748283].  This research agreement can be found in Appendix 3. 
During the  recruitment period  Nancy Henry , GNP,  PhD, or Maria Carolina Rojido, M HA, (Senior Project 
Coordinator s) will review the objectives of the program and mutual expectations, including 
demonstrating the online training materials and the various forms used to document the 
implementation of the intervention. Experience from previous  community Nursing Homes  qualit y 
improvement research projects suggests that such meetings are helpful to successfully initiate and 
sustain research and quality improvement projects. CLC project Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748284] t he implementation of INTERACT at their CLC . 
 

Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023515] program will be implemented in up to 15 CLCs that agree to participat e involving various 
stipulations including: 1) identifying and appointing “Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s” who will be responsible for program 
impleme ntation; 2) agreeing to incorporate the INTERACT program as a “quality improvement” project 
that will be evaluated on an ongoing basis; 3) agreeing to encourage relevant staff to engage in the web 
based training and regular conference calls to review the c onditions surrounding each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
and 4) sustain engagement in the INTERACT program throughout the [ADDRESS_1023516]  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]:  In addition to strong support by [CONTACT_748451], 
prior studies highlight the importance of selecting enthusiastic, experienced, respected  leaders  as 
project Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]. Implementing INTERACT with only one Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748285] a  reduction in engagement, non -adherence or drop -out. Thus, at each

 2.) A 12-[ADDRESS_1023519] occasional refresher trainings and other web -based modules for new or existing 
staff interested in participating .   
 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023520] Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], as well as key CLC staff, including certified 
nursing assistants (CNAs), licensed nursing staff, ancillary staff, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], social workers, administrative 
nurses, the medical director, and medica l providers  (MDs, NPs, 
and P As) will be expected to participate in the online training 
curriculum . Night and weekend staff will also be expected to 
complete the curriculum, as many acute care transfers occur at 
night and on weekends.  These types of staff members successfully 
completed training in community -based trials of INTERACT.  
 
The [ADDRESS_1023521] specific SharePoint. Training sessions will not be linked to individual CLC 
staff.  
 
Between sessions, suggested implementation  activities  will include practicing the use of the tools and 
tracking acute care transfer and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748289], 
either paper or electronic formats .  Teleconferences will be held  every other  wee k and include 
opportunities f or participating CLCs to ask questions, discuss implementation challenges, and share 
successes with other CLCs.  Individual CLC calls as well as calls with multiple intervention CLCs  (Cohort 
calls) implementing INTERACT at the same time  will be held.    The calls will  include the  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s and 
key leadership staff at the CLC . 
 
The subsequent 12-[ADDRESS_1023522] Tools : The INTERACT tools were developed and refined with extensive 
input from national experts in nursing home care, as well as from all  levels of direct care NH staff and 
medical providers. The tools are consistent with evidence -based and expert recommended clinical 
practice guidelines. [40-43]  
 
There are four types of tools  within the INTERACT QI program , illustrated in the figure  above :  
1. Communication tools : structure d to document communication  between nursing assistants and 
licensed nurses (RNs/LPNs /LVNs ), between nurses and medical providers  (MD, NP, PA) , and between 
CLCs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. These tools include an Early Warning Tool (“Stop and Watch”), Situation  Background 
Assessment Request (“ SBAR ”) Communication  Form  and Progress Note, Acute Care  Transfer Checklist , 
CLC to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748290], Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748291], and CLC Capabilities List .

Amendment 15   2. Decisions Support Tools : includ ing change in condition file cards and care paths for ten conditions 
that are common causes of potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748292], change in behavior with new or worsening behavioral symptoms, deh ydration,  
falls, fever, GI symptoms such a nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, shortness of breath, symptoms of CHF, 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_748293].   
3. Advance Care Planning tools  (ACP):  includ ing an Advanced Care Planning Tracking tool, 
communication guide with specific strategies and examples of quotes to use when discussing palliative 
and end -of-life care with  NH residents and their families, a template for “comfort care” orders , and 
educational  handouts for staff (Identifying Veterans Appropriate for Palliative or Comfort Care) and 
Veterans and their families ( Education on  CPR for residents and families, Education on Tube feeding for 
residents and families, Deciding about going to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  .  
4. Quality Improvement tools : includ e a structured review of acute changes in condition and acute care 
transfers , a form to track transfers and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , and a quality improvement summary tool  
 
The version of tools designed  specifically for the VA CLCs  can be found in Appendix 2, INTERACT VA CLC 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_1023523] care staff notices an acute 
change in a Veteran , they ca n document and communicate the change using the Stop & Watch Early 
Warning Tool . Licensed nursing staff can use the SBAR Form and Progress Note  to document and 
communicate their findings to medical providers, and can use the Care Paths  and Acute Change in 
Condition File Cards  as decision support tools. If the decision to transfer to the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748294], 
inter -facility communication is stru ctured and facilitated by [CONTACT_748452] . The Quality 
Improvement tools  include a structured review using a root cause analysis approach to assist CLC staff in 
reflecting on their experience in identifying, evaluating, and managing acute change s in condition, and a 
tracking form for acute care transfers and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].   
 
A potential barrier to using the INTERACT tools  within the CLC setting is that they are not integrated into 
CPRS as electronic templates where CLC clinical staff document  encounters and communication.  To 
address the feedback from  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Aim 2A ) in Tampa for records to be maintained electronically, the 
SBAR Communication Form and Progress Note  used by [CONTACT_748453] a change in condition 
will be available for use  electronically  at CLCs that  obtain approval through  their local Medical Record 
Committee (MRC).   All forms will not be created electronically at this time due to considerable time and 
resources and requir ed to  mak e changes to existing VH A systems before we have the evidence that the 
intervention is effective  in the CLC setting.  
 
Support by a Senior Research  Project  Coordinators: During the [ADDRESS_1023524] program  the audience on these calls may  be expanded to include others in the CLC clinical 
and/or administrative leadership . The calls will be used to:  review and reinforce the use of specific 
INTERACT tools and implementation strategies; share challenges and successes in implementing the 
intervention; review cases in which the INTERACT tools assisted in preventing a transfer and/or in 
managing residents without transfer; and review cases in which a resident was initially managed in the 
facility, but required transfer to the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

Amendment 15   
Documenting Intervention Fidelity : The process of implementing and remaining true to the 
fidelity of INTERACT  will be documented in a uniform manner across all  intervention CLCs   using the web 
based training, documentation of attendance on conference calls , qualitative notes from site visits, and 
from fielding trouble shooting calls.  Speci fic items of interest that will be examined and reported will 
include: a change in the  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s; the  proportion of staff who  complete the web -based training;  the 
number of  Stop and Watch Early Warning Tool s used ; the n umber of SBAR Progress Notes completed 
relative to the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748295]; and any increase  in the number of CLC residents 
with advance care directives .   Variation between CLCs participating in the INTERACT intervention will be 
one of the foci of  an implementation report .  We will also document the association between a global 
assessment of “adherence” to the INTERACT intervention and the degree of reduction in the actual rate 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748296] .  Counts of contacts, calls and numbers of forms filed will be 
differentiated between the first [ADDRESS_1023525] tools ( Stop and Watch Early Warning  
Tool , SBAR,  Quality Improvement Tools, and  Advance Care Planning Tracking). The Project Coordinator  
will track receipt of data and will contact [CONTACT_748454][INVESTIGATOR_748297] -ups if data is not 
submitted . 
 
Aim #1:  To characterize VHA CLCs in terms of alternate measures of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748298] -acute care residents, including Medicare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and to examine regional variations in 
these rates over the period [ADDRESS_1023526] several different measures of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748299] s that are 
applicable to both short and long stay residents.  A facility level measure with limited risk adjustmen t 
will be calculated as the number of CLC patient days in the year divided by [CONTACT_748455].  This measure can be calculated per calendar year, per quarter or per month.  
Using 2007 and 2008 data, we’ve calculated this for all VH A CLCs, although some outliers suggest that 
there are likely inconsistencies in how unit transfers are coded which we will correct under the 
proposed study. Since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748300], we’ll adjust for each CLC’s own seasonal variation 
(due to l atitude) and characterize regional variation as well as variation attributable to the mix of short 
and long stay residents in the CLC and the proximity of the CLC to the VAMC. Of particular interest will 
be tracking changes over time in the rates of hospit alization since in the Medicare FFS system we have 
documented large increases over the last decade. [2]  We will undertake the same analyses using the risk 
adjusted, per patient level hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748301], estimating the proportion of short and long stay 
residents, respectively, that were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748302] [ADDRESS_1023527] whether the patient 
level, risk adjusted rate o f hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669388], given changes in the acuity of individual entering 
and residing in CLCs.  
 
Aim #2 A: To modify, for VHA implementation, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_748303] -line INTERACT  quality improvement 
program  intervention training material s.  
The INTERACT  quality improvement program  was initially developed under a grant from the 
Commonwealth Fund and has since been modified extensively through  interventions implem ented 
under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_748304] -sponsored quali ty improvem ent programs and select state -based efforts 
designed to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s from nursing home s.[3, 44] INTERACT’s  web -based training 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023528] training tools to be VA -centric will involve six 
on-site focus group sessions at the Tampa VA CLC . Focus group sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_748456], PhD (Senior Project Coordinator), un der the supervision of Joseph Ouslander, MD, who is based 
at [LOCATION_012] Atlantic University, in close proximity to the Tampa site.  [CONTACT_213549] will serve as director for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]. The focus groups will not involve data collection, metrics, or any contact [CONTACT_748457]. 
The CLC personnel will be asked only to avail themselves of their professional expertise to make 
suggestions and/or feedback on the practical use of INTERACT.  
The Senior Project Coordinator  (SPC) will coordinate with the Tampa Site  Cham pi[INVESTIGATOR_748305] a free thirty minute  discipline -specific  
introductory  learning  session  about  INTERACT . This will involve staff watching a 30 minute video  
provided via  the Medline University  website . Staff will be provided free access to the website and can 
schedule at their convenience prior to their involvement in the focus groups.  Using a  classroom setting 
in the CLC , the SPC (FAU) w ill facilitate  (6) fifty  minute focus groups which will build on the Medline 
University INTERACT introductory session . These focus groups  will be faci litated  by [CONTACT_748458] (FAU)  along 
with the Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748306]  a convenient time  for staff participation . During  each  
focus grou p, CLC  volunteer staff  will be provided a Power Point presentation  and paper versions of  
specific INTERACT education materials and tools .  The SPC (FAU) will lead a discussion about the usability 
of the tools in the CLC practice setting. Staff will have the option to offer verbal feedback and/or write 
their feedback on the paper materials during the session. The last of the six focus groups will include a 
discussion of recommendations and/or consideration for use of select INTERACT  tools i n electronic 
template form for use in CPRS, the VA electronic medical record. Input from these VA CLC volunteer 
staff will provide essential feedback on how best to modify the program and tools to ensure delivery of 
the most effective and efficient version  of the INTERACT Quality Improvement Program for VA CLC 
intervention sites. A focus group guide  containing detailed procedures around the introduction of the 
INTERACT program tools and training materials  can be found in Appendix [ADDRESS_1023529] tools and materials.  Feedback from 
staff  provided either verbally and /or in written format , will be summarized by [CONTACT_748458] (FAU) but no 
persona l data will be collected from any staff or any resident in the Tampa CLC. Furthermore, no 
information gathered during the focus group process will involve topic areas beyond that of refining the 
INTERACT  Quality Improvement tools nor any sensitive disclosu res that might result from staff mix in 
attendance.  This process will involve minimal risk: the voluntary participation and input sought from VA 
CLC employees does not increase the probability of harm or discomfort.  
(Note:  As we are not gathering any dat a or information related to the participants in the focus group 
sessions, we are requesting both a waiver of informed consent and will not maintain a master list of 
subjects ).  
Upon completion of the  (6) focus groups , the SPC  (FAU) will coordinate  scheduling of thirty minute 
learning  sessions for the day, evening and night staff of one CLC unit  with the  Tampa Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748307] 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 16 of 43

overview  of the INTERACT program and instructions on the use of 1) the Stop and Watch Early Warning 
Tool , and 2) SBAR tools for use in everyday care of residents.  The staff will be provided a supply of 
paper tools to complete as opportunities arise a nd submit them to their ward leade r for a period of 30 
days . The Data Handling Plan that t he Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748308].  The

testing.  The Site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748310]  (FAU ) the  verbal or written feedback about the staff’s 
experience with the tools  and the total number used . This thirty day period of feedback  will add a 
substantial and valuable contribution towards  understanding how best to revise  the INTERACT  tools in 
preparation for use in the CLC intervention sites. At the conclusion of the  (6) focus groups and one 
month of  tool usage  in one CLC ward , the total sum of feedback and/or recommendations offered  by 
[CONTACT_748459]. This will conclude the activities at the Tampa VA CLC.  
Data Handling  Plan (Tampa pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) : The staff will fill out paper tools and hand them off to the 
unit leader, who will ultimately submit them to the Site  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . The Sit e Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748311] a locked cabinet in a secure room at the CLC until the completion of the [ADDRESS_1023530] tools  that may potentially be used throughout the whole study 
intervention period  can be found in Appendix 1, pages 2 -4. Howe ver, p lease note that  the SBAR and 
Stop and Watch tools are the only two tools that will be tested at the Tampa pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and that resident 
information collected by [CONTACT_748460] o nly be seen by [CONTACT_748461] , not research staff . 
However, research staf f will receive verbal or written feedback about the staff’s experience with the 
tools and the total number of each tool used  in the [ADDRESS_1023531] intervention for study 
aim 2B (see below).  
Aim #2B : To implement the INTERACT intervention in up to 15 randomly selected, pair matched CLCs for 
a 6 month intervention train ing period and an additional 12-18 month observation period.  
CLC agreement to participate :  Up to  [ADDRESS_1023532] contact[CONTACT_748462].  
 
The formal training at each CLC is scheduled to occur over a 6 month  period followed  by 12-18 
additional months of observation. A minimum level of partici pation in the training is required to

Amendment 15  ascertain that the intervention has been embraced by [CONTACT_748463] .   The Providence research staff  will 
monitor  the CLCs’ participation  in the intervention . If a CLC is doing poorly and the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s seem to 
be unable to engage and motivate the staff, we may drop the site  or try to recruit an additional 
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (s).  This is one of the reasons for matching extra pairs of CLCs. One of the strengths of the pair 
matched design is that if one of the intervention CLCs is dropped we can readily drop the matched 
control site without having to worry about unbalancing the design.  
 
 Each CLC will follow the procedure below to become an active participating CLC in the INTERACT 
intervention. Selected  CLCs will be contact[CONTACT_213229] a letter  from the PI, Vincent Mor, PhD , Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_748312], MD, MPH , INTERACT Developer, J oseph Ouslander, MD , and GEC  leadership containing 
introductory materia l, describing the INTERACT training program being proposed.  After the letter, 
follow  up contact [CONTACT_748464].  Sites who agree to participate 
will be asked to sign a Resea rch Study Agreement (See Appendix # 3, Research Study Agreement).   
 
The intervention CLCs that agree to participate  will agree to the following stipulations:  identify   
appropriate candidate s as Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748313]  (and 
replacing a  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748314]) ;  incorporate the INTERACT program as a “quality improvement” project that will be 
evaluated on an ongoing basis; encourage relevant staff to e ngage in the web based training, 
anonymous feedback and conference calls to review the conditions surrounding each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748315]; and sustain engagement in the INTERACT 
program  throughout the trai ning and 12-[ADDRESS_1023533] Training Curriculum :  Site visits and/or calls will be conducted by 
a project coordinator to review the objectives of the program and mutual expectations .  This includes 
gathering preliminary information regarding QI activities already existing within the CLC, demonstrating  
the online training materials and the various tools , and working with sites to introduce the use of 
INTERACT to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] p ersonnel as necessary .  A resource handbook will be provided along with access 
to the secured VA -INTERACT CLC SharePoint providing all essential documentation and resources for the 
intervention . We will schedule training times  and confirm with Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748316] (electronic and paper materials will be used) about the upcoming INTERACT Intervention to 
personnel. Providence VAMC staff will assist sites with scheduling, material distribution and resources.  
ALL training will be schedu led based on site and study staff availability .  
 
Eight (30 -50 minute) webinars will be held (online or in -person) (at convenient times for the site 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], other staff and moderator/facilitators) (See Appendix #  5, INTERACT Webinars & Staff 
modules).  Each  live webinar will be recorded for the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748317]. The recorded (live Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) 
webinars will be accessible through the individual secure CLC SharePoint  or site-specific shared folder

individual access.  Individual employees will remain anonymous, identifying only their position in the CLC 
when completing the modules and post session quizzes. (Only Providence VAMC Research staff will have 
access to individual responses.  Providence Research staff will quantify the results and share with 
clinicians so they can provide feedback to s ites on their implementation status  and evaluate  process 
measures related to uptake of INTERACT implementation at a particular CLC (See Appendix #  [ADDRESS_1023536] Webinars & Staff modules).  In between webinars  personnel will be asked to use the tools and 
track acute care transfers and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748322] 
(paper or electronic). Conference calls with each CLC will be held between webinar sessions to assess  
and support  the implementation of INTERACT from the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748323].  Cohort 
conference calls will be held periodically to get feedback across sites on the implementation process and 
INTERACT  uptake, as well as an opportunity for sharing successes  and challenges .

search by [CONTACT_941] ‘INTERACT SBAR Note’ title  (named locall y with specific naming conventions)  created for 
the study locally and obtain the SBAR  Note  used  for each Veteran listed .   This will lessen the burden on 
the CLC personnel as well as provide more accurate and timely data for the study.  The SBAR Note  will 
be extracted from V istaWeb  into PDF files including the Veterans name [CONTACT_748496] B.  These files will be 
stored on the secure  access -controlled and site -specific shared folder stored on the secure server at the

Amendment 15  The coded SBAR data (including a limited data set) and the SBAR review data  collected for each case  will 
be entered  and stored in REDCap which  will assist with future tracking, exporting and general analysis of 
the collected data.  
REDCap is a secure data storage method.  We will use this data storage option because it provides: 1) an 
intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export 
procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statis tical 
packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.   
This has been reviewed by [CONTACT_748466].  All information  being stored here is 
acceptable and cannot be readily or easily re -identified.   There is no identifi able information stored here 
so it is acceptable to store the data here as well.   REDCAP is approved for use within the VA as a secure 
data storage mechanism.  
The SBAR s collected will be shared with the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748326] .  The name , DOB  or last [ADDRESS_1023539] been transferred sooner, and  information about the Veteran ’s advanced directives and end of life

related to documenting the reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748327].  If desired the call  group could be expanded to 
include others in the CLC clinical and/or administrative leadership, depending upon progress in the 
implementation of the INTERACT program .   The calls will be used to: review and reinforce the use of 
specific INTERACT tools and  implementation strategies; share challenges and successes in implementing 
the intervention ; review  de-identified cases in which the INTERACT tools assisted in preventing a 
transfer and/or in managing residents without transfer; and review  cases in which a  Veteran  was initially 
managed in the CLC, but required transfer to the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. (Appendix # 6, Interview Guide )

The Quality Improvement tools  include a structured review using a root cause analysis approach to assist  
CLC staff in reflecting on their experience in identifying, evaluating, and managing acute changes in 
condition, and a tracking form for acute care transfers and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  The completed tools will be 
available for the research staff to review and  identify areas to continue helpi[INVESTIGATOR_748329].   
Additional training sessions to assist with proper usage and reinforce the use of the INTERACT tools will 
be offered as necessary to the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458].   Also, the research team m ay host occasional refresher 
trainings and other web -based modules for new or existing staff interested in participating.     
  
Exit Survey :  To finalize the intervention and elicit feedback on the full intervention an exit 
survey ( See Appendix [ADDRESS_1023542] Exit Survey ) will be conducted with CLC study Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]. The exit 
survey will gather specific information on how much of the VA -INTERACT QI program was utilized by 
[CONTACT_748467], continued plans for use of VA -INTERACT within the CLCs, and in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] i f the INTERACT 
QI program can be fully integrated into the daily care practices of CLC staff.   
This information will be gathered by [CONTACT_748468] 2b 
and did not have any interaction with CLC staff or Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458].  The individual champi[INVESTIGATOR_748330].  
The champi[INVESTIGATOR_748331]. They will be contact[CONTACT_748469].  It is 
entirely voluntary and their individual responses will remain anonymous to all other study staff except 
those sending and collecting the exit survey by [CONTACT_6968].  
The Exit Survey questions (See Appendix 8) will be emailed to all Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748332] [ADDRESS_1023543] occurs.  The exit survey 
research team will send an email message (See Appendix 8) with the attached interview questions to be 
completed at the Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748333]. The 
exit survey team will send a reminder email to those champi[INVESTIGATOR_748334] a second reminder after week two if no response received.  The reminder will be the same 
scripted email originally sent with an additional line in each  indicating “This is a reminder we have not 
received your exit survey responses yet” . The final email will say “This is a reminder we have not received 
your exit survey response yet, this is our final attempt to collect this information.  Plea se respond by 
[CONTACT_748470].”  Those are the only reminders that will be sent.   
A follow up phone call may be scheduled with any individual champi[INVESTIGATOR_748335] o ur understanding of the 
use of VA -INTERACT in the VA CLC setting.  This will be scheduled with those champi[INVESTIGATOR_748336] 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 21 of 43 
Amendment 15  convenience. Which champi[INVESTIGATOR_748337] a follow up phone call will be determined based on the 
following:   
First, they must be wi lling to be contact[CONTACT_748471] (if left blank, we will consider them as having checked no and they will not be eligible for 
follow up phone contact).  Additional criteria for determining wh o will receive a follow -up call includes: 
1.) Any responses that includes a novel or unique challenge or success  that further details could result 
in a better understanding of how VA -INTERACT could be integrated into the CLC setting or 2.) any 
incomplete or unclear narrative  response that with further conversation could contribute to a better 
understanding of how VA -INTERACT can be integrated into the CLCs.  
If determined a follow up call would provide valuable feedback on VA -INTERACT usage in the VA CLC 
setting based on the above criteria, the exit survey team will email the designated champi[INVESTIGATOR_748338] 
a time to speak over the phone to expand or clarify some of their responses.  Through email, the exit 
survey team member and champi[INVESTIGATOR_748339] a ti me to schedule this call. The exit survey member 
will call the champi[INVESTIGATOR_748340].  If they are unavailable at this time, a message will be left 
regarding a time to reschedule.   Also an email requesting at time to reschedule will be sent, thi s email 
will remind the champi[INVESTIGATOR_748341]. If they no longer wish to participate, they 
can reply to the email letting the exit survey member know and no future contact [CONTACT_97632].  If no 
response is received from the champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  a second email will be sent a week later to try to reschedule the 
call. This will be the final attempt and it will be noted in the email that this is the final contact.  Only if a 
response from the champi[INVESTIGATOR_748342].  
The information gathered will be entered into their survey responses to those narrative questions being 
followed up on from that champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].   
The exit survey research team will compi[INVESTIGATOR_748343], strippi[INVESTIGATOR_748344], replacing with an ID.  Only the exit survey research team will have access to connect 
the champi[INVESTIGATOR_748345].  The exit survey staff will keep the coded list of 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]’ names and IDs and their responses on a se cure server within their local VA system.  The 
local VA exit survey team will be responsible for analyzing and providing the outcomes from these 
interviews to the rest of the research team  
 
Aim #3 : To conduct a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of th e implementation of INTERACT in  
order to characterize the fidelity with which CLCs in the intervention participated in training, engaged in 
regular conference calls, undertook root cause analyses identifying why hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748346] d.  
 
 The proposed documentation of the implementation of the INTERACT intervention will have both a 
quantitative as well as a qualitative component .  We will rely upon the data recorded as part of the 
documentation of the intervention process to character ize the extent of adherence to INTERACT over 
the course of the training period and across the participating CLC sites. Each site will be characterized in 
terms of the following:  percentage of direct care staff who initiated and completed the on -line train ing; 
the percentage of training calls attended by  [CONTACT_549043][INVESTIGATOR_2394] s; the proportion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748347] 
a root cause analysis was completed by [CONTACT_60397]; and the number of SBAR and Stop & Watch 
tools  reported on by [CONTACT_748472][INVESTIGATOR_2394] s per week . To document changes in the intervention from the 
beginning of the training period to the end of the monitoring  period, we will calculate some metrics  on a 
monthly basis  to share with the CLC, allowing for the likelihood that the level of adherence of the 
intervention will change over time, presumably rising throughout the 6 month training period and 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023544] protocols and uptake of intervention . This may help  explain 
possible differential results between facilities.   
 
Aim #4 :  To test the effect of the INTERACT intervention on the rate of reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748348] a formalized structured 
implicit review  (SIR)  process whether the intervention was associated with a reduction in “avoidable” 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748349] .  
 
We will test  the effect of INTERACT on the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748299] s taking advantage of both  the 
paired control CLCs as well as the differences in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748350].  The primary outcome variable is the monthly 
rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which, after adjusting for seasonality  and trends in the rate over several years 
prior to the intervention, is compared to the rate of the paired comparison CLC.  To allow for regional 
differences in seasonality, separate ARIMA models will be run for each CLC and then we will use the 
monthly difference between the observed to the expected CLC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748351], aggregating these differences  overall pairs. Technically, the average 
monthly rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748352] n facilities, using a standard difference in difference  design.  
 
A similar approach will be used with the person level, risk adjusted hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748353].  The unit of analysis will be the CLC resident but 
the standard errors will be clustered at the facility level.  
 
Using the results of the Structured  Implicit Review process, we wi ll determine the percent of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748354] ’s condition could have been safely managed in 
an average VA CLC.  We will compare the percentage hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748355]. The sample size of [ADDRESS_1023545], is 
based upon the assumption that  the pre -intervention rate of potentia lly avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748356] 40%. For the overall project, we are hypothesizing that there will be a 20% reduction in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] .  Logically, the reductions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748357] "avoidable" 
type (otherwise we hav e a causal inconsistency).  Thus, if [ADDRESS_1023546] are 
avoidable and all of the 20% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (20 of 100) will come from among those that 
are avoidable, we expect a 50% reduction in the rate of avoidable hospit alizations.  So, if the pre rate is 
40% and the post rate is 20%, using a one tailed test at the alpha .05 level, we need about 100 records 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 23 of 43 
Amendment 15  before and 100 after to achieve a power of .90.   In the event that some "unavoidable" hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748358] a voided due to the intervention, we increase the sample size to [ADDRESS_1023547] for unintended consequences by [CONTACT_748473], as measured by t he MDS 3.0 nursing home resident 
assessment, which is done upon admission, periodically thereafter and upon discharge. [45]  
 
Random selection of records with a transfer: A total of [ADDRESS_1023548] will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_748359]/ analysts who will pull it  from current CDW data and MDS data.    Once the list is generated, 
random selection will occur to obtain [ADDRESS_1023549] th e reviewers  (and include a randomized  portion o f 
the records to be used for training on how to complete the SIR ).   
 Reviewer Recruitment and training :  Up to [ADDRESS_1023550]. Debra Saliba and her team from 
LAVAMC.  These individuals  will be added as study team members and  will be required to  complete a 
two-day trainin g (in-person or web based) , sign confidentiality  and pri vacy agreement , be provided 
access through CAPRI (Compensation and Pension Record Interchange)  /VistaWeb  to the [ADDRESS_1023551] influencing the reviewers’  structured implicit review we will NOT recruit 
anyone from our existing CLC intervention sites.   
After the reviewers complete th eir assigned chart reviews they will participate in a debriefing with the 
LA team, notifying them about the use of INTERACT as the QI intervention and the impact their reviews 
will have on determining INTERACT’s effectiveness at preventing ‘avoidable’ hosp italizations from 
occurring within the CLCs.    
The reviewers will be trained to use CAPRI /VistaWeb  to complete the chart reviews.  CAPRI /VistaWeb  
provides  a standardized, user -friendly method to access the charts for review with in VA.   
 Structured Implic it Review (SIR) Procedure:   Each reviewer  will be randomly assigned an equal 
percent of the [ADDRESS_1023552] intervention chart.   
The reviewers’  will then complete their review of the chart s using the SIR Instruction Manual and Guide 
(See Appendix 7,  Structure Implicit Review Instructions and Guide ).  They will utilize  access to a

throughout the process to do the reviews and share information with the research team, from 
Providence and LAVMC related to assistance with the SIR process.  
 
The reviewer s will complete each review using the SIR Instructions and Form (appendix 7) .  They will 
save each review to the secure designated restricted folder.  If they choose to hand write their 
responses, they will scan the original review in and save on the secur e restricted designated folder or

folder within the Secure Providence VA Research Server.  The original hand written copi[INVESTIGATOR_748360] a desi gnated locked location by [CONTACT_748475] -10.  
 
While the reviewer  will have access to complete medical reco rds, only specific identifiable information 
from any medical record will be s hared with the research staff (f rom Providence and LAVMC) to assist 
them in making sure they are accessing the correct record prior to their reviews.  That information 
would include the Veterans name, Date of birth,  last four of SSN, treatment dates being reviewed and 
the information con tained in the Review Form  (appendix 7).   
 
REDCap may be used to input the reviews for analysis. The reviews would be input by [CONTACT_748476], stripped of any identifying information and used to confirm the hypothesis 
that a reduction in avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748361], specifically the use of the SBAR change in condition progress note within CPRS.   
Review by [CONTACT_748477].   
REDCap is a secure data storage method. We will use this data storage option because it provides: 1) an 
intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export 
procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical 
packages; and 4) procedures for impor ting data from external source s.  
 
Aim #5 :  To conduct a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) of the INTERACT program from a VA perspective, 
using the [ADDRESS_1023553] is less effective in VA, it still should yield significant 
savings.   
 
The BIA will be driven by [CONTACT_748478]’ estimates of the VA effectiveness of INTERACT.  As part of the 
intervention, we will carefully track both the start -up and on -going labor associated with INTERACT.  
Actual VA labor costs will be used to value this time.  The cost savings of the program are not directly 
observed as they are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748362] s, and thus must be estimated.  We will 
obtain data on all VA and Medicare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748363].  VA costs will be obtained 
from the DSS fee -basis files, and the Medicare reimbursement will be used as the estimated costs of 
non-VA care.   The first analysis will be to compare the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748364], including looking for offset effects for other types of care (reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748365] c are, including higher costs in the CLC).   
 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023554] increases.  The extent of the savings will be driven by [CONTACT_748479][INVESTIGATOR_059], and of the types of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (costs vary significantly by 
[CONTACT_748480]).  Another concern is that the DSS cost estimates include fully allocated 
overhead costs.  The details in the DSS cost data will be used to provide information about how the 
potential cost savings are distributed across variable direct care costs (e.g., supplies and nursing labor), 
costs that can only be changed over time (e.g., reallocation of space to other types of care ), and 
allocated overhead costs that wi ll not change with the program.  
 
 Statistical Considerations : 
 
We estimate our power to detect an expected decrease in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_230225] a 24 month period 
using simulation analysis, over different scenarios wi th different sample sizes (# of CLCs), to predict the 
expected power of our pair matched experiment. Previous research reveal s that a Auto -Regressive 
Moving Average (ARIMA) model characterizes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748366]. In our 
simulati ons analysis we assume that each CLC’s rate follows an ARMA(2,2) model of the following form: 
, where ρ i  the correlation of the current to the previous i  months, θ i is 
the parameter that describe the effect of the error at time t -[ADDRESS_1023555] deviation of σ ε and c is the overall expected 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103]. The simulation analysis included 5 parameters: 1) the sample size in the treatment 
group; 2) an increase/decrease in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748367] σ ε (F); 3) the size of the effect (c); 4) 
the accuracy of the decrease σ c;.; and, 5) the variability of ρ i, θi of the nursing home that rece ived 
treatment from the matched nursing home that received control σ d. For each configuration of the five 
parameters, the following algorithm was repeated for 100 times: 1. a sample of n yearly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748368]; 2. sample  ρ i’s, θ i’s from the above ARMA(2,2) model randomly generated for each of n 
treatment CLCs; 3. for each i treated nursing home we perturbed the ρ i’s, θ i’s by a factor of σ d, and 
assigned them to the pair matched control CLC; 4. generate 2n ARMA processes using the ρ i’s, θ i’s 
generated in step 2 and 3, and the variance σ ε/F; 5. decrease the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748369] 5c% to 20c% over 24 months + rando m deviation of σ c; 6. calculate the monthly 
differences between the treated nursing home hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748370], and average 
across 24 months (τ j) and calculate the standard error σ τ ; and finally, 7. use the average and variance 
calcu lated in [ADDRESS_1023556] on power, we calculated the MSE of all the main effects and 
their interactions. The F, n and c are factors that capture 93% of the variabi lity in the data. Figure 1 
shows how the # of CLCs and F (variance of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103]) affect the power of our analysis. . Even 
if the monthly reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748371] 10%, using 8 treatment CLCs will result in .77% 
power.

Preliminary Studies :   
 
The investigative team assembled to undertake this study is exceptionally strong and well suited to 
implementing the proposed study. [CONTACT_213549] has been studying nursing home quality and the clinical, 
organizational and policy factors associated with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_690201] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748373]. [2, 46-48] He has extensive 
experience managing large scale, multi -faceted and interdisciplinary research projects having had an NIA 
funded MERIT award and PI [INVESTIGATOR_748374] -investigators on a complex intervention study. With funding from the VA HSR&D 
Center of Excellence for the Study of Healthcare Provider Behavior, [CONTACT_748498] developed the SIR 
instruction manual and form based on literature review, exper t panel input into elements, a conceptual 
model for nursing home to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748375]. Reliability testing in [ADDRESS_1023557] been avoided. [5] The SIR form was revised based on input and 
questions from participating reviewers and was used in th e Georgia QIO test of IMPACT. [3] Additionally, 
[CONTACT_748498] was the author of the MDS 3.0, leading an interdisciplinary group of clinicians and scientists in 
testing and reviewing the evidence for reliable and valid assessment items in both community and VA 
facilities. [36] In addition to his extensive research outside of VA settings, [CONTACT_748499] did his Geriatric 
Medicine Fellowship at the Sepulveda VAMC, and subsequently served as the medical director of that 
facility’s CLC. He directed the Atlanta VAMC Rehabilitation Research and Devel opment Center and 
served as an investigator in the Birmingham -Atlanta VA GRECC. During that time he successfully 
conducted a multi -CLC study of an exercise and incontinence intervention. Orna Intrator, Ph.D. is an 
applied mathematician, health services res earcher who is a funded VA investigator studying use of long 
term care services by [CONTACT_748482].  She has been a long -time 
collaborator with [CONTACT_213549] examining nursing home hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748376]. [12, 19, 49]  Ciaran Phibbs is a health economist 
with a long time interest in estimating the cost of medical interventions, particularly for the chronically 
impaired. [50, 51]  He has integrated multiple sorts of health care utilization records in characterizing the 
costs of mental illness and experienced by [CONTACT_284171]. [52, 53]  [CONTACT_748500] is an experienced 
physician health services researcher who is one of the most experienced researchers in the long term 
care arena in the VA having done seminal research on the predictors of pressure ulcers, the 
measu rement of nursing home quality indicators and the use of multiple pharmacologic agents by [CONTACT_748483]. [54, 55] 
 
Examination of CLC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748377] 2008.  We accumulated all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748378], both those 
occurring in VAMCs and those occurring in Medicare reimbursed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Given the relatively high use 
of Medicare h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_748379], we were surprised to see that only 7% of all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748380] a VAMC.  As expected, this varied from a high of 
nearly 50% in a small CLC to virtually no non -VAMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748381].  We calculated 
the number of acute events per Veteran and constructed the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748382]. We did this by [CONTACT_748484] 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023558]. Intrator. [56]  
Across all CLCs, we found that there were .35 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748383] 23.5% of Veterans ever in 
the CLC in 2008 were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], suggesting  that some individuals were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748384].  
Indeed, we find that the observed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748385] 1.3 per person year, ranging from a high of 1.1 
to a low of .1!  Both of these outliers had relatively few patient days suggesting that they hou se 
relatively few patients at any given time.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_748386], we should be able to effectively 
match CLCs with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748387] -range.   
 
Limitations:  
 
Like all research studies, ours has various limitations. First, our design requires comparisons over time 
and between our intervention and control VAMCs under which we assume no other competing forces 
such as policy changes that might confound our interpretation. Secondly, we assume that reductions in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748388] e from the Veterans’ perspective and that many of the current 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748389], indeed, avoidable.  Third, we assume that CLCs offered the 
opportunity to introduce a new training program will be interested in doing so, which, given  the strong 
interest in the private sector, we feel will actually occur.  Fourth, we are explicitly treating the 
introduction of the INTERACT intervention as a quality improvement demonstration which CLCs and 
VAMC leadership can choose to adopt as an admin istrative practice rather than as research per se .  
Finally, as noted, it is likely that the intervention would be more smoothly implemented were its 
documentation features fully integrated into Veteran’s medical record, but the complications and cost 
associated with such a significant local departure fr om the medical record system may be too great to 
be borne by a single research project.    
 
Dissemination : 
 
As part of the LTC CREATE, the INTERACT trial is embedded within a broader dissemination structure 
that has direct access to senior officials within  the VHA who are committed to transforming the 
character of the VHA long term care system to be more Veteran centered and evidence based. This is 
described in detail in the accompanying CREATE overview.  Our principle vehicle for dissemination is the 
Geria tric and Extended Care (GEC) service and the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural 
Transformation (OPCCCT).  Every [ADDRESS_1023559] will be 
highlighted and incorporated into a report that Planetree (currently a major contractor to OPCCCT 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_748390]) prepares and which identifies examples of positive instances of 
transformation around the country.  Thus , GEC leadership will be fully engaged in interpreting and then 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a practical implementation strategy for the findings of the INTERACT research program.   
 
Another aspect of our dissemination plan is to publish study results via the academic and c linical 
journals and to present study results at clinical meetings such as the American Geriatrics Society, the 
American Medical Directors Association and VAHSR&D annual meetings.  Since Drs. Saliba and Ouslander 
are leaders in the geriatrics and long term  care communities and [CONTACT_748501] is a well -known figure in 
the VA HSR&D system, we are confident that presentations, including pre -conference workshops, will be 
well attended since they represent a great draw. As importantly, the whole issue of re -hospi [INVESTIGATOR_748391] a major issue in clinical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748392] a trial revealing reductions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748393].

Amendment 15  Human Subjects : 
 
Risks to Subjects:  This proposed project has two different aspects of human subjects research: 
1. Use of de -identified, sensitive health data which will be accessed for all Veterans receiving long term 
care over the period 2008 through 2017; and 2. CLC staff of the up to [ADDRESS_1023570] groups is described separately in the sections below.  
 
Data Sources and Data Handling :  There are two major types of data used in this project:  
Veteran specific data and organization level data. These data will be assembled from existing 
administrative data sources available either from the VA or from sources assembled by [CONTACT_748486].  All individually identifiable datasets made availa ble by [CONTACT_748487] a unique 
identifier, the scrambled SSN, which is a formula -based encryption of the individual's Social Security 
Number. The identifier is consistent for a given patient across datasets and this project’s fiscal years and 
will enable us to access and link data from all of the data sources required for this project.  
 
All organization level data are identified by [CONTACT_5640] a federal identification number (Medicare/ Medicaid 
certified community nursing homes), or by [CONTACT_748488] (s tation). Organization level data 
include public available data from the Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) of Medicare/ 
Medicaid certified nursing homes, the Area Resource File (ARF) obtained from the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Serv ices ( http://arf.hrsa.gov/overview.htm ).  
 
VA data will be extracted from Austin Automated Center via VA intranet. Following a signed DUA with 
VIReC /CMS, VIReC  will set up a secure share for us to transfer t he finder file containing scrambled SSNs 
of Veterans residing in VA CLCs, as required for the project.  
 
Data Assurances : 
 
Adequacy of Protection against Risk:  The procedures described in this section address our 
efforts to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality.  All research personnel involved in the project 
will have successfully completed the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) at the VA and  all other 
elements of human research protections education programs required by [CONTACT_748489].  
 
The primary risk for this study is the potential of loss of confidentiality resulting from a breach of data 
security. This risk is low. We will reduce t his risk by [CONTACT_748490] a protected location in the 
Providence VA Medical Center and by [CONTACT_748491]. All data analytic 
work will occur in the Providence VAMC on the secure cluster present there after VA and Medicare files 
are downloaded from the VA system in Austin. All personal identifiers are removed from the dataset 
prior to generating analytic files thus further minimizing the risk of loss of identifiable data.  
 
The Providence COIN  computing infrastructure consis ts of a Windows server ( COIN  server), accessed via 
remote desktop sessions and client Windows PCs. Network security is provided by a combination of VA 
firewalls, local network access controls, and continuous auditing and monitoring for security 
breaches.  Access from systems external to the VA’s intranet and COIN  server is limited to encrypted 
channels, e.g. VPN. Access to the COIN  server is independent from the general VA network to provide an 
extra layer of protection.   
 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /[ADDRESS_1023571]’s programmer and investigat or. No data may 
be transferred to other computers (desktops or laptops) unless they are stripped of all identifiable 
information. COIN  employees sign a VA privacy agreement to ensure confidentiality of all sensitive 
information, and its violation may resul t in criminal charges and a fine of from $5,000 to $20,000.  
 
The COIN ’s computer system is highly secure, and accessible only to authorized users.  Within the group 
of authorized users, access to project data is restricted to critical research support sta ff and INTERACT 
Study Facilitators, as well as CLC specific Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748410]) .Data uploaded to the project SharePoint is stored in the VA environment on a secure VA server 
behind the VA firewall.  
 
Data are de -identified before analytic files are created, providing an additional level of protection. 
Furthermore, COIN  employees have signed an oath of confidentiality, and its violation is sufficient 
grounds for immediate termination. Finally, analysis results are always presented in aggregate form with 
minimum cell sizes restricted to greater than [ADDRESS_1023572].  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  
 
To ensure the safety of Veterans in the CLC and confirm the intervention is not reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748411]’ we have created a safety monitoring plan as described below which has 
been r eviewed and signed off on by  [CONTACT_748492]  (DSMB) .  
1. We will generate mortality data for all CLC residents in both INTERACT (experimental) and 
control facilities, charting changes in mortality rates relative to the historical and contemporary 
mortality rates of paired facilities;  
2. The INTERACT (experimental) CLCs will complete SBAR Progress Notes regarding acute changes 
in conditions for Veterans. These forms are completed by [CONTACT_748493] a 
clinical change in a patients’ cond ition that warrants a discussion with the physician regarding 
the need for changes in standing orders.  There is considerable detail on patients’ clinical 
condition at the time along with information on the disposition of the case;  
3. Staff will transfer the names of cases for which  an SBAR is completed to Providence VAMC 
research staff via a joint SharePoint  and Providence staff will keep records of SBARs used.   
4. The INTERACT (experimental) CLCs, during every other week calls with the site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748412]’s for whom an SBAR form was completed during the 
previous timeframe.  
5. During these qualitative interviews/calls with CLC site Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748413] a Veteran had an SBAR completed, but was not transferred to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748414]/or is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748415].  These cases will be further discussed based upon the content of the SBAR 
progress note.   A standardized set of open ended questions will be asked focusing on whether 
the Veteran should have been transferred to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513984], based upon the SBAR progress

Amendment 15  VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) : 
 
As VA and VHA research progresses, large amou nts of data are being collected into databases 
maintained by a variety of investigators, studies, and locations. Individual investigators and multiple 
databases may lack sufficient resources to ensure consistency and quality control, or a long -term 
commitm ent to data storage and access. Therefore, there are less consistent standards for the 
protection of Veterans data, data quality, and data access compared to a centralized repository. A 
centralized research data repository, such as the VA Informatics and C omputing Infrastructure (VINCI), 
offers a number of important advantages: Consistent, defined, and transparent security and standards 
for access to data; a common point of entry for all investigators who use the data; tools for analysis and 
reporting; tigh ter and more consistent control over the standards and quality of the data included; and 
the ability to standardize and update terminology and format as technology and methodology improve. 
VINCI is a partnership between the VA Office of Information Technol ogy (OI&T) and the Veterans’ Health 
Administration Office of Research and Development (VHA ORD). VINCI provides the storage and server 
technologies to securely host suites of databases integrated from select national data. These servers 
reside at the Austi n Information Technology Center (AITC), located in Austin, [LOCATION_007]. To ensure the 
protection of Veterans data, VINCI maintains compliance with the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_108814] (VHA) Handbook 1200.12, Use of Data and Data Repositorie s in VHA Research and 
all other applicable VA and VHA policies and regulations. In addition, VINCI has undergone all security 
certification activities in support of obtaining an Authorization to Operate (ATO). Access to VINCI 
resources will be approved in accordance with the requirements of National Data Systems (NDS), VHA 
Handbook 1200.12, Use of Data and Data Repositories in VHA Research, and all other applicable VA and 
VHA policies and regulations. Researchers and Operations staff will access the data al ong with the tools 
for analysis and reporting in the secure, virtual working environment through a certified VHA network 
computer using the VA INTRANET (NOTE:   VINCI is not accessible through the INTERNET).   If not working 
within a VA or VHA hosted office environment containing VA network access, researchers may access 
VINCI through an approved Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Desktop application. The remote 
computing environment will enable data analysis to be done directly on VINCI -CDW servers loc ated at 
the Austin Information Technology Center, thus keepi[INVESTIGATOR_748417].  
 
Data Collection  
VA provides care to veterans at over 1,[ADDRESS_1023573] system known as the Veterans 
Information System Technology Architecture (VistA). VistA provides a longitudinal view for patients 
receiving care nationwide including diagnosis, procedures, pharmac y, orders, labs, microbiology, 
physiologic measurements, and text documents. VA uses [ADDRESS_1023574] over 1.03 Billion documents (e.g., 
Progress Notes, Discharge Summaries, Reports) accumulating at a rate of 638,000 each workday; 1.65 
Billion orders (+955,000 each workday); 590 Million images (+884,000 each workday); 1.0 6 Billion vital 
sign measurements (+729,000 each workday) and 850 Million medication administrations (+607,000 
each workday).  
 
VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) aggregates data sources from individual VistA 
systems, data from the Regional  Data Warehouses for all 4 VA regions, the VA Corporate Data 
Warehouse, and the VA Health Data Repository and prepares them for research use. Other data 
published by [CONTACT_92527] (DSS) and Inpatient and Outpatient Medical SAS 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 38 of 43 
Amendment 15  (MedSAS) ca n be requested through VINCI. VA National Data Services and other data stewards regulate 
the right to use the data, but VINCI facilitates the process. VINCI servers for data, applications and 
virtual sessions are physically located in the VA Automation Cen ter in Austin, [LOCATION_007]. This secure enclave 
with [ADDRESS_1023575] ed from source databases and placed in SQL tables accessible only to the research team and VA 
Automation Center OI&T operations personnel.  
 
The Communication tools and Quality Improvement Tools will be used to track Veterans changes in 
condition and hospit alizations.  During calls with CLC Champi[INVESTIGATOR_748418], a transfer cou ld have been prevented .  A root cause analysis 
assessment will be performed to determine better practices for future  instances of similar conditions.  
The research team will track data for the pair matched facilities and provide aggregate, de -identified 
data for the Data Safety Monitoring Board (See page 31).  
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) : 
 
The VINCI application library has a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for extracting 
information from unstructured text. The ability to create textual reports offers flexibility to clinicians for 
describing symptoms, vital signs, behaviors, attitude, instructions, patient and family history, and much 
more; but free text is not a data format well suited to the analytical tools familiar to researchers.  
VINCI has an NLP “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]”, a collection of configurable NLP modules available as a Service  Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) within the VINCI processing environment. This SOA pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], named V3NLP, is more 
easily configured than other NLP pi[INVESTIGATOR_748419]. VINCI and their cus tomers have adapted V3NLP to data patterns specific to the 
VA and V3NLP has been used for several clinical use cases.  
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others : 
 
Although there are no direct benefits to human subjects, this study would provide information that 
would assist policy makers and facility administrators. The minimal risks to subjects are reasonable for 
the importance of the information that will help und erstand the variation and outcomes of health care 
transitions. Reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748420]. In addition,

Women and Minority Representation : 
 
The cohort selected for this study will be population based, thus ensuring adequate representation of 
minorities and women, as represented among the overall veteran population served in nursing homes. 
According to a recent report, among newly admitted ve terans to VHA NHCU between June 1999 and 
Version 1 4:  06/28 /17                                VA Central IRB Protocol                                       Page 39 of 43 
Amendment 15  October 2004, 97% of the population were men, 82% were white, 13% were African American, and 5% 
were of other racial or ethnic background25.  
 
Since 2003, the VA has collected self -reported race in compliance with a new federal guideline from the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In FY 2003 the variables RACE1 - RACE6 were added to the 
SAS Inpatient Datasets and in FY 2004 RACE1 - RACE7 were  added to the SAS Outpatient Datasets to 
allow for multiple race reporting. These new variables are coded to incorporate both race and method 
of collection. Hispanic ethnicity is recorded as a separate variable under the new coding.  The variable 
ETHNIC wa s added to the SAS Inpatient Datasets in FY 2003 and to the Outpatient Datasets in FY 2004. 
The RACE variable is only partially populated in the FY 2003 Medical SAS Inpatient Main Dataset and is 
entirely empty in the FY 2004 Inpatient Main Dataset. VIReC c onducted a study examining issues related 
to the transition to the new race/ethnicity data collection standards in the VA 60. Using Medical SAS 
Inpatient and Outpatient Datasets for FY 1997 through FY 2002 and FY 2004, the researchers found that 
the agreement between observer -recorded race before the transition and self -reported r ace/ethnicity in 
FY 2004 was high overall and among White and African American (AA) VHA users.  This result suggests 
that observer -recorded and self -reported data for these groups can be used across years without 
creating serious bias. Observer -recorded ra ce was less reliable for non -AA minorities.  The investigators 
demonstrated that combining those groups to create a higher -level more inclusive group improved 
accuracy of observer -reported race/ethnicity and that the AA and non -AA distinction provided the 
greatest agreement between observer - and self -reported race/ethnicity. Consistent with VIREC’s 
recommendation ( http://www.virec.research.va.gov/DataSourcesCategory/DataQuality/HSRD 
_Data _Quality_Alert.pdf ), we plan to use race/ethnicity as a 3 level categorical variable identifying 
Whites, African Americans, and other minorities.  For veterans enrolled in Medicare, the Medicare 
denominator file is considered of good quality with few missi ng values, and will be preferred to the VHA 
recorded race/ ethnicity. Other veterans’ not enrolled in Medicare who have missing race/ ethnicity 
information will be examined for evidence of race/ ethnicity in prior year’s  data.

I. Hypothesis  and Specific  Aims
We hypothesize that the  BSE  assessment  of swallowing  certain consistencies will provide the most  
accurate diagnosis  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
A.  Specific  Aim #1:  To develop  a BSE-based non-invasive clinical prediction rule (CPR) that will 
accurately and efficiently diagnose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600075].
B.  Specific  Aim #2:  To identify abnormalities in laryngeal structure and swallowing physiology that are 
associated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600076].
.
Study Design: Prospective cohort study of patients with acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_600077] 48 hours. 
Inclusion Criteria:
1. Admission to an ICU.
2. Mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube  for greater than 48 hours. 
Exclusion Criteria:
1. Age < [ADDRESS_794804], a SLP will perform a comprehensive BSE  on each ARF survivor.  
Subsequently a second blinded  SLP/investigator will perform the FEES to determine  whether  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600078]. The  FEES  examination will  also identify abnormalities associated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
For Aim #1: Primary Outcome Variable: Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (PAS score of ≥6)  on the FEES with any of the five 
feedings. A  PAS score  of ≥ 6 includes  patients with  both  silent and non-silent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
Statistical analysis: Recursive partitioning or Classification and Regress Tree (CART) analysis creates a 
tree that  asks a  series  of yes/no questions, taking the user down  different branches depending on the 
answers. At  the end  of each branch will  be an estimated probability of outcome.  
For Aim #2: Primary outcome  variables: Presence of abnormalities in the four laryngeal  functions  and two  
swallowing physiology  measures.  
Statistical analysis:  For each outcome and independent variable, a univariate logistic  regression model  will 
be developed.  
Overall Sample  Size  Determination: In a simulated data analysis,  a sample size of 200 yielded an area  
under the curve (AUC) of .75 for the resultant tree algorithm. To be conservative,  we will enroll  a total of 225 
patients.
Significance:  For the 455,000 acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  (ARF) survivors  each year, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148450] a 
devastating complication that can develop after the initiation of oral nutrition.1;2 Occurring in as  many

Speech language  pathologists (SLPs) determine when ARF survivors can resume oral feeding.11 
Based on our national survey, SLPs commonly  rely upon the bedside  swallow evaluation (BSE)  to provide 
feeding recommendations for ARF survivors.11 The BSE  consists  of a comprehensive history and physical 
examination followed by [CONTACT_600179]’s ability to swallow foods  and liquids of different 
consistencies. SLPs do not routinely order or perform gold standard  tests such  as a videofluoroscopic  
swallow study  (VFSS) or flexible endoscopic swallow study  (FEES).[ADDRESS_794806] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600082]. 12-22 Due to differences  in 
the reasons for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], CPRs  for these  patients are  unlikely to be effective for ARF survivors. 12-14;16;20 As 
a result, there are no BSE-based diagnostic non-invasive  CPRs 
that SLPs can  use to  provide  feeding recommendations  for ARF 
survivors.  
Using recursive partitioning analysis  (RPA), we  will develop 
an effective  diagnostic CPR to accurately detect 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600075]. RPA has been previously 
used to create clinically  useful  CPRs including:

TRIAL DESCRIPTION
Background: 
Dysphagia and subsequent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600091] (ARF).  
Each year more than 700,000  patients  develop  ARF requiring mechanical ventilation.  The care of these 
patients costs an estimated $27 billion, or 12% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96375].2 Based on a 65% rate of survival,  
455,[ADDRESS_794813] cope  
with a  variety  of consequences of their critical  illness.53-58 One previously under-recognized consequence of 
ARF is dysphagia and subsequent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].6;25;26 As summarized in our two recently published clinical 
reviews on dysphagia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600092], as many as  44% of ARF survivors 
(200,000 patients annually) have difficulty with  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].25;26 Whether clinically significant or “silent” 
(without symptoms), aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600093], percutaneous feeding  tube placement,  an 
increased need for institutionalized care, and increased  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69436]. 9;59-61
The bedside  swallowing  evaluation (BSE) is commonly used to diagnose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600086]. Every  90 seconds, a  critical  care practitioner in the [LOCATION_002] determines  when it is safe to 
restart oral nutrition for an ARF survivor.1;[ADDRESS_794814]  critical care practitioners delegate this  decision to speech-
language pathologists  (SLPs).11 In more than 60% of ARF  survivors, SLPs perform a  bedside evaluation 
(BSE) as  their  sole assessment to detect aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600094].11 The BSE 
consists of two components:  1) a history and physical examination, and 2) an assessment of the patient’s 
ability to swallow foods and  liquids of different consistencies. SLPs do not routinely order or perform gold 
standard tests such as  a videofluoroscopic swallow  study (VFSS)  or flexible  endoscopic swallow  study 
(FEES) to detect aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].11
The BSE may not accurately diagnose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600089]. By [CONTACT_600180], clinical prediction  rules (CPRs)  have been developed for  patients with head and neck  cancer  or 
cerebrovascular accidents.16-18;31;62-[ADDRESS_794815] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600095]. 1) The proposed  mechanisms responsible  for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600096] a BSE.9;59-61 2) 
Decreased saliva production  after radiation  alters swallowing function and has been included in head and 
cancer specific CPRs.12-14;20;66;[ADDRESS_794816] likely not contribute to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600097]. 3)  Some aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600098]; creating both a  selection bias and limiting generalizability of the results.69;70;72 4) Due to their 
diminished respi[INVESTIGATOR_2607], the consequences  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600099].73 Therefore 
CPRs might need  to be more sensitive  for the detection of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 5) Certain CPRs were developed  
without comparison to  a gold standard test of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_465800] a VFSS or FEES.69;70;72 6) The [ADDRESS_794817] (3-WST)  is a sensitive  initial  screening  test in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. However,  it is unclear 
whether the 3-WST applies to ARF survivors, or what BSE components could be combined with the 3-WST 
to confirm aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].74-76 
Because the mechanisms responsible for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600100], there are no medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_600101] .26 Currently SLPs treat patients  with 
suspected aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600102],  adjusting the consistency of their food or liquids, or 
teaching patients different  swallowing maneuvers.77-90 All of these interventions limit  the chance of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600103].77-90 There  are several 
abnormalities in ARF survivors that  may  be responsible for dysphagia and subsequent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (Figure  
2). These  abnormalities  may  be caused by [CONTACT_600181],  deconditioning,  critical  illness 
polyneuromyopathy, reduced pharyngeal clearance, and/or limited respi[INVESTIGATOR_2607].27-31;52;91-96 We 
identified specific abnormalities in laryngeal function and swallowing physiology that are associated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600089] (see preliminary data).52 
Additional studies are  needed to  delineate  the 
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page  4
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015
mechanisms responsible  for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600104].
PRELIMINAR Y DATA:  1.Longer duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with dysphagia.5 We 
conducted a cohort study of  446 ARF patients admitted to the Medical  ICU who required  mechanical 
ventilation and received  a BSE.  Patients with prior  neuromuscular disorders were excluded.   Dysphagia 
was present in 84% of  patients (mild  in 52% and moderate/severe in 48%). After  adjustment, longer duration 
of mechanical ventilation was independently associated with moderate/severe dysphagia (AOR 2.84  [1.78-
4.56], p <0.01).  These results suggest that dysphagia  is common in ARF survivors.
2. In ARF survivors, dysphagia  can persist until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600105].  5 Moderate/severe dysphagia was independently associated 
with the composite outcome of pneumonia, re-intubation, or in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473]  (AOR 3.31  [1.78-4.56], 
p<0.01) (Figure 3). In ARF survivors, dysphagia was  still present in 55%  of patients  at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600106] (8 [5-
15] days  vs 5 [3-8] days after the initial BSE was performed, p<0.01). Patients with moderate/severe 
dysphagia were more  likely to be kept NPO after  the initial BSE (74% vs 15%, p<0.01) and receive a 
surgical feeding tube  during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(15% vs 5%,  p<0.01).   
3. Our nationwide  survey of SLPs 
identified current  practices  to detect 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600075]. 11  We 
designed, validated, and distributed a survey to 1,966 SLPs working in an inpatient setting. 
Each survey included  questions concerning  
SLP staffing  and availability,  and methods 
used in the diagnosis  and treatment of 
dysphagia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  A total of 836 SLPs completed their  survey  (43%),  [ADDRESS_794818] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600075].11  Only  
29% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600107].  Most SLPs performed the  BSE on average 24 hours  after extubation. 
Importantly, the majority of SLPs (60%) only use the BSE to  identify aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600108].  Gold standard tests (VFSS 
and FES)  are not commonly used,  and 
there is significant geographic variability  in 
their use (Figure 4). VFSS and FEES are 
also more available and  more utilized at 
university hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600109] (p < 0.01).
5. We already have enrolled 26 ARF survivors in Aim #1 without any adverse events . A total of  50% of ARF 
survivors had  evidence  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600110]. The diagnostic accuracy of each individual assessment of Figure 3
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page  5
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015
swallowing foods and liquids of different consistencies appears to be poor for  detecting true aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (see 
Table 1).   These data demonstrate feasibility to complete the studies in Aim  #1. By [CONTACT_600182], we anticipate that  we will be able to develop a more  accurate diagnostic CPR for  
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
6. In ARF survivors, abnormalities  of laryngeal  function and  swallowing physiology  are associated 
with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (Aim #2 data). At [LOCATION_011] University Medical Center,  [ADDRESS_794819] 
abnormalities were  common including: laryngeal  edema, 
vocal cord  immobility, and vocal  cord  granuloma 
formation. Vocal cord granulomas  were  associated with 
severe dysphagia or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (p = 0.04). This work has  
been submitted for publication and demonstrates the feasibility to complete the studies in  Aim #2.
OBJECTIVES
To develop  a BSE-based non-invasive clinical prediction  rule (CPR) that will accurately and efficiently 
diagnose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600089].
To identify abnormalities in laryngeal structure and swallowing physiology that are associated  with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600111].
Primary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the BSE assessment of swallowing certain  consistencies will 
provide the most accurate  diagnosis of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
1.  Screening  and recruitment:  
Patients meeting enrollment  criteria will be approached  for informed consent  no later than  72 hours after  
extubation. Surrogate  consent may be used if patients are unable to provide their own informed consent due 
to lack  of decisional  capacity.
Inclusion Criteria: Subjects  will be eligible to  participate in the study if they meet  all of the following  
criteria:
1. Admission  to a University  of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600112]
2. Mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube for greater than 48 hours
Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Age < 18 years  
2. Contraindication to enteral nutrition administration.
3. Pre-existing or acute  primary central or peripheral  neuromuscular disorder 
4. Pre-existing history of dysphagia or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
5. Pre-existing head and neck cancer or surgery.
6. Presence of  a tracheostomy.
7. Coagulopathy resulting  in uncontrolled nasal  or pharyngeal bleeding.
8. Unable to participate due to altered mental status
9. Extubated for greater  than 72 hours. 
10. Inability to obtain  informed consent from patient or an appropriate surrogate.
11. Pregnancy
12.  Imprisoned  at the time of admission, anytime during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or anytime  during the 
follow up period
If patients  meet  an exclusion  criterion,  they can be re-evaluated  to determine if the exclusion criteria no 
longer exists; up to 72 hours after  extubation. The presence  of delirium is  the one exclusion criterion that is 
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page  6
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015most likely to change over time and require repeated assessments.
There is no  minimal amount of time that  is required after extubation  to be enrolled into the study (as long as 
the patient  meets the inclusion criteria and does not currently meet  any of the exclusion  criteria. 
After enrollment, the research  coordinator should complete the demographic information on the Case 
Report Forms. No fields on the Case Report Forms should be left blank. The research  coordinator should 
also contact [CONTACT_600183],  and the second SLP who will perform the FEES. The 
research coordinator should arrange a specific time that  the BSE and FEES will be performed. 
Screening and recruitment techniques:
Every new  ICU admission receiving mechanical  ventilation will be screened,  wherein  an established 
treatment relationship exists. This will  include but not be limited to admissions from the ED, wards,  and 
operating room. We will also assess patients transferred from  outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The enrollment window for  
these patients will include the time during admission  at the outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600113]. 
The research coordinators or site PI [INVESTIGATOR_600114]. During this time, the residents will be alerted to each of the study inclusion  and exclusion  
criteria.  We would also recommend developi[INVESTIGATOR_600115].  Each day, the research coordinator will 
identify each  patient who is endotracheally  intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation  for at least 48 
hours. Patients  will then be followed until they are extubated.
At the  time of extubation, the  patient by [CONTACT_600184]. At this point the 
patient should  be entered into  the screening log in one of several ways
1. If they  meet a  permanent exclusion criteria, they should be entered  as be excluded  from the study
2. If they  meet a  potentially transient exclusion (like  altered mental  status), they should be followed for  up to 
72 hours after  exclusion  to determine if the exclusion criteria resolves.  If it resolves they should  approached  
for enrollment
3. If the patient meets no exclusion criteria,  they should be  approached about study participation.
4. If they  agree to  participate and sign the consent form then they are enrolled into the study.
5. If they  decline to  participate, then they should be entered  as an excluded patient.
Informed consent:
Obtaining informed consent  is a process that  is reviewed by [CONTACT_600185] a monthly  basis. All of the personnel involved in screening and patient identification  have successfully  
completed the on-line  course  on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Informed  consent will be obtained 
from each  patient or legally  authorized  representative (LAR) prior to enrollment  in the trial. No study 
procedures will be done prior  to obtaining informed consent. Permission to approach  patients and/or LARs 
will be  requested from the attending physicians.
In general our methods for  obtaining informed consent include  the following:  1. identification and contact [CONTACT_600186],  2. arrangement of a  mutually acceptable  meeting  time with 
this party in a private conference room or in the patient’s room,  and 3. a lengthy discussion between the 
study investigator and the interested party.  The discussion includes an update of the patient’s overall  
condition justifying the rationale  for inclusion of the patient  into the specific trial.  The consent form is 
reviewed in detail including the  background  information and rationale  regarding the specific intervention of 
the study, potential risks and options.   Patients or their representatives are informed of their rights as a 
research subject  and are informed  of their  ability  to discontinue study participation at any time throughout 
the trial.  Subjects  or their  representatives are given the  opportunity to ask any questions regarding the 
verbally described consent form.  Following  this discussion, opportunity is  given to privately read  the 
consent form.   If the patient or representative is illiterate,  the consent form is read to them.   After sufficient 
time, an additional  question and answer session  is performed if needed. 
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page  7
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015A few key points  to the informed consent  process.
1. Sit down when you are taking to the patient and/or  surrogate.
2. Explain who you are  and that you normally  work  with patients in the intensive  care unit.
3. Explain that you are  here  to help  determine if the patient is  swallowing normally. 
4. Explain that difficulty swallowing is common after being on a  breathing machine
5. State  that the  standard tests to determine whether  someone  can swallow properly  after being  on a 
breathing machine are  to have a nurse or speech therapi[INVESTIGATOR_600116]  a person  swallow liquids  and foods of 
different consistencies.  However, these tests are not perfect. Sometimes it appears that the patient  can eat 
normally, and they are actually swallowing things down  the wrong tube (into  their lungs), Other times,  it 
appears that the patient is not swallowing properly when  they  actually are swallowing properly.
6. In addition to  this normal swallowing exam,  there  is an  additional simple test we can do that is above and 
beyond the normal swallowing exam. This additional technique will definitively identify if someone is  
swallowing normally, and  allow us to identify the correct  strategy for  eating. Sometimes  we do this  test as 
part of the normal patient swallowing evaluation. 
7. The test  is simple and  down  right here in the patient’s room. It takes 5-[ADDRESS_794820] if they want. We will put a  very small  tube  (like a very thin straw) down the back  of the throat  
so we  can see  your  vocal cords. We will  then have you swallow liquids and foods  of different consistencies 
and see if the material is actually going down the  wrong tube. 
8. Share these results  with your doctors so they have the additional information  and can use the information  
to potentially take better  care of you in  regard  to your feeding  and swallowing. 
If the patient  agrees to  the study, then the coordinator should contact [CONTACT_600187], 
and the second SLP who will perform the FEES.

Next, a SLP will perform  a comprehensive BSE  on each  ARF survivor, and a second blinded SLP will 
perform the FEES to  determine whether aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600118]. The order of the BSE and FEES exams 
will be  randomized. The  reason  for the random  order of the tests  is that after  several swallows,  a patient  
who has not eaten orally in several days or weeks will  start to do better  as the system  “wakes up”.  If  the 
BSE always precedes  the FEES, it might lead  to a false result – it would show more  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600119].   But it won’t  be because the BSE  was showing a  false positive; in fact it is just that the 
patient started  to improve by [CONTACT_600189].
2. Bedside Evaluation:
The BSE protocol should be  performed within  [ADDRESS_794821] 
manner for  all patients. Unless there a  medical  restrictions (due to femoral lines, sacral wounds, etc), all 
BSEs should be performed in a sitting position. The  SLP will document  the patient position that the BSE was 
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page  8
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015performed.
Part 1: Initial Assessment:  The SLP will  review the subject’s medical record and become knowledgeable 
with the patient’s medical history. The patient should  be seated with the head of the bed as elevated  as 
possible.  A physical exam of the aerodigestive  system will be performed including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; saliva  
formation; lip  seal;  tongue movement, strength, and  coordination; palate movement, gag reflex; cough 
reflex; and voice quality/dysphonia. In addition, the SLP will also determine cough strength in L/min  using a 
peak flow  meter (HealthScan, Cedar Grove, NJ).
Part 2: Standardized consistency testing:  The SLP will  then  administer five  standard  consistencies.[ADDRESS_794822] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498]: 1) ½ tsp, then  1  tsp ice chips ,  2) 1 tsp 
of nectar thick liquids,  then  3 tsp of  nectar thick liquids, 3)  a 2 ounce patient  controlled administration  of 
nectar thick liquids, 4) 1  tsp of pureed solids (applesauce), then 10 mls  of pureed solids (applesauce), 5) 5 
mls of thin liquids (water  or milk),15 mls of  thin liquids  (water or milk), and a  2 ounce patient  controlled 
administration of thin  liquids  and 6) ¼ of a graham  cracker.107 The patient  will be instructed to chew the 
graham cracker  before swallowing. In  order to limit the complexity and duration of our consistency testing, 
honey-thick liquids will be excluded from the  protocol. 
The SLP will wait for 10 seconds following the completion of each individual trial before recording the results 
for that consistency.  The following adverse  outcomes (coughing/choking, change  in breath sounds, and 
change in voice quality,  throat clearing, or change in pulse oximetry recording by  > 10%) will be recorded 
after each trial. 
If the clinician feels it is unsafe to  continue with  the next bolus consistency, the protocol  can be stopped at 
any time.
Coughing/coughing:  Dichotomized  as a single cough  or choking sound within 10 seconds after  diet 
administration (yes/no).
Change in breath sounds:  Breath  sounds  will be assessed before and 10 seconds after the examination by  
[CONTACT_600190]-cricoid  space during  quiet breathing  or listening  to the 
patient’s breathing without a  stethoscope.  The SLP will record whether  they used a stethoscope or not to 
listen for change in  breath  sounds. Patients  will be classified as  “gurgling” or “non-gurgling.”  Gurgling is a 
low/medium-pi[INVESTIGATOR_600120].108   
Change in vocal quality:   Baseline  vocal quality will be assessed  initially and dichotomized as  
normal/abnormal.  Any transition from normal  to abnormal vocal quality  during feeding will be recorded.
Part 3: Three Ounce Water Swallow Test (3-WST):  During the  standardized 3-WST, patients receive three 
ounces of water and are instructed to drink the entire amount, via cup or straw,  completely and without 
interruption (the cup can  be held to the patient’s mouth by [CONTACT_127428]).74;76;[ADDRESS_794823] will be scored as  
pass/fail.  Criteria for failure of the 3-WST are: the inability to drink the entire  amount, coughing or choking 
up to  1 minute after completion, or the presence of a wet-hoarse vocal quality. 
At this point the SLP will document their diet recommendations, and whether further invasive testing (MBSS 
or FEES) is indicated.  
Subsequently, the SLP can perform additional testing including specific maneuvers. The results of these  
additional tests will be recorded in  the CRF. The SLP will then document their diet recommendations that 
include the knowledge gained from the additional testing. Again the SLP will document  whether  further 
invasive testing  (MBSS or FEES) is indicated. 
Based on these recommendations, the patient will be allowed to advance  their diet prior to the performance 
of the  FEES, if indicated.
The coordinator should  make sure that  the BSE  CRF is completely filled  out before the SLP who completed 
the test leaves the ICU.

The BSE form for consistency testing in attached as Appendix.
3. FEES examination: The SLP will review the subject’s  medical record and become  knowledgeable with 
the patient’s medical  history. The FEES examination will be performed by a second SLP who is blinded to 
the results of the BSE. The  FEES should be performed within approximately  4 hours  of the BSE.
Similar to the BSE, the patient should be seated with  the head  of the bed as  elevated as possible. At the  
discretion of the SLP/investigator, Afrin  and Lidocaine spray can be administered into the nasal  passage 
before the laryngoscope is inserted. The use of these medications will be noted  in the case report form. 
Part 1: First the SLP will perform and  videotape  the examination of the upper airway.
Velar closure, base of  the tongue  retraction,  laryngeal elevation, right  and left vocal cord/arytenoid mobility, 
right and left pharyngeal wall  medialization, epi[INVESTIGATOR_600121], granuloma formation, and upper airway 
edema will be  assessed. 
Laryngeal sensation will  be assessed by [CONTACT_600191]  (LAR) or a patient 
response to a light touch/poke to the aeryepi[INVESTIGATOR_600122], and 
scored dichotomously.
Part 2: Standardized consistency testing:  The SLP will  then  administer five  standard  consistencies in two  
trials of  each consistency with different amounts.[ADDRESS_794824] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498]: 1) ½  tsp, then  1 tsp ice chips , 2) 1 tsp of  
nectar thick liquids,  then 3  tsp of nectar thick  liquids,  3) a 2 
ounce patient controlled administration  of nectar thick 
liquids, 4) 1 tsp of  pureed solids (applesauce), then 10 mls 
of pureed solids (applesauce), 5)  5 mls of thin liquids  (water 
or milk),15  mls of  thin liquids (water or milk), and a 2 ounce  
patient controlled  administration of thin liquids and 6) ¼ of a  
graham cracker.107  The patient will  be instructed  to chew  
the graham cracker  before swallowing. In  order  to limit the  
complexity and duration of our consistency testing, honey-thick liquids  will be excluded  from the protocol.  
After the swallow, the laryngoscope will be advanced to closely view the patient’s airway. The SLP will wait 
for [ADDRESS_794825]
 
The entire  FEES will be video recorded. The SLP will score  each of the trials  using the PAS  score (Table 3).   
In addition for each of  the trials of the consistencies, the SLP will record the following two physiological 
measures: 
1) Swallowing onset time:  The time from first bolus visualization until swallow  onset.  
2) Incomplete bolus clearance: leaving residue in  the pharynx or laryngeal vestibule after  a swallow.
Using the video recordings, the quantification of the swallowing onset time and incomplete  bolus clearance 
will be  determined by a  single observer.
Part 3: Three  Ounce Water  Swallow Test (3-WST): During the standardized  3-WST, patients  receive 
three ounces  of water and are instructed to drink the entire amount,  via cup or straw, completely and without  
interruption (the cup can  be held to the patient’s mouth by [CONTACT_127428]).74;76;[ADDRESS_794826] leaves  the ICU. See Appendix  for FEES evaluation form.

5. Statistical analysis for Aim #1: Recursive  partitioning or Classification  and Regress  Tree (CART)  
analysis creates a  tree that asks a  series of yes/no questions, taking the user  down different branches 
depending on the answers. At the end of each branch will be an estimated probability of outcome.  
Statistically, recursive portioning is a non-parametric  approach to regression, in this  case logistic  regression.  
We will predict a class  Y (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516])  based on the  predictor variables, X1….Xn which can 
be either categorical or continuous.  The main characteristic of this method is  that predictor variables are 
“split” and partitions  are created so that  observations  with the same response variable  are grouped  together.  
After the first split,  further splits of variables will occur based on the  groups which are made from the prior 
split separately.   The goal is to group observations  with the same response class  minimizing  
misclassification.  Some  of the benefits of  using  recursive partitioning  are that the splits are  data driven, 
predictor variables  can be  used multiple  times, and interactions  will be included without having to decide  
which interactions are  important.  An algorithm  (or tree)  is obtained  that splits the predictor variables until 
each person has been  classified as  with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600125]-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50496] a terminal node.  Pruning  of the tree 
will take place by [INVESTIGATOR_16598]  a value of the change in misclassification  rate which is deemed too  small to 
include the next branches on the trees. By  [CONTACT_600192], ten-fold  cross-validation  will estimate the misclassification rate for the tree. The chosen set will be sent 
through a tree developed from  randomly choosing nine  of the sets.  The misclassification for this set will be 
calculated, and  performed 10 times until each set has been  sent through a  tree.  An average rate of 
misclassification is developed  to determine how well  the tree  based on all the data will perform on new data.
Sample Size Calculation  and Feasibility: Based on our [ADDRESS_794827] 48 hours and lived to be 
discharged to home or self-care. For recursive partitioning,  there are  no specific sample  size calculations. 
However, in a simulated data analysis, a sample size  of 200 yielded  an area under the curve (AUC)  of .75 
for the  resultant tree  algorithm. To be conservative, we will enroll  a total of 225 patients.  Based on our 
estimated number  of ARF survivors, we will need to  obtain consent from only 20.6%  of them to achieve  our 
enrollment goal. This is a  very conservative estimate for obtaining informed consent  for research on 
swallowing function.
Additional Considerations: Our primary  analysis will  develop a CPR for  the combined outcome of silent 
and non-silent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. We  will also develop a CPR  for silent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600126] a PAS score =8, 
and a CPR for non-silent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600127] a PAS score of 6-7. For each of the five different 
consistencies, the accuracy of the BSE  assessment  for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600128] (PAS ≥6).  Sensitivity,  specificity,  positive and negative predicted values  
will be  determined with  95% confidence intervals  for each point estimate. Based on a  sample size of 225 
patients, the  width  of each 95% confidence interval  point estimate will be 2-4%. 
Statistical analysis  for Aim #2: For each outcome  and independent variable, a  univariate  logistic 
regression model will  be developed.  If  the Wald test for an individual variable in the logistic regression 
model is significant  at the p  <0.[ADDRESS_794828]  
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page 11
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015whether the subject had the outcome of interest.  Using baseline demographical  information, testing for  
confounding will also be assessed to better understand the relationships  between independent  variables 
and outcomes. Based on the enrollment described  in Aim #1, we have powered  the univariate comparison 
between our  primary independent  and dependent variables for these studies. A  logistic  regression with a 
sample size between  178 and 271 observations  achieves 80%  power at a 0.[ADDRESS_794829] 
an odds ratio  between 2.5 and 3.0.  
Risks and Justifications  of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: Risks of the FEES procedure  
include patient discomfort, gagging, vomiting, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], mucosal injury , epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and an adverse 
reactions to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866].12, 15-17   One study of 500 consecutive FEES assessments reported the 
occurrence of minor epi[INVESTIGATOR_600129] 0.6% of cases.15  Another  survey

exceedingly infrequently (a total of two and four cases, respectively , ever reported out of all FEES  
procedures ever  done).[ADDRESS_794831] copi[INVESTIGATOR_600130] a locked drawer in a locked  office  at each enrolling site.  Citrix  ShareFile, a

to share de-identified FEES video recordings between the two enrolling sites.  ShareFile will be accessible 
only to approved research staff and used for the fidelity and scoring of FEES procedures by [CONTACT_431].   
Potential Scientific Problems: This study will not determine the accuracy of these  diagnostic  tests for 
patients who require mechanical ventilation for fewer than [ADDRESS_794832] to diagnose  dysphagia.10   
HUMAN SUBJECTS
Each study participant or a  legally authorized representative (LAR)  must sign and date an informed consent  
form. Institutional review  board approval will be required before any subject is entered  into the  study. PETAL 
will use  a central IRB.
SELECTION OF SUBJECTS
Federal regulations  at 45 CFR 46(a)(3) require  the equitable  selection of subjects.  The ICUs  will be 
screened to determine if any patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data that have been collected  as 
part of the routine management of the subject will be reviewed  to determine eligibility.  No protocol-specific 
tests or  procedures will be performed as part of the screening process. If any subjects meet criteria  for study 
enrollment, then the attending physician will  be asked  for permission to approach the patient or his/her LAR 
for informed  consent. Study exclusion  criteria  neither unjustly exclude classes of individuals from 
participation in the research nor unjustly  include  classes of  individuals from participation in the research. 
Hence, the  recruitment of  subjects conforms to the principle  of distributive  justice. 
JUSTIFICATION OF INCLUDING VULNERABLE SUBJECTS 
The present research aims  to investigate the ability of  a bedside evaluation to detect aspi[INVESTIGATOR_600131].   Due to the nature of acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_600132] (eg, sepsis,  
trauma), some patients  will have impaired  decision-making  capabilities. This study cannot  be conducted if 
limited to enrolling only those subjects with retained decision-making  capacity. Hence, subjects recruited for  
this trial  are not being unfairly burdened with involvement  in this  research simply  because  they are  easily 
available.
INFORMED CONSENT
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page 12
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015Federal regulations  45 CFR 46.111(a)(5) require  that informed consent  will be sought from each prospective 
subject or  the subject’s legally  authorized representative (LAR). As we will enroll  patients recovering from 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_600133]’s LAR, and thus the remainder  
of this section  will focus on LARs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the LAR understands the 
risks and benefits of participating in the  study, and answering any questions the LAR may have throughout 
the study and sharing any  new  information in  a timely manner that may be relevant to the LAR’s willingness 
to continue the  subject’s participation in  the trial. The consenter will make every effort to minimize coercion.  
All study participants or their  LARs will  be informed of the objectives of the study and the potential  risks.  The 
informed consent  document will be used to explain  the risks and benefits  of study participation  to the LAR in 
simple terms before the patient is entered into the study,  and to document that the LAR  is satisfied with his 
or her  understanding  of the risks and benefits of participating in the study and desires  to participate in the 
study.  The  investigator is responsible  for ensuring  that informed consent  is given by [CONTACT_600193]. This 
includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on  the informed  consent document  prior to the 
performance of any protocol procedures and  prior  to the administration of study agent.
CONTINUING CONSENT
For subjects for whom consent was initially obtained from a LAR, but who subsequently regains decision-
making capacity  while in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  all sites  will obtain formal consent for  continuing participation, inclusive of 
continuance of  data acquisition. The initial consent form signed by [CONTACT_600194].
WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT
Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by [CONTACT_55639])  from the trial  at any time without prejudice.  Data 
recorded up to the point of  withdrawal will be included in the trial analysis, unless  consent to use their  data 
has also been  withdrawn.  If a patient or LAR requests termination of the trial during the study period, the 
study will be  stopped  but the patient will  continue to be followed up as  part of the trial. If a patient or LAR 
withdraws consent  during trial treatment,  the trial will be stopped but permission will be sought  to access 
medical records for data related to  the study. If a patient or LAR wishes to withdraw  from the trial after 
completion of trial  treatment, permission to access medical records f or study data will be sought.  
Identification of Legally  Authorized Representatives
Many of the patients approached  for participation  in this research protocol  will invariably have limitations of 
decision-making abilities  due to their critical  illness. Hence, most  patients will not be able to provide 
informed consent.  Accordingly, informed  consent will be sought from the potential subject’s  legally 
authorized representative (LAR).  
Regarding proxy consent, the existing federal research  regulations (‘the Common Rule’) states  at 45 CFR 
46.116 that “no investigator may  involve  a human being as a  subject in research…unless  the investigator 
has obtained  the legally  effective  informed consent of the subject or the subject’s legally  authorized 
representative”; and  defines at 45 CFR 46 102 (c) a legally  authorized representative  (LAR) as  “an 
individual or judicial or  other body authorized  under applicable law  to consent on behalf of a  prospective 
subject to the  subject’s participation in  the procedures(s)  involved in the research.”  OHRP defined examples 
of “applicable law” as being state statutes,  regulations, case law, or formal  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a State Attorney 
General that addresses the issue of surrogate consent to medical procedures. Such “applicable law” could 
then be considered as empowering  the LAR to  provide  consent for  subject participation  in the research. 
Interpretation of “applicable law” may be state specific and will be addressed by [CONTACT_36985].
According to a previous President’s Bioethics Committee (National Bioethics  Advisory Committee),  an 
investigator should accept as an LAR…a relative or friend of the potential  subject who is recognized as an 
LAR for purposes of clinical decision making  under the law of the state where the research takes place 
(National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC), 1998). Finally, OHRP has stated  in their determination 
letters that  a surrogate  could serve as a LAR for research  decision making if such an individual is authorized 
under applicable state law to  provide consent for the “procedures” involved in the research  study (Office  of 
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page 13
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015Human Research Protections (OHRP), 2002).     
JUSTIFICATION OF SURROGATE CONSENT
According to the Belmont Report, respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions; first, that 
individuals should be treated as autonomous agents,  and second, that person with diminished autonomy are 
entitled to protection. One method that  serves to protect subjects is restrictions on the participation of 
subjects in  research  that presents greater than minimal risks.  Commentators and Research  Ethics 
Commissions have held the view that it is permissible to  include incapable subjects in greater than  minimal 
risk research as  long  as there  is the potential for beneficial effects  and that the research presents a balance 
of risks and  expected  direct benefits similar to  that available in the clinical  setting  (Dresser, 1999) . Several  
U.S. task forces  have  deemed  it is permissible to  include incapable subjects in research. For example, the  
American College of Physicians’ document allows surrogates to consent  to research  involving incapable 
subjects only  “if the net additional risks of participation  are not substantially greater than the risks of 
standard treatment.” (American College of  Physicians,  1989) . Finally, the National Bioethics Advisory 
Committee (NBAC) stated that an IRB may approve a protocol that presents greater than minimal risk but 
offers the prospect of  direct medical benefits  to the subject, provided that…the potential subject’s LAR gives 
permission…” (National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC), 1998)
Consistent with the above ethical sensibilities regarding the participation of decisionally incapable  subjects 
in research and the previous assessment of risks and benefits in the previous section, the present study 
presents a balance of risks  and potential direct benefits that is similar to that available in the clinical setting.    
ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS FOR VULNERABLE SUBJECTS  
The present research will involve subjects who might be vulnerable to coercion  or undue influence.  As 
required in 45CFR46.111(b), we recommend  that additional safeguards be included to protect the rights  and 
welfare of these subjects. Such safeguards might include, but are not limited  to: a) assessment of the 
potential subject’s capacity to provide informed  consent, b) the availability  of the LAR to monitor the 
subject’s subsequent participation and withdrawal  from the study;  c) augmented consent  processes. The 
specific nature  of the additional safeguards will  be left to the  discretion of the central  IRB, in conjunction with 
the sites.  
CONFIDENTIALITY
Federal regulations  at 45 CFR 46 111 (a) (7) requires that when appropriate, there  are adequate provisions  
to protect the privacy of  subjects  and to maintain the confidentiality of data. To  maintain confidentiality,  all 
laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, and  reports  will be identified  only by  a coded number.  The  coded 
number will be generated by a computer,  and only the study team will have access to the codes.  All records 
will be  kept in a locked, password protected computer.  All computer entry and networking programs will be 
done with coded numbers only.  All  paper case report forms  will be maintained inside  a locked office.  Study  
information will  not be released without the written permission of the patient, except as necessary for 
monitoring by [CONTACT_572], Lung,  and Blood  Institute, and the PETAL Clinical  Coordinating Center.
ADVERSE EVENTS
SAFETY MONITORING
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. Each participating investigator 
has primary responsibility for the safety  of the individual participants under  his or her care. The 
Investigators will determine  daily if any adverse  events  occur during the period from enrollment 
through study day [ADDRESS_794833].  
The following adverse events will be collected in the adverse event  case report forms:
Serious adverse  events
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page 14
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015Nonserious adverse events that are considered  by [CONTACT_600195] 
A clinical study adverse event is any untoward medical event associated with the study procedure  in 
humans, whether or not it is considered related to a study procedure.   
Adverse events related to  protocol procedures  must be evaluated by  [CONTACT_093]. If the adverse event is 
judged to be reportable, as outlined above,  then  the investigator will report to the medical monitor their 
assessment of the potential relatedness of each adverse event to protocol procedure. Investigators will 
assess if there is a reasonable  possibility  that the study procedure caused  the event,  based on standard 
criteria. Investigators  will also consider if the event is unanticipated or unexplained given the patient’s 
clinical course,  previous medical conditions, and concomitant medications.  
If a patient's  participation in  the study is discontinued  as a  result of an adverse  event, study site personnel  
must report the circumstances  and data leading  to discontinuation of treatment in the adverse event  case 
report forms.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious adverse  event collection begins after the patient or surrogate has signed  informed consent and has 
undergone study procedures.  If a patient experiences a serious adverse event  after  consent,  but prior to the 
start of the  study, the event will NOT be collected unless the investigator feels  the event  may have been 
caused by a protocol procedure. 
Study site personnel must alert the medical  monitor of  any serious and study procedure related adverse  
event within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event.  Alerts  issued  via telephone are to be 
immediately followed with  official  notification on the adverse event  case report form. 
As per  the FDA and NIH definitions, a serious  adverse event  is any adverse event  that results  in one of the 
following outcomes and is not classified as a clinical  outcome of acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_600134]:
Death  
A life-threatening experience (that  is, immediate risk of dying)
Prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600135]://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm:  Report  if admission to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event. Emergency room  
visits that do not result in  admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600136] (e.g., life-threatening; required intervention to prevent permanent impairment  or damage;  
other serious medically important event).
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
As per  http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm:  Report  if the adverse  
event resulted in a  substantial disruption  of a person's ability to conduct normal  life functions,  i.e., 
the adverse event resulted  in a significant,  persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in  the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.
Important medical  events  that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600137], based upon appropriate medical judgment,  they may jeopardize  
the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.
Serious adverse  events will be collected during the  first 2  study days or until ICU  discharge, whichever  
COMIRB #  12-0184 Page 15
Protocol version 3,  07/09/2015occurs first,  regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289].  Thereafter, serious adverse events  are not 
required to be reported  unless the investigator feels the events were  related  to either study drug or a 
protocol procedure.

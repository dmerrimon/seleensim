 BACKGROUND AND INTRO DUCTION : Up to one -third of patients with irritable bowel syn drome 
(IBS) describe the onset of their symptoms following an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266700]. This is called 
post-infective IBS (PI[INVESTIGATOR_266701]). 1 It is associated with an increase in inflammatory mediators such as 
prostaglandins, cytokines, and nerve growth factors. 2  Routine col on histology is usually normal; 
however, there is often  an increase in the number of mast cells and T -cells on microscopic examination.3 
It is thought that the initial inflammatory response triggers a cascade of events (mediated by [CONTACT_266714] -like receptors and NF -KB) leading to proliferation of mast cells and activation of 
enterochromaffin (EC)  cells. Intestinal mucosal mast cells attract inflammatory cells and initiate the 
innate and adaptive immune system manifested by [CONTACT_266715] T -lymphocytes, and also enhance visceral 
hypersensitivity and abdominal pain.4 Enterochromaffin cells secrete serotonin which regulates intestinal 
motility and secretion. It remains unclear whether the inflammation is the response to injury or initiates 
the disease. Nor is it known why the disease becomes self -perpetuating.  
 
NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa -light chain -enhancer of activated B cells) is a transcription factor that plays 
a central role in inflammation and immune regulation. 5 Mesalamine (5 -ASA) is a PPAR γ (peroxisome 
proliferator -activated receptor γ) agonist which among other things inhibits NF - κB.  [ADDRESS_324632] improvement in quality -of-
life (QOL) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved - perhaps suppression of the immune 
response which is partly responsible for the extraintestinal symptoms of fatigue, etc. Comp liance was a 
problem in this study as patients were not receptive to  taking [ADDRESS_324633] PI -IBS.11, 12  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of long acting mesalamine (Lialda ®) in  patients with 
PI-IBS. We will evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms, IBS specific quality of life  (IBS -QOL) before and 
after treatment with Lialda ®.  
 
Significance of this study:  
This study will test long acting mesalamine in the management of PI -IBS. It has the  potential to improve 
QOL and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms, in patients with PI -IBS. The  results of this study, if positive, 
will provide preliminary data f or a large scale clinical trial.   
 
Aim: 
To determine if mesalamine will relieve symptoms, improve QOL and reduce  inflammation in patients 
with PI -IBS. 
 
IBS 
IBS is characterized by [CONTACT_266716] (diarrhe a 
and/or constipation) in the absence of any structural abnormality.[ADDRESS_324634] frequent GI disorder seen by [CONTACT_13922], 
comprising 50% of referrals to gastroenterologists and as many as 3.[ADDRESS_324635] of IBS in the US is estimated at $1.[ADDRESS_324636], $20 billion.  The cause of IBS is not known. The speculated mechanisms of IBS include 
altered GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, aberrant brain -gut interaction, and psychological factors, 
perhaps with a genetic predisposition. 16 A proposed triggering mechanism in patients with PI -IBS is 
mucosal injury with subsequent inf lammatory/ immune response which becomes self -perpetuating.2  
 
PI-IBS 
IBS occurs in 7% to 30% of subjects after an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266702].[ADDRESS_324637] been shown 
to predispose to PI -IBS: severity of the initial illness, bacterial toxigenicity, hypochondriasis, depression 
and adverse life events in the previous [ADDRESS_324638] shown high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL -1β, IL -6 and TNF -α in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It has also been speculated that IBS patie nts may be more susceptible 
to infection and are thus genetically predisposed to produce lower amounts of the anti -inflammatory 
cytokine, IL -10.  A recent study has shown abnormalities in the IL -10/1L -[ADDRESS_324639] cell and enterochromaffin cell 
mediators in the colon and thus may play a role in the perpetuation of IBS. 26, 27 
 
Mesalamine  
5-aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_266703] -inflammatory agent that is used in the treatment 
of inflammatory bowel dise ase. 5 -ASA activates the peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor γ (PPAR -
γ). 6 PPAR -γ is a transcription factor which is highly expressed in the colonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_266704]. It modulates 
cytokine production and, specifically, decreases activity of NF -κβ, which is a central factor in 
inflammation.5 It also r educes synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrines which are also mediators of the 
inflammatory response.

 Mesalamine and PI -IBS 
There is strong evidence that PI -IBS is triggered by [CONTACT_266717]:  1) it starts after gastroenteritis, 2) presence of mast cells which induce the 
innate and adaptive immune systems 3) the increase in pro -inflammatory and decrease in anti -
inflammatory cytokines in blood, 4) PI -IBS shares many of the features of lymphocyti c colitis (chronic 
diarrhea, grossly normal endoscopic findings, mucosal inflammation and a benign course). 7-[ADDRESS_324640] shown that there is trend to improvement in QOL with mesalamine.  
 
The pu rpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of long acting mesalamine (Lialda®) in patients with 
PI-IBS. We will evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms  and IBS specific quality of life (IBS -QOL) before 
and after treatment with Lialda®

STUDY PROCEDURES :  
This study will be conducted at the University of Utah and the VA Medical Center.  Information collected 
at the VA will be stored at the VA.  For purposes of statistical analysis the information from the VA will 
be de -identified and sent to the University of Utah.   
 
All patients will have a complete blood count, comprehensive biochemical profile (including serum 
calcium), thyroid -stimulating hormone  (TSH) , tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG), C - reactive 
protein, and stool exa mination for electrolytes  (optional) , ova and parasite, C.difficile toxin  (not required 
if stool is formed) , Calprotectin  or lactoferrin, and Giardia antigen .  These tests will not be repeated if 
they were collected in the last 6 months.    Blood and stool  samples will be collected for storage if the 
patient consents.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of the colonic mucosa will be performed in all 
patients at the beginning of treatment. Patients with red flag symptoms (onset in older than >50 years, 
progre ssive or non -fluctuating symptoms, unexplained weight loss, rectal bleeding or anemia, family 
history of colon cancer, fever, abnormal examination or laboratory tests) will have colonoscopy and 
biopsy.  Patients with structural, biochemical, or infective d isorders will be excluded from the study. A 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will not be done if an acceptable biopsy was completed within [ADDRESS_324644] ionnaire  
The Bowel Disease Questionnaire (BDQ) will be used to identify patients with IBS.[ADDRESS_324645] used the BDQ and the 
modified version in our previous studies.11, 34   
 
Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS)  
BSS is a validated IBS outcome measure which consists of 100 -mm visual analog scales related to each 
symptom of IBS (pain/ discomfort, bloating, constipation, diarrhea) and an overall severity scale.35 All 
questions contribute equally to the total score, which ranges from 0 -400. Similarly reflux disease 
questionnaire (RDQ) measures change in upper gastrointestinal symptoms before and after treatme nt.  
 
Psychological Symptom Questionnaire  
The BSI -18 questionnaire (Brief Symptom Inventory, a short form of symptom check list -90-revised, 
SCL-90-R) will be used .36 The BSI -18 has 18 items, six each on the somatization, depression, and anxiety 
dimensions. The global severity index represents the glo bal or total score, which summarizes the 
respondent’s overall level of distress. Each item response is scored [ADDRESS_324646] correlate 
highly (i.e.>0. 90) with SCL -90-R.  
 
IBS-QOL Questionnaire  
The disease -specific IBS -QOL will be used for evaluation of subjects QOL.37 The IBS -QOL is a validated 
disease specific quality of  life questionnaire for use in patients with IBS. It has 34 items and measures 8 
domains found to be relevant to patients with IBS: dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, 
health worry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual, and relationships.  The IBS -QOL has high internal 
consistency and high reproducibility. IBS -QOL has been shown to be sensitive to treatment response in 
patients with IBS. 38

 The Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) will be used to evaluate how a patient’s life and daily activities are 
affected by [CONTACT_266720].  
 
 
Treatment Schedule  
This study will compare mesalamine two (Lialda®) 1.[ADDRESS_324647] been made while  
they are enrolled on the study. The  patient may not  be rescreened if there is no change in patient’s 
symptoms if they are outside the screening window.  
All patients will fill out the following questionnaires:  
 
1) The Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) at the beginn ing, at 4 weeks  and at the end of the study  period 
to assess any change based simply on admission to the trial.  
2) The BSI -18 at the beginning of the screening  period.  
3) The IBS -QOL at the beginning , at 4 weeks and end of treatment.  
4) The Nepean Dyspepsia Index  at the beginning , 4 weeks and end of treatment as well as during the 
mail-in/phone call visits. BDQ (Bowel Disease Questionnaire) at screening.  
 
 
Drug, Dose and Duration Rationale   
Mesalamine with MMX (Multi Matrix System) technology (Lialda®) will be use d for this study. This is a 
novel oral, high strength (1.2 gm/tablet) formulation of [ADDRESS_324648] shown that clinical and endoscopic remission with 2.4 and 4.8 
gm/ day was similar.[ADDRESS_324649] 8 0% compliant for continuous dosing of 
medication by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692]. Adverse reactions will be assessed. Patients will be called by [CONTACT_266721] s during the [ADDRESS_324650] the gastrointestinal motility will not be 
allowed during the study  unless the patient has been on a stable dose for >1 month and symptoms are still 
persisting . - The following medicatio ns will be prohibited: oral anti -cholinergics (dicyclomine, 
hyocyamine, and propatheline), narcotics, tramadol, colchicine, misoprostol, antacids, antidiarrheal 
agents, bismuth compounds and laxatives.  
 
Time Line  
Location of Study  
This study will be perfo rmed at the University of Utah Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266706] .  
 
Time Table of study :  Approximately [ADDRESS_324651] recruitment will start immediately upon IRB approval and continue throughout the dur ation of the 
study. We estimate that 50% of recruited patients will qualify for enrollment. Sixty -eight  patients with 
diarrhea -predominant or mixed IBS (with diarrhea as predominant symptom) will be enrolled at the rate 
of 1-2 per week. The estimated dropo ut rate is 10% , leaving [ADDRESS_324652] high prevalence of PI -IBS.

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient temporarily associated with the use of Lialda whether or 
not considered related will be recorded. SAE is defined as life threatening event or death. Safety data will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_266724]. The study side effects will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], and unexpected side 
effects will be reported to  the IRB. All adverse events will be recorded and reported to Shire 
Developmental Inc .  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_324653] (DSMB). The 
DSMB will consist of a physician ([CONTACT_266734] -Santos, M.D., Division of Infectious Disease), a 
pharmacist (Anthony Dalpi[INVESTIGATOR_266707], Pharm.D) and a biostatistician (Tom Greene, PhD).  The board will meet 
every 4 months to review the study’s progress and endpoints, monitoring of safety data (adverse events or 
serious adverse events), and recommendations whether to continue, modify or stop the study.  
 
STATISTICAL METHODS,  DATA ANALYSIS AND I NTERPRETATION :  
Sample Size 
The sample size for this trial is based on primary end -point of overall improvement in BSS. A previous 
IBS treatment trial reported baseline BSS of 183±65. [ADDRESS_324654] 25% cha nge in BSS, 32 patients in each 
group will provide 80% power using two -sided alpha 0.05 comparisons. Assuming 5% drop out rate, we 
would require a total of 68 patients (n=34 in each group). Assuming proportional estimates for the 
individual symptoms of IBS, a similar power will be  achieved with this sample size.  
 
The Lialda treated group will be compared to the placebo group on improvement in the BBS global 
symptoms of IBS (continuous  scale, range 0 to 400) and BBS individual symptoms of IBS (continuous 
scales, range 0 to 100). Given the repeated measurements on continuous outcomes, the data will be 
analyzed with mixed effects linear regression.  
 
Primary analysis will be based on inte ntion to treat. Exploratory analyses assessing “compliers” will also 
be reported. We will compare the results of placebo and Lialda treated group. The key comparisons 
between treatment arms will assess changes from baseline to end of treatment using parame tric 
approaches such as the t - test and, when data is highly skewed, nonparametric approaches such as the 
Wilcoxon test. We note that it is feasible to construct confidence intervals as well as significance tests in 
the setting of nonparametric comparisons . For some of the secondary efficacy approaches, such as those 
with binary/ categorical outcomes, follow -up status will be compared between treatment arms using the 
chi-squared test of the Mantel -Haenszel chi -square for ordered categorical outcomes. Exact versions of 
these tests will be performed when cell sizes are excessively small.  
 
In addition to the unadjusted primary analyses we will perform exploratory analyses which will use the 
logistic regression model for binary outcomes, and the linear regressi on model for continuous outcomes 
(transformations or categorization may be necessary for the cell count variables). We expect that 
psychological factors may affect the response to treatment and therefore will do pre -study psychological 
analysis and will co ntrol for them while evaluating response to treatment.  
 
We note that IBS -QOL will be collected at 4-week intervals. Therefore, approaches incorporating 
repeated measures, notably the linear mixed model, will be implemented to assess and quantify trends 
(e.g., a linear divergence between treatment arms) over time. These approaches also allow the inclusion of 
available data from patients who drop out in the middle of the study in the analysis.  We are aware, 
however, that the dropout pattern in this study may  not be the "Missing at Random" pattern required for 
such available -data models to yield valid inference. We will examine and report characteristics of study 
completers versus dropouts, to obtain some empi[INVESTIGATOR_266708].  
  
We are familiar with imputation approaches, and will implement these when appropriate. Simplistic 
approaches such as substituting each subject’s “worst” value, or the “worst” value observed for any 
subject, for missing values may shed light on th e robustness of any significant findings to missing data. 
However, such substitution approaches are not useful for formal statistical inference.

Recruitment:  
Patients will be recruited from the gastroenterology, infectious diseases and internal  medicine clinic at the 
University of Utah Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266712]. Patients will also be recruited from 
community Physicians referral letters, flyers , and newspaper advertisements. A report will also be created 
of all previous patients  seen in GI clinic with the diagnosis of IBS within the past year.  The report will  
assist in recruiting potential patients within the department of Gastroenterology.   After reviewing the 
records from the report if it appears  patients qualify we would conta ct the provider. The provider then 
contacts the patient to see if they are interested in the study and if it would be ok for the study staff to 
contact [CONTACT_476]. If they are, then the provider lets the study staff know  and we contact [CONTACT_102].  Patient s 
will be contact[CONTACT_65312], in person while in clinic or via mail using the recruitment letter. We will also 
post our study site contact [CONTACT_266729], School of Medicine, Department of 
Internal Medicine, Divisi on of Gastroenterology website, 
http://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/gastroenterology /. Many patients and practitioners use this site 
to gather information on PI-IBS and other functional GI disorders, so a web posting may serve as 
additional advertising for our site. We als o have a database of patients with IBS who have agreed to be 
participating/ to be contact[CONTACT_266730] .   
 
Mass emails may also be used as recruitment methods. The mass emails will be sent to all the university 
staff and students as well  as other organizations like Westminster College, Salt Lake Community College 
etc. The groups will be identified by [CONTACT_266731] V ice President  or other authorized personnel. However we 
may decide on sending the mass email to one organization at a time. The u niversity procedure for sending 
mass emails will be followed and approval for the text of the email will be obtained from the IRB prior to 
sending of the emails. Permission from the cognizant VP of the college or organization will be obtained 
before sendin g the mass e -mails and the form for sending the mass email will be filled with the 
Information Technology  Services at the university. Similar procedure may be followed at other 
organizations.  
 
We will also use the Division of Infectious /International Trav el Clinic at the University of Utah. The 
travel clinic evaluates a large number of returned missionaries and other travelers who have PI -IBS.

1. Introduction  
1.1. Background and Rationale 
The Cardiva VASCADE Vascular Closure System (VCS) is designed to deliver a 
resorbable collagen patch, extravascularly at the arteriotomy site to aid in achieving 
hemostasis. The collagen patch is designed to seal the arteriotomy within minutes and 
be resorbed in approximately three months. There are two versions of the product; 
one is for use in 5 Fr 12 cm introducer sheaths and the other for use in in 6 or 7 Fr 12 cm 
introducer sheaths.  
The safety and effectiveness of this device has been shown in several studies of 
retrograde access closure with very low complication rates and improved times to 
hemostasis and ambulation, compared to manual compression subjects ( 1). Results of 
the RESPECT Trial led to FDA ’s PMA  approval of the Cardiva VASCADETM VCS on Jan. 
31, [ADDRESS_692955] broadened treatment options for patients needing treatment in the 
lower extremity vasculature. Antegrade punctures of the femoral artery often require 
a steeper puncture angle and can be technically more challenging, especially in 
obese patients. However, antegrade femoral puncture is commonly performed in 
patients with infrainguinal vascular disease, and allows the operator to treat ipsilateral 
lower limb lesions with better manipulation, support and pushability of wires and 
catheters, when compared to femoral retrograde, cross-over access (2-5). Manual 
compression is still regarded as the gold standard for achieving hemostasis and is 
widely used in both antegrade and retrograde access, but it has long been 
associated with patient discomfort associated with groin pressure and prolonged 
immobilization (5) .  
Although most vascular closure devices have been routinely tested for safety and 
efficacy in retrograde access procedures, these same devices are being successfully 
used in antegrade access diagnostic and interventional peripheral procedures (6).    
There have been many single-center and multi-center studies conducted to examine 
procedural outcomes when VCDs are used to close antegrade femoral access sites. 
Although the vast majority of these studies are limited to retrospective analyses, the 
major complication rates have been reportedly similar to those reported in 
retrograde evaluations with these commercial devices (4- 10). However, due to major 
i
nconsistencies in study methods, definitions and reporting among currently published 
studies, it is difficult to make a meaningful comparison of outcomes across studies 
and devices (7).

1.2. Risks and Benefits 
1.2.1. Risks 
Risks associated with the VASCADE VCS are similar to those associated 
with other extravascular methods of achieving hemostasis at arteriotomy 
sites.  Complications that may occur include:  
 Allergic response  
 Arterial occlusion 
 Arterial thrombus  
 Arterio-venous fistula  
 Bleeding/oozing from the puncture site 
 Bruising at wound site 
 Death 
 Device failure / malfunction 
 Edema 
 Embolization tissue (thrombus, air, calcific debris, device)  
 Hematoma 
 Infection

  Vascular Closure System over manual compression alone to achieve 
hemostasis included reduced time to hemostasis and time to ambulation 
in both diagnostic and interventional subjects.    
This registry is intended to evaluate the potential benefit of reduced time 
to hemostasis, time to ambulation and time to discharge in interventional 
subjects undergoing antegrade access, while also evaluating procedural 
complications. Although antegrade access is a procedural technique 
that is gaining favor among clinicians for the treatment of ipsilateral 
peripheral disease, prospective enrollment and evaluation of outcomes 
related to vessel closure is lacking. Data collected in this registry may 
benefit clinicians in decision-making related to these types of procedures.  
2. Device Description 
The Cardiva VASCADE Vascular Closure System (VCS) is designed to deliver a 
resorbable Collagen Patch, extravascularly at the arteriotomy site to aid in achieving 
hemostasis. The collagen patch is designed to seal the arteriotomy within minutes and 
be resorbed in approximately three months. There are two versions of the product; 
one is for use in 5 Fr 12 cm introducer sheaths and the other for use in in 6 or 7 Fr 12 cm 
introducer sheaths.  
Refer to Attachment 2: Instructions for Use for a complete description of the device, 
warnings and precautions, and a summary of the PMA (P120016) Summary of Safety 
and Effectiveness Data.  
2.1. Device Labeling 
A copy of the Instructions for Use (IFU) will be included with the devices .  The 
Cardiva VASCADETM Vascular Closure Systems (VCS) are commercially label ed 
for sale in the [LOCATION_002] and contain the following information:  
 Product Name 
 Part number 
 Lot number 
 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (use before) date 
 
2.2. Previous Clinical Experience 
VASCADE 6/7 Fr VCS was evaluated in a prospective, multi-center, randomized 
(2:1) clinical trial (the RESPECT Trial) in 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and one site in 
Australia, comparing VASCADE VCS to Manual Compression (MC). The trial 
involved 420 patients undergoing diagnostic (n=211) or interventional (n=209) 
endovascular procedures.  
VASCADE 5 Fr was evaluated in a prospective, single treatment, single-center 
study to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the scaled-down 5 Fr version of 
the VASCADE 6/7 Fr VCS.

dure, followed by a telephone follow-up between 23-37 days for final 
assessment of any complications. These contacts are required so that Procedure 
Success can be evaluated at 30 days, and to ensure that outcomes are consistently 
reported according to industry standards.  
Study personnel should explain that even if a patient agrees to participate in the 
registry and signs an informed consent form, the Investigator may still determine that 
the patient is not a suitable candidate for the registry .  
A Screening/Enrollment Log will be maintained to document select information 
about candidates who are consented, but who are not enrolled due to failure to

A
t the completion of the endovascular procedure, patients who meet all the 
pre- and intra-operative eligibility criteria may be enrolled in the registry and are 
eligible to receive the VASCADE VCS for access site hemostasis as part of the 
registry .  The Investigator will acknowledge intention to enroll the patient prior to 
VASCADE VCS insertion into the procedural sheath, and it will be documented 
on a source worksheet. Once Investigator acknowledgement has been made 
and the device has entered the body, the subject is considered enrolled into the 
registry and should complete all evaluations and follow-up requirements.  An 
Enrollment Notification eCRF must be completed and submitted within 24 hours 
to notify Sponsor of enrollment. 
If a patient does not meet all eligibility criteria for the registry, the patient may 
receive one of the following to achieve arterial hemostasis , at the Investigator’s 
discretion: 1) the VASCADE VCS as a commercial device, b ut the subject will not 
be enrolled in the registry; 2) another commercially available closure device; or 
3) manual compression. These patients and the final reason for registry exclusion 
will be documented on the Screening/Enrollment Log.

“ANTEGRADE- PVD”  Post-Market Registry, PTL 0502- 02, v. 1.[ADDRESS_692969] will be made to 
assess the anatomy of the access site, the integrity of the procedural sheath (i.e., 
no kinking) and to verify the intra-operative eligibility criteria.   
NOTE: This image must be recorded and printed for the subject’s records.  
7.4.3. Access Site Closure 
The VASCADE Vascular Closure System should be deployed following the 
procedure in the Instructions for Use (IFU) provided in Attachment 2.   While the 
procedure is being perform ed, record the following information on the 
Procedure Source Data Worksheet provided by [CONTACT_1034] (required): 
 T1: time antegrade access achieved (i.e., time of stick) 
 T2: time endovascular procedure is completed (i.e., last guide catheter 
removed and final sheath is in place) 
 T3: time of sheath fluoro/angio to confirm that procedural sheath placement 
is correct and not kinked (print for subject ’s record) 
 T4: time VASCADE VCS is  inserted into the procedural sheath 
 T5: time that VASCADE VCS was deployed and/or removed and adjunctive 
compression started* 
 T6: time that arterial hemostasis was achieved 
 Verification that arterial hemostasis was confirmed 5 minutes later 
 Determination of Device Success 
 Light compression methods implemented after TTH was achieved 
 VASCADE VCS device specifications. 
*Immediate formation of a hematoma post-sheath removal may indicate a 
back-wall or secondary arterial puncture.  If this situation is suspected, the VCS 
should be removed and the subject should be converted to manual 
compression according to institution’s st andard guidelines. 
Adjunctive Compression Guidelines: 
Upon successful deployment of the VASCADE VCS, adjunctive compression at 
the site may be used until arterial hemostasis is achieved (i.e., no pulsatile 
bleeding or a forming hematoma ). TTH will not be recorded until adjunctive 
compression is no longer applied and arterial hemostasis is achieved. These 
times will be recorded on the Procedure Source Data Worksheet provided by 
[CONTACT_1034] (required).

50 
  NOTE: Manual compression devices should not be used for achieving initial 
arterial hemostasis to ensure accurate recording of TTH. 
 
Light Compression Guidelines: 
If the subject experiences slight oozing from cutaneous or subcutaneous tissues, 
characterized by [CONTACT_533554], light compression 
methods (i.e., sand bags, compression bandages/devices , and light manual 
pressure) may be used to manage oozing.  A ny light manual pressure applied to 
control oozing should be documented on the Source Document Worksheet. 
7.4.4. Post-Operative 
After hemostasis is achieved, the access site should be closely monitored at least 
every [ADDRESS_692970] of care to 
confirm hemostasis. 
Ambulation 
Subjects should be ambulated according to institution’s stan dard practice. Any 
incidents of delay in ambulation (> [ADDRESS_692971] of care for 
each site) should be documented on the Ambulation eCRF  and a Protocol 
Deviation eCRF should be completed for non-medical delays > [ADDRESS_692972]-Procedure Source Data Worksheet 
provided by [CONTACT_1034] (required): 
 T7 TTA: time that subject was able to stand and ambulate at least 20 feet 
without evidence of arterial re-bleeding at the access site. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533530], all subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of lower 
extremity neuropathy in the ipsilateral limb that were not existing prior to the 
index procedure (i.e., paresthesias, numbness, weakness), including an 
assessment of severity. Record the following information on the Post-Procedure 
Source Data Worksheet provided by [CONTACT_1034] (required): 
 T8 TTD: time of discharge from the facility. 
Subjects should be discharged according to institution’s stan dard practice. Any 
incidents of access site arterial re-bleeding, or delay in time to discharge should 
be documented on the Discharge eCRF.  
7.5. Follow-up 
A
ll enrolled subjects are required to complete an office visit between days 1- 15, 
and a
 30 (+/- 7) day telephone follow- up. Depending on each institution’s

“ANTEGRADE- PVD”  Post-Market Registry, PTL 0502- 02, v. 1.[ADDRESS_692973] 
should be instructed that a follow-up telephone assessment will be conducted 
between day 23 and 37 to complete the study. It is important that all subjects are 
contact[CONTACT_533555] 30 (+/- 7) day window to determine Procedural Success. 
During both the office visit and telephone follow- up, the subject should be 
queried regarding any complications they experienced after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533531].  All subjects will be 
evaluated for symptoms of lower extremity neuropathy in the ipsilateral limb that 
were not existing prior to the index procedure (i.e., paresthesias, numbness, 
weakness), including an assessment of severity.  
In the event of refusal to return to the clinic, a protocol deviation will be reported 
and a telephone follow-up will be completed.   
7.6. Study Exit 
Onc
e the subject has completed the follow-up visit or has withdrawn, they should 
be exited from the registry provided they do not have any conditions that require 
continued follow-up.  The date of exit and subject status will be recorded. 
8. Assessment of Procedural Outcomes 
8.1. Primary Procedural Outcomes - Performance 
Ti
me to hemostasis (TTH) is defined as the elapsed time between Cardiva 
VASCADETM VCS removal and first observed and confirmed arterial hemostasis.  
The time to hemostasis will be measured in hour (hh):minutes (mm):seconds (ss).   
(TTH = T6 – T5). 
8.
2. Secondary Procedural Outcomes - Performance 
Time to ambulation (TTA) is defined as elapsed time between device removal 
and when subject first stands and walks 20 feet without evidence of arterial re-
bleeding from the access site. The time to ambulation will be measured in hour 
(hh):minutes (mm).   (TTA = T7 – T5).  
Time to discharge (TTD) is defined as elapsed time between device removal and 
when subject is actually discharged from the facility . The time to ambulation will 
be measured in hour (hh):minutes (mm).   (TTA = T8 – T5).  
Device Success is defined as the ability to deploy the delivery system, deliver the 
collagen, and achieve hemostasis with the Cardiva VASCADETM VCS alone or 
with adjunctive compression. 
Procedure Success is defined as attainment of Device Success and freedom 
from major access site closure-related complications through 30 days.

  9. Statistical Considerations 
9.1.  Analysis Populations and Data Handling Conventions    
9
.1.1. Intent to Treat (ITT) Population 
All subjects who receive any portion of the Cardiva VASCADETM VCS device 
treatment under this protocol (i.e., intention to enroll acknowledged by 
[CONTACT_533556]; subject is then enrolled at time of 
device introduction) will be included in the primary, ITT performance and 
complication analyses.  
Subjects who do not receive any portion of the VASCADETM VCS but instead 
receive manual compression, a VASCADE VCS commercial device (i.e., outside 
of the registry), or another approved closure device instead (i.e., by [CONTACT_533557]), will not be enrolled and are therefore excluded from all 
analyses .  
9.1.2. Per Protocol (PP) Population 
As secondary analyses, all subjects who have the collagen deployed and meet 
all I/E criteria will be included in the PP performance and complication analyses. 
9.1.3. Missing Data 
Missing data will not be imputed by [CONTACT_70485].  
9.2. Statistical Analysis Plan 
9.2.1. General Analysis Principles 
As a descriptive study, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum will be reported for continuous variables. Frequencies and proportions 
will be reported for categorical variables. Ninety-five percent confidence 
intervals will be reported for outcome summaries, e.g. mean and median for 
time to hemostasis (TTH), time to ambulation (TTA), and time to discharge (TTD) , 
and Wilson score confidence intervals for proportions of device success and 
procedure success. 
Since the critical limb ischemia population encompasses a broad spectrum of 
disease severity and comorbidities, both performance and complication 
outcomes will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_2225]: Rutherford

  9.2.2. Performance Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Performance Outcome Analysis (TTH) 
The primary performance outcome to be described is time to hemostasis (TTH) as 
defined in Section 8.1. Summary statistics for TTH (mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum) will be reported for the ITT and PP subject 
cohorts,  and as described in Section 9.1. Nine ty-five percent confidence 
intervals will be presented for means and medians. The proportions of enrolled 
Cardiva VASCADETM VCS subjects converted to manual compression will also 
be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Performance Outcomes Analyses 
Secondary performance outcomes to be reported include time to ambulation 
(TTA), time to discharge (TTD), and proportions of device success and 
procedure success as defined in Section 8 .2 in both the ITT and PP cohorts. The 
analyses will be as described in Section 9.2.1. 
9.2.3. Complication Outcomes 
[IP_ADDRESS].   Primary Complication Outcome Analysis 
The primary complication outcome analysis will be based on the 30-day 
patient inciden ce rate of combined major access site closure-related 
complications for the ITT and PP cohort s, as described in Section 9.1.  The 
proportion of subjects with any major access site closure-related complications 
will be reported with 95% Wilson core confidence intervals.  For each particular 
major complication listed in Section 8.3, the proportion of subjects reporting it 
will also be summarized. 
[IP_ADDRESS].   Secondary Complication Outcome Analysis 
The secondary safety analysis will be based on the 30-day patient inciden ce 
rate of combined minor access site closure-related complications for the ITT 
and PP cohorts.  The proportion of subjects with any minor access site closure-
related complications will be reported with 95% Wilson core confidence 
intervals.  For each particular minor complication listed in Section 8.4, the 
proportion of subjects reporting it will also be summarized. 
Additionally, all reported adverse events will be summarized, and will be 
mapped to standard terms. The number and proportion of subjects reporting 
any given adverse event will be tabulated according to the worst severity 
reported up to the 30 day follow-up.  Separate tables will be constructed for (a) 
all reported adverse events, (b) device related adverse events, (c) serious 
device-related adverse events, and (d) all serious adverse events.

change, along with the reason for the change (if not obvious).   
Study Exit eCRFs are completed for all enrolled subjects, regardless if they did or 
did not complete the registry (e.g., subject discontinuation, registry termination). 
11. Monitoring Procedures 
11.1. Monitoring  
Remote and on-site monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made periodically 
during the registry, to ensure that all aspects of the current, approved 
protocol/amendment(s) and 21 CFR 50 requirements are followed. Original 
source documents will be reviewed for verification of data in the electronic 
database. The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original 
source documents by [CONTACT_106202], Inc. personnel, their designees, and 
appropriate regulatory authorities . In the event that the original medical records 
cannot be obtained for a patient that is seen by a non-study physician at a non-
study institution, photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_533533]. 
It is important that the Investigator and relevant study personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

registry. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the devices are 
available at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106143].  
11.2.2. Device Accountability 
Device information will be collected in the eCRF (e.g., size and lot#). Since the 
devices are commercially distributed, there are no device accountability 
requirements for this registry, however labels or other source data confirming 
the device information should be kept with the subject’s records for monitoring 
purposes.  
12. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
12.1. Site Training 
To
 ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its 
representatives will provide instructional material to the trial sites, as appropriate;  
 Instruct the Investigators and site personnel on the protocol, the completion 
of the eCRFs, and registry procedures 
 Communicate regularly with site personnel via mail, email, telephone, and/or 
fax 
12.2. Physician Training 
Investigators with significant experience in performing antegrade access and 
subsequent closure with VCDs were chosen to participate in this registry, 
therefore “roll -in” cases will not be performed in the registry. A Cardiv a Medical 
representative may be present for the first several cases. All enrolling 
Investigators will be approved by [CONTACT_106202], in writing, prior to their

  13. Adverse Events  and Device Failure Reporting Requirements  
13.1. Regulatory Requirements – [ADDRESS_692976] that the VASCADE 
VCS, a) may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury; or b) has 
malfunctioned and that the device or a similar device marketed by [CONTACT_533560] a death or serious injury if the 
malfunction were to recur.  
“Caused or contributed to” means that a death or serious injury was or may 
have been attributed to a medical device, or that a medical device was or 
may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including events occurring 
as a result of: 
 failure; 
 malfunction, defined as the failure of a device to meet its performance 
specifications or otherwise perform as intended, according to approved 
labeling;  
 improper or inadequate design; 
 manufacture; 
 labeling (i.e., IFU); 
 user error. 
A “serious injury ” means that an injury or illness which: 
 Is life-threatening – substantial risk of dying at the time of the AE, or use or 
c
ontinued use of the device might have resulted in the death of a patient; 
 Results in permanent impairment of a body function or damage to a body 
structure, excluding trivial impairment or damage ( “permanent ” means 
irreversible impairment , excluding trivial impairment or damage).  
 Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
Incidences requiring surgery to remove malfunctioned device will be 
considered a serious injury. Retrieval of a fracture pi[INVESTIGATOR_533534] a body cavity 
without the need for additional medical intervention will not be considered a 
serious injury.

  Malfunction:   
Means the failure of a device to meet any of its performance 
specifications or otherwise to perform as intended.  Performance 
specifications include all claims made in the labeling of the device.  The 
intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which 
the device is labeled or marketed through means such as labeling claims, 
advertising matter, and oral or written statements of Cardiva 
representatives. 
 
Medical Device Report (MDR) :  
Means a report mandated by [CONTACT_533576] 
3500A  regarding a reportable event. 
 
MDR Reportable Event:   
Any incident about which a Cardiva Medical employee receives or 
becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that a Cardiva 
Medical device; (1) may have caused or contributed to a death or 
serious injury; or (2) has malfunctioned and that the device or a similar 
device marketed by [CONTACT_533577] 
a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. 
 
Permanent: 
Means irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function 
excluding trivial impairment or damage. 
 
Reasonably Suggests: 
Means that a “reasonable” person considering the information would 
conclude that a reportable event has occurred.  Information which leads 
a person qualified to make a medical judgment (e.g. a physician, nurse, 
risk manager, clinical engineer, etc.) to reach a reasonable conclusion 
that a device-related event is or is not reportable is to be documented in 
the MDR event files. 
 
Serious illness or injury :  
Means an injury or illness that (1) is life-threatening; (2) results in permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure; 
or (3) necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure. Incidences requiring surgery to remove a malfunctioned 
device will be considered a serious injury.  Retrieval of a fracture pi[INVESTIGATOR_533538] a body cavity without the need for additional medical intervention 
will not be considered a serious injury.

Your Consent  
You are invited to take part in this registry  at (insert hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] / facility name) . A “registry” 
is a place where official records are collected and kept. The purpose of this “registry ” is 
to collect procedural data when the Cardiva Medical VASCADETM Vascular Closure 
System (VCS) device is used to close the  artery that will be punctured  using a specific 
technique,  as part of your upcoming procedure.  
 
This device was  approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January, 
2013, and has been  used and sold in the [LOCATION_002]  since that time. The Cardiva 
Medical VASCADE VCS is not investigational . 
 
This consent form will provide you with information about the registry, the procedures 
that will be performed, and your rights. This consent form may contain words that you 
do not understand. Please ask the study doctor or the study staff to explain any words 
or information that you do not clearly understand.   
 
Purpose & Background of the Registry  
Your doctor has explained to you that you need a procedure to look at the arteries 
(blood vessels) in your l egs and possibly treat them.  A t the beginning  of this procedure, 
the doctor will puncture a hole in an artery in your groin area, in order to look at the 
arteries in your leg on x -ray.  The doctor will make the hole on the same side of your 
body as the le g that needs to be treated.  This is a technique called “antegrade 
access”, which means “in the direction of the blood flow”. This is one of several 
techniques that your doctor can decide to use for your procedure, based on his/her 
medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_533540].  Your doctor’s decision 
that you need the procedure and use of an antegrade technique is made based on 
your medical needs and independent of this registry.  
Rev 1 31OCT2016                                            Page 2 of 8 Once the doctor has finished any treatment of your leg arterie s this hole will need to be 
sealed (closed up) to prevent bleeding. There are several FDA approved  devices that 
could be  used to close the hole, and the Cardiva Medical VASCADE VCS is one such 
device. .  
Your doctor already uses this device to close holes i n both “antegrade” and other types 
of cases, but there have not been many studies to collect data about antegrade  
procedures. The purpose of this registry is to collect data about your procedure so that 
the results can be provided  for other health care pro fessionals to use when making 
decisions about what procedures and devices to use in their patients.  
If you choose to take part in the registry, you will receive the Cardiva Medical device, 
providing your doctor feels you meet the study criteria. A small c ollagen (cotton -like) 
patch is placed just outside of the artery to plug the hole and stop the bleeding.  The 
patch is absorbed by [CONTACT_10489]  (dissolves)  in about three months.  
Your doctor will do everything the same way he/she would if you were not in a stu dy, 
except he/she will collect specific information about your procedure and information 
about how your are doing  for about 30 days afterwards.  
If your doctor decides that you do not meet registry  criteria, you may still receive a 
Cardiva Medical VCS outsi de of the registry, but you would not be enrolled in the 
registry. Your doctor may also decide that using an antegrade approach and/or using 
a Cardiva Medical VCS is not the best option for you . In those cases, you will not be 
enrolled in the registry  and may receive  another commercially available device , or you 
may  have firm pressure placed on the leg artery hole for the amount of time it takes for 
the artery to clot and stop bleeding. This is known as “manual compression” and is also 
a usual way of treat ment.   
This study will enroll about [ADDRESS_692995] 30 days (± 7 days). The expected total time for all patients to 
complete the study is about 9 months.  If you agree to be in this  registry, the following 
will happen to you:  
Pre-Procedure  Before the operation you will have a medical interview and 
physical to make sure you qualify for the registry (are el igible to 
take part ). Any blood that is taken will be done as part of your 
stand ard care, and there are no tests done specifically for the 
registry.  
Procedure  During the operation your doctor will insert a small plastic tube to 
gain access to the large artery in your leg (femoral artery)  using the 
“antegrade” technique .  He/she will t hen insert a small tube and 
inject dye to evaluate any blockages in your arteries  on the same 
side of the body . It is possible that he/she might open a blocked 
Rev 1 31OCT2016                                            Page 3 of 8 artery if he/she feels this is necessary during your procedure.  
He/she will also monitor your b lood to determine how long it takes 
you to stop bleeding.  
 When your doctor is finished with the operation and your doctor 
feels it is okay for you to take part in the registry, he/she will use the 
VASCADETM VCS to close the hole in the artery. This is whe n you 
would be “enrolled” as a subject in the registry and details about 
your procedure will be collected for the registry.  
Post-Procedure  After the procedure, the puncture site (place where the hole was 
made for the tube ) will be checked often to make sur e it is not 
bleeding.  Your doctor will determine how long you need to stay in 
bed, when you can walk and when you can be discharged based 
on his/her normal  care for this type of procedure.     
Office Visit between 1-15 Days  
You will need to come in to your  doctor’s office some time 
between 1 – [ADDRESS_692996] had .   
This ty pe of visit is normal care for your procedure, and will be 
scheduled according to your doctor’s preferred timing for the visit.  
Phone Visit between 23 - 37 days  
You will be called on the phone by [CONTACT_4904]’s office within 
about 23 – [ADDRESS_692997] 23 days, according to the protocol.  
Possible Risks  
 
The safety of this device h as been tested and proven in several prev ious research 
studies of over 3 50 human patients without serious problems or deaths.  The collagen 
patch is similar to other collagen -based closure devices used in surgery to close small 
holes.  In a large FDA approv al study, a total of 417 subjects were enrolled. Two -thirds 
(275 patients) received the VASCADE device, and one -third (142) received manual 
compression to close the artery hole. Safety r esults were similar in both groups. Of the 
possible side effects liste d below, there were no reports of these occurring in the 275 
VASCADE patients, except for the following:  
 
*Reported in < 1% of patients receiving VASCADE  
**Reported in < 2% of patients receiving VASCADE

Possible side effects (problems) are similar to other closure devices and “manual 
compression” and can include:  
 
• allergic response (to the material in the device or collagen)  
• arterial occlusion (blockage of the leg artery)  
• arterial thrombus (blood clot in  the leg artery)  
• arterio -venous fistula (abnormal connection between artery and vein) * 
• death  
• device failure / malfunction *** 
• edema (swelling in the tissues ) 
• embolization ( thrombus, air, tissue, device floating downstream)  
• groin bruising *  
• groin hematoma (b leeding under the skin) ** 
• groin inflammatory response (inflammation)  
• groin wound dehiscence (separation of wound edges)  
• intimal tear / dissection (tear of the leg artery wall)  
• limb ischemia (lack of oxygen to the leg)  
• mild infection or infection of the gro in requiring extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533541]  
• minor bleeding * and/or bleeding requiring transfusion  
• peripheral nerve injury (nerve damage to the leg) * 
• perforation of the vessel wall (puncture of the vessel wall)  
• pseudoaneurysm (abno rmal collection of blood with persistent flow outside 
an artery due to a leaking hole in the artery due to injury) ** 
• retroperitoneal bleeding (bleeding in the pelvis) * 
• thrombus formation (blood clot  in an artery or a vein )** 
• vasospasm (spasm of the artery)  
• vasovagal response (slowed heart rate with possible fainting)  
• vascular injury requiring repair (vessel damage requiring repair)  
• Wound site pain ***

VASCADEVasc ular Closure System (VASCADE VCS) 
INSTRUCTIONS  FOR U SE 
5F and 6/7F 
IFU 2611 Rev N  
CAUTION ± Federal ([LOCATION_003]) law restricts this device to sale by [CONTACT_106232] a physician 
DESCRIPT ION 
The VASCADE VCS is intended to seal the femoral arterial 
access site at the completion of an endovascular procedure.  The 
system is designed to deliver a resorbable Collagen Patch, extra-
vascularly, at the arteriotomy site to aid in achieving he mostasis.  
There are two versions of p roducts in the VASCADE product 
family. One is for use in 5F 12cm11 introducer sheath s, and the 
other device is for use in 6F or 7F 12cm1 introducer sheaths. 
The system consists of a sterile disposable Vascular Closure 
Catheter which houses a resorbable Co llagen Patch, and the 
VASCADE C lip (refer to Figure 1). The collagen pat ch is 
composed of type I Bovine collagen and is delivered in a 
compressed form that is approximately 15mm in length.  The dry 
weight of the collagen in VASCADE 5F  is 8.5mg ± 2mg and in 
VASCADE 6/7F it is 12mg ± 3mg.   The patch expands  as a 
result of rehydration in the presence of blood in the tissue tract 
to provide an extravascular seal.  A radiopaque proximal marker 
band  on the Catheter provides means  to verify placement of the 
patch in the tissue tract adjacent to the femoral arteriotomy site 
prior to the release of the patch.  A second distal marker band 
locates the distal tip of the VASCADE Disc. After completion of 
the catheterization procedure, the VASCADE VCS Cath eter is 
inserted through a commercially available 5F, 6F, or 7F 
introducer sheath.  The VASCADE Disc is then deployed within 
the vessel and the introducer sheath is removed over the 
VASCADE   VCS Catheter.  After the introducer sheath is 
removed, the VASCADE Disc is positioned against the intimal 
aspect of the arteriotomy, providing both temporary hemostasis 
and protection from intravascular p lacement of the Collagen 
Patch, and the VASCADE Clip is applied at skin level to maintain 
the position of the VASCADE D isc. After confirming the position 
of the Collagen Patch fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the Black Sleeve is 
unlocked and  retracted to  expose the Collagen Patch to the 
tissue tract. The system is left in place for a brief dwell period to 
allow the patch to swell, after which the VASCADE D isc is 
collapsed and the VASCADE VCS Catheter is removed from the 
artery leaving the resorbable, extra-vascular, hemostatic 
Collagen Patch at the arteriotomy site providing arterial 
hemostasis.

or re-sterilization, may result in transmission of infectious or blood borne diseases and/or death. 
x Do not use if components  or packaging appear to be damaged  or defective or if any portion of the packaging has 
been  previously opened.  Damaged or opened packages may compromise product functionality.  
x Do not use if product is beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  Product performance has not been established beyond the 
labeled shelf life.  
x Do not deploy the VASCADE Disc in a stent. Do not pull the deployed VASCADE disc through a stent.  Damage to 
the product may occur.  
x Do not use VASCADE if access is through a previously placed permanent  closure device such as a metal clip.  
Interference between the two closure devices may result.  
x Do not deploy the Collagen Patch if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_533542].  Partial or complete obstruction of blood flow may result.  
x Do not deploy a second collagen patch at the same access site within 90 days.  Safety has not been established.  
 
PRECAUTIONS  
x The VASCADE VCS should only be used by a trained licensed physician or healthcare professional. 
x Do not use in access sites where there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a “backwall” stick.  Increased bleeding risk may occur.  
x Do not use if arteriotomy is noted to be a “side stick.”  Bleeding risk may increase.  
x Do not use if arteriotomy site is noted to be “high,” above the Inguinal Ligament (cephalad to lower half of the 
femoral head or the inferior epi[INVESTIGATOR_106164]).  This may increase the risk of 
bleeding. 
x Do not use in an artery with suspected intraluminal thrombus, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous 
fistula.  These conditions may complicate proper device use and performance. 
x Do not use if intra-procedural bleeding around the introducer sheath is noted including hematoma formation (sign 
of possible multiple wall stick).  This may suggest problems with the access site. 
x Do not use in a procedural sheath > 12cm in length (or >15cm in overall length) or with a diameter other than 5F 
for VASCADE 5F, or 6F or 7F for VASCADE 6/7F. This may complicate disk deployment.

The R ESPE CT Study was a pros pective, randomiz ed, c ontrolled multi-center clinic al trial designed to evalu ate the safety 
and eff ectiveness of the st udy device in s ealin g common femoral arterial access sites and provid ing reduced times to 
hemos tasis and am bulation com pared with Manual Compre ssion (MC) at the comple tion of diagnostic or interventional 
endov ascular procedur es (cardiac or peripheral vascular catheterizations) performed through 6F or 7F introducer sheaths.  
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 treatment device to control ratio.  The trial was conducted at 20 sites in the United 
States and one site in Australia. In an ultrasound sub-study, images of the access site were obtained from 100 consecutively randomized, treated, VASCADE patients at 5 sites prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
To be eligible f or the trial, p atients were r equired to be between  18 a nd 80 years of age; a ble and willing to sign an 
Informed Cons ent Form; acceptab le candidates f or an elective, non-emer gent diagnostic or interventional endova scular 
procedure via the comm on femoral artery using a 6F or 7F introducer sheath who were a lso acceptabl e candidates for 
post-proc edure m anua l compression; and able and w illing to compl ete a 30-day ± 7 days follow-up evaluation. P atients 
were e xcluded if they had clinica lly significant peripheral  vascular disease; bleeding disorder; ip silateral femor al 
arteriotomy wit hin the previous 30 days; p lanned end ovascular procedure w ithin the next 30 days ; previous vascular 
grafts at target a ccess site; extreme morbid obesity (B MI gr eater than 45 kg /m2) or were underweig ht (BMI less than 20 
kg/m2); known alle rgy/adverse reaction to bovine de rivatives; planned ex tended hosp italization; administration of low 
molecul ar weight h epari n (LMWH) within 8 hours of the proc edure; femor al artery diameter less than 6mm at a ccess site; 
multi arterial sticks ; rece ived un fractionat ed hepari n with an ACT greater t han 300 seconds in the abse nce of a 
glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor or greater th an 250 sec onds  in the pres ence of a g lycoprotein IIb/IIIa in hibitor; intra-
procedural bleedin g around sheath or sus pected i ntraluminal thrombus, hem atoma,  pseudoan eurysm , or AV fistula; 
uncontro lled hype rtension; or length of tissue tract est imated to be less than 2.5 cm. 
A total of 420 patients, 211 d iagnosti c and 209 i ntervention al patients, were enrolled. The m ean age was 62 years and 
mean BMI was 30kg/m2. Twenty-nine percent ( 29%) of pati ents were femal e. The st udy also included 69 ro ll-in cases, 
consisting of 45 d iagnostic and 24 i nterventional patients. The randomized VASC ADE arm in cluded 1 37 diagnosti c and 
141 inte rventional pat ients, while the manual compre ssion arm in cluded 74 diagnosti c and 68 i nterventio nal patients. 
Seventy- seven percent ( 77%) of the VASCA DE interventional patients rece ived biva lirudin, 27% received hepa rin, 60% 
received clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], a nd 8% received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. T he m ean Activated Clotting Time (ACT) in patients receiving 
unfractionated he parin for diagnostic patients was 221 sec onds  vs. 172 seconds  in the VASCADE and manual 
compre ssion groups, res pectively. The m ean ACTs in inte rventio nal pati ents were similar am ong groups, wi th the 
VASCA DE group reporti ng 289.5 ± 136.9 seconds vs. 289.0 ± 100.7 secon ds in the manual compre ssion grou p. 
Enrolled patients were followed f or 30±7 days. Four hundre d fifteen (41 5) randomiz ed patie nts (98.8% ) compl eted 30-day 
follow-up. Three patients were prem aturely ran domize d and immediately withdrawn from the s tudy due to ineligibility; one 
was lost to fo llow-up and one withdrew consent to part icipate prior to 30-day fo llow-up.

A. VASC ADE 5F Confirma tory Trial 
The purpose of the VASCADE 5F study was to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the scaled-down 5F version of the 
VASCADE 6/7F VCS.  The 5F device is virtually identical to the slightly larger 6/7F VCS.  The study population was 
defined as patients undergoing cardiac or peripheral vascular catheterization procedures via the femoral artery approach 
when using a standard 5F introducer sheath.  The study was conducted at a single-center in Australia, and was a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, single treatment trial.  The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to the U.S. IDE RESPECT trial with the exception that patients had to be undergoing a catheterization procedure utilizing a 5F introducer sheath.  
Thirty (30) patients were enrolled into the study.  All of the patients enrolled in the study underwent diagnostic procedures .  
Patient demographic characteristics at baseline, such as gender, age, and BMI were comparable between the U.S. IDE 
trial and the 5F Australian confirmatory study.  The safety and effectiveness endpoints for the 5F confirmatory study were identical to the 6/7F study.  Identical to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_533545], the primary safety endpoint was the rate of combined major access site-related complications within 30 ± 7 days following the catheterization procedure.  The secondary safety endpoint was the rate of combined minor access site-related complications within 30 ± [ADDRESS_693004] trial, the primary effectiveness endpoint was TTH.  The secondary effectiveness endpoints 
were TTA, TTDE, TTD, procedure success, and device success.

B. VASC ADE 5F Eng ineering Analysis 
 Engineering analysis f or the scaled do wn VASCADE 5F VCS included Collagen  Patch size calculations resu lting in a 
proporti onally smaller Collagen P atch as com pared with the VASCAD E 6/7F VCS device. These analys es confirmed 
equiv alent tissue-tract s pace-filling capabilit y between  the 5F and 6/7F ve rsions of the VASCA DE device . In additio n, 
fundam entally the same verific ation and va lidation testing was compl eted for the 5F VASCA DE VCS de vice as w as 
compl eted for the 6/7F VASCADE VCS device. 
 
Conclusions 
The resul ts from the R ESPECT  clinical trial demonstr ate that patients who have undergone diagnostic or interventional 
cardiac or peripheral vascular endovascular procedures usi ng a 6F or 7F introduc er sheath an d were tr eated w ith 
VASCAD E VCS have stat istically and clinic ally significant decreased t imes to hemostasis and am bulation for diagnostic 
and inte rventional procedures, and statistically and clinica lly significant decrease d time to discharge eligibility f or 
diagnostic pro cedures, when com pared to patients t reated with manual  compre ssion. In addition, the t rial demonstr ated 
that patients t reated wi th the VASCADE V CS we re noninfe rior to pati ents treated with manual compre ssion wi th respect to 
major access site-related comp lications. 
 A confirm atory clinical s tudy and engineering ana lysis demonstr ated that the VASC ADE 5F V CS is equivalent to the 
VASCA DE 6/7F V CS in de sign and perfo rmance.

8. Deplo y the Disc by [CONTACT_533592] 8.  
 
CAUTION : Do not continue to pull on the Black Actuato r once it is lo cked in pl ace as this may damage the devic e. 
 
NOTE: When the Disc is properly deployed, the Green Segment will become visible distal to the Black Actuator.  If 
the catheter  is not properly locked in place, the Black Actuator  will slide back to its original position and the Green 
Segment will disappear (in VASCADE 5F approximately 1mm of the Green Segment remains visible when  disc is 
collapsed) indicating that  the Disc is not properly deployed.  In this case repeat the step for deploying the Disc by [CONTACT_533593]. 
 
9. Gently remove sheath, wit hout applyi ng any compression at the access si te or holding t he VASCADE VCS 
Catheter, as show n in Figure 9.  As the sheath slides over the VASCADE VCS Catheter, grasp the Catheter 
proxim al to the LOCK as it exits the distal end of the introduc er sheath.  Conti nue s liding the sheath ov er the 
VASCADE VCS Cathet er and discard sheath. 
 
CAUTION : Compressing the access si te during s heath removal may not a llow the Disc to track back to the arteriot omy and may cause 
Disc defor mation. This may lead to inability to achieve t emporary hemosta sis. 
 
10. Apply ge ntle tension on the Black Ac tuator  until temporary hemos tasis is achieved.  Note wh ether any portion of 
the White Mark er Stripe, which i s located n ear the distal as pect of the Black Sleeve, is visible above the ski n.  If it 
is, then the length of the ti ssue tract i s less th an 2.[ADDRESS_693009] may not be long eno ugh f or the 
Collagen P atch. 
 
WARNING:  If any portion of the White Marker Stripe is showing DO NOT RELEASE  the Collagen Patch as this may increase the 
risk of infection. 
 
NOTE:  If any portion of the White Marker Stripe is showing and the collagen patch is not to be deployed continue 
the procedure as follows: 
For diagnostic cases: the VASCADE VCS Catheter should be removed by [CONTACT_533594]. 
For anti-coagulated patients: the Clip may be applied to the VASCADE VCS Cath eter on the skin surface 
as shown in Figure [ADDRESS_693010] al Mark er Band locat es the distal e nd of the Di sc. 
 
CAUTION: Applying too much upward tension on the Black Actuator may cause disc to pull out of vessel.  Should this occur, 
convert to your LQVWLWXWLRQ¶VPDQXDOFRPSUHVVLRQSURWRFRO  
WARNING: It is import ant to ensu re that the Disc is in contact [CONTACT_533595]- vascu lar Collagen Patch to avoid releasing the Collagen Patch in the vessel.  This step requires fluoroscopy (Figure  11).

EXTRA-VASCULAR COLLAGEN PATCH DEPLOYMENT AND DEVICE REMOVAL 
12. Once the Disc location is verified, expose the extra -vascular resorbable Collagen Patch by [CONTACT_533596].  This is done by [CONTACT_106244][INVESTIGATOR_533547], between the thu mb and the index finger, 
and graspi[INVESTIGATOR_533548] -Blue K ey with the right hand and then sliding the Yellow -Blue K ey into the Lock  until 
no blue color is visible, as  show n in Figure 12.  Once the Sleeve is unloc ked and while still holding on to the 
Lock, remove the Clip with the right hand, and gent ly slide the Lock back along the angle of entry to retract 
the Black Sleeve as shown in Figure 13.  The Black Sleeve will move freely after so me initial resistance.  A 
second resistance point may be felt after the sleeve is moved appro ximately 1.6 cm (0.6 inch).  
Proceed to fully retract the Black Sleeve proxi mally to the Silver Handle.  This action exposes the Collagen  
Patch extr a-vascular ly, which will swell at the arteriotomy site.  The Collagen Patch may be allowed  to swell 
for up to 30 seconds prior to re moval of the VASCADE VCS Catheter.  The Clip should be reapplied during 
the Collagen Patch swell period with minimal tension  on the Catheter (Figure 14).  
 
NOTE:  If the Black Sleeve does not retract easily, recheck that the blue end of the Yellow -Blue Key is fully engaged 
in the Lock.  
 
NOTE:  If the Collagen Patch is removed during sleeve retraction, for non -anti-coagulated patients, collapse the Disc, 
remove the Catheter and apply manual compression, per institutional protocol.  If the patient is anti -coagulated, the 
Clip may be applied to th e VASCADE VCS Catheter on the skin surface to maintain temporary hemostasis.  The 
device may then stay in dwelling in order to allow time for the ACT level to normalize.  The device can then be 
removed followed by [CONTACT_533597].

and grasp the green  tube bet ween the thumb and the in dex finger as shown in Figure 15 .  With slack in the 
catheter, coll apse the Dis c by [CONTACT_533598] t he Black Ac tuator  Tip as shown in Figure 16 .  When the Disc is fully 
collapsed, the Green S egment should not be visibl e for 6/7F device, or only a small portion, approxim ately 1mm, 
may be visible for the 5F devic e.  While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_533549] y pull back the VASCA DE VCS 
Catheter proximally.   The Cathe ter Handle will move approxim ately 1.5cm while the green portion of the 
catheter remai ns stationary .  This acti on slides the coll apsed cathe ter Disc by [CONTACT_533599] h.  Once this initial movem ent has occu rred, let go of the Green 
Tube.  Gentle m anual  compre ssion may be appli ed at the arterio tomy site.  Remove the VASCADE VCS 
Catheter, and apply m anual compre ssion. 
Alternative Technique:  AFTER 15-[ADDRESS_693011] ooze until full 
hemos tasis is achieved. 
NOTE:  Prior to the VASCADE VCS Catheter  removal confirm that the Disc is completely collapsed by [CONTACT_533600] 6/7F device and only a small portion app roximately 1mm is 
visible for the 5F de vice.  Care should be taken not to compress directly over the catheter during the removal step 
of the device so that the catheter  can be easily removed and without displacement of Collagen Patch.  Note:  The 
implanted Collagen Patch should not  be affected by [CONTACT_533601] (MRI).

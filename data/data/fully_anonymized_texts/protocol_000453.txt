3 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Disease Background 
Stroke is the leading cause of adult-onset of disability. Recent studies estimate 
that stroke affects about 795,000 people in the U.S. each year, resulting in a 
prevalence of over 6.4 million individuals1,2. A large proportion of these stroke 
survivors (up to 80%) experience considerable gait deficits, including reduced 
walking speeds and asymmetrical walking patterns, limiting their capacity for 
community ambulation3. These mobility deficits are due to a combination of 
numerous neuromuscular changes following the stroke including: reduced corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_87166], muscle  atrophy and weakness, impaired balance 
and posture control, abnormal muscle syner gies, and visuo-cognitive deficits.  
 The goal of post-stroke rehabilitation is to reintegrate individuals back to their 
highest level of function for employment, social and community participation
4. 
The return of mobility and walking is a cr ucial part of this return to function5. Gait 
training has been a major focus of stroke rehabilitation4, with self-selected 
walking speed considered to be one of the most important measures of stroke 
rehabilitation. It is thought to be a predictor  of health status, community mobility, 
social interaction, and overall quality of  life. Stroke surv ivors are currently 
classified based on their self-selected walking speeds as: non-ambulators 
(unable to walk), limited household ambulators (<0.4m/s), limited community 
ambulators (0.4-0.8m/s), and community ambulators (>0.8m/s)6. These walking 
speeds are however significantly lower t han those exhibited by [CONTACT_87183] 
(1.3-1.5 m/s)7.  
 Physical rehabilitation has many methodological approaches to training post 
stroke. The [ADDRESS_95051]-
stroke.  
1.2 Study Agent(s)/Devices Background  
 
The Stride Management Assist (SMA) Syst em is a robotic device developed by 
[CONTACT_87182] R&D Corporation ®, Japan ( http://corporate.honda. com/innovation/walk-
assist/ ).   
Study Number # STU00085161  
________________________________________________________________________

This robotic device assists hip flex ion and extension, for each side 
independently. It is controlled through software run on a tablet. The device 
weighs 2.8 kgs, and has 2 brushless DC motors running on a rechargeable 
lithium ion battery. It comes in 3 sizes (small, medium and large). It is worn around like a belt with the motors near the hips and straps on the thighs. The 
SMA device allows users to increase their stride length by [CONTACT_87184]. This device is 1) simple to use in the clinical 
setting; 2) easily adjustable to alter according to the requirements of each 
subject; and, 3) can quantify the amount of assistance required to facilitate 
walking patterns.  
1.[ADDRESS_95052] stroke has been 
found to be a very effective strategy for gait retraining10,11. Impairment based 
physical therapy is another methodology pr acticed in clinical settings where the 
training is based on progressive streng th and balance exercise program in the 
outpatient setting12. The SMA group (task specific training) will be trained to 
simulate the demands of overground wa lking. The impairment based group will 
match the SMA group in intensity but will be focused on balance and other 
functional goals rather than explicitly on walking. The rationale of this study is to 
assess task specific training with SMA vs. impairment based training. To this 
end, we will use the Stride Management A ssist device by [CONTACT_87185] l therapy in outpatient sessions.  
 The enhancement of corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_87167]-term 
plasticity and improved motor control in peo ple with stroke. To study this, we will 
measure corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_87168] t he lower limb muscles using Transcranial 
Magnetic Stimulation TMS. TMS is a safe and non-invasive method that has 
been widely used to study cognition,  brain-behavior relations and the 
pathophysiology of various neurolo gic and psychiatric disorders.

5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 
5.1 Screening/Baseline Procedures 
Subjects will be randomized into 2 separate gr oups, either SMA or IPT. We will enroll 80 
subjects, 40 in each group, planning for a 30% attrition rate. These subjects will be 
recruited when they are referred to RIC’s stroke rehabilitati on outpatient clinics at RIC’s 
flagship at [ADDRESS_95063]. 12th floor, or RIC Northshore in Northbrook IL or RIC 
Willowbrook in Willow brook, IL. We will also recruit from local physicians or RIC’s Clinical 
Neuroscience Research Registry for subjects who are potential candi dates for outpatient 
physical therapy. They will be directed to a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87170]/exclusion criteria. 
Once subjects have agreed to participate in  the study, they will come to RIC and be 
consented at one of the clinics at the Rehabilitation Institute of  Chicago. Study staff will 
explain the study, a written consent form w ill be signed by [CONTACT_87186], a copy will be given to the subject and a copy will be kept in the 
subject's folder in a secure, locked cabinet in the lab's locked office.  
After consenting, subjects will undergo a phy sical evaluation and screening exam by a 
licensed PT. If they meet study criteria, they will be randomly placed into either the SMA 
group or the IPT group usi ng a random number generator and they will be entered into 
the study. Once they are enrolled, baselin e outcome measures will be assessed by a 
blinded research PT.   
In addition, subjects will have a baseline meas ure of their cortical excitability through 
TMS. This will be conducted at University of  Illinois, Department of Physical Therapy. 
TMS sessions will last approximately 2 hours.

Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVIC): Before beginning the TMS 
protocol, an estimate of MVIC will be obt ained for each muscle with the subject 
positioned in sitting on a chair, with t he knee joint at [ADDRESS_95070] will be 
given real time feedback of muscle ac tivity to match a target contraction 
corresponding to 10% MVIC for individual muscles during TMS measurements 
(details below).  
 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS):  TMS is a safe, non-invasive, painless 
method of brain stimulation that has be en widely used to study the physiology of 
the representations of muscles in the motor cortex in healthy and neurologically 
disordered individuals13. Very short duration (< 1 ms) magnetic pulses are 
applied via an insulated wire coil placed on the intact scalp overlaying the motor 
cortical area projecting to a target muscle. Each pulse induces a motor evoked 
potential (MEP) in a target muscle that can be readily monitored by [CONTACT_87187]. A figure-of-eight or double cone coil is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_87172] a number of scalp sites over the 
cortical area representing a muscle of interest.  
 
Self-adhesive disposable electrodes (Delsys) with an inter-electrode distance of [ADDRESS_95071] skin preparation techniques (light 
Study Number # STU00085161  
________________________________________________________________________ 
9 abrasion and cleansing with alcohol) will be completed prior to application of the 
electrodes. EMG recordings will be amplified (Delys, Bagnoli EMG), band-pass 
filtered (10-1000 Hz), and sa mpled at 5000 Hz. Electromyographic (EMG) activity 
will be collected from the all the muscles bilaterally. Magnetic stimuli will be 
delivered via a double cone coil/figure of eight connected to a Magstim 200 unit 
(Magstim Company, [LOCATION_011] MA). The rest ing and active threshold for TMS will 
be determined for each subject. TMS measurements will involve generating 
motor evoked potentials (MEP) for each muscle from two different coil positions – 
2cm on either side of the vertex. Moto r evoked potentials (MEPs) at intensities 
ranging from 70 – 140% active threshold will be generated for each muscle from 
each coil position. A figure-of-eight or double cone coil will be used to deliver 
focal magnetic pulses.  Resting motor threshold for t he muscle of interest in will 
be defined as the stimulator output int ensity that can elicit motor evoked 
potentials (MEPs) with peak-to-peak amplitude more than 50 µV in four out of 
eight trials. It will be determined by [CONTACT_87188] 1% stimulator output.  Active thresholds will be determined with the same protocol, 
however with the subject contracting t he muscle of interest to about 10% of 
maximum voluntary contraction. Subjects will receive approximately 100 – [ADDRESS_95072] the investigator and co-
investigators in generating recruitment curves which will help assess the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_87173] l and contralateral motor cortex to each 
lower limb muscle.

12 Response Criteria / Outcome Measures :  
 
The following outcome measures will be evaluat ed for both the groups at testing points at 
baseline, mid-testing , post-testing and follow-up testing. 
 Clinical Performance Outcome Measures: 
 
1. [ADDRESS_95073]:  The 6MWT measures the distance a subject can walk indoors 
on a flat, hard surface in a period of [ADDRESS_95074]:  The 10mWT assesses walking speed in meters per second 
over a short duration. Changes in gait speed that result in a transition to a higher 
category of ambulation classification re sulted in better function and quality of life15. In 
the 10mWT, subjects are directed to walk at their self-selected and maximum safe speed with the effects of acceleration and deceleration minimized (by [CONTACT_1583] [ADDRESS_95075]’s steady state 
speed). Any assistive device and orthotic  should be kept consistent and documented. 
It should also be documented whether the gait is tested at “preferred walking speed” or “fastest walking speed”. The 10mWT has been validated for the stroke population 
and is accepted as a responsive, functional measurement of the patient’s ability to 
ambulate over short distances such as thos e typi[INVESTIGATOR_87177] a household setting.  A small 
meaningful change for people with stroke is 0.06 meters/second; a substantial meaningful change is 0.14 meters/second14. A speed of <0.4 and >.08 m/s is an 
exclusion in the study.   
3. Berg Balance Scale (BBS):  The BBS is a 14-item objec tive measure designed to 
assess static balance and fall risk in adult populations and is a well-accepted 
measure in the stroke literat ure. The functional activiti es that are assessed include 
sitting and standing balance during transfers, altered base of support, reaching, turning, eyes open and closed. Each item is  scored from [ADDRESS_95076] (5xSST): The 5xSST is used to measure functional lower 
extremity strength during the transitional move ment of sit to stand. The individual is 
timed in moving from the start position of sitting, arms across chest, in a standard 
chair without armrests to fully standing fi ve times. The minimal detectable change in 
individuals with chronic stroke is 3.6 seconds.18 
 
5. Gait Analysis:  A quantitative means of assessing gait function in adults post-stroke 
based on spatiotemporal parameters of gait. The GaitRite® system is an electronic 
walkway with integrated sensors and is considered a reliable and valid means of 
assessing gait changes poststroke. 
 
6. Functional Gait Assessment (FGA):  The FGA is a 10-item test for assessing 
postural stability during various walking task s. It includes 7 of the 8 items from the 
original Dynamic Gait Index, and 3 new item s, including “gait with narrow base of 
support,” “ambulating backwards,” and “gait with eyes closed.” The FGA demonstrates excellent concurrent validity wi th the Berg Balance Scale for individuals 
with stroke.
19 The maximum score is 30 points; minimal detectable change for 
chronic stroke is 4.2 points.20 
Study Number # STU00085161  
________________________________________________________________________ 
13 7. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (FMA):  The purpose of 
the FMA is to evaluate and measure recove ry in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. 
There are five domains assessed on a 3 point ordinal scale from 0-2. “0” is equal to 
“cannot perform”, “1” is equal to “performs partially”, and “2” is equal to “performs 
fully. The domain for lower extremity motor function will be used. It has been found to 
be reliable and valid in assessing individuals with stroke with a minimal clinically 
important difference of 10 points for the lower extremity motor scores.21 
             Self-Reported Measures: 
 
8. Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (mFES):  The mFES is a 14 item self-report survey 
that assesses an individua l’s perception of balance and  stability during indoor and 
outdoor activities of daily living. The mFES is a 10 point numerical rating scale with 
higher scores indicating higher confidence in the performance of the activity.  
 
9. Activities- specific and Balance Confidence Scale (ABC):  The ABC is a 16-item 
self-report questionnaire that measures confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling. Items are rated on a scale ranging from 0-100, with zero representing no confidence and [ADDRESS_95077] Scale (SIS):  The SIS is a validated measure of the impact of stroke on 
overall physical and cognitive function. This 59-item patient-based questionnaire 
assesses eight doma ins of stroke recovery: stre ngth, mobility, communication, 
emotion, memory and thinking, participation, activities of daily living/instrumental 
activities of daily living (ADL/IADL) and hand function. An additional question requires 
the patient to rate their stroke recovery  on a scale from 0 to 100. This measure 
instructs subjects to answer the question based on the period of time two-four weeks 
prior to the questionnaire. 
 
11. Community Participation Indicators (CPI):  The CPI [INVESTIGATOR_87178]-item self-report 
questionnaire that assesses the individua l’s satisfaction with their community 
participation. 
 
12. Visual Analog Scale or Numeric Pain Rating Scale:  The 0-10 rating scale for pain 
is used to gain a subjective report of the intensity of a person’s pain. Zero represents 
“no pain” and ten represents “the most intense pain imaginable”. A meaningful 
change would be plus or minus 3 points. 
 
13. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report 
screening assessment for depression. It is  the depression module of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual (4th edition). Each item is scored from 0-3; total scores may be 
0-27, with higher scores representing increased severity of depression. 
 14. Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL):  The SSQoL is a self-report questionnaire 
that is accepted as a reliable and valid way to assess health-related quality of life 
specific to stroke survivors. Subjects re spond to 49 questions in 12 domains: mobility, 
energy, upper extremity function, work/productivity, mood, self-care, social roles, 
family roles, vision, language, thinking, and personality. Each item is rated on a 5-
point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Domains scores 
(un-weighted average of item scores) and a summary score (un-weighted average of 
all 12 domain scores) are computed.

6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
6.1 Potential risks 
6.1.1 The risk of falling: This could be caus ed by [CONTACT_87190][INVESTIGATOR_87181]. The risk of falling will be minimized by [CONTACT_87191], gait belt, assistive devic es such as cane or a walker as 
needed. This risk is similar to that du ring any clinical outpatient physical 
therapy session. 
6.1.2 Discomfort, skin pressure /friction, bruising, pain , or unusual swelling 
caused by [CONTACT_87192]. This risk will be mi nimized by a thorough skin 
check performed by [CONTACT_87193]’s experienced licensed physical therapy 
personnel at each session. Adjustment s to the sizing and placement of 
Study Number # STU00085161  
________________________________________________________________________ 
15 additional padding will be assessed to decrease the risk of skin 
breakdown as well. 
6.1.3 The device itself could malfunction. The device delivers 6-8 Nm (Newton-
meter) of torque, which give a gentle assist to movement. In the event of 
device malfunction, this force will be absent and the subject will be given 
with physical assistance if required, and the patient will be able to safely transfer out of the device, if require d. Research engineers will ensure 
that the device has been maintained according to specifications and the 
software is always in working order. 
6.1.4 Muscle soreness from exercises during therapy sessions. All subjects 
will work with RIC’s licensed physic al therapy personnel and will be 
initiated with testing and therapy sessions with simple activities, 
progressing on to more dynamic, complex activities when it is clear that 
they are safe and acclimated to the protocol being used. To manage this, 
subject will be provided with adequate rest periods and subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_87194]. 
6.1.5 Risks associated with TMS:  
There are certain populations who have a risk of seizures following TMS. Individuals will be screened using the TMS safety checklist. Single pulse TMS has been deemed to "carry little risk beyond occasionally 
causing local discomfort" in healthy adult populations (Anand and Hotson 
2002). Our stimulation procedures follow published safety guidelines. Seizure activation is extremely unlikely with the single pulse low numbers 
of stimulation proposed in the current investigation. 
A small number of people find TMS uncomfortable, particularly at high 
intensities of stimulation. If subjec ts report feelings of discomfort 
stimulation intensity will be reduced or, if not feasible, testing will be 
terminated. The "clicking" noise associated with stimulation may also be uncomfortable for some individuals. All subjects will be provided with protective ear-plugs during stimulation. 
There is a possibility that a subject could develop muscle soreness or 
fatigue from holding a tonic contraction. If shoulder, wrist or leg pain 
occurs as a result of the experimen t, we will withdraw the subject from 
the study. During testing, there is also a possibility that a subject may 
experience irritation due to the nerve stimulation or EMG electrodes or electrode gel.

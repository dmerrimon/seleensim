Objectives  Endpoints  
Immunogenicity -related Endpoints:  
• Incidence of ADAs , post randomization  
ADAs  = antidrug antibodies ; AUC tau = area under the curve from time  0 over the dosing interval; C max = maximum 
concentration; C trough = trough concentration; PASI  = Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; t max = time of maximum 
conc entration  
 
Overall Design : 
This is a randomized, double -blind, phase  [ADDRESS_1120026]  
administration .   
The study is composed of two periods .  A lead -in period of treatment with adalimumab (weeks: 
1 to 12) followed by a randomized two parallel arm period (weeks: 12 to 32).  Subject s will 
receive an initial 6 doses of adalimumab  on week  1/day 1 ( mg loading dose) , 1 week  later on 
week  2/day 8 ( mg), then at 2 week s interval on week  4, week  6, week  8, and week  10 
( mg), administered subcutaneously (SC) .  At week  12, subjects  with Psoria sis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI) ≥  50 (PASI  50) response will be randomized to either the continued -use 
group or switching group in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_810018] ( week  1/day 1, yes vs. no) .  Subjects achi eving less than PASI 50 response  at week  12 
visit will be considered non -responders and will be discontinued  from the study  at week  12.  
These subjects will be a sked to complete  End of Study (EOS) Visit  procedures . Subjects 
randomized to the continued -use group will continue on adalimumab every 2 week s (Q2W) with 
last dose at week  28.  Subjects randomized to the switching group will switch to ABP 501 Q2W 
at week  12 (dosed week  12 and week  14), then back to adalimumab Q2W at week  16 (dosed 
week  16 and week  18), and again to ABP 501 Q2W at week  20 (dosed week  20, week  22, 
week  24, week  26, and last dose at week  28).   
All enrolled subjects not randomized at week  12 will be considered lead-in failures and the 
lead-in failure reason will be documented.  
An EOS  Visit will be conducted at week  32.   
Disclosure Statement: This is a  parallel group, treatment  study with [ADDRESS_1120027]:  ABP 501

Number of Arms : Continu ed-use group  
Switching group  
Number of Subject s and Statistical Consid erations : 
Approximately 414 subjects will be enrolled to receive adalimumab during the lead-in period .  
Subjects with prior biologic use for psoriasis will be capped at 50% of the total enrolled subjects .  
This sample size will ensure approximately 342 subjects will be randomized at  week  12 after the 
lead-in period, considering 1 7% lead-in failures, in a 1:1 ratio to the continued -use group or the 
switching group .  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_810019] ( week  1/day 1, yes vs. no) and geographic region .  The number of subjects enrolled 
may be adjusted during the study with the actual lead-in failure rate seen to ensure 
approximately [ADDRESS_1120028] 90% power to demonstrate similarity of the primary PK endpoints based on the Two 
One-Sided Tests at a 0.[ADDRESS_1120029] var iability (as 
measured b y coefficient of variation) of 53% for ABP 501 and adalimumab, a true geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 501 and adalimumab, a similarity margin of 0.8, 1.25 , and 
15% drop -outs after randomization through week  30 (including subjects who discontinu e the 
study prior to week  [ADDRESS_1120030] evaluable primary PK 
endpoints between weeks  28 and 30).   
Intervention  Groups  and Duration : 
The total duration of study participation for each subject will be about [ADDRESS_1120031] 
administration .   
Dose regimens: Continued -use of adalimumab  (adalimumab   mg or  mg, SC injection) and 
switching group ( adalimumab   mg or  mg, ABP 501  mg, SC injection) .

Data Monitoring Committe e: For details on the Data Monitoring Committee, refer to 
Section  10.1.3 , Appendix  1.   
Statistical Analysis:  
The primary analysis of the primary PK endpoints, area under the curve from time 0 over the 
dosing int erval (AUC tau) and maximum concentration ( Cmax), between weeks  28 and 30 will be 
performed based on the PK Parameter Analysis Set (consisting of all subjects who are 
randomized and received all assigned doses post -randomization and who have an evaluable 
ABP 501 or adalimumab serum concentration -time profile between weeks  28 and 30), according 
to the actual treatment groups (switching group versus continued -use group) .  The point 
estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the GMRs between ABP 501 and a dalimumab 
for AUC tau and C max between weeks  28 and 30 will be estimated using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model adjusting for stratification factors , weight,  and PK trough concentration at the 
end of the lead-in period ( week  12).  Prior to statistic al modeling, the PK parameters will be 
logarithmically transformed (natu ral log) .  Point estimates and 90% CIs for the mean difference 
in logarithmic PK parameters will be estimated from the ANCOVA model, which will then be 
transformed back to the original  scale to obtain the point estimates and 90% CIs for GMR .  
AUC tau and C max of ABP [ADDRESS_1120034]:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun 2021  Page 14 of 87 
 
and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] .  A sensitivity analysis of the primary PK 
endpoints will  be conducted on the Per Protocol PK Parameter Analysis Set (consisting of all 
subjects from the PK Parameter Analysis Set who do not have an important protocol deviation 
that could affect the primary PK endpoints) .  To establish  the risk in terms of safet y or 
diminished efficacy of switching is not greater than the risk of us ing the reference product 
without such switch , the 90% CI of GMRs of ABP 501 versus adalimumab for AUC tau and C max 
from the primary analysis should fall within the pre -specified simila rity margin .   
The analyses of the secondary PK endpoints of time of maximum concentration ( tmax) between 
weeks  28 and 30 and trough concentration ( Ctrough) between weeks 14 and 28 will be based on 
the PK Parameter Analysis Set according to the actual trea tment groups (s witching group 
versus continued -use group) .  tmax will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_810021] 14 and 28 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3232] .  
The point estimates and 90% CIs for GMR  for C trough between the two treatment groups will be 
estimated using an ANCOVA model adjusting for stratification factors , weight,  and PK trough 
concentration at the end of the lead-in period ( week  12).   
The analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints w ill be based on  the Per Protocol Efficacy 
Analysis Set (consisting of all subjects who are randomized and received all assigned doses 
post-randomization and who have not experienced an important protocol deviation that may 
affect the evaluation of the effi cacy endpoints)  according to the actual treatment groups 
(switching group versus continued -use group) .  The point estimate and 90% CI of the mean 
difference in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI ) percent improvement from day 1 at 
week  30 will be estim ated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for the baseline PASI value and 
the stratification factors .  The point estimate and 90% CI of the risk differences in PASI  75, 
PASI  [ADDRESS_1120035] method for PASI percent improvement from day 1 at week  30 and 
by [CONTACT_105] -responder imputation for PASI  75, PASI  90 and PASI  100 response rates at week  30.  In 
addition, the PASI percent improvement from day 1 at week  30 and the PASI  75, PASI  90 and 
PASI  100 response rates at week  30 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] .   
All reported adverse events wil l be categoriz ed by [CONTACT_810022] (latest version at the time of final 
analysis) dictionary and graded by [CONTACT_10653] , version

4.03.  Safety analyses  of the safety endpoints will be performed based on the Safety Analysis 
Set (consisting of all subjects who are randomized and receive any investigational product post 
randomization) according to the actual treatment received .  Treatment -emer gent adverse e vents 
post randomization are defined as adverse events that start or worsen on or after the first dose 
of investigational product post randomization and prior to the EOS .  The numbers and 
percentages of subjects reporting treatment -emergent adverse events,  serious adverse events 
and events of interests will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570] .  The number and percent of 
subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_810002] (ADA) in the subset of Safety 
Analysis Set who have nev er tested positive (ie,  tested negative or no results) prior to the first 
dose of investigational product post randomization and have at least one ADA result post 
randomization will be tabulated descriptively by [CONTACT_35080] .   
In addition, safety analyses prior t o randomization will be performed based on the Lead-in 
Treated Set (consisting of all enrolled subjects treated with at least [ADDRESS_1120036] during the lead-in period) .  The number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment -
emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and events of i nterest while receiving

2 Introduction  
ABP 501 is [COMPANY_010]’s biosimilar product to Humira® (adalimumab).  ABP 501 is approved in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) under brand name [CONTACT_810060]™ (adalimumab -atto) and 
approved/marketed in European Union and other countries, as AMGEVITA® (adalimumab).  
[AMGEVITA® Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC ), March 2020 , AMJEVITA™ 
(adalimumab -atto) [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information (USPI), June 2019 ]. ABP 501 is 
approved as a 50  mg/mL formulation.  
[COMPANY_010] is now developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new A BP 501 high concentration (  mg/mL) formulati on (referred 
to in this protocol as ABP 501 -HCF).  The dosage forms, route of administration (subcutaneous 
[SC]) and dosing regimens for ABP 501 -HCF will be the same as those for the approved 
50 mg /mL formula tion;  
  ABP 501 -HCF has not been approved or marketed anywhere.  For specifics related to 
the minor differences in excipi[INVESTIGATOR_810004] 501 formulations and analytical comparabili ty 
assessment please refer to the ABP 501 Investigator’s Brochure . 
Note that in this prot ocol the term “ investigational product ” refers to both, ABP 501-HCF or 
adalimumab  ( mg/mL approved formulation) .  
2.1 Study Rationale  
This study is being conducted to support  a demonstration  that ABP 501 is interchangeable with 
adalimumab  (US), as defined by [CONTACT_810024] 2009 
(BPCI Act).  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) def ines interchangeability to mean that “the biological 
product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care 
provider who prescribed the reference product” (FDA Guidance for Industry: Biosi milars: 
Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeabilit y with a Reference Product 2019 ).  
The primary objective of this switching study is to demonstrate that the risk in terms of safety or 
diminished efficacy of switching between ABP 501 (a proposed interchangeable biosimilar 
product) and adalimumab (a refer ence product) is not greater than the risk of using adalimumab 
without such switch .  More specifically, the study aim  is to demonstrate that the switching  
between adalimumab and ABP [ADDRESS_1120052]:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 20 of 87 
 
parameters , when c ompared with continued use of adalimumab .  Immunogenicity, clinical 
efficacy and safety will be also assessed descriptively as secondary endpoints.  
The study will be conducted using the  mg/  mL PFS presentation of adalimumab (sourced 
in the US) and t he  mg/  mL PFS presentation of ABP 501 -HCF (currently under 
development ).  
2.2 Background  
ABP 501 is [COMPANY_010]’s biosimilar product to Humira ® (adalimumab).  ABP 501 is a tumor necrosis 
facto r (TNF) blocker ( a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody) indic ated for treatment  
of chronic inflammatory conditions that include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis, adult Crohn's disease an d ulcerative colitis, plaque 
Psoriasis (Ps).  Please refer to prescr ibing information of the respective products (A MJEVITA ™, 
AMGEVIT A®). The new ABP  501-HCF ( mg/mL) currently under development  has no 
changes to the active substance, conditions of use, dosing regimen, or route of administration.   
The ABP  501-HCF contain s 2 of the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (sucrose and polysorbate 80) as the 
marketed ABP 501 but uses an  based formulation compared to  an acetate based 
formulation used for ABP 501. Refer to ABP 501  Investigator’s Broc hure for details and plans 
related to ABP 501 - HCF.  
The  mg/mL concentration formulation is approved and marketed  for the adalimumab (US) 
reference product.  
2.3  Benefit/Risk Assessment  
The doses ( mg) and dose regimens of both investigational product s proposed in this study 
are consistent  with the  ABP 501 and Humira ® products prescribing information for patients with 
plaque Ps.  Thus, the risks and benefits of ABP 501 -HCF are expected to be similar to those of 
adalimumab  (reference product) .  More detaile d information about the expected benefits, risks, 
and potential adverse reactions  to ABP 501 can be found in the ABP 501  Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
 present in the new ABP 501 -HCF, to be used in this study, is generally recognized 
as a naturally occurring substance that is safe for humans and the amount of  in the 
maximum ABP 501 ‑HCF dose is below what is currently approved fo r other marketed SC 
administered products.  No  clinically  meaningful  difference s in the safety or local , injection site  
tolerability of ABP 501 ‑HCF ( mg/mL) compared with adalimumab  ( mg/mL formulation)

measures, including COVID -19 related precautions and procedures (including severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507]  2 [SARSCoV2 ] testing/screening) will be implemented based 
on the prevailing situation during study conduct, at the inves tigator’s discretion and in 
accordance with local and institutional guidelines , as applicable . 
2.4 Overall Benefit:  Risk Conclusion  
Consideri ng the measures taken to minimize risk to subject s participating in this study, the 
potential risks identified in assoc iation with ABP  501-HCF, as well as switching between 
ABP 501-HCF and adalimumab  (US), are justified by [CONTACT_810025].  On the basis of the available nonclinical and clinical data, and prior 
knowledge of ABP  501  mg/  mL and adalimumab  mg/  mL and  mg/  mL 
(Humira ®), the risk -benefit profile of ABP 501  mg/  mL (ABP  501-HCF)  is judged 
acceptable for the proposed clinical study.

ABP 501 Q2W at week  12 (dosed week  12 and week  14), then back to adalimumab Q2W at 
week  16 (dosed week  16 and week  18), and a gain to ABP 501 Q2W at week  20, (dosed 
week  20, week  22, week  24, week  26, and with last dose of ABP 501 at week  28).   
All enrolled subjects not randomized at week  12 will be considered lead-in failures and the 
lead-in failure reason will be documented.  
An EOS Visit will be conducted at week  32.   
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The current study is designed to demonstrate that the risk in terms of safety or diminished 
efficacy of switching between ABP 501 (a proposed interchangeable biosimilar prod uct) and 
adalimumab (a reference product) is not greater than the risk of using adalimumab without such 
switch .   
A dedicated  switchi ng study approach has been selected, as outlined  in the US FDA guidance 
(Guidance for Industry: Bi osimilars: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability with a 
Reference Product, May 2019 ).   
This study is designed to assess whether switching between  adalimumab  (reference product)  
and ABP 501-HCF (three switches  with the last switch from adalim umab to ABP 501-HCF) will 
result in differences in PK or immunogenicity profiles, when compared to con tinued therapy with 
adalimumab (reference product) .  The C max and AUC tau at the end of multiple switching between 
investigational products  were chosen as co-primary PK study endpoints.  
The FDA guidance provides recommendations to conduct clinical switching  studies in relevant 
patient  population  rather than in healthy volunteers .  Population of subjects  with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis was thus selec ted for this study , as it offers a sensitive model to detect 
potential differences with regard to immunogenicity, PK, safety , and efficacy ( Guidance for 
Industry: Biosimilars: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability with  a Reference 
Product, May 2019 ) in a repeat dose setting .

Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120079]  Enrollment  
Before subjects begin participation in any study  specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] requi res a 
copy of the site’s written  IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, informed consent form ( ICF), and all 
other subject information and/or recruitment material .   
The subject or legally acceptable representative must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and 
[COMPANY_010] approved ICF before commen cement of study  specific procedures .   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all 
eligibility criteria and has been enrolled  in the Interactive Web/Voice Response System (IXRS ).  
The investigator is to docum ent this eligibility decision and date in the subject’s medical record .   
Each subject will have a unique subject identification number obtained from the IXRS .  This will 
be assigned at screening .  The unique 11 -digit subjec t identification number will be assigned in 
sequential order for each site in the format “ 497XXXXX###,” where “ 497XXXXX” refers to the 
site number and “###” refers to the sequential subject ordering as each subject at a site is 
entered into the IXRS (eg,  49712345001) .  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject .  The investigator will keep a record (the subject screening log) that includes limited 
informa tion (such as date of scre ening) about the potential candidates for subjects who entered 
screening .   
If a subject withdraws from study participation, his/her unique identification number(s) cannot be

6.4 Measures to Minimize Bias: Blinding  and Randomization  
The investigational product containers  are largely matching for ABP 501 and adalimumab ; 
however,  to ascertain the blind is being maintained, the investigational product ( ABP 501 or 
adalimumab)  will be handled by [CONTACT_810031] , designated study nurse  or designee .  The subjects, the sponsor 
([COMPANY_010] Inc.), designated CRO personnel, and other study center staff will be  fully blinded to the 
investigational product allocation for each subject .  Randomization data will be kept s trictly 
confidential, filed securely by [CONTACT_456] (or designee), and accessible only to authorized 
persons per sponsor’s (or designee’s) standard operat ing procedures until the time of 
unblinding .  Select CRO staff (eg, unblinded clinical research associ ates) who will not be 
involved in the monitoring or the daily operations of the study will be unblinded to subject 
investigational product allocation to p erform investigational product accountability .  For details 
on the emergency procedure for unblinding of individual subjects please refer to the 
Section  6.4.1 . 
6.4.1  Blinding  
The study is double -blind ; therefore, the investigators, st udy personnel  including the sponsor  
and CRO  study team  (with the exception of the unblinded site staff  (see Section  6.4), Data 
Monitoring Committee [DMC ], Parexel  staff supporting DMC activities  and randomization  list 
activities , and unblinded Parexel s taff supporting drug accountability activities ) and the study 
subject s will remain blinded to treatment allocation .   
Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized staff and th e 
DMC until the time of unblinding .  Authoriz ed staff includes the randomization statistician, who 
will store the master randomization list in a secure system, an unblinded statistician, and 
unblinded programmers, who will provide the DMC with unblinded da ta for review, as and when

designated global safety representative .   
Emergency unblinding will be organized through t he IXRS .  The investigator must record the 
date of unblinding and the reason .  All unblinding must be adequately documented .   
If a serious adverse event  is reported, the designated global safety representative may unblind 
the treatment assignment for the individual subject  through IXRS in order to meet regulatory 
reporting requirements .  Authorized staff will be provided with a unique Personal Identification 
Number  (PIN)  to access the IXRS to obtain blinding inf ormation .  The PIN is unique to the 
individual and must not be shared .

manner .  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_810033] 
(week  1/day 1, yes vs. no) and geographic region .  All enrolled subjects not randomized at 
week  12 will be considered lead-in failures and the lead-in failure reason will be documented .   
In the event of a quality assurance  (QA)  audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
investigational prod uct records to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done 
accurately .

Subjects unable to complete the week  [ADDRESS_1120101] s 
terminating early from the study should complete all procedures scheduled for EOS Visit 
(ie, week  32) within 28  days after withdrawal/discontinuation if possible .  Non-responders 
(defined as subjects achieving less than PASI  50 response  at we ek 12 visit) will be discontinued 
from the study at week  12. These subjects will be asked to complete EOS Visit  procedures .  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject  does not wish to receive further 
protocol  required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] , and the subject  does not wish to or is unable to 
continue further study participation .  Subject  data up to withdrawal of co nsent will be included in 
the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after 
withdrawal of consent .  The investigator is to discuss with the subject  appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from the study and must do cument the subject ’s decision to withdraw in the subject ’s 
medical records .  If the subject  withdraws consent for disclosure of fut ure information, the 
sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent .  
If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the investigator must docume nt this in the study center study records and notify 
the sponsor or designee .  Although a subject  is not obliged to give his/ her reason(s) for 
withdrawing prematurely from a study, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to 
ascertain the reason(s) , while fully respecting the subject 's rights .  Subject s who are withdrawn

8.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occur rence in a clinical trial subject .  The event does 
not necessarily have a causal rel ationship with the investigational product .  An adverse event 
can therefore be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or di sease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, 
combin ation product, medical device, or procedure .  The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
that any adverse events  observed by [CONTACT_98138] a re recorded in 
the subject’s medical record as well as the electronic case report fo rm (eCRF ).

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events that meet the adverse event definition:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments  (eg, electrocardiogram , radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (eg,  not 
related to progression of underlying disease) .  Where applicab le, clinical sequelae 
(not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event .  In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (eg,  vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an adverse event or 
serious adverse event .   
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition .   
• New conditions detec ted or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present before the start of the study .   
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction .   
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication .  Overdose per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent .  Such overdoses should 
be reported regardless of sequelae .  In ca se of overdosage, it is recommended 
that the subject be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or 
effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately .   
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action " per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event .  Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments .  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae  resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse ev ents 
or serious adverse events if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or 
serious adverse event .

[IP_ADDRESS].2  Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events not meeting the adverse even t definition include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg,  endosc opy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event .   
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164921] 
24 hours]) .   
• Anticipated day  to day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen .   
• A pre -existing condition that has not worsene d during the study or involves an 
intervention such as elective  cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on 
study is not considered an adverse event .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that me ets at least 1  of 
the following serious criteria:  
• Results in de ath (fatal) .   
• Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) .   
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .   
• Results in persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity .   
• Congenital anomaly/birth defe ct.   
• Other medically important serious event .   
Definitions  
Life-threatening : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “seriousness” refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk  of death at the time of the event .  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe .  For example, drug  
induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -
threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal .  It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death .   
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 50 of 87 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810009] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting .  
Complications that occ ur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54497] .  If a complic ation prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious .  When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered 
serious .  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810010] o f a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an adverse event .   
Disability/incapacity : The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions .  This definition is not int ended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may i nterfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not c onstitute a substantial disruption .   
Other medically important serious event : Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in 
deciding whether serious adverse event reporting is appropriate  in other situations such as 
important medical events that ma y not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810011] 1  of the other outcomes liste d in the above definition .  These events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_155969] .   
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of dru g dependency or drug abuse .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing all laboratory test results, including review of 
labor atory test results prior to subject enrollment  and reviewing subsequent laboratory test 
results throughout the study .  The investigator will determine whether an abnormal value in an 
individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline 
values .  Laboratory abnormalities with out clinical significance (based on the investigator's 
judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events .  However, 
laboratory abnormalities (eg,  clinical chemistry, he matology, and urinalysis abnormalities) that 
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120112] be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, as applicable .  Where app licable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) a re to 
be recorded as the adverse event .  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments 
(eg, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an 
adverse even t or serious adverse event if they meet the definition of an adverse event or 
serious adverse event as described in Section  8.3.[ADDRESS_1120113] the syndrome or diag nosis (eg, anemia), not the laboratory result 
(eg, decreased hemoglobin) .   
8.3.2  Assessments of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and serious 
adverse event reported during the study .  The assessm ent of severity will be based on  Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE , version 4.03 ): 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1120114] and the event .   
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship .   
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as th e temporal relation ship of the event to study treatment administration will be 
considered and investigated .   
The investigator will also consult the  Investigator’s Brochure  in his/her assessment .   
For each adverse event or serious ad verse event, the investigator must document in the 
medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event or serious adverse event and has 
provided an assessment of causality .   
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 52 of 87 
 
There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and th e investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report .  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the serious adverse event data .   
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated causality assessment .   
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used  when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements .   
8.3.[ADDRESS_1120115]’s medical records as well as the applicable CRF Adverse Event Summary 
page .  The adverse event grading scale to be used for this study will be CTCAE version  4.03, as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .   
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms)   
• Dates of onset and resolution   
• Severity (National Cancer Institute CTCAE version 4.03)   
• Asse ssment of relatedness to investigational product, other protocol  required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492423]   
• Action taken  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is  possibly related to the 
investigational product .  This relationship is indicated by a “ye s” or “no” response to the 
question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33248]?” The investigator is respo nsible for reviewing laboratory test results and 
determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values .  In general, abnormal laboratory findings 
without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as 
adverse even ts.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in 
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 53 of 87 
 
current therapy are considered adverse events .  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the 
laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event .   
The investigator’ s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an adverse event .  A subject, or subject’s legal represe ntative, can also 
voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event .  If the subject withdra ws consent, 
the subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an EOS assessment .   
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], laboratory 
reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an adverse event .  Wherever  possible, the 
investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documented as the 
adverse event .   
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records to 
sponsor or responsible CRO in lieu of completion of the CRF page .   
If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, 
such as discharge summa ries, medical records, or extracts from the medical records .  In this 
case, all subject identifiers, w ith the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_810012] .   
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek adverse events or serious adverse events after 
the subject ’s conclusion of study participation .  However, if the investigator learns of any serious 
adverse event, including death, at any time after a subject  has been discharged from the study, 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the investi gational product or study 
participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is  responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_810040] s ubject that occur after signing of the ICF through the EOS Visit 
are reported using the applicable CRF Adverse Event Summary page or via the paper se rious 
adverse event report form for serious adverse events occurring during screening for subjects 
not enrolled.   
All serious adverse events must be documented , recorded , and transmitted to [COMPANY_010], or its 
designee, within 24  hours following the investigato r’s knowledge of the event .   
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 54 of 87 
 
The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the sp onsor or designee 
within 24  hours of it being available .   
The criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria f or 
serious adverse events .  It is left to the investigator’s judgment to report these grade  4 
abnormalities  as serious adverse events .   
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is not functional, the serious adverse event can be 
reported by [CONTACT_29658] a co mpleted paper Serious Adverse Event Form to the fax number as 
indicated on the SAE form or by [CONTACT_810041] .  
The event must be updated electronically in the EDC system by [CONTACT_810042] f unction resumes .   
After the study is completed at a given center, the EDC system will be taken off -line to  prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data .  If a center receives a report of a new serious 
adverse event from a study subject or receives updated data on a previously reported serious 
adverse event after the EDC has been taken off -line, th en the center can report this information 
on a paper Serious Adverse Event Form .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse 
Events  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol  required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a serious 
adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010], or its designee .   
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_68477] (or designee) of serious adverse  events is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and  
the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met .   
The sponsor (or designee) has a legal responsibility to notify both the l ocal regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical i nvestigation .  
The sponsor (or designee) will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to 
safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators .   
Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected  serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor (or designee) policy and forwarded to 
investigators  as necessary .   
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 55 of 87 
 
An investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse event or 
other speci fic safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse events) from the 
sponsor (or designee) will file it along with the  Investigator’s Brochure  and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to l ocal requirements .   
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop s erious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be 
unblinded by [CONTACT_810043] .  Aggregate 
analyses may also be unblinded by [CONTACT_54548], as appropriate .  Investigators 
will receive notificat ion of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in 
accordance with local requirem ents.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Event After the Protocol 
Required Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for seri ous adverse events following the 
protocol required reporting period or after the EOS .  However, these serious adverse events can 
be reported to [COMPANY_010] .  Per local requirements in some countries, investigators  are required to 
report serious adverse events th at they become aware of after the EOS .  If serious adverse 
events are reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24  hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event .   
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -requi red reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical study cases and handled according ly based on 
relationship to investigational product .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Care will be taken not to int roduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse 
events .  Open -ended and nonleading verbal que stioning of the subject is the preferred method 
to inquire about adverse event occurrence .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow -up 
During the study the adverse events and serious adverse events should be followed proactively 
by [CONTACT_810044]/contact .  All adverse events and serious adverse events

Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120116]’s study participatio n ends, all ongoing 
adverse events and serious adverse events should be evaluated for resolution .  All new or 
updated information for prev iously reported serious adverse events must be sent to [COMPANY_010] 
within [ADDRESS_1120117] of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_286668]/or causality of the adverse event and serious adverse event as fully as possible .  
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with oth er health care professionals .   
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol  required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a serious 
adverse event,  this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  If a subject dies during 
participation in the study, the investigator w ill provide [COMPANY_010] with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopathology if available .   
Events of interest are described in Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_1120118] are n ot planned at this time .   
8.3.5  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies and/or lact ation in female subjects and female partners of male 
subjects that occur after the start of study treatment and until [ADDRESS_1120119] injection will be documented .   
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010]  and/or designee  within 24  hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in 
Section  10.2, Appendix  2.  [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety  or its designee will follow -up with the 
investigator regarding additional information that may be requested .   
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg,  sponta neous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalie s, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events .   
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120120] for ABP 501/adalimu mab will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Pla n (SAP)

Biomarkers are not evaluated in this study .   
8.9 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Antibodies  (binding and neutralizing)  to investigational product  will be evaluated in serum 
samples collected from all subject s.  Additionally, serum samples should also be collected at the 
final visit from subject s who discontinued investigational produc t or were withdrawn from the 
study .  These samples will be tested by [CONTACT_4209]'s designee .  Samples should be 
taken pr ior to administration of investigational product (predose) on dosing visits .  Samples 
tested positive for binding antibodies may be further assessed for neutralizing antibodies .  
Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out ADAs during the study .   
The detection and characterization of ADAs  will be performed using a validated assay method

9 Statistical Considerations  
9.1 General Considerations  
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study w ill remain blinded until database lock .  
Analysis will be performed using SAS® version  9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC , US) by 
[CONTACT_17091] .   
The SAP will be developed and finalized prior to the unblinding for the final analysis .  The SAP 
will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided 
in the protoco l.   
Data during the lead-in period, where all subject s are receiving adalimumab , will be presented  
as one group  for the subjects who have been treated with IP .  All data post randomization will 
be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (switching group versus conti nued -use group) .  Descriptive 
statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for continuous variable, and counts and percentages will be presented for 
categorical variables .  Confidence interval s (CIs) and other inferential statistics may also be 
provided .   
In general, baseline will be defined as the last non  missing measurement/procedure before or 
on the date of first administration of investigational product .   
9.[ADDRESS_1120124] the following hypotheses  for each endpoint : 
Null Hypothesis (H 0): The geometric mean ratio (GMR) between ABP 501 and adalimumab  is 
outside a prespecified margin of 0.8, 1.25 , 
versus  
Alternative Hypothesis (H A): The  GMR between ABP 501 and adalimumab  is within a 
prespecified margin of 0.8, 1.25 . 
To establish that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of switching between ABP 501 
and adalimumab is not greater  than the risk of using adalimumab without such  switching 
(continuously),  both of the 90% CI of GMRs of ABP [ADDRESS_1120125]:  ABP 501

curve from time 0 over the dosing interval ( AUC tau) and C max from the primary ana lysis must fall 
within the prespecified  margin  mentioned  above .   
9.[ADDRESS_1120126] s will be enrolled to receive adalimumab  during the lead-in period .  
Subjects  with prior biologic use for psoriasis will be capped at 50 % of the total enrolled subjects .  
This sample size will ensure approximatel y [ADDRESS_1120127] s will be randomized at week  12 after the 
lead-in period, considering 17% lead-in failures  in a 1:1 ratio to  the continu ed-use group or the 
switching group .  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_810019] (week  1/day 1, yes vs. no) and geographic region .  The number of subjects enrolled 
may be adjusted during the study with the actual lead-in failure rate seen to ensure 
approximately [ADDRESS_1120128] 90% power to demonstrate similarity of the primary PK endpoints based on the Two 
One-Sided Tests at a 0.[ADDRESS_1120129]  variability (as 
measured by [CONTACT_810046]) of 5 3% for ABP 501 and adalimumab , a true GMR  of 1 
between ABP 501 and adalimumab , a similarity margin of 0.8, 1.25, and 15% dropouts after 
randomization through week  30 (including subject s who di scontinue the study prior to week  [ADDRESS_1120130] evaluable primary PK endpoints between 
weeks  28 and 30).

9.5.1  Primary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The primary analysis of the primary PK endpoints, AUC tau, and C max, between weeks  28 and 30 
will be performed based on the PK Parameter Analysis Set , according to the actua l treatment 
groups (switching group versus continued -use g roup) .   
The point estimates and 90% CIs  for the GMRs between ABP 501 and adalimumab for AUC tau

the subject .   
Important protocol deviations are a subset o f protocol deviations that may significantly impact 
the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject’s rights, safety, or  well-being .  For example, important protocol deviations may include

Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120146] data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as this  may 
compromise the scientific value of the study .   
The investigator should  not implement any deviation from the protocol without agreement from 
the sponsor and prior review and approval from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where 
necessary to eliminat e an immediate hazard to a study subject .  In the event of an important 
protocol deviation, the investigator will discuss the deviation with the sponsor’s medical monitor 
and will come to an agreement as to whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study 
due to the important protocol deviation .

that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject  names or any 
information which would make the subject  identi fiable will not be transferred .   
The subject  must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by [CONTACT_20004] .  The level of disclosure must also b e 
explained to the subject .   
The subject  must be informed that his/her medi cal records may be examined by [CONTACT_810057], by [CONTACT_6667]/IEC 
members, and by [CONTACT_90742] .

implementing the changes .  The sponsor or designee will submit protocol amendments to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities for approval .   
The current vers ion of the ICF will require similar modification if the IRB/IEC, investigator, and /or 
sponsor, judge the amendment to the protocol to substantially change the study design and/or 
increase the potential risk to the subject and/or impact the subject's involv ement as a study

The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at  the sole discretion of the sponsor .  Study sites will typi[INVESTIGATOR_810015] .  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and 
study supplies have been collected and a study  site closure visit has been performed .   
The investigator may initiate study  site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination .   
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_11004]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines .   
• Inadequate recruitment of subject s by [CONTACT_093] .   
• Discontin uation of further investigational produc t development .   
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor  shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory  authorities, and any contract research 
organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by 
[CONTACT_211721] .  The investigator shall promptly inform the subject  and 
should assure appropriate subject  follow -up.   
10.2 Appendix  2: Contraceptive Guidance and Col lection of 
Preg nancy Information  
Study specific contraception requirements for males and females  of childbearing potential are 
outlined in Section  5.2 exclusion criteri a 22 and 23). 
Product:  ABP 501 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20200497  
Final 1 .0 Date:  [ADDRESS_1120150] s to use highly effective methods of 
contraception and/or for an increased length of time .  The investigator must discuss th ese 
contraceptive changes with the subject .   
Definitions  
Females  of Childbearing Potential  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below) .   
If fert ility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea  in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of investigational product , additional evaluation should be 
considered .  For more details on the definitions, refer to Section  5.2. 
Women i n the following categories  are not considered females of childbearing potential : 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following:  
• Documented h ysterectomy .   
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] .   
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy .   
NOTE: Docume ntation can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview .   
3. Postmenopausal fe male  
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
caus e.   
• A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) .  However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorr hea, a single FSH measurement > 40 IU/L is required .

Final 1 .0 Date:  03 Jun  2021  Page 80 of 87 
 
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the n on-estrogen hormonal effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study .  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment .   
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects : 
Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use one of 
the follow ing acceptable effective method of contraception throughout the duration of the study 
and for [ADDRESS_1120151] dose of study drug .  as describe d below : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception  
associated with inhibition of o vulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal) . 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) . 
• Intrauterine device . 
• Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system . 
• Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion . 
• Vasectomized partner (provided that par tner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female  subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has 
received  medical assessment of the surgical success) . 
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the  
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual  
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the dur ation of the trial and the 
preferred  and usual lifestyle of the subject) . 
• Double barrier method: the male uses a condom a nd the female may choose 
either  a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an 
option due  to the risk of tearin g when both partners use a condom) . 
Male Subject s: 
Male participants are not required to use birth control during treatme nt with ABP 501.  However, 
female partner of the study male participant should be informed about the study and subject's 
participation .

Pregnancy Testing  
• Female of childbearing potential  should only be included after a confirmed 
menstrual period and a nega tive highly sensitive serum  pregnancy test .   
• Additional  pregnancy testing  should be performed at intervals as per the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table  1-1), and as required locally .   
• Pregnancy  testing  will be perfor med whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or 
when pregnancy is  otherwise suspected .   
• Pregnancy testing , with a sensitivity of 5 mIU/mL will be performed .

• The invest igator will attempt to obtain a si gned authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner 
to obtain additional pregnancy information .   
• After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization fo r release of pregnancy 
and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and 
infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_54560] .  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010]  or its 
designee.  
• Generally, infan t follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth of the 
child (if applicable) .

• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious 
adverse event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate 
will be reported a s an adverse event or serious adverse event .  Note that an 
elective termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation or 
maternal complication  is generally not considered an adverse event, but still must 
be reported to [COMPANY_010] or its designe e as a pregnancy exposure case .   
• If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg .  female subjec t experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonat al congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event .   
• Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a poststudy preg nancy which 
is considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be 
reported to [COMPANY_010] or its designee .  While the investigator is not obligated to 
actively seek this information in former study subject s, he or she may learn of a 
serious adverse event through spontaneous reporting .   
• Any female subject  who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue 
study treatment .   
Collection of Lactation Information

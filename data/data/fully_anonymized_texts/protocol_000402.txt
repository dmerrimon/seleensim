Page [ADDRESS_971265] radiation therapy (external beam and/or 
brachytherapy) as their primary treatment (1).  For men with orga n-confined, low -risk 
disease (Stage T1/T2, Gleason ≤ 6, PSA < 10 ng/mL), radiation therapy result s in excellent 
long- term survival and disease control ( 2).  However, it i s less effective against more 
aggressive forms of the disease (Stage ≥ T3, Gleason ≥ 7 , PSA > 10 ng/mL) and a 
significant fraction of patients develop disease recurrence within 10 years.   Fortunately, the 
rate of occult distal failure following definitive radiotherapy is < 10 % at 10 years (3) .  Hence , 
there is a substantial window of opport unity after initial recurrence in which the disease may 
still be largely localized and amenable to local salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Men with locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiotherapy have few therapeutic 
options that have a h igh likelihood o f eradicating the tumor with a reasonable degree of 
safety.  Other than expectant management and systemic therapy (i.e., androgen deprivation 
therapy, ADT), there are four available local treatment  options  for locally recurrent prostate 
cancer: 1) salvage radical prostatectomy (RP), 2) salvage cryo ablation (CA), 3) salvage 
brachytherapy (BT), and 4) salvage high- intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  Although 
some have demonstrated encouraging [ADDRESS_971266] are associated with significant morbidity and there are no prospective 
randomized studies demonstrating their long -term effectiveness.  
 
1.1  Local Salvage Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713539] -Recurrent Prostate Cancer  
 
1.1.1 Radical Prostatectomy  
 Salvage RP following  definitive radiotherapy has resulted in disease- free 
survival of 55% - 71% at 5 years and 30 % - 43% at 10 years ( 4, 5).  Patients 
with organ- confined disease, who represent 20% - 50% of cases, have an 
excellent prognosis.  However, the complication rate associated with salvage 
RP is high.  Urinary incontinence is observed in 20% -  68% of patients, 
anastomotic stricture in 9% - 32%, and erectile dysfunction in over 72% . 
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_971267] -generation cryotechnology , 5-year disease- free survival is 44% - 
73% (5).  I ncontinence is observed in 4% -  40% of cases , 
obstruction/retention in 3% -  21%, and e rectile dysfunction in over 72% .  
Hence, the results with salvage CA are compar able to salvage RP.  
 1.1.3 Brachytherapy  
 
Five-year disease- free survival following s alvage BT is 34% -  87% (4, 5), 
although many patients also received short -term hormone thera py 
confounding the results.  As expected, most of the c omplications associated 
with salvage BT were genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) in nature.  
Grade 3/4 GU toxicity (incontinence, frequency/urgency, hesitancy, nocturia) 
is 14% - 47% and grade 3/4 GI toxicity (rectal ulcers , bleeding) is 0% -  24%. 
 
Page 7 of 47 Only one study reported erectile dysfunction, which was 100% grade 2.  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_971268] been only three published reports on salvage HIFU and the 
follow -up is relatively short (< 3 years) .  The largest study (167 patients) 
reported 3-year disease- free survival of 53% , although 18% of patients also 
received hormone therapy.  Complications associated with salvage HIFU 
include incontinence (7% -  50%), urinary obstruction/retention (9% -  36%), 
urinary  stricture (17% - 20%), recto -urethral fistula (3% - 7%).  Only one 
study reported erectile dysfunction, which was 72%.  
 
1.2  Oncolytic Adenovirus -Mediated Cytotoxic Gene Therapy  (OAMCGT)  
 1.2.1  Preclinical Studies  
 
Suicide gene therapy is an investigational cancer therapy that is currently 
being evaluated in clinical trials ( 6).  It is based on the premise that cycling 
tumor cells expressing the suicide gene will be rendered sensitive to specific 
pharmacologic agents thereby [CONTACT_1541] a therapeutic index.  Delivery of the 
suicide gene to the tumor is usually accomplished by [CONTACT_713549] a viral vector containing the suicide gene.  
 
Two suicide genes that have been evaluated in preclinical models and in the 
clinic are the E. Co li cytosine deaminase (CD) and herpes simplex virus 
thymidine kinase (HSV -1 TK), which confer sensitivity to 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -
FC) and ganciclovir (GCV), respectively ( 7-25).  The mechanism of CD/5 -FC 
killing is mediated through its ability to inhibit th ymidylate synthase (TS) 
resulting in the depletion of dTMP, which is required for DNA synthesis.  The mechanism of HSV -1 TK/GCV killing is mediated through its ability to inhibit 
DNA chain elongation.  Both the CD/5- FC and HSV -1 TK/GCV suicide gene 
systems  exhibit a by[CONTACT_145152], which results in the destruction of 
neighboring tumor cells not expressing the suicide genes ( 7-9). 
 The concept of using CD and HSV -[ADDRESS_971269] proposed by [CONTACT_137219]. (26- 28).  The 
product of the CD/5 -FC reaction, 5- FU, is a well established 
chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizer in the clinic.  The mechanism of 5 -FU 
radiosensitization is believed to be mediated through the inhibition of TS (by 
5-FdUMP), resulting in the depletion of dTMP pools and increased DNA 
strand breaks as well as redistribution of cells in early S phase, a 
radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle.  It was hypothesized that the HSV -1 
TK/GCV system may also result in tumor cell radiosensitization by  
[CONTACT_713550] -induced DNA damage.  Both suicide gene 
systems demonstrated marked tumor cell radiosensitization in vitro  resulting 
in sensitization enhancement ratios (SER) in the range of 1.8 to 2.2 ( 26-28). 
 
Because the CD/5- FC syste m increases DNA strand breaks and the HSV -1 
TK/GCV system may inhibit the repair of those breaks, Rogulski et al . were 
the first to propose combining the two suicide gene systems ( 29).  They 
generated a novel CD/HSV -1 TK fusion gene that could confer both 5 -FC 
 
Page 8 of 47  and GCV sensitivity onto cells.  Implementation of both suicide gene 
systems simultaneously without, or with, EBRT proved to be far superior 
than either system alone in vitro  and in vivo  (29-32). 
 To further enhance the effectiveness of CD and HSV -1 TK suicide gene 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713540], Freytag et al . generated a replication -
competent oncolytic adenovirus (Ad5 -CD/TK rep) expressing the prototype 
CD/HSV -1 TK fusion gene ( 33).  Not only do replication-competent 
adenoviruses provide a therapeutic effect via their cytolytic activity  (oncolytic 
viral therapy), they also result in a greater efficiency of gene transduction in 
vivo relative to replication-defective adenoviruses.  Moreover, the 
multiplicative property of replication -competent adenoviruses results in a 
greater therapeutic gene copy number per infected cell as well as a greater number of tumor cells infected due to local viral spread.  The merit of 
oncolytic replication -competent adenovirus -mediated suicide gene therapy in 
combination with EBRT (trimodal therapy) has been evaluated in several 
preclinical tumor models ( 34, 35).  In an orthotopic prostate tumor model, 
oncolytic adenovirus -mediated cytotoxic gene therapy (OAMCGT) 
significantly improved both local and metastatic tumor control relative to 
EBRT alone ( 35). 
 1.2.2  Clinica l Trials  
 
The toxicity and efficacy of OAMCGT has been evaluated in five clinical 
trials  of prostate cancer  (36-44), inclu ding a prospective randomized phase 2 
study ( Table 1 ).

3Median PSA follow -up of surviving subject s as of 0 5/15/15.  Subjects lost to follow -up were excluded.  
 Three different (but related) oncolytic adenoviruses armed with therapeutic 
genes have been used:  
 
1) Trials 1 & 2- used the first -generation Ad5-CD/TK rep adenovirus , which 
contains a bacterial CD (bCD)/ wild-type HSV -1 TK fusion gene 
(bCD/HSV-1 TK).  Trial [ADDRESS_971270] s with locally recurrent 
prostate cancer (36, 38).  Trial [ADDRESS_971271] s with newly  
diagnosed intermediate - to high -risk prostate cancer and included  
radiation therapy  (37). 
 
2) Trials 3 & 5 - used the second- generation Ad5- yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-ADP 
adenovirus , which contains an improved yeast CD (yCD) /mutant HSV-1 
TKSR39 fusion gene ( yCD/ mutTKSR39) and the a denovirus death protein 
 
Page 9 of 47  (ADP) gene  (45).  Both the yCD and mutant HSV -[ADDRESS_971272] 
better catalytic properties than the bCD and wild -type HSV -1 TK genes 
contained in Ad5 -CD/TK rep (46 , 47).  ADP increases the cytolytic activity 
of replication -competent adenoviruses (48, 49).  Trial [ADDRESS_971273] s with newly  diagnosed intermediate - to high -risk prostate can cer 
and included radiation therapy  (39).  Trial 5 was a prospective 
randomized phase 2 study that compared the toxicity and efficacy of 
combining OA MCGT with contemporary dose (80 Gy) intensity 
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus IMRT alone and enrolled 44 
subjects with intermediate- risk prostate cancer  (44). 
 
3) Trial 4- used the second- generation Ad5-yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hNIS  
adenovirus , which contains the improved yCD/ mutTKSR39 fusion gene 
and the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) reporter gene .  hNIS 
allows for non- invasive imaging of recombinant adenoviruses using 
single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) when coupled with radioactive tracers such 
as sodium pertechnetate (Na
99mTcO 4) or iodide (123I, 125I or 131I), 
respectively  (50, 51).  This trial enrolled 18 subjec ts with newly  
diagnosed intermediate - to high -risk prostate cancer and included 
radiation therapy  (42, 43).  
 The results of trial 1 (phase 1 study in locally recurrent setting), trial 5 
(randomiz ed phase 2 study in newly  diagnosed setting), and trial 4 (phase 1 
study in newly  diagnosed setting with non- invasive imaging) are described.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer  (Trial 1)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_971274] Health System between January 2000 and  December 2001 (36).  All m en received a 
single intraprostatic injection of t he first-generation 
Ad5-CD/TK rep adenovirus on day 1.  The adenovirus 
dose was escalated from 1 x 10
10 vp (cohort 1) to 1 x 
1012 vp (cohorts 3 & 4) in four cohorts.  5 -FC + GCV 
prodrug therapy  was administered for one (cohorts 1 
- 3) and 2 (cohort 4) weeks.  
 
The primary endpoint was acute toxicity through day  
30.  Secondary endpoints included PSA response, 
trans gene expression and tumor destruction in post -
treatment biopsies, adenoviral DNA in blood, 
infectious adenovirus in blood and urine, and 
neutralizing antibodies (NAB) to adenovirus.  
  
  
 
Page 10 of 47  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Short -term  Results  
 There were no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) or 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  Ninety -four percent 
of the AEs  observed were mild or moderate (grade 
1/2) in nature.  There were nine (6%) grade [ADDRESS_971275]  and were transient.  
There were no  grade 4  events.  
 Seven of 16 (44%) subject s demonstrated a > 25% 
decrease, and 3 of 16 (19%) demonstrated a > 50% 
decrease, in serum PSA  lasting < 120 days .  There 
was excellent correlation between persistence of the 
Ad5-CD/TK rep adenovirus , as determined by [CONTACT_713552], and PSA response.  Transgene 
expression and tumor destruction at the injection site were confirmed by [CONTACT_713553] [ADDRESS_971276] s were negative for adenocarcinoma at 1 year.  
 Ad5-CD/TK rep DNA was detected in blood as far out 
as day 76.  N o infectious adenovirus was detected in 
serum or urine  at any time point .  All subject s 
developed high titers of NAB to adenovirus.  
 [IP_ADDRESS].3  Long -term Results  
 Long- term outcome was assessed at 5 and 7  years. 
At 5 years, PSA doubling time (PSADT) and delay in 
the administration of additional salvage therapy was examined (38).  At 7 years, overall (OS) and disease -
specific (DSS) survival were comp ared to well -
matched historical controls ( 41). 
 When considering all evaluable subject s (n = 14) , 
PSADT increased from a mean of 17 months (prior to 
gene therapy) to 31 months ( after gene therapy) ( P = 
0.014)  (Table 2) .  A greater percentage of subject s 
who received the highest adenovirus dose exhibited 
an increase in PSADT suggesting a dose- dependent 
effect.  Assuming that salvage androgen deprivation 
 
Page 11 of 47  
therapy (AD T) would have been initiated at a PSA of 
15 ng/mL, administration of the gene therapy delayed 
the projected onset of salvage AD T by a mean of 2.[ADDRESS_971277] ’s request.  
2The delay in administration of salvage A DT was determined by [CONTACT_713554] a threshold of 15 ng/mL using pre- gene therapy versus post -gene therapy PSADT.  
 
OS and DSS were examined at 7 years and 
compared to well -matched historical controls  (Figure 
1 and Table 3 ).  The control cohort included 154 
patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer treated 
at the University of Michigan between 1986 and 2000 
(52).  At 7 years, OS was 69% vs. 44% ( P = .07), and 
DSS was 94% vs. 55% ( P = .03), in the gene therapy 
vs. the control cohort, respectively .  Median survival 
was 8.6 vs. 5.9 years in the gene therapy vs. the 
control cohort, respectively.

[IP_ADDRESS].4  Summary of Results in Locally Recurrent Setting 
 
OAMCGT was associated with minimal toxicity when 
administered to men with locally recurrent prostate 
cancer.  There was suggestive evidence of long- term 
benefits as demonstrated by a lengthening of 
PSADT, a delay in when additional salvage therapy is 
indicated, and possible improvements in overall and 
disease- specific survival.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Newly  Diagnosed Prostate Cancer In Combination With 
Contemporary Dose IMRT  (Trial 5)  
 
1.2.2. 2.[ADDRESS_971279] 
Health System and Johns Hopkins Medical Institute 
between January 2008 and July 2010 (44).  Subjects 
were randomly assigned to receive either OAMCGT 
plus 80 Gy IMRT (arm 1; n = 21) or 80 Gy IMRT only 
(arm 2; n = 23).  Su bject s were stratified into three 
groups based on Gleason score, PSA, and percent positive biopsy cores at baseline.  Men in arm 1 
received a single intraprostatic injection (1 x 10
12 vp) 
of the second- generation Ad5- yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-
ADP adenovirus on day 1 followed by 2 weeks 
(weekdays only) of 5-FC + valganciclovir ( vGCV ) 
prodrug therapy.  IMRT (40 x 2 Gy for 80 Gy) 
commenced with the initiation of the prodrug therapy.  
Men in arm 2 received IMRT (40 x 2 Gy for 80 Gy) 
only.   Hormone therapy was not allowed  until 
biochemical recurrence was documented.  
 
The primary phase 2  endpoint was acute (≤ 90 days) 
toxicity.  Secondary endpoints included freedom from 
biochemical/clinical failure (FFF) , prostate biopsy (12 
core) positivity at 2 years, disease- specific and 
overall survival , and quality of life (QOL),  
 
1.2.2. 2.2 Results  
 Men in arm 1 exhibited a greater incidence of flu -like 
symptoms, transaminitis, neutropenia and 
 
Page 13 of 47 thrombocytopenia relative to men in arm 2.  These 
events were expected and attributable to the 
oncolytic adenovirus (flu- like symptoms, 
transaminitis) and prodrug therapy  (neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia).  The vast majority (98%) of AEs 
were grade 1/2 and transient.   Less than 10% of men 
in each arm exhibited acute ( ≤ 90 days) ≥ grade 2 GI 
toxicity.  While acute ≥ grade 2 GU events were more 
prevalent (arm 1 - 43%, arm 2-  31%), no significant 
difference in acute GI or GU toxicity was noted between the two arms.   There was no significant 
difference in QOL between the two treatment arms . 
 
Prostate biopsy outcome ≥ 2 years after radiotherapy 
is highly prognostic for long- term outcome ( 53-55).  
Hence, short -term efficacy was assessed by a 12 
core prostate biopsy 2 years after completion of 
IMRT.  Two-year biopsies were obtained on 37 (84%) 
men.  There was a 42% ( P = 0.13) and 34% ( P = 
0.14) relative reduction in biopsy positivity on arm 1 based on actual biopsies and intent -to-treat (ITT), 
respectively ( Table 4).  This type 1 error is within the 
accepted range for randomized phase 2 trials (5 6).  
There was a 60% ( P = 0.07) and 48% ( P = 0.08) 
relative reduction in biopsy positivity on arm 1 in men with < 50% positive biopsy cores at baseline based 
on actual biopsies and ITT, respectively.  Owing to 
the adenovirus injection algorithm that skewed the adenovirus dose distribution to the positive sextants, 
men in arm 1 with < 50% positive cores received 2.5 
times the adenovirus dose/positive core than men 
with ≥ 50% positive cores.

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Summary of Results in Newly Diagnosed Setting 
In Combination With Contemporary Dose IMRT  
 There was no significant difference in G I/GU events 
and QOL between the two arms.  There was a 42% relative reduction in 2 -year biopsy positivity on the 
gene therapy arm (arm 1).  There was a 60% relative 
reduction in 2 -year biopsy positivity on the gene 
therapy arm in men who had < 50% positive biopsy 
cores at baseline.  The results indicate that 
combining OAMCGT with contemporary dose IMRT 
does not exacerbate the most common side effects of prostate radiotherapy and results in a clinically 
meaningful reduction in positive biopsies at 2 years in 
men with intermediate- risk prostate cancer.

 1.2.2. 3.[ADDRESS_971283] Health System between May 2006 and January 
2010 (42, 43) .  All men received a single 
intraprostatic injection of the second- generation Ad5-
yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hNIS adenovirus on day 1.  The 
adenovirus dose was escalated from 1 x 1011 vp 
(cohort 1) to 5 x  1012 vp (cohort 3) in three cohorts.  
5-FC + v GCV prodrug therapy was administered for 2 
weeks  (weekdays only).  Following the adenovirus 
injection, subject s were administered Na99mTcO [ADDRESS_971284] ence of reporter gene expression, 
whole body distribution of 99mTcO 4 uptake , PSA

1.2.2. 3.2 Results  
 hNIS reporter gene expression (i.e., 
99mTcO 4 uptake) 
was detected in 0 of 3 (0%) subject s at 1 x 1011 vp, 6 
of 8 (75%) subject s at 1 x 1012 vp, and 6 of 6 (100%) 
subject s at 5 x 1012 vp.  Gene expression was readily 
detected in the prostate following injection  of 1 x 1012 
vp and 5 x 1012 vp (Figure 2 ).  Serial imaging on 
consecutive days demonstrated that gene expression 
in the prostate lasted ≤ 7 days ( Figure 3 ). 
 
Importantly, whole body planar scans demonstrated 
that no reporter gene expression was detected 
outside of the prostate in any subject ( Figure 4 ).

In Combina tion With Conformal Radiotherapy and 
Non-Invasive Imaging  
 
Gene expression was readily detected in the prostate 
at adenovirus doses ≥ [ADDRESS_971291] ≤ [ADDRESS_971292] .  At an adenovirus dose of 5 x 10
12 vp, on 
average, 45% of the prostate volume was covered 
with gene expression (43).  
 
1.3  Interleukin 12 (IL -12) Gene Therapy  
 To enhance our investigational approach further, we have added IL -12 to our 
therapeutic platform (57).  IL -12 was selected for evaluation for several reasons.  IL-
12 plays an essential role in the interaction between innate and adaptive immunity (58-60).  It is normally produced by [CONTACT_305472]  (monocytes/macrophages, 
neutrophils) and dendritic cells in response to pathogens, and directly activates cells of the innate (NK and NK -T cells) and adaptive (CD4
+ and CD8+ cells) arms of 
immunity.  IL-12 helps to prime T cells and increases their surviv al, promotes Th1 
differentiation, enhances T cell, NK cell, and NK -T cell effector functions, and 
induces the secretion of IFN -γ, which mediates many of IL -12’s anti -tumor effects.  
IFN-γ acts directly on tumor cells as well as stromal and endothelial cells within the 
tumor microenvironment.  IFN -γ signaling results in 1) increased MHC class I 
processing and presentation (enhancing recognition of tumor by T cells); 2) 
induction of chemokines (IP -10 and MIG) that may recruit innate and adaptive 
immune effectors, which in turn lead to 3) alterations in extracellular matrix 
remodeling, including inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase expression, that reduces 
angiogenesis and tumor invasion; and 4) decreased expression of adhesion 
molecules by [CONTACT_713556].  Hence, the 
rationale behind IL- 12 immunotherapy lies in its ability to induce IFN -γ expression, 
promote immune cell survival and activation, enhance productive antigen 
presentation, and inhibit tumor angiogenesis.  
 
IL-12 has demonstrated significant anti -tumor activity in preclinical models  including 
prostate cancer  (61).  However, its activity in the clinic has been modest when 
administered as a recombinant protein or expressed from retrovirally -transduced 
fibroblasts (59 ).  Furthermore, IL- 12 has resulted in severe toxicity including two 
treatment -related deaths when administered syste mically as a recombinant protein  
(62, 63) .  We believe that IL-12 produced by a locally administered, oncolytic 
adenovirus may exhibit better activity in the clinic without excessive toxicity relative to previous approaches.  Administering the adenovirus i ntraprostatically (rather than 
systemically) should result in a high, local concentration of IL- 12 within the prostate. 
This should limit systemic toxicity and promote IL -12’s anti -tumor effects.  IL -12 has 
been well -tolerated in humans when administered l ocally ( 59).  Moreover, we 
believe our multi -modal approach may function like an autologous, whole tumor 
Stricker et al.  
Page 18 of 47 vaccine.  All modalities ( oncolytic viral therapy, cytotoxic gene therapy, IL -12 gene 
therapy , and radi otherapy  when combined with radi ation ) result in  significant tumor 
cell destruction and the release of tumor antigens.  This may facilitate antigen cross -
presentation by [CONTACT_713557], which, when coupled with IL -12’s ability to 
promote Th1 differentiation, may lead to the development of antigen- specific, cell -
mediated immunity.  
 
We have demonstrated in a preclinical model of prostate cancer that the addition of 
IL-12 to our therapeutic platform improves both local and metastatic tumor control  
that is mediated by [CONTACT_713558] (57). 
 
1.4  Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and Utilities  
 
1.4.1 Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)  
 
The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive 
instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother af ter prostate 
cancer treatment.   EPIC is a robust prostate cancer HRQOL instrument that 
measures a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, and sexual symptoms related 
to radiotherapy ( 64). The domains (e.g., urinary, bowel, sexual) were 
validated separately; sinc e each domain will be used intact there is no threat 
to validity ( 65). 
 
1.4.2 Utility as Measured by [CONTACT_20367] -5D 
 
The EQ -5D is a two -part, self -assessment questionnaire that takes 
approximately 5 minutes to complete ( 66).  The first part consists of 5 items 
covering 5 dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has an index 
score of 1 - no problems, 2-  moderate problems, or 3-  extreme problems.  
The second part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health 
state, measured on a 20- cm [ADDRESS_971293] imaginable 
health state is scored as 100 at the top.  Both the 5 -item index score and the 
VAS score are transformed into a utility score between 0 “Worst health state” 
and 1 “Best health state”.  The EQ -5D will be completed by [CONTACT_102].

 5.1.2  Oncolytic Adenovirus -Mediated Gene Therapy 
 [IP_ADDRESS]   Description of Ad5 -yCD/ mutTK
SR39rep-hIL12  Adenovirus  
 
Ad5-yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hIL12 is a replication -competent, type 5 
adenovirus (Ad5) containing a yeast CD ( yCD)/mutant  SR39 
HSV- 1 TK ( HSV- 1 TKSR39) fusion gene in the E1 region and 
human IL- 12 coding sequences in the E3 region ( 57).  
Expression of the y CD/HSV- 1 TK SR39 fusion gene renders tumor 
cells sensitive to 5- FC and vGCV.   Expression of IL -12 stimulates 
the innate and adaptive arms of immunity , inhibits angiogenesis, 
and mitigates immune suppressi on in the tumor mil ieu. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Supply of Ad5 -yCD/ mutTK SR39rep-hIL12 Adenovirus  
 Clinical -grade Ad5-yCD/ mutTK
SR39rep-hIL12 adenovirus was 
manufactured at the Baylor College of Medici ne Vector 
Production Facility (Houston, TX) using GMP procedures.  The adenovirus was supplied as a sterile, frozen liquid in vials 
containing 1. 1 mL at a concentration of 1  x 10
12 viral particles  
(vp) per milliliter (mL).  
Stricker et al.  
Page 24 of 47 [IP_ADDRESS]   Storage of Ad5 -yCD/ mutTK SR39rep-hIL12 Adenovirus  
 
The Ad5-yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hIL12 adenovirus is stored in a 
locked ultralow ( -80oC) freezer located in a room with restricted 
access.  An inventory log is maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Freytag.  
 
Stability testing of the Ad5-yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hIL12 adenovirus  
will be performed on a semi -annual basis.  This will involve: 1) 
determination of titer, 2) genetic stability as determined by 
[CONTACT_713565], 3) quantifi cation of 
the adenovirus cyt opathic effect  following infec tion of human 
prostate adenocarcinoma cells , 4) ability of the adenovirus to 
confer 5- FC and GCV sensitivity onto infected prostate 
adenocarcinoma cells, and 5) IL -12 expression following 
infection of human prostate adenocarcinoma cells . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Handling  and Dilution of Ad5 -yCD/ mutTK SR39rep-hIL12 
Adenovirus  
 Human adenoviruses are Risk Group 2 (RG2) agents and should 
be handled using Biosafety Level 2 (BL2) procedures ( 67). 
 Thirty minutes prior to each injection, a  new vial of Ad5-
yCD/ mutTK
SR39rep-hIL12 adenovirus  will be removed from the 
storage freezer, thawed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_713543].  The 
adenovirus will be diluted with sterile saline to the prescribed 
concentration.  The diluted adenovirus will be loaded into 1 mL

[IP_ADDRESS]   Toxicity  
 
Injection procedure - Possible side effects of the injection 
procedure include infection, gross hematuria and urinary retention.  Infection occurs in less than 1% of cases.  Antibiotic therapy will be given as prophylaxis prior to and after  the 
adenovirus injection.  Gross hematuria following prostate biopsy occurs in less than 1% of cases and is usually self- limited. 
Injection of the adenovirus into the prostate may cause local swelling that could lead to acute urinary retention.  A Foley catheter will be placed, if needed.  
 
Ad5-yCD/ mutTKSR39rep-hIL12 a denovirus - Based on the results 
of five phase 1/2 trials with similar oncolytic adenoviruses lacking 
IL-12 (36 -44), l ikely adverse events attributable to the oncolytic 
adenovirus include trans ient flu -like symptoms ( [ADDRESS_971313] s 
or 47% ) and transaminitis  ([ADDRESS_971314] s or 41%).  The vast 
majority (> 94%) of these events were  mild (grade 1)  to moderate 
(grade 2).  The flu -like symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_40167] a few 
days  and can be alleviated with analgesics .  The transaminitis  is 
self-limiting and typ ically resolves within 2 weeks.  
 The toxicit ies associated with IL -12 administration are well-
established (59, 62, 63) , some of which overlap those associated 
with the adenovirus and prodrug therapy.  It is possible /likely that 
IL-12 will exacerbate flu-like symptoms  (e.g., chills /rigor, fever, 
malaise ), hepatic toxicity  (e.g., transaminitis , ALKP, bilirubin ), 
and hematological events (e.g., anemia, leukopenia, 
lymphopenia, neutropenia, thro mbocytopenia) .  Other adverse 
events possibly/probably related to IL -12 administration include: 
ascites, confusion, capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], cytokine release 
syndrome, dehydration, delirium, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspnea, 
edema, headache, hypotension, nausea, pleural effusion,

Page 28 of 47 [IP_ADDRESS]   Toxicity  
 
The most common side effects associated with 5 -FC (Ancobon®) 
+ vGCV (Valcyte®) prodrug therapy include neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia.  In five previous phase 1/2 trials representing 
79 subjects ( 36-44), 19 of 79 (24%) subjects exhibited grade 1 -  
3 neutropenia and 26 of 79 (33%) subjects exhibited grade 1/2 thrombocytopenia.  The prodrugs may also contribute to anemia 
(32 of 79 subjects or 41%) and possibly lymphopenia (69 of 79 
subjects or 87%).  Except for lymphopenia, the vast majority of 
these events are mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2).  Sixty -four 
percent (64%) of the events of lymphopenia were moderate 
(grade 2) and 25% were severe (grade 3).  All hematologic 
events are transient and self -limiting, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_713546] (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) to six 
(lymphopenia) weeks.  
 Other possible side effects associated with 5- FC (Ancobon
®) + 
vGCV (Valcyte®) prodrug therapy include nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea and headache.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Dose Modifications  
 
5-FC and vGCV doses will be modified based on the guidelines 
below . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Cytopenia  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1   Absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/μL 
or platelet count < 100,000/μL-  reduce 
5-FC and vGCV doses to 75%.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2   Absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL or platelet count < 50,000/μL-  
discontinue 5- FC and vGCV, and 
resume the drugs at 50% of the 
original dose when the neutrophi l 
count is > 500/μL and platelets > 
50,000/μL.  
 
 
Stricker et al.  
Page 29 of 47  [IP_ADDRESS].2  Creatinine Clearance  
 
If creatinine clearance (CrCl) is < 50 mL/min/m2, 
follow the guidelines in Table 6 and check the 
creatinine every other day (except weekends).  
Creatinine clearance should be  calculated based on 
the most recent creatinine level as follows:  
 CrCl = (140 - age [years]) x  (body weight [kg])  
           ---------------------------------------------------- 
              (72)  x   (serum creatinine [mg/dL])

Creatinine Clearance  Ancobon  Valcyte  
≥ 50 No modifications  No modifications  
≥ 40 and < 50  Reduce to 75 mg/kg/day  Reduce to 450 mg b.i.d.  
≥ 25 and < 40  Reduce to 37.5 mg/kg/day  Reduce to 450 mg q.d.  
< 25 Suspend  Suspend  
 
In all cases, if creatinine clearance improves, Ancobon and Valcyte doses can be increased 
(resumed) once according to guidelines in Table 6.  If 
creatinine clearance drops a second time, Ancobon and Valcyte dosage should be reduced accordingly , 
but may not be increased if creatinine clearance 
improves.  In all cases, the s ubject  should take no 
more than a maximum of 7 days of prodrug 
medication (regardless of the dose received).  If 
prodrugs are suspended continuously for > [ADDRESS_971316] should not receive any  further prodrugs. 
 
5.1.4 Other Medications  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Antibiotics  
 
To reduce the risk of infection, s ubject s will be given c iprofloxacin 
(500 mg, p.o., b.i.d.) the evening before , and the morning of , the 
adenovirus injection, continuing the antibiotic twice daily for a 
total of 3 days.   They will also receive gentamicin (120 mg, I.M.) 
just prior to the adenovirus injection.  If the subject  is allergic to 
ciprofloxacin , another antibiotic can be substituted at the 
discretion of the treating physician.

8.0  S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 This phase 1 trial is designed to determine the toxicity of oncolytic adenovirus -mediated 
cytotoxic and IL- 12 gene therapy in locally re current  prostate cancer.  Endpoints are 
classified as primary, secondary and exploratory.  
 
8.1  Endpoints , Hypotheses  and Analys es 
 8.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Hypothesis - Oncolytic adenovirus -mediated cytotoxic and IL -12 
gene therapy is associated with acceptable toxicity.  
 Adverse events will be graded according to NCI’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  v4.03 (68).  
Adverse events will collected through day 30 (day 1 being the 
day of the adenovirus injection) . 
 
8.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis  1- Oncolytic adenovirus -mediated cytotoxic and IL- [ADDRESS_971338] ’s baseline value.

Page 41 of 47   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis 2- Oncolytic adenovirus -mediated cytotoxic and IL- [ADDRESS_971339] on PSADT.  
 Serum PSA will be assessed according to Table 7 .  PSADT will 
be determined by [CONTACT_713571] (38).  PSADT  prior to the study therapy will be 
calculated using a minimum of three PSA values including the last PSA prior to initiation of the study therapy.  Subjec ts who do 
not have at least three  pre-treatment PSA values will be 
excluded from the analysis.  PSADT after the study treatment will 
be calculated from the nadir and will use all PSA values prior to 
the implementation of additional salvage therapy such as AD T. 
 
PSADT will be calculated assuming first -order kinetics using the 
following equation:  
 Ln (PSA) = β
o + β1t 
 where β
o is the point where the regression line crosses the 
ordinate at t = [ADDRESS_971340]  (PSA) 
changes for every one -unit change in time (i.e., the slope).  
PSADT is defined as Ln (2) / β1.  Data are evaluated for 
normality the ranked data are considered if data are not normal.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis 3- Oncolytic adenovirus -mediated cytotoxic and IL- [ADDRESS_971341] on quality of life . 
 
We will use two instruments to measure QOL: EPIC and EQ -5D. 
QOL instruments will be collected on all subjects  at baseline, 6, 
[ADDRESS_971342] a self -report score of 1 to 3 in 
five domains (mobility, self -care, usual activity, pain/discomfort 
and anxiety/depression), and an overall health score [ADDRESS_971343]  will be 
included in the analysis.  
 Data will be evaluated for normality, data transformation or 
nonparametric approach will be considered if data are not  
normal.  
 For each QOL domain variable, analysis of variance and 
covariance (ANCOVA) will be used.  Analysis will include the 
baseline covariates of pre- treatment domain score, covariate of 
time (of assessment post -treatment) and the independent

PERMANENT CLOSURE  
 
We are distributing this memorandum to t he Southwest Oncology Group, CALGB, CTSU 
and EPP investigators to notify them of the immediate closure of the above-referenced 
protocol.   
 Prompted by [CONTACT_290512], the Sout hwest Oncology Group 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) conducted an interim-analysis of this study 
on January 10, 2007 and recommended closing the study  to accrual due to a patient safety 
issue related to an increased incident of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).  Three cases of AML have been reported among the [ADDRESS_354335] source of concern for the 450+ study participants who were randomized to the chemotherapy arm of this st udy.  It is with regret that I have to share 
this information.

MEMORANDUM  
 Understandably, [COMPANY_011]-Aventis is anxious to in itiate an adjuvant therapy trial for high risk 
prostate cancer.  We feel it  is vital that we complete S9921
 and sincerely ask that you do 
not open this trial at Southwest Oncology  Group institutions.  We have struggled 
successfully to keep our study open, and accrual has been improving in the past year. Indeed, at the present rate, it may be possibl e to complete accrual within 3 years. 
 However, there are very compelling scientific reasons for completing this trial as well. 
These include:  a) Although statistically superior to mitoxant rone/prednisone in survival, the effect in 
Tax 327 and S9916
 was small (3 months). 
 b) Toxicities, long and short term may we ll be considerably different for the two 
approaches. 
 c) There are examples in breast, colon, and lung cancer trials where the “best drug” 
did not necessarily translate to the best result in the adjuvant setting. 
 d) It is possible that men could benefit from  combining active regimens using single 
agents (e.g. [CONTACT_290585]’s studies us ing sequential vs. combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] – 
all of which are active).  For this to occur, one would need a second regimen with significant activity to build on.

REVISION #7  
 
The above noted protocol has been revised as follows: 
 • The heading of Section 5.[ADDRESS_354371]
 
be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_530], completed and submitted as  part of the initial forms set.  
Section 14.6 has been revised to include a completed copy of Section 5.0 as 
part of the initial forms set. 
 • Section 5.1c has been revised to remove the verbiage "and pT3a (extra-prostatic extension)" since it is felt that all patients with a pathologic Gleason's sum of 7 and positive margins are at high risk.  Section 5.1d has been revised to remove "have received preoperative hormone therapy" to expand the criteria to allow patients with similar feat ures regardless of preoperative hormone 
therapy status.  The following statement has been added to Section 5.4:  "The use of low dose megace (< 40 mg/day) fo r the treatment of hot flashes is 
allowed."  Section 5.[ADDRESS_354372] be less than or 
equal to 0.2 ng/ml. 
 • In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_290486], Section 7.4b and the Study Calendar have been revised to indicate  that prednisone treatment should be 
tapered at the discretion of  the treating physician. 
 • The Study Calendar has been revised to clarify that follow up MUGAs or 2-d echos are only needed for those patients who required one at baseline.

      • CALGB institutions participating on Southwest Oncology Group-coordinated 
studies will now submit data directly to the Southwest Oncology Group 
Statistical Center  rather than routing it through the CALGB Data Management 
Center.  Data submission instructi ons for CALGB institutions have been 
revised in Section 14.4. 
 • The heading "FOR CTSU INVESTIGATORS ONLY" which appears on the first page of the model informed consent has been replaced with the following text, "It is suggested that CTSU instituti ons incorporate the following paragraph in 
their consent form."  The section of the model informed consent that addresses 
the level of patient’s consent regar ding additional use of specimens has been 
put in bolded text.  This was inadvertently  not done at the time the protocol was 
distributed. 
 As a reminder, for those patients randomized to the mitoxantrone arm, mitoxantrone 
will be supplied and distributed by [CONTACT_290521].  Mitoxantrone should be 
requested by [CONTACT_290522] S9921
 Novantrone ® Drug Request Form (see Section 19.4) to 
the Immunex Drug Distribution Center (s ee Section 3.3.c).  Drug will be shipped 
Monday through Wednesday and a minimum of two days notice is required.

REVISION #5  
 
The above-noted protocol has been revised as follows: 
 The Table of Contents has been revised to correct the page numbers indicated for the 
Data Submission Schedule, Special In structions and Ethical and Regulatory 
Considerations.  Section 5.[ADDRESS_354377] and then optional RT can be given on 
protocol.  All RT should be documented on the flow sheet.  Section 7.5 has been revised to correctly indi cate that radiation therapy for patients on 
either arm of the study will be allowed at the physician's discretion following the 
guidelines outlined in this section.  This applies to all patients, not just those with positive 
surgical margins.  Section 9.2, the study calendar for arm 2, has been corrected as follows:  the "x"s have 
been deleted under Month 4 for mitoxantrone and prednisone; "x"s have been added for bicalutamide since it is taken daily; and "x "s have been moved from Month 4 to Day 106 
(Cycle 6) for history and physical ex am and weight and performance status.

REVISION #1  
 
The above-noted study has been revised to indi cate that Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals 
will provide Casodex® and Zoladex® free of charge to patients registered to this protocol.  
Additionally, Immunex has agreed to provide mitoxantrone free of charge to patients 
registered to Arm 2 of this protocol.  These changes are reflected in Sections 3.1c, 3.2c 
and 3.3c (supplier), the Model Informed Consent Form, and the addition of two 
appendices.  The new appendices are:  Section 19.3 - the Returned Medication Packing 
Slip (for Casodex® and Zoladex®) and 19.4 the S9921  Novantrone® Drug Request Form. 
 
Additionally, [CONTACT_102778]'s contact [CONTACT_290525] 8.4.  The time frame for pr estudy prostatectomy has been lengthened from a 
maximum of 90 days to a maximum of 120 days prior to registration (the time frames in 
Sections 5.[ADDRESS_354390] been revised 
accordingly).  Radiation timing guidelines have been added in Section 7.[ADDRESS_354391] statements regarding 
IRB approval were updated in Sections 5.13 and 13.3.  The term "Affiliates" replaced the 
term "CGOPs/Member Affiliates" on the face  page, Section 13.1 and Section 14.3.  The 
"Ω" footnote on both Study Calendars was corrected to clarify the intent and timing for off 
treatment follow-up.  Study Calendar 9.2 wa s corrected to show the intended timing of 
history and physical examinations during c hemotherapy (every cycle).  Additionally,

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Introduction  
 
Historically the management of localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate has followed a monotherapy 
strategy.  (1, 2)   For several decades, patients thought to have organ-confined prostate cancer or 
minimal risk of extracapsular disease were offered either radical prostatectomy or radical irradiation. Although these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_290488], it is well recognized that the potential for cure is highly dependent on stage and grade.  Approximately 30% of patients with organ-confined prostate cancer and up to 60% of patients with T3 tumors are at risk for a systemic relapse despi[INVESTIGATOR_290489].  (3)  The figure is higher if the nodes are positive. 
 
In patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer, freedom from biochemical relapse at 5 years is related to Gleason score, PSA, pathologic T and N stage and status of the surgical margin.  (4 - 8)  
Freedom from relapse at 5 years ranging from 83% - 95% is especially associated with Gleason score of ≤ 6, pT1-T2 with a pre-therapy PSA of < 10 ng/ml.  (5)  A preoperative PSA of > 20 ng/ml, poorly 
differentiated histology (Gleason ≥ 8), seminal vesicle or extensive surgical margin involvement or 
nodal metastases define a high risk group of patients with a 50% or greater biochemical relapse rate at 5 years.  (5 - 8)   These data suggest the presence of occult systemic disease at time of initial 
diagnosis underscoring the potential importance of early systemic therapy.  The case for the latter may be strengthened by [CONTACT_290527]/metastatic prostate cancer is currently incurable in the majority of cases.  
A greater recognition of the importance of eliminating subclinical residual disease or occult systemic metastases in a variety of solid tumors has led to the investigation and development of multimodality treatment approaches. Survival improvements had become more achievable particularly with the addition of systemic therapy such as the case in  breast, colorectal, and lung cancers and melanoma.  
(9 - 12)  By [CONTACT_290528].  This lag may in part be attributed to the perceived lack of precise prognostic criteria capable of 
predicting relapse risk for a particular individual, the long natural history which impacts on the timely evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, the lack of "effective" systemic nonhormonal therapy and the concern regarding the morbidity and negative quality of life effects of long-term hormonal therapy.  However, a number of recent innovations have made it more feasible to investigate multimodality strategies including the introduction of PSA, the improvement in patient selection for local therapy and in surgical and radiation techniques, the development of Iong-acting reversible androgen- suppressing agents with minimal side effects and the development of systemic chemotherapy with modest but definite activity in the setting of refractory prostate cancer.
  
Neoadjuvant Therapy   
In prostate cancer the use of systemic therapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant), is not a new concept.  Since the early 1970s, androgen deprivation has been investigated primarily in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy.  Several trials have been reported including a randomized RTOG trial comparing 4 months of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy plus 
 S9921 
 Page 5 
  
  local irradiation to an irradiation-only arm in  patients with locally advanced disease (RTOG 
86-10). (13,14)   A statistically significant improvement in local control and in 5 years incidence of 
distant metastases in favor of the combined therapy arm was demonstrated.  (13)  
A similar approach was adopted for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, as 30%-60% of 
patients clinically thought to have organ-confi ned prostate cancer w ill have extraprostatic 
disease, thus are at a higher risk for relapse.  (15, 16)   Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation was 
used to decrease the number of patients with posit ive surgical margins with the assumption that 
this would translate to fewer relapses. The data from these studies to date are mixed in that 
neoadjuvant hormonal therapy can decrease the inci dence of positive surgical margins but does 
not improve the disease-fr ee or overall survival.  (17 - 22)   Initial reports with short follow up have 
suggested no difference in biochemical recurrence rates between patients treated with 
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation plus radical pros tatectomy and those treated with radical 
prostatectomy alone.  (22)  While the reasons for the lack of objective benefits are unclear it may 
be that brief exposure to androgen deprivation is ineffective in controlling occult systemic 
disease. The latter is not entirely surprising since in breast cancer, another hormone sensitive 
tumor, it has been demonstrated that longer duration of therapy is superior to shorter duration of 
hormonal manipulation.  (23)  Furthermore, the neoadjuvant studies that have been conducted 
were designed with short follow-up to detect pathol ogic but not survival differences, and it could 
be suggested that hormonal therapy can induce changes  in the prostate cancer cells making it 
difficult for the pathologist to recognize their existence.  (24)  The latter would lead to a false 
increased rate of organ-confined tumors.  With this  data it is reasonable to conclude that the role 
of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radi cal prostatectomy remains to be determined.  
Adjuvant Therapy   
Considering that:  a) appropriate patient selecti on is crucial for the success of combined therapy 
trials; b) current determinants of recurrence are based predominantly on pathologic findings and 
c) the fact that longer systemic therapy duration is likely to be necessary, it would seem quite 
logical to investigate adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with high risk localized prostate cancer.  Current data which will be summarized in the ensuing paragraphs suggest that systemic therapy in the form of short course or per manent androgen deprivation results predominantly in 
prolongation of disease free survival, however, st atistically significant survival improvements 
were demonstrated in only one study.  A signific ant disease free survival advantage was noted at 
5, 10, and 15 years in favor of diethylstilbestrol  (DES) plus radiation therapy as compared with 
standard dose irradiation in 78 patients wi th locally advanced prostate cancer.  (25)  The lack of 
an overall survival advantage was attributed to t he greater incidence of intercurrent disease-
related mortality in the DES arm.  The sec ond study was conducted by [CONTACT_290529] (NPCP) in radi cal prostatectomy (NPCP-900, 184 pat ients) or radiation therapy 
(NPCP-1000, 253 patients) treated patients.  (26)  Following lymph node dissection, patients 
were randomized to observation, cyclophosphamide or estramustine.  Recent update of the result 
with a 14.3 years follow-up indicate that the estramustine treated patients in both studies demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS ) especially in patients with T3 or T4 or 
Grade [ADDRESS_354407] been 
conducted comparing combined therapy to radi ation alone, one by [CONTACT_169894] (RTOG) and the other by [CONTACT_290530] (EORTC), in  patients with locally advanced or  node positive prostate cancer.  
The RTOG trial used life long or until progre ssion androgen suppression with goserelin and the 
EORTC trial tested three years of adjuvant goserelin.  (27, 28)  With [ADDRESS_354408] to disease-free survival in both trials.  Overall survival superiority was observed only in the EORTC trial.  However, for patients with centrally  reviewed tumors with a Gleason score of 8 - 10, 
in the RTOG trial, the difference in actuarial five year survival was in favor of the adjuvant therapy 
arm (66% vs. 55%, P=0.03).  The discrepancy in out come with regard to survival between the two 
trials is unclear.  It is interesti ng to note that the five year survival in the experimental arms of the 
two studies is comparable (75% and 79%, respecti vely), however the control arm in the RTOG 
study had a better survival than the EORTC study ( 71 % vs. 62%, respectively).  This difference 
in 
 S9921 
 Page 6 
  
  survival may be related, in part, to different patterns of clinical practice as they relate to timing of 
salvage hormonal therapy in the [LOCATION_003] and Europe and differences in patients' characteristics.  With this background we organized a multidiscip linary consensus conference in April of 1997 to 
answer three specific questions: 1) Consi dering [ADDRESS_354409] majority of patients undergoing radical 
prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer?, 2) If not, can we identify the subset of patients that is likely to be at  a high risk of relapse using cu rrent refined clinical/pathologic 
criteria?, 3) If a high risk subset can be defined,  should adjuvant systemic therapy be investigated 
and what should the design be?  The conference recommendations were further endorsed by [CONTACT_290531]-B (CALGB).  These recommendati ons provide the basis for this proposal.  
The eligibility criteria used in this proposal are t hought to identify a subset of patients with a 40% 
or greater risk of relapse.  The primary endpoi nt is survival.  Much discussion centered around 
the treatment arms.  A "no therapy" arm vers us hormonal therapy were both discussed as 
potential controls.  However, the inherent diffi culties in randomizing a high risk group to "no 
therapy" coupled with emerging data (discussed above) on early systemic therapy suggesting an 
advantage in at least the disease free survival, the fact that survival outcome from an adjuvant trial will not be ready for at least 10 years, with the desire to jump start the process and the 
awaited results of two major trials (the inte rgroup D1 adjuvant hormone trial and the adjuvant 
bicalutamide trial) led to choosing prim ary androgen deprivation as the control arm. 
 Therapy intensification using chemohormonal therapy was also deemed an important step based 
on proven successes of modestly active chemotherapy in other solid tumors such as colon, lung 
and melanoma when advanced to earlier stages,  and attempting to change the paradigm in the 
management of this disease.  Both estr amustine and mitoxantrone based combination 
chemotherapy were considered. However, despi [INVESTIGATOR_290490], it was recognized that no large scale or Phase 
III data are currently available for these combinations in contrast to the mitoxantrone + prednisone combination therapy.  (29 - 32) Although the latter combination had no impact on 
survival, the outcome from the two randomized tr ials indicate a higher proportion and duration of 
palliative, objective and PSA response rates in favo r of the mitoxantrone/corticosteroid arm as 
compared with corticosteroid control, in addition to a favorable side effect profile.  (31, 32)  
 With this background we propose a Phase III r andomized trial targeting high risk surgically 
treated prostate cancer patients.  A combi ned hormonal therapy arm will be compared with 
chemohormonal therapy arm.  The role of post prostatectomy radiation in pati ents with locally advanced disease is uncertain.  
Patients with margin, capsular, seminal vesicle, and lymph node involvement have a significant risk of local failure.  Retrospective studies indi cate that postoperative r adiation could reduce the 
risk of local failure significantly.  (33 - 35)   It is unclear as to what  degree this impacts on disease 
free and overall survival.  (33 - 36)   In 1987, the Southwest Oncology Group initiated a 
postprostatectomy study ( SWOG-8794
) that randomized patients with T3, N0, M0 disease to 
adjuvant radiation or none.  The goal was to det ermine the effect of postoperative radiation on 
the disease free survival rate.  The results of that  study are to be reported in 2002.  Accrual to the 
study was slower than expected, partially due to the increasing trust and dependence on PSA as 
a marker of failure.  Since not all patients with T3 disease fail, it is appealing to wait for the disease to declare itself before init iating potentially morbid treatment.  (37)  On the other hand, 
there is some indication that earlier radiati on might have a better chance of improving the 
outcome.  (38, 39)   Given that the question is uncertain, the Southwest Oncology Group will allow 
investigators to continue to utilize post-operative radi ation to the prostate fossa at their discretion 
on this study.

There is particular concern about prostate canc er in African American (AA) men where the 
incidence is higher and the prognosis appears to be wors e.  The issue in this trial is whether AA 
patients will have a different outcome as com pared to non AA patients, and more specifically 
whether clinically meaningful  arm-specific differences between AA and non AA patients can be 
detected.  At this time there are no data suggesting that such a relationship exists.  This study will 
provide an opportunity to perform exploratory analyses of the relationship of survival to AA status 
and adjuvant therapy.  The Southwest Oncology Group experience in accruing AA patients to an 
early stage prostate cancer trial has been in SWOG-8794  where 20% of the pathologic Stage C 
patients accrued are AA (which is considerably higher than that which would be expected based 
on the proportion of older AA men in the population).

3.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
 
3.1 Bicalutamide (Casodex®) (NSC-0310-0705)  
a. DESCRIPTION  
Chemistry :  Casodex® is a racemic mixture containing two enantiomers, (2RS)-
4'-Cyano-3(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydro xy-2-methyl-3'-trifluoromethyl) 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_290491].  
Casodex® is an active non-steroidal antiandrogen and its antiandrogen activity 
resides exclusively in the (-) or (R) enantiome r.  Unlike flutamide, it is peripherally 
selective and does not cause a rise in serum LH or Testosterone in male rats 
and dogs.  This peripheral selectivity may be because it penetrates poorly the CNS and Hypothalamus (the site of negative feedback of androgens).  In 
humans, rises in LH, Testosterone and Es tradiol concentrations were seen.  
These rises were not dose related.  In 90%, testosterone levels remained within normal limits.  There was no significant rise in mean serum FSH. 
 b. TOXICOLOGY  
In rats, besides antiandrogenic changes , there was evidence of hepatocyte 
hypertrophy and basophilia.  In dogs treat ed for 6 months, there was increased 
heart rate with decreased PR interval, tr ansient decrease in circulating PMNs 
and increased plasma cholesterol.  No cardiac pathology was found.  In a mouse oncogenicity study, an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the top dose male group (75 mg/kg/day).  The no effect dose level 
for hepatocellular carcinoma in this st udy was 15 mg/kg/day with steady state 
blood levels in excess of 10 µg/ml.  The mechanism for this tumor formation is a non-genotoxic, phenobarbitone-type MFO induc tion and is not considered to 
represent a risk for humans.  A two-year st udy in rats and female mice at similar 
doses did  not show an increas ed incidence of hepatic tumors.

Amended 2/14/06 Page 8 
  
  
  Casodex® has been given to over 3,500 men in 35 different clinical studies 
worldwide, in doses up to 600 mg daily.  When Casodex® is given in combination 
with an LHRH analog, the pharmacologic adv erse event profile is dominated by 
[CONTACT_290533] (53%), gynecomastia (9%) and breast 
pain (6%).  Other adverse events repor ted regardless of causality included 
diarrhea (12%), constipation (22%), nausea (15%) and abdominal pain (11%).  
Other adverse were reported, such as  fatigue (22%), pain (35%), back pain 
(25%), pelvic pain (21%), infection (18%), peripheral edema (13%), dyspnea 
(13%), nocturia (12%), hematuria (12% ), anemia (11%), dizziness (10%).  
Casodex® has been associated with changes in liver function, although these are 
infrequent (7%) and rarely occur with jaundice.  Many of these changes improved 
or resolved despi[INVESTIGATOR_290492].  There have been no reports of fatal hepatotoxicity associated with Casodex® therapy. 
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
 
Pharmacokinetics:  
 
Animal studies:  After oral single dos e administration, absorption of the 
compound was slow with peak concentration occurring 3 - 12 hours and plateau between 2 and 48 hours.  There was non-proportional increase in plasma levels with increasing doses.  Elimination half life ranges from 17 - 28 hours in male rats, 21 - 29 hours in female rats and 5 - 7.5 days in dogs.  91 - 96% of Casodex
® is bound to plasma protein. 
 
Human studies:  After single doses, mean time for peak plasma concentration was 6 hours at 10 and 30 mg, but at 50 mg, it was 16 hours.  Mean plasma elimination half lives after 12 weeks of 10, 30, 50, 100 mg/day was 7 - 10 days.  
This finding was consistent with single dos e data.  In patients given daily doses 
of 50 mg, mean plasma concentration was 10 ug/ml at 12 weeks.  After single 
doses, there was linear increase with  doses between 10 and 50 mg, but became 
non-linear at doses of 50 - 100 mg.  At 100 mg, the oral bioavailability is reduced 
by 30% but plasma elimination half life is unchanged.  Casodex
® is extensively 
metabolized and metabolites are excreted by [CONTACT_290534]. 
 
Formulation :  Casodex® is prepared as round, film-c oated green or white tablets 
containing standard recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s and 50 mg of the drug. 
 
Storage and stability :  All packages of Casodex® should be stored securely in a 
dry place at room temperature. 
 
Route of Administration :  Casodex® is to be administered orally in tablet form as 
a once-daily oral dose.  Patients shoul d be instructed to take one tablet once 
daily. 
 
Supplier :  Casodex™ is commercially available, however for this study Astra 
Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will supply the drug to UVI, Inc. for distribution.  Casodex™ will be supplied as white tablets containing 50 mg each of micronized

Chemistry :  The physical form of Zoladex is an off-white powder. 
 
Chemical Structure : 
 
pyro-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Ser (But)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Azgly-NH 2 
 
Molecular Weight :  1269 (as base) 
 Solubility
:  Soluble in water, dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. 
 
b. TOXICOLOGY 
 Animal Studies
:  In laboratory animals, the acute toxicity of ICI 118,630 was 
found to be very low in comparison to its pharmacologic potency.  Intravenous doses of up to 6 mg/kg were without any  adverse effects in rats undergoing LD50 
studies.  No significant pharmacol ogical activity was apparent in the 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], central ner vous, renal and metabolic, coagulation or 
gastric acid secretory systems.  In ra ts, but not the cat, mouse, dog or rabbit, 
long-term dosing of Zoladex has resulted in benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_239572].  Human Toxicity
:  Most side effects attributed to LH-RH agonists have been due 
to testosterone withdrawal (e.g., hot flashes, sweats, impotence, breast enlargement, nausea and dizziness).  Skin reaction and irritation at the injection site (rarely, < 2%) have also been observed.  Tumor flares have been reported in a  small number of patients receiving LH -RH agonists.  Flare reactions usually 
consist of minor complications such  as increased bone pain and therapy may be 
continued; however, potentially dangerous co mplications (e.g. incipi[INVESTIGATOR_290493]) must be averted by [CONTACT_290536]. 
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
 
Kinetics
:  Subcutaneous depot given on Days 1 and 29 to patients with prostatic 
cancer with normal renal and hepatic f unction revealed a peak concentration 12 
to 15 days after administration, with peak  values of 2.64 ng/ml and 2.44 ng/ml.  
There was no drug accumulation.  In an aqueous formulation given daily to 8 
patients with advanced prostatic canc er, peak serum concentration was 12.8 
ng/ml and the half life was 6.1 hours.  The mean area under the curve in the 
dosing interval was 65 ng h/ml and mean total body clearance was 120.1 ml/min. 
 
Formulation :  Zoladex is supplied as a 10.8 mg solid depot formulation preloaded 
in a disposable syringe device mounted on a #14 gauge hypodermic needle. 
 
Storage and Stability :  The sterile unit will be enclosed in a sealed light and 
moisture proof package.  The package should be stored securely in a dry place 
at room temperature (not to exceed 25°C or 77°F).  Before being opened, each package must be inspected for damage in which case the depot should not be used.  Being sterile, the syringe should be removed from its package only immediately before required. 
 
Administration
:  Zoladex will be injected every 3 months (13 weeks).  No 
anesthetic is required; however, local anesthetics may be applied prior to 
injection if desired.  After cleaning with  an alcohol swab, a small area of skin on 
the anterior abdominal wall will be anesthetized by [CONTACT_44579] 0.2 ml of 1.0% lidocaine hydrochloride intradermally or by [CONTACT_290537][INVESTIGATOR_290494].  
Zoladex will then

with a single spot.  In the unlikely event of the depot needing to be surgically 
removed (e.g., severe anaphylaxis), this ma rk will facilitate such a procedure.  
After checking to ensure that the depot has been discharged, the used syringe 
will be broken and discarded in a safe manner.  Supplier

3.3 Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (Dihyd roxyanthracenedione) (DHAD) (Novantrone
®) (NSC-
301739) 
 
a. DESCRIPTION  
Mitoxantrone is a synthetic antineopl astic anthracenedione.  All of the 
aminoanthraquinones are potent inhibitors of DNA and RNA synthesis in vitro 
and bind strongly to DNA as evidenced by T
m values.  It would appear, because 
not all of them have antitumor effects, t hat the antitumor activity is due to some 
mechanism other than, or in addition to, DNA binding and the inhibition of nucleic 
acid synthesis.  Since a number of bis(substituted amino-alkyl amino) 
anthraquinones have been shown to be interc alating agents, mitoxantrone most 
likely acts through intercalation betw een base pairs of the DNA double helix. 
 b. TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology
:  The dose-limiting toxicities are myelosuppression and 
cardiotoxicity.  Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were maximal by [CONTACT_290539] [ADDRESS_354415] pains and green urine 
and serum.  Cardiotoxicity may be more common in patients previously treated with anthracycline, mediastinal radiother apy or preexisting cardiac disease.  
Mitoxantrone may cause fetal anomaly and is mutagenic in bacterial systems.  Extravasation may cause local tissue necrosis. 
 c. PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics
:  Pharmacologic studies done in dogs showed that the drug disappears 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_290495] (drug found only in the three-minute sample) and that ≤ 1% 
appears in the urine in a 24-hour period.  In itial clinical pharmacology studies in 
man show a rapid distribution half-life (eight minutes) and an elimination half-life of two hours.  Most of the drug is probabl y excreted in the biliary system, as only 
about 10% of the drug is excreted in the urine.  Additional experience at the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Cent er in San Antonio shows an every-three-
week schedule to be tolerable.

  3.4 Prednisone (NSC-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
a. DESCRIPTION 
 
Prednisone is a glucocorticoid r api[INVESTIGATOR_60750]. 
 
b. TOXICOLOGY 
 
Human Toxicology :  Possible adverse effects associated with the use of 
prednisone are:  fluid and electrolyte di sturbances, congestive heart failure in 
susceptible persons, hypertension, euphoria, personality changes, insomnia, 
mood swings, depression, exacerbation of infection (e.g., tuberculosis), 
exacerbation or symptoms of diabet es, psychosis, muscle weakness, 
osteoporosis, vertebral compression frac tures, pancreatitis, esophagitis, peptic 
ulcer, dermatologic disturbances, convulsions, vertigo and headache, endocrine 
abnormalities, ophthalmic changes, and met abolic changes.  Some patients have 
experienced itching and other allergic, anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity 
reactions.  Withdrawal from prolonged t herapy may result in symptoms including 
fever, myalgia and arthralgia.  Phenytoin phenobarbitol and ephedrine enhance metabolic clearance of corticosteroids. 
 
Corticosteroids should be used cautiously  in patients with hypothyroidism, 
cirrhosis, ocular herpes simplex, exis ting emotional instability or psychotic 
tendencies, nonspecific ulcerative colitis , diverticulitis, fresh intestinal 
anastomoses, peptic ulcer, renal insuffi ciency, hypertension, osteoporosis and 
myasthenia gravis.  Immunization procedur es (especially smallpox vaccination) 
should not be undertaken in patients on corticosteroids. 
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
 
Kinetics
:  Natural and synthetic glucocorticoids are readily and completely 
absorbed from the GI tract.  Prednisone is very slightly soluble in water.  
Glucocorticoids have salt-retaining properti es.  The anti-inflammatory property of 
this drug is its ability to modify the body's immune system.  On the other hand, 
glucocorticoids suppress the body's res ponse to viral as well as bacterial 
infections.  Equivalent doses are as follows:  Dexamethasone Methyl-prednisolone Prednisolone Hydrocortisone Cortisone  and Triamcinolone and Prednisone 
 
 0.75 mg 4 mg 5 mg 20 mg 25 mg 
 
Formulation :  Prednisone is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg 
tablets. 
 
Storage and Stability :  Prednisone should be stored at room temperature. 
 
Administration :  Prednisone is administered orally. 
 
Supplier :  Prednisone is commercially av ailable and should be purchased by 
[CONTACT_60788].  Prednisone will not be supplied by [CONTACT_6812] .

7.5 Radiation Therapy:   All RT must be recorded on the S9921
 Treatment Form (Form #[ZIP_CODE]).  
Radiation therapy will begin upon recovery from chemotherapy (ideally 3 - 6 weeks and no 
later than 8 weeks) for patients on Arm 2, and should begin no later than 4 weeks after the initiation of androgen ablation for patients on Arm 1.  
Radiation therapy for patients on either arm of the study will be allowed at the physician's 
discretion following these suggested guidelines:
  
Doses :  The target volume will be the prostate fossa and immediate periprostatic tissue.  The 
minimum and maximum allowable doses will be 6,480 cGy and 7,100 cGy respectively at a 
dose of 180 - 200 cGy per day.  Conedown of the fields at 4,400 - 4,600 cGy is allowed (see portals below).  
Radiation Portals
:  Whole pelvis radiation is not allowed.  Initial ports can have more generous 
margins than those outlined below, but after the initial 4,400 - 4,600 cGy should be coned 
down to those margins.  The goal is to treat the prostate fossa.  Treatment of the seminal vesicle (SV) fossa is left to the discretion of the treating physician.  For SV negative patients it is probably not necessary.  For SV positive patients, it is usually the base of the seminal vesicle that is involved and it may not be desirable to cover the whole SV fossa to the full dose out of concerns for toxicity.  If a preoperative CT is available, it can be used in planning, with a margin of 1.[ADDRESS_354437] is required.   
 
Four-field technique (recommended) can be planned with 3D conformal technique.  IMRT is allowed as long as boundary parameters are met.  The NCI's IMRT guidelines can be found on the Advanced Technologies Consortium website (http://atc.wush.edu under "News", then "NCI IMRT Letter").
  
AP/PA  ports:    Inferior
 margin will be at or below the ischial t uberosity (or if urethrogram is used, > 0.5 
cm below the narrowing of the urethra).   
Lateral  margin will be minimum of 1.0 cm lateral to the midpoint of the obturator foramen 
(usually a field width of 8 to 9 cm).  
Superior  margin for prostate only or to include the base of the SV is 2 cm above the 
pubic symphysis.  For the entire SV is  at the top of the femoral head. 
 
Revised 4/15/00 S9921 
Amended 2/14/06 Page 18 
  
  
  Lateral  ports: 
 
Inferior margins  as for the AP/PA ports.   
 
Lateral margins  - anterior:  1 cm anterior to the junc tion of the projection of the posterior 
pubic symphysis over the superior ramus of the pubis or  at the tip of the pubic 
symphysis.   
 
Posterior :  1 cm posterior to a line from the pos terior acetabulum and posterior obturator 
foramen.  As much rectum as possible needs to be spared, but at the minimum the 
anterior 1 cm will be included in the port.  This  would usually put the block in the mid 
rectum.  A larger portion of the rectum ma y need to be covered if the rectum subluxed 
into the prostate fossa.  The rectum above the midpoint of the femoral head can be 
blocked entirely. 
 
Superior :  margins for the prostate only and base of the SV would be as for the AP/PA 
ports.  The anterior bladder can be blocked from a line 1 cm anterior to the junction of the projection of the pubic symphysis over the s uperior ramus of the pubis through the center 
of the femoral head.  Unless the entire SV fossa is to be covered the area posterior to the 
acetabulum can be blocked. 
 
Beam Energy :  Megavoltage equipment with effect ive photon energies greater than 6 MV 
is required. 
 
Treatment Distance :  Minimum SSD and SAD distance is 80 cm. 
 
Fractionation :  180 - 200 cGy per day five days a week with one set of portals treated 
each day. 
 
Treatment Planning :  Isodose distribution at the mid-transverse plane of the tumor 
volume and the central axis (if different). 
 
Localization films : If a cone down is done, both fields can be on the same set of films if 
they are the basis for both treatment.  
 
a. Patients will be evaluated weekly for toxi city during radiotherapy and all toxicities 
documented on the S9921  Adverse Event Summary Form (Form #[ZIP_CODE]).

  8.0 TOXICITIES TO BE MONITO RED AND DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
 
8.1 Patients will be evaluated and graded for toxici ty every visit as specified on the Study 
Calendar for subjective/objective evidence of  developi[INVESTIGATOR_290498] 2.X (see Section 19.1). 
 
8.2 Arm 1 – Hormone therapy  
 
a. There are no dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity. 
 
b. The most common side effects of  anti-androgen therapy are breast pain and 
gynecomastia.  No dose modification is needed except in very severe cases 
(Grade 3 or higher).  In such cases, the anti-androgen will be discontinued permanently and LHRH agonist therapy continued.    
c. Antiandrogens may be omitted in the case of hepatic toxicity of any severity (at 
the discretion of the treating physician). 
 
d. Hot flashes may develop in patients treated with LHRH agonists.  In general, 
these will not require therapy as resolu tion is expected following completion of 
protocol treatment (termination of therapy).  
 
8.3 Arm 2 – Mitoxantrone and prednisone + horm one therapy (follow guidelines in Section 
8.2 for toxicities attributable to hormone therapy).  If mitoxantrone is delayed due to 
toxicity, prednisone is given on schedule without dose reduction. 
 
a. Myelosuppression:  
See table below for a summary of dose modifications for myelosuppression.  Grade 1, 2 and 3 myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombo-cytopenia) and Grade 4 leukopenia or Grade 4 neutropenia except as defined below, with recovery within twenty-one da ys, does not require dose modification.  
Patients who do not recover WB C or platelet counts to ≤ CTC Grade 1 toxicity 
within 21 days should be reduced to dose level -1 for all subsequent courses. 
 
In order to maximize dose intensity,  patients with afebrile Grade 4 neutropenia ≥  
7 days or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with fever (one reading of oral temperature > 38.5°C, or three readings of oral temperature > 38.0°C in a 24-
hour period) should be retreated after recovery at the dose level -1. 
 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000) at any time necessitates retreatment after recovery at the dose level -1. 
 
G-CSF is not permitted.

  b. Gastrointestinal 
 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment of nausea and/or emesis, diarrhea, 
mucositis, and/or abdominal pain is permitted.  
c. Cardiovascular  
The total cumulative dose of mitoxantrone is anticipated to ≤ 72 mg/m
2; based on 
6 cycles of 12 mg/m2; EKG changes, arrhythmias, tachycardia, and/or chest pain 
should be managed based on the specific findings.  Patients who have underlying cardiac disease or CHF, will undergo baseline ejection fraction 
determination echocardiogram or MUGA and this evaluation will be repeated for 
all patients every two courses.  If MUGA decreases to below institutional limits 
(or < 15%) discontinue protocol treatment.  
d. Allergic:  
Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 hypotension, urticaria, or severe rash should be removed from protocol treatment. 
 e. Hepatic ( ≥ Grade 2): 
 
Delay mitoxantrone treatment for up to [ADDRESS_354439] resolved to  Grade 1 or less.  If toxicity has not 
resolved within 4 weeks discontinue protocol treatment. 
 f. Other:  
If toxicities ≤ Grade 2, manage symptomatically, if possible and retreat without 
dose reduction.  If toxicities ≥ Grade 3, drug should be withheld (except for alopecia or anemia) 
until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline if baseline was greater than Grade 1, 
then reinstituted, if medically appropriate, at a dose of 9 mg/m
2 (permanent dose 
reduction).

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
11.1 The primary objective of this study is to co mpare the overall survival in prostate cancer 
patients treated with combined androgen blockade (LHRH agonist and anti-androgen) 
with that in patients treated with the combination of combined androgen blockade and 
mitoxantrone plus prednisone.  Mito xantrone, prednisone and combined androgen 
blockade would be judged superior to the standard regimen of combined androgen 
blockade if the true increase in median survival is 30%.

in median survival, using a one-sided test with 0.[ADDRESS_354445] Oncology Group Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  The DSMC 
will be approved by [CONTACT_290543].  A majority of the DS MC will be outside members, and at least one

approximately 6 years after the study opens.  Evidence suggesting early termination of 
the trial would be if the alternative hypothesis of a 30% improvement in survival with the 
MP + CZ combination arm is rejected at the 0.[ADDRESS_354447] that allows for testing a relative risk not equal to 1.  In addition, the null hypothesis of no difference in survival will be tested at the one-sided level of 0.005.  The 
second interim analysis will be performed after 50% of the total expected deaths (275 deaths) will have occurred.  Testing will be done as above at the 0.[ADDRESS_354448] 
interim analysis will be performed 2.5 years after accrual has been completed.  This testing will also be done at the alpha=0.005 leve l.  The final analysis will be performed at

Informed Consent  
 
The principles of informed consent are descri bed by [CONTACT_60836] (Federal 
Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50)  and the Office for Protection from Research 
Risks Reports:  Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46).  They 
must be followed to comply with FDA regulati ons for the conduct and monitoring of clinical 
investigations.  Institutional Review
 
 This study must be approved by [CONTACT_60837] (Ref. Federal Regi ster Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 56) 
and the Office for Protection from Research Ri sks Reports:  Protection of Human Subjects (Code 
of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46).   Drug Accountability
 
 For each drug supplied for a study, an accountab ility ledger  containing current and accurate 
inventory records covering receipt, dispensing, and the return of study drug supplies must be 
maintained.  Drug supplies must be kept in a secure, limited access storage area under the recommended storage conditions.  During the course of the study, the following information must 
be noted on the accountability ledger; the identification code of the subject to whom drug is 
dispensed, the date(s) and quantit y of drug dispensed to the subject, and the date(s) and quantity 
of drug returned by [CONTACT_423]; subjects should re turn empty containers to the investigator, with 
the return noted on the ledger.  These Account ability Forms must be readily available for 
inspection and are open to FDA or NCI inspection at any time.

Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075].  Reports are 
due January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31.  16.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
 
 
a. Purpose 
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety  of patients enrolled in the studies as 
well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner  at scheduled times during a trial. 
(Directions for routine reporting are pr ovided in Section 14.0.) Additionally, 
certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. The following guidelines prescribe expedited adverse event reporting for this protocol.  See also Appendix 
19.5 for general and background information about expedited reporting. 
 
 
 S9921

 Amended 2/14/06 
 
  
  b. Reporting methods  
 
This study requires that expedited adv erse event reporting use the NCI’s 
Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). The NCI’s guidelines for 
AdEERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov . An AdEERS report must be 
submitted to the Southwest Oncology Group Operations Office  by [CONTACT_290552]: 
 
• Electronically submit the report via the AdEERS Web-based application located at http://ctep.cancer.gov, or 
 • Only if submitting electronically is not possible , fax the completed 
NCI Adverse Event Expedited Report – Single Agent or Multiple Agents 
– paper template, located at http://ctep.cancer.gov
, to 210/677-0006. 
Once Internet connectivity is re stored, an AE report submitted on a 
paper template must be entered elec tronically into AdEERS by [CONTACT_25521].   
c. When to report an event in an expedited manner   
When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within [ADDRESS_354472] responsible for 
oversight of the patient. 
 
e. Expedited reporting for commercial
 agents  
Commercial reporting requirements are prov ided in Table 16.2. If there is any 
question about the reportability of an adver se event or if on-line AdEERS cannot 
be used, please telephone or email the SAE Program at the Operations Office, 
210/677-8808 or [EMAIL_1196], before preparing the report.

  f. Reporting secondary AML/MDS/ALL 
 
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (A ML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 
and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that occur in patients on NCI-sponsored 
trials following chemotherapy for cancer  must be reported using the NCI/CTEP 
Secondary AML/MDS Report Form in li eu of AdEERS. The following supporting 
documentation must also be submitted within 30 days: 
 
• a copy of the pathology report c onfirming the AML/MDS/ALL diagnosis; 
and 
• (if available) a copy of the cytogenetics report.

NOTE: If a patient has been enrolled in  more than one NCI-sponsored study, the 
AML/MDS Report must be submitted for the most recent trial.   
Adverse Reaction Reporting Requirements for CALGB Institutions : 
 
CALGB participants should employ definitions  of adverse events as described above.  Adverse 
reactions, both written and telephone reports, should be made directly to the Southwest 
Oncology Group and the NCI according to the institutions in those sections.  A copy of written AERs should also be sent to the CALGB Regulatory Affairs Coordinator:   
CALGB Central Office Attn:  Regulatory Affairs, Coordinator [ADDRESS_354476] Chicago, IL  [ZIP_CODE] Fax:  312/345-0117  
Institutions are responsible for notifying their IR Bs of toxicities reported as adverse events under 
these guidelines.  
Adverse Event (AE) Reporting for CTSU Investigators:
 
 1. CTSU sites must comply with the expectati ons of their local Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) regarding documentation and submission of adverse event s.  Local IRBs must be 
informed of all reportable serious adverse reactions. 
 2. CTSU sites will assess and report adverse  events according to the guidelines and 
timelines specified in the protocol.  Y ou may navigate to the CTEP Adverse Event 
Expedited Report System (AdEERS) from eit her the Adverse Events tab of the CTSU 
member homepage (https://members.ctsu.org
) or by [CONTACT_290554] S9921  Web page. 
 3. Do not send adverse event reports to the CTSU.  4. Secondary AML/MDS/ALL reporting: Report o ccurrence of secondary AML, MDS, or ALL 
via the NCI/CTEP AML-MDS Report Form in lieu of AdEERS.  Submit the completed 
form and supporting documentation as outlined in the protoco
l.

PHASE III 
 
This is a clinical trial (a type of research study). Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your family and friends. 
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have prostate  cancer considered to be 
high risk, and your prostate has been removed by [CONTACT_44850].  It is suggested that CTSU institutions incorporate the following paragraph in their consent form: (7/1/01)  You have been asked to participate in a research study because you have [INSERT BRIEF 
DESCRIPTION OF DISEASE BEING STUDIED] . This study is being performed by [CONTACT_290559] [INSERT INSTITUTION NAME] who are members of the National Network of 
participating physicians and sponsored by [CONTACT_29630]'s Cancer Trial Support Unit. (paragraph added 6/1/00)  
  
Why Is This Study Being Done? 
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of the addition of chemotherapy (mitoxantone and prednisone) to a standard hormone therapy with hormone therapy given alone on you and your prostate cancer to see which is better.

How Long Will I Be in the Study? 
 
Your hormonal therapy will last 2 years.  We would like to keep track of your medical condition for fifteen years to look at the long-term effects of the study.  
The researcher may decide to take you off this study if your disease gets worse 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_60767]; the side effects of the treatment are too dangerous for you; new information about the treatment becomes available and this information suggests the treatment will be ineffective or unsafe for you.   
What Are the Risks of the Study? 
 
While on the study, you are at risk for these side effects. You should discuss 
these with the researcher and/or your regular doctor. There also may be other side effects that we cannot predict. Other drugs will be given to make side effects less serious and uncomfortable. Many side effects go away shortly after the drugs are stopped, but in some cases side effects can be serious or long-lasting or permanent.

Consent Form for Use of Specimens for Research  (2/14/06) 
 
About Using Specimens for Research  
You have had a prostatectomy (surgery to remove the prostate). Your doctor has removed some 
body tissue to do some tests. The results of these tests will be given to you by [CONTACT_60854].  If you agree, you will have about [ADDRESS_354483] treatment, again between Weeks 24 and 28 of treatment, and when you go off protocol treatment.  
 We would like to keep some of the tissue and blood for future research. If you agree, these specimens will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Please read the information sheet called "How are Specimens Used for Research" to learn more about specimen research.

  Your specimens will be kept at: 
 Cecilia M. Fenoglio-Preiser, M.D. University of Cincinnati [ADDRESS_354484] [PO_BOX] Cincinnati, OH [ZIP_CODE] Phone:  513/558-4500 FAX:  513/558-2289 E-mail:  [EMAIL_5705]  The research that may be done with your specimens is not designed specifically to help you. It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
Reports about research done with your specimens will not be given to you or your doctor. 
These reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care.  
Things to Think About  
The choice to let us keep the left over specimens for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
If you decide now that your specimens can be kept for research, you can change your 
mind at any time. Just contact [CONTACT_290565]. Then any specimens that remain will no longer be used for research.  
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. While 
the Southwest Oncology Group may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
Sometimes specimens are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families). Even if your specimens are used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health records.  
Your specimens will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done 
with your specimens may help to develop new products in the future.  
Benefits 
The benefits of research using specimens include learning more about what causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
Risks 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our 
best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private.  The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.

  Specimen Consent Supplemental Sheets (added 2/14/06)  
 
How are Specimens Used for Research?  Where do specimens come from?  A specimen may be from a blood sample or from bone marrow, skin, toenails or other body materials.  People who are trained to handle specimens and prot ect donors' rights make sure that the highest 
standards of quality control are followed by [CONTACT_60857].  Your doctor does not work for the Southwest Oncology Group, but has agreed to hel p collect specimens from many patients.  Many 
doctors across the country are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_60773].    Why do people do research with specimens?  Research with specimens can help to find out more about what causes cancer, how  to prevent it, how to 
treat it, and how to cure it.  Research using specim ens can also answer other health questions.  Some of 
these include finding the causes of diabetes and heart disease, or finding genetic links to Alzheimer's.  What type of research will be done with my specimen?  Many different kinds of studies use specimens.  Some researchers may develop new tests to find 
diseases.  Others may develop new ways to treat or even cure diseases.  In the future, some of the 
research may help to develop new products, such as te sts and drugs.  Some research looks at diseases 
that are passed on in families (called genetic research ).  Research done with your specimen may look for 
genetic causes and signs of disease.  How do researchers get the specimen?  Researchers from universities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and other health organizations conduct research using specimens.  They contact [CONTACT_60858].  The 
Southwest Oncology Group reviews the way that t hese studies will be done, and decides if any of the 
samples can be used. The Southwest Oncology Group gets the specimen and information about you 
from your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and sends the specimen samples and some information about you to the researcher.  
The Southwest Oncology Group will not send your name, address, phone number, social security number 
or any other identifying information to the researcher.  Will I find out the results of the research using my specimen?  You will not receive the results of research done with your specimen.  This is because research can take 
a long time and must use specimen samples from many  people before results are known.  Results from 
research using your specimen may not be ready for m any years and will not affect your care right now, 
but they may be helpful to people like you in the future.  Why do you need information from my health records?  In order to do research with your specimen, resear chers may need to know some things about you.  (For 
example:  Are you male or female?  What is your race or ethnic group? How old are you?  Have you ever 
smoked?)  This helps researchers answer questions about diseases.  The information that will be given to the researcher may include your age, sex, race , diagnosis, treatments and family history.  This 
information is collected by [CONTACT_60859][INVESTIGATOR_60774].  If more information is needed, the Southwes t Oncology Group will send it to the researcher. 
 Will my name [CONTACT_60889]?  No.  Your name, address, phone number and anything else  that could identify you will be removed before 
they go the researcher.  The researcher will not know who you are.

  How could the records be used in ways that might be harmful to me? 
 Sometimes, health records have been used against patient s and their families.  For example, insurance 
companies may deny a patient insurance or employer s may not hire someone with a certain illness (such 
as AIDS or cancer).  The result s of genetic research may not apply onl y to you, but to your family 
members too.  For disease caused by [CONTACT_60860], t he information in one person's health record could 
be used against family members.  How am I protected?  The Southwest Oncology Group is in charge of making su re that information about you is kept private.  
The Southwest Oncology Group will take careful steps  to prevent misuse of records.  Your name, 
address, phone number and any other identifying informat ion will be taken off anything associated with 
your specimen before it is given to the researcher.  This would make it  very difficult for any research 
results to be linked to you or your family.  Also , people outside the research process will not have access 
to results about any one person which w ill help to protect your privacy. 
 What if I have more questions?  If you have any questions, please talk to  your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at (Insert 
IRB's Phone Number) .

  19.5 Determination of Expedited Ad verse Event Reporting Requirements 
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, whic h are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patient s enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using sim ilar agents. Adverse events are reported in a 
routine manner at scheduled times during a tria l. (Directions for routine reporting are 
provided in Section 14.0.) Additionally, cert ain adverse events must be reported in an 
expedited manner to allow for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. 
Expedited adverse event reporting principles  and general guidelines follow; specific 
guidelines for expedited adverse event reporti ng on this protocol are found in Section 
16.0.  Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), 
and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse even t; 3) the Phase (I, II, or III) of 
the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290510].   An investigational agent is a protocol dr ug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Submission (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label.   Commercial agents are those agents not pr ovided under an IND but obtained instead 
from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
When a study includes both investigational  and commercial agents, the following rules 
apply.  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination 
with a commercial agent(s), the combinati on is considered to be investigational and 
expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational 
agents. 
• Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent(s) and a 
commercial agent(s) on the same study arm, but the commercial agent(s) is given for 
a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent(s), expedited reporting of 
adverse events that occur prior to starti ng the investigational agent(s) would follow 
the guidelines for commercial agents. Once therapy with the investigational agent(s) 
is initiated, all expedited reporting of adver se events should follow the investigational 
guidelines. 
 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner  
Step 1
: Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE).  The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading 
scale for each adverse event listed. A c opy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the 
CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov) . Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCI 
has an Index to the CTCAE that provides help for classifying and locating terms. All 
appropriate treatment locations should hav e access to a copy of the CTCAE. 
 S9921 
 Page 64 
 Amended 2/14/06 
 
 
 
       
  Step 2 : Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE version specified.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is  related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial).  Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.  Step 4
: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those 
that have been previously identified as resu lting from administration of the agent. An 
adverse event is considered unexpected,  for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or t he severity of the event is not  listed in  
 • the current NCI Agent-Specif ic Adverse Event List (f or treatments using agents 
provided under an NCI-held IND); 
• the drug package insert (for treat ments with commercial agents only); 
• Section 3.0 of this protocol. 
 Step 5
: Review Table 16.1 in the protocol to det ermine if there are any protocol-specific 
requirements for expedited reporting of specif ic adverse events that require special 
monitoring.   
 Step 6
: Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included an

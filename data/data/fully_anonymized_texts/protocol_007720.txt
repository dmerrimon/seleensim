Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects up to 30 million men in the [LOCATION_002]. The only class of oral 
medication approved for ED is phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). These include 
sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil and avanafil. Other pharmacologic  options in the treatment of ED 
are delivered as an intraurethra l suppository (alprostadil) or i ntracavernosal injection 
(alprostadil, pap averine, phentolamine, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). These are more invasive routes of 
administration. Men who fail to obtain benefit from a PDE5i or those who have a 
contraindication to this class of medication may ultimately avoid further pharmacologic 
treatment options. An alternative class of oral medication to treat ED may prove to be of 
benefit to a large population of underserved men.  
 
There is in vitro evidence that beta -[ADDRESS_1152151]  in the [LOCATION_002]. Its favorable 
safety profile and the potential for therapeutic efficacy in ED make it suitable for further 
investigation.  
 
We hypothesize that beta -3 adrenergic activation offers a pharmacologic target for the 
treatment of ED. Men w ith mild, mild to moderate, or moderate ED and symptoms of 
overactive bladder (OAB) can be recruited with pre - and post - Mirabegron administration 
assessment of their ED to determine the validity of this hypothesis. Men with sever ED will be 
excluded as hi storical data shows they are less likely to benefit from oral pharmacologic 
therapy alone. Mirabegron is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of adults with OAB. Therefore , recruiting men with concurrent ED and OAB (rat her 
than men with ED alone) will avoid the need for off -label administration of Mirabegron.  
We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_830166]. If 
measurable positive effect on erectile function  is noted, this can guid e further investigation in a 
randomized, placebo -controlled blinded clinical trial.  
For the observational pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will recruit 20 men with mild, mild to moderate, or 
moderate ED and symptoms of OAB who present routinely to the urology clinic at Jo hns 
Hopkins. This initial group of patients will allow a clinical assessment of Mirabegron’s  possible 
in vivo effect on erectile function.

• Screening of erectile function status will be performed using the International Index of 
Erectile Function Questionn aire (IIEF). The Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB -q) 
will be used to assess the bother of OAB symptoms and its impact on health related 
quality of life. Currently, questionnaires such as the IIEF and the Sexual Health Inventory 
for Men (SHIM) are the primary tools guiding diagnosis and medical therapy of ED. 
Other validated tools  or measurable physiologic correlates of ED  are not yet available in 
current Urology clinical practice. More objective testing via a penile Doppler ultrasound  
is pe rformed only  for surgical candidates and does not guide medical therapy.  
• Inclusion criteria will be: (1) men 18 to 70 years old, (2) presence of mild (score 22 -25 
out of 30 on the IIEF -Erectile Function domain), mild to moderate (score 17 -21) or 
moderate (score 11 -16) ED, (3) presence of OAB symptoms for at least [ADDRESS_1152152] use 
of anticholinergic medications is acceptable.  
• Exclusion criteria will be: (1) concurrent ED therap y, (2) prior pelvic surgery (including 
prostatectomy, cystectomy, transurethral procedures), (3) prior penile surgery (4) 
history of priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], (5) history of neurologic disease (such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], 
Parkinson’s disease , multiple sclerosis), (6) unco ntrolled hyperten sion (systolic blood 
pressure > 140mmHg  or diastolic blood pressure > 90mmHg), (7) chronic kidney disease 
stage 4 or 5 (estimate creatinine clearance rate < 30ml/min), (8) moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B or C) (9)  concomitant use of CYP2D6 -
metabolized drugs (metoprolol, desipramine, thioridazine, flecainide, propafenone) or 
digoxin (10) post void residual greater than 150  ml, or (11) evidence of urinary tract 
infection on urinalysis and/or urine culture.  
 
Internal  review board approval will be obtained prior to patient screening. Following this, 
patients being seen routinely in the clinic setting will be screened for possible study 
participation. The initial clinic visit will consist of medical and surgical history , a physical exam 
(including blood pressure, postvoid residual measurement  using a portable ultrasound machine 
specifically for this purpose as is routinely done in Urology clinical practice  and urinalysis and/or 
urine culture) and administration of the II EF and OAB -q questionnaires. A physician or clinical 
nurse participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_830167]. Results will be recorded. A

Informed consent will be obtained without monetary compensation.  
• Time 0: Study participants will be provided with daily Mirabegron 25mg for 14 days ([ADDRESS_1152153] information with  24-hour access 
to report any adverse reactions and to receive medical advice. Any concerning 
symptoms (at any stage of t he study) will result in immedi ate discontinuation of the

MedWatch program and Astellas will be contact[CONTACT_830171].  
• Week 2: Study participants will return for evaluation by a physician or clinical nurse. Any 
noted adverse reactions will be recorded. Blood pressure and postvoid residual will be 
measured. IIEF and OAB -q questionnaires will be administered. If no adverse findings 
are noted, the participants will have the opportunity to dose -escalate  if required to 
asse ss optimal benefit from use of the medication, Accordingly, they may either 
continue on Mirabegron 25 mg daily or proceed to receive Mirabegron 50mg daily to be 
taken for the next 10 weeks. Reduction in dosing will also be permitted during the 
course of th e study (resumption of 25mg daily dosing) and will be recorded. In structions 
to report any adverse reactions will be reinfor ced, as previously.  
• Weeks 4 and 8: Study participants will return for interim evaluation by [CONTACT_830172]. Reassessme nt of adverse reactions and clinical monitoring (blood 
pressure, postvoid residual) will be repeated, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -administration of IIEF and 
OAB -q questionnaires . 
• Week 12: Study participants will return for final evaluation by a physician or clinical 
nurse. Adverse reactions will be recorded. Blood pressure, postvoid residual IIEF and 
OAB -q questionnaires will again be assessed. Participants will be encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_830173].  
Results from 20 subjects will be carefully tabulated. Adverse events will be recorded. Changes 
in blood pressure and postvoid residual will be evaluated. IIEF and OAB -q scores will be 
reviewed. The primary endpoint will be the change in IIEF -Erectile Function domain score

a total mean increase of 4 or more points in the IIEF-Erectile Function domain score. Secondary 
endpoints will include OAB im provement, as reflected by a 10 point decrease in OAB -q 
symptom severity score.  
This non -randomized single arm study will enroll 20 men with mild to moderate ED by [CONTACT_830174] (scores 11 -25) and symptoms of OAB. Pre -treatment IIEF and OAB scores will be 
compared to post -treatments scores at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary analysis for both IIEF 
and OAB scores will be repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) if there are no 
missing time points, otherwise a mixed model will be used. The primary endp oint will be the 
TIME effect, i.e. to test for a change from pre -treatment value of IIEF or OAB. The minimum 
change considered clinically relevant is an increase in IIEF of [ADDRESS_1152155] of 
Mirabegron  on ED, we performed power calculations for various scenarios  of change in IIEF or 
OAB. The scenarios us ed a pattern of means with an absolute increase from pre -treatment to 
12 weeks of 4 units for IIEF and absolute decrease of 10 units for OAB, and plausible 
conservative (higher than expected) values for the within -subject standard deviation that were 
incre ased until power fell below 80%. For both IIEF and OAB we evaluated power if the pre -
treatment mean was the midpoint of the range of values eligible for study: IIEF = 18 (range 11 -
25), OAB = 50 (range 0 -100). However, the power was not sensitive to the pre -treatment mean, 
and showed little variation according to the specific changes in mean score between time 
points, for a fixed overall change from pre -treatment to [ADDRESS_1152156] a 4 unit increase in IIEF and 10 unit decreas e in OAB, with 20 patients 
evaluated at 4 time points, α = 0.05, within -subject standard deviation and autocorrelation 
both constant over time. Power calculations were performed using PASS v. 11 (NCSS Software, 
Inc., Kaysville, UT), according to the method  of Mueller (Mueller 1989).

Should a measurable positive effect be  noted, a more extensive randomized, placebo 
controlled, blinded and possibly multi -institutional trial be considered. The information 
obtained from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_830168].  
Rationale for the proposed drug doses:  
Per th e Mirabegron US package insert, 2015: The approved therapeutic dose of Mirabegron for 
OAB in the [LOCATION_002] is 25mg once daily which may be increased to 50mg once daily based 
on individual tolerability. Mir abegron has been studied at doses ranging from 25mg to 200mg 
once daily in OAB patients and 25mg demonstrated statistical superiority compared to placebo 
for incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_830169].  
Rationale for 12-week  observation period:  
Mirabegron has been studied extensively for at least a 12-week  time period as this was the 
approximate time other classes of OAB drugs (eg. Antimuscarinics) were discontinued due to 
low tolerability (eg. Dry mouth). Mirabegron was found to be both efficacious and tolerable 
within this time frame.  
Rationale for open label study design:  
The proposed study is an observational pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834]. Results from this preliminary 
investigation will dictate the utility of a  more resource consuming,  future randomized 
controlled trial.  
Discussion of the clinical effects and adverse effects of Mirabegron for its approved 
indication : 
The approved indication is the treatment of OAB and the safety of the drug has been well 
characterized in phase 2 and 3 studies.  
Potential adverse effects include QT prolongation with s upratherapeutic doses or in high risk 
populations, increased heart rate and increased blood pressure, the risks of which are greater 
with increasing exposure. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are also a potential risk. 
Changes in pulse rate and blood p ressure are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The

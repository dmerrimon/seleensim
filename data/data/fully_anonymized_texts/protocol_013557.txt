Page 3 of 14 Version Date: August 12, [ZIP_CODE].0 Objectives
 Primary Aim:  To determine whether synthetic retropubic midurethral sling 
(MUS) combined with concomitant detrusor injections of onabotulinumtoxinA
 is 
more effective than midurethral sling alone in improving mixed urinary 
incontinence (MUI) symptoms.
Secondary Aims:
a. To compare incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_836467] a 3-day diary in women
who undergo midurethral sling plus onabotulinumtoxinA to those who
undergo midurethral sling alone.
b. To compare urinary incontinence symptoms and quality of life in women
who undergo midurethral sling plus onabotulinumtoxinA to those who
undergo midurethral sling alone.
c. To identify baseline
 factors associated with persistent urgency
incontinence in women after midurethral sling alone and midurethral sling
plus onabotulinumtoxinA.
 Hypotheses:
1. By [CONTACT_2329] a double-blind randomized
 controlled trial, we will be
able to show that retropubic midurethral sling surgery with detrusor
muscle onabotulinumtoxinA injection will be more effective at
controlling mixed urinary incontinence symptoms than sling
 surgery
alone.
2. Patients who receive both midurethral sling and
onabotulinumtoxinA injection will have objectively have fewer
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_836468]
3.
Patients who receive both treatments will have better quality of
life as it relates to urinary symptoms than those who receive
midurethral sling alone
4. Patients who have persistent urgency urinary
 incontinence after
either midurethral sling alone or both midurethral sling and
onabotulinumtoxinA injection alone will have significantly different
baseline urine microbial content than those who do not have
persistent urgency symptoms after treatment

This double-blind
 randomized controlled trial looks to find a better  treatment for 
women with mixed urinary incontinence.  The primary aim of this study is to 
determine whether midurethral sling, the predominant incontinence surgery 
performed worldwide, combined with injections of onabotulinumtoxinA 
(Botox®) into the large muscle of the bladder improves symptoms of mixed 
urinary incontinence better than sling surgery alone.  Secondary aims are to

 We will also 
compare urinary incontinence symptoms and quality of life measures in patients 
who receive the injections versus those who do not. Lastly, we plan to try to 
identify baseline factors associated with persistent urgency urinary incontinence 
in women after sling surgery alone and sling surgery plus injection.
We plan to enroll women who have mixed urinary incontinence and 
randomize them into either treatment with sling surgery alone or sling surgery 
with bladder onabotulinumtoxinA injection at the
 time of surgery. Patients will 
then be followed with scheduled, in-person follow-up with a physician at 2-
weeks,  3-months and at [ADDRESS_1161254] improvement in symptoms has been difficult.  By [CONTACT_836477]’ urine, we hope to better understand 
this phenomenon.
Project Background:
Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is a clinical conundrum for providers and 
patients alike. The International Continence Society defined MUI as “involuntary 
loss of urine
 associated with urgency or urgency incontinence AND urine loss 
associated with physical exertion, sneezing or coughing or stress incontinence”. 
While some women ONLY experience one type of incontinence (stress OR 
urgency), many experience leakage with both, and it is unclear if these MUI 
symptoms are one disease with a continuum of symptoms or two separate diseases 
making treatment algorithms challenging. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_836470], MUI accounts for up to 50% 
of incontinence in women. The annual burden of MUI on the national economy is 
significant and growing. 
More importantly, women with MUI are more bothered and suffer more dramatic 
quality of life impact.  Yet, optimal treatments for MUI lag behind.
  Definitive 
treatments for stress incontinence are typi[INVESTIGATOR_836471], while those for urgency 
incontinence are behavioral or medical. As early as the 1980s, investigators 
sought to determine if surgical or non-surgical treatments should be used first for 
MUI.  In one small trial, women with MUI were randomized to medical treatment 
(e.g. anticholinergic medications designed to relax the bladder muscle) for 
urgency incontinence or surgery for stress incontinence.  Forty-three percent of 
women in the medicine group continued to have incontinence symptoms, while

PROTOCOL TITLE: The SL IM Study: Sling and Botox® Injection for Mixed Urinary 
Incontinence 
Page 5 of 14 Version Date: August 12, 2016only 12-13% of the surgical patients had persistent incontinence symptoms.  
Further complicating treatment decisions, continence procedures designed to treat
 
stress incontinence have historically worsened urgency incontinence in some 
women. 
There is no high-quality evidence or consensus amongst specialists on how to 
approach treatment for women with MUI.  The
 optimal treatment strategy for 
women with MUI is unclear.  Historically, health care providers tried to identify 
which type of incontinence, stress or urgency, was most bothersome to the patient 
and treated the bothersome subtype first.  Those with stress predominant 
incontinence underwent surgery, while those with urgency predominant 
incontinence received medications and behavioral/physical therapy.
Currently, the primary surgical treatment of stress incontinence is midurethral 
slings. Greater than 66% of women undergoing midurethral
 sling surgery for 
stress incontinence also report baseline urgency incontinence. Investigators report 
improvement in urgency incontinence in some women with MUI undergoing 
midurethral sling, however, subjective outcomes are worse in women with MUI 
compared to pure stress incontinence and the lower cure rates are associated with 
persistent urgency incontinence. Studies also demonstrated that urgency 
incontinence is the major cause of patient dissatisfaction of surgery for stress 
incontinence and prolapse. Reduced satisfaction and treatment failure after 
midurethral sling surgery is associated with higher baseline urgency and urgency 
incontinence.  Additionally, one study showed that 33% of women who did not 
have urgency incontinence symptoms prior to midurethral sling developed 
urgency symptoms after surgery. This study further complicates the issue, as it is 
possible that midurethral sling may cause urgency symptoms in some patients. 
Overall, studies have shown a wide range in improvement of urgency 
incontinence symptoms after midurethral sling placement between 46-74%.  The 
wide range of anticipated improvement coupled with the not insignificant rate of 
de novo in urgency incontinence symptoms after midurethral sling, make 
counseling women with MUI contemplating surgery challenging.  Essentially, 
surgeons can counsel women with MUI that although their stress incontinence 
symptoms are likely to improve after midurethral sling (90% satisfaction), their 
urgency incontinence may get better, stay the same, or get worse.
Other strategies for treating MUI have also been proposed including treatment 
with anticholinergic medication in addition to traditional sling surgery. In an 
AHRQ funded study, anticholinergic medical
 therapy had minimal to moderate 
efficacy for treatment of urgency incontinence symptoms. Furthermore, many 
women taking anticholinergic medications suffer bothersome side effects, such as 
dry mouth and constipation, and over 50% stop taking the medication during their 
treatment course.  In our prior work, we found that women treated with 
anticholinergic medications prior to traditional continence surgery were more 
likely to have urgency symptoms post-operatively, suggesting poorer outcomes in 
women with MUI. Understandably, patients with persistent urgency symptoms 
post-operatively are significantly less satisfied with their symptoms and surgical 
outcomes than patients who have complete resolution of their symptoms.

PROTOCOL TITLE: The SL IM Study: Sling and Botox® Injection for Mixed Urinary 
Incontinence 
Page 6 of 14 Version Date: August 12, 2016Given the known treatment shortcomings of anticholinergic medications for 
treatment of urgency incontinences, clinician-investigators began injecting 
onabotulinumtoxinA into the bladder in an attempt reduce urgency incontinence 
while minimizing side effects.  OnabotulinumtoxinA is a neurotoxin,
 which 
inhibits acetylcholine release and temporarily relaxes the bladder muscle to inhibit 
urgency incontinence.   A large NIH funded multicenter double-blind randomized 
controlled trial investigated the role of detrusor injections with 100 units of 
onabotulinumtoxinA compared to anticholinergic medications for the treatment of 
urgency incontinence.  More women in the onabotulinumtoxinA group were 
completely dry (no incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) without having the bothersome side 
effects of the anticholinergic medications.  Women in the onabotulinumtoxinA 
group also had higher rates of transient urinary retention requiring self-
catheterization and urinary tract infection; however, these rates were significantly 
lower than earlier studies using higher doses of onabotulinumtoxinA.  Several 
studies suggest the optimal dose of onabotulinumtoxinA, which maximized 
resolution of urinary incontinence while minimizing complications, is [ADDRESS_1161255] fewer bothersome incontinence symptoms than 
women undergoing sling alone.  The aim of this double-blind randomized 
comparative efficacy trial is to determine if women with MUI planning sling 
surgery sustain greater improvement in their urinary symptoms with the addition 
of onabotulinumtoxinA injection at the time of sling.  
A secondary aim is to identify subsets of women who may be prone  to 
persistent urinary symptoms after treatment.  Although classic teaching is that the 
urine is ‘sterile’, recent studies identified that urine of normal asymptomatic 
women contain bacteria; in other words, similar to all other organ systems in the 
body (gastrointestinal tract, skin, etc) urine is NOT sterile rather it has a 
microbiome.  Recent data suggests that patients with urgency symptoms have a 
different bladder microbiome (different bacteria) than those who do not suffer 
from this ailment.  Our unit recently found that the microbiome of women with 
urgency and bladder pain differs from age-matched controls.

Procedures Involved
Women with MUI undergoing midurethral sling for bothersome SUI will 
be randomized to 100 units onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo (saline) injections in 
the detrusor at the
 time of sling surgery.  Specifically, the retropubic midurethral 
slings used will be either the Gynecare TVT Exact Continence System by [CONTACT_836478]-Urethral Sling System 
based on surgeon preference. Surgeons and participants will be masked to study 
assignment.  Primary outcome will be the Patient Global Assessment of 
Improvement (PGI-I), a global, patient oriented measure that assesses symptoms 
of SUI and UUI at 3-months.  The primary outcome, PGI-I asks subjects to best 
describe how their urinary tract condition is now, compared to how it was before 
treatment for urinary leakage. Response choices are: (1) ‘very much better’, (2) 
‘much better’, (3) ‘a little better’, (4) ‘no change’, (5) ‘a little worse’, (6) ‘much 
worse’, and (7) ‘very much worse’. Construct validity of the PGI-I was 
demonstrated in incontinence trials.32  
We selected a subjective, patient oriented outcome as our primary 
outcome measure secondary to the complex nature of MUI, and the
 association 
between dissatisfaction after incontinence surgery and persistent or new onset 
urgency.  We felt the patient’s overall impression of their continence status 
represented a more clinically meaningful outcome than traditional objective 
measures.  In addition, we will compare subjective and objective urinary 
symptoms and quality of life amongst treatment groups 3-months and 1-year after 
surgery.
All women with MUI planning surgical intervention with midurethral 
sling will be approached
 for study participation.  MUI will be defined as an 
answer of “moderately’ or “quite a bit” bothered to Urinary Distress Inventory 
(UDI) items (2) “urine leakage with a feeling of urgency” AND (3) “urine leakage 
related to coughing, sneezing, or laughing”.
Women will undergo standardized urologic evaluation at baseline 
including assessment of urinary symptoms and quality of life using short forms of 
the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact
 Questionnaire 
(IIQ-7); assessment of overall severity of their incontinence symptoms with the 
Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S);[ADDRESS_1161258] void residual urine volume; 
urine analysis and culture; multichannel urodynamic testing; and pelvic exam 
with prolapse quantification using pelvic organ prolapse quantification system 
(POP-Q)33.  All patients will also complete a 3-day urinary diary at baseline 
quantifying the number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (stress and urge).   Three months 
and 1-year after surgery, patients will again complete all baseline measures, 
including UDI, IIQ, PGI-I, PGI-S, and 3-day diary to report symptom and 
objective urinary symptoms after treatment.  A sample of urine will be obtained 
for microbiome analysis at each visit.
Scheduled in-person follow-up visits will occur at baseline, 2 and 6-weeks, 
3-months, and 1-year after surgery. At the baseline,
 3-month, and 1-year visits,

Page 9 of 14 Version Date: August 12, 2016research staff will collect the 3-day diary information and record any adverse 
events that have occurred during the post-operative period. Subjects will also 
complete the general and condition specific symptom and QOL
 questionnaires.  In 
addition, an update of current medication and assessment as to whether any 
evaluation or treatment for pelvic floor disorders or adverse outcomes from 
surgery have occurred since the previous evaluation will be assessed by [CONTACT_836479]-person visits. All patient and survey data will be recorded in 
RedCAP.
7.0 Data and Specimen Banking
Data will be collected at Northwestern Medicine. All study data will be 
recorded on Case Report Forms by [CONTACT_836480]
 a locked cabinet. CRFs will be derived from source 
documentation and/or participant self-report. Data will be entered by [CONTACT_836481] a REDCap database that will be 
stored on a secure sever at the Data Coordinating Center. All collected 
data must be entered into REDCap within 5 business days. Any queries to 
data entered into REDCap will be addressed by [CONTACT_157720] 5 business 
days. It is each site’s responsibility to regularly check REDCap for data 
queries. 
Both data and specimens will be banked for further use. Patient specimens 
will not have any directly identifiable patient information on them, but 
will remain coded for future studies if the specimen
 is unused in this 
study.  Argonne National Laboratories will have no access to any patient 
identifying information.  All patient identifiers will be removed prior to 
transferring microbiome samples to Argonne National Laboratories for 
processing.
8.0 Data and Specimen Management
All analyses will be conducted using SPSS version 20 (Chicago, IL).  Histograms 
will be used
 to determine distribution of data and appropriate non-parametric or 
parametric tests will be selected.  Primary outcome will be analyzed 
dichotomously with responses of “very much better” and “much better” 
considered an optimal outcome.  A chi-square test of association will be used to 
compare primary outcome (PGI-I) between treatment groups.  Questionnaire data 
will be compared between sling alone and sling plus onabotulinumtoxinA groups 
using Mann Whitney test. All test results will be considered significant with a p-
value of less than or equal to 0.05.
In a study of women with MUI undergoing retropubic midurethral sling, 66% of 
patients reported a PGI-I of “very much better’ or ‘much better’ at 3-months.23  
Similarly, in a randomized
 trial of intravesical onabotulinumtoxinA 55% of 
participants had PGI-I scores of “very much better’ or ‘much better’.  Therefore, 
assuming “optimal outcomes’ (PGI-I scores of “very much better’ or ‘much 
better) in 66% of women undergoing sling alone and 93% in those undergoing 
sling plus onabotulinumtoxinA, we will need to recruit 34 patients in each group

website. All
 users of REDCap need an institutional username [CONTACT_836488]. Research personnel, including study staff as well as study 
doctors will be able to collect and have access to subject data.
All specimen collected will be stored locally in the clinic storage facility until 
patient de-identification and subsequent transfer to Argonne National Laboratory 
for analysis can be completed.  Any specimens that are not
 used for this study will 
be stored for future study use.  Only the study coordinator and physicians 
participating in the study directly will have access to the storage facility for the 
purposes of adding specimens and sending them out only.  Specimens will be

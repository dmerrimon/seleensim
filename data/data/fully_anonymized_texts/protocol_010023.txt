PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_605379] whether and to what degree a  community -based karate class tailored for 
individuals with early - to middle -stage Parkinson’s Dise ase (PD) 1) is feasible; and 2) improves objective 
mobility and balance , 3) improves patient -reported outcomes  in mobility, balance, camaraderie, and 
overall wellbeing compared with individuals given a standard exercise prescription for PD . The benefits 
of exercise for general health and wellbeing in older adults are well -established. Balance exercises suc h 
as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training, can improve or maintain physical function in older 
adults and enhance muscle strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and 
improving cardiovascular and functional health. Non -contact [CONTACT_472218] a surge in popularity 
among individuals with PD, with components of both aerobic and balance exercise. While participants 
anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function, this has only been minimally studied. 
However, drawing on th e enthusiasm for boxing, literature surrounding aerobic and balance exercise in 
PD, and the combined aerobic, balance, and mindfulness practices that comprise karate, we 
hypothesize d that participation in structured karate programs may offer s imilar or greater benefits  than 
any of the individual components above . In particular, the aerobic, resistance, and balance aspects of 
karate may be beneficial for physical and cognitive wellbeing, and the mindfulness exercise may improve 
overall wellbeing . Therefore, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 10 week -long study of a structured karate exercise 
program for people with early to middle PD  during the summer and early fall of 2018. In this single -arm 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (no control participants) , we assessed mobility, gait, balan ce, falls, attention, quality of life, patient -
reported global impression of ch ange, and mood  before and after the 10 weeks of karate. Among 15  
participants completing 10 weeks of twice -weekly classes, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_472200]: 
adherence was high (mean attendance 87% of 20 classes), 100% of participants indicated interest in 
continuing karate classes, and 100% would recommend the program to other individuals with PD, 
respectively. Additionally, participants experienced a statistically and clinically significant improvement 
in quality of life, as measured by [CONTACT_328162]’s Disease Questionnaire -Short Form (PDQ -8), with mean 
scores improving from 25.3 to 19.3 (p <0.01) , significant improvements in measures of working memory 
and executive fun ction, and a trend toward improvement in the Timed Up and Go mobility measure (9.[ADDRESS_605380] -intervention, p = 0.12). Further data analysis —including 
qualitative analysis --is underway.  
Based on these promising results fr om the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], w e are therefore proposing the next step in this line of 
research, namely, a randomized, controlled trial of a structured karate intervention for individuals with 
PD.  Individuals will receive a one -time, in -person training in best practices for exercise in P D. Due to 
both the capacity of the karate classes and the scientific approach to detecting changes in PD, subjects  
will be randomly assigned into  either Arm 1 : immediate participation in the karate class or Arm 2:  
participation in usual ex ercise for six months followed by [CONTACT_472219]. For participants 
in Arm [ADDRESS_605381] six months of classes, subjects may choose to continue their participation in 
karate and in the study, though this will require paying membershi p fees at the dojo  (karate studio) . For 
participants in Arm [ADDRESS_605382] six 
months of classes.   
 
 We hypothesize: 1) Subjects will show improved mobility after 6-months of twice weekly karate classes,  
as measured by [CONTACT_472220] & Go  (TUG)1 and MDS -UPDRS motor subscore ; 2) The majority of 
subjects will report a positive change from baseline in their overall wellbeing, as measured by a 
response of “very much improved”, “m uch improved” or “minimally improved” on the Patient Global 
Impression of Change Scale (PGIC)2 followin g 6 months  of classes; 3) Feasibility will be high, as measured 
by >75% attendance rate and a response of “yes” to either “Would you recommend this program to 
someone else with PD?” or “If available, would you continue to participate in this or a similar karate 
class?”  
 
Exploratory outcomes will include change in anxiety and depression, as measured by [CONTACT_80826][INVESTIGATOR_70505] (HADS)3, cognition as m easured by [CONTACT_105645] 
4and measures of attention such as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Digit Span Test 
(DST)3. Additionally, we will assess change in group cohesion or camaraderie using the Physical Activity 
Group Environment Questionnaire (PAGEQ) . Finally, we will offer instrumented gait analysis to all 
participants at bas eline, 6 months, and 12 months, however this component is optional for participants.  
I.b. Background  
Parkinson’s Disease, the second most common neurodegenerative condition5 presents a significant 
health concern  and the progressive, incurable course of the disease impacts functional abilities of the 
patient and quality of life for both the patient and caregivers . Exercise is an established supplement to 
pharmacologic  PD treatment and various modalities have demon strated benefits in gait, balance, PD 
symptoms, and quality of life  measurements .6,7,[ADDRESS_605383] for participants .9,10 A notable trial compared resis tance training, 
stretching and tai chi interventions among Parkinson’s patients and while both the res istance and tai chi 
arms showed improvements on multiple measures of physical ability, tai chi demonstrated a 
significantly greater impact in measures of balance and postural stability .[ADDRESS_605384], PD -focused boxing class that has garnered national media attention.  Anecdotal reports of the 
benefits of these vigorous, goal oriented,  exercise classes are numerous; however, it has been minimally 
studied from the academic perspective. A case series describing six patients attending Rock Steady 
boxing classes reported at least some improvement in gait, balance, activities of daily living, and quality 
of life .[ADDRESS_605385] therapy in PD has not yet been investigated, although one study 
reports improvements in cognitive speed and subjective mental health among healthy older adults 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_605386] s will attend a baseline study visit at Rush University Medical Center. At that time, the 
study logistics will be reviewed, informed consent process will occur, and each subjec t will complete 
brief, individual pre -intervention assessments including a demographic and medical history 
questionnaire, followed by [CONTACT_472221] , gait, and balance  (instrumented Timed up 
and Go, I-TUG ; instrumented [ADDRESS_605387] ), PD -specific 
clinical characteristics (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale , MDS -
UPDRS ), overall cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), executive function and attention 
(digit span test, DST, and symbol digit modality test, SDMT), anxiety and depression (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56106], HADS) , physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ)  and 
quality of life (PDQ -8). Instrumented  gait analysis wil l be performed to gather more detailed data on 
stride length and velocity, number of steps to turn, turn duration, and postural sway.[ADDRESS_605388] 
will be asked to identify their preference for karate studio (dojo) location: Roscoe Village,  Evanston, 
Glenview, Park Ridge, or Wilmette.  
Once all subjects have completed the objective and subjective baseline assessments, the  baseline visit 
will continue with a one-time, in -person , group  training highlight ing current research on the benefits of 
exercise  for PD. This training will be delivered by [CONTACT_472222][INVESTIGATOR_472201] -based recommendations for  safe and effective  exercise 
programs  for individuals with early to middl e stage PD. Participants will leave the training with printed, 
publicly available materials on exercise for PD as references.  
 
After the training, e ligible subjects  will be grouped by [CONTACT_472223], and randomized 1:1 within each 
dojo into Arm 1 : immedi ate participation in six months of twice -weekly karate classes, or Arm 2:   usual 
exercise  for six months. After six months, Arm 1  participants  may opt to pay for dojo membership and 
continue classes, and Arm 2 participants will crossover and begin six mont hs of twice -weekly karate 
classes. Only the Research Coordinator  will know which subjects belong  to Arm 1 and Arm 2 , and she/he 
will deliver all study -related communication  to the subjects .  
 
The karate classes have been  specifically designed for individuals with early - to middle -stage PD, focused 
on incorporating upper and lower limb mov ements in multiple directions, increasing awareness 
throughout the body, shifting body weight and rotation, relaxation of the muscles, improving reaction 
time, usi ng complex repetitive actions to improve coordination, footwork training and centered weight 
shifts to help with fall prevention , and striking shields for self -defense and stress relief. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_472202], and will be available and 
responsive to any questions or concerns throughout the course of the study. The structure of the [ADDRESS_605389] misses a class, they may 
choose to make up a class at one of the other dojo locations.  
 
Every two months, subjects in  both  Arm s will receive an online link to report their attendance at classes , 
indicate whether their PD medication regimen has changed (as a potential confound er), and complete 
the IPAQ,  HADS, and PDQ -8. In addition, the survey will contain the Physical Activity Group Environment 
Questionnaire ( PAGEQ ) to measure camaraderie,  and Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGIC ) for the 
subject’s global impression of ch ange. The online survey will be delivered through a secure online 
database called Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).  The purpose of the online surveys is to 
track adherence to karate classes, adherence to other walking/moderate/vigorous activity, q uality of 
life, anxiety, depression, global impression of change, and group cohesion.  
 
After  six months , participants in both arms  will have a  second in -person  study visit  in which the pre -
intervention assessments  will be re -administered  (MDS -UPDRS, TUG, IPAQ, MoC A, PDQ -8, HADS , SDMT, 
DST, and instrumented gait analysis ), along with the PAGEQ and PGIC . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators 
performing the MDS -UPDRS will be blinded to subjects’ assignments. Following completio n of all 
assessments, without the blinded raters present, all participants will be reminded to continue 
completing the bimonthly online surveys over the upcoming six months, and the Research Coordinator  
will explain to  Arm 2 on the crossing over  process  into the active intervention (karate classes) , and 
participants will be provided with information on the timing and location of classes . Individuals in Arm [ADDRESS_605390] six months of classes ; PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigators will not be present during the focus group in order to preserve the blind . Subjects will be 
prompted to share their thoughts on how the intervention impacted their overall wellbeing, balance, 
and mindfulness; whether the intervention a chieved their expectations; whether they intend to 
continue, and what feedback they would like to provide .  
 
After twelve months, participants in both arms will have a third in -person study visit * in which the pre -
intervention assessments will be re -admini stered ( medication regimen, MDS -UPDRS, TUG, IPAQ, MoCA, 
PDQ -8, HADS, SDMT, DST, and instrumented gait analysis), along with the PAGEQ and PGIC. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21547]-investigators performing the MDS -UPDRS will remain blinded to subjects’ assignments. Following 
com pletion of all assessments, all subjects will be asked to stay and participate in a brief focus group to 
reflect on the entire study. Given the number of subjects, study staff may divide the group into Arm [ADDRESS_605391] the opportunity to speak ; again, PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators performing ratings will not be 
present to preserve blinding . The script for both groups will be identical.  
 
*Covid -19 Procedures for 12 month study visits:  
Remaining 12 -month data assessments will be administered electronically. Treatment, HADS, IPAQ, 
PDQ -8, Attendance and Camaraderie, Global Impression of Change, & Post -Intervention questionnaires 
will be administered over the phone a nd/or video call. UPDRS will be administered over video call. 
Cognitive test DST will be administered over the phone. Necessary visual components for the cognitive 
tests SDMT and MoCA will be emailed to participants to complete and return, and the remainde r of 
these assessments will be administered over the phone. Study team will directly enter all data into 
REDCap.  
 
Expanding on work begun in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_472203] a n associate  
professor of Cinema and Television Arts from Columbia College Chicago, IL to develop a documentary to 
educate others about karate as an interactive form of exercise and its potential benefits on the 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/2020   
 symptoms and quality of life of people with PD. To captu re the group ’s journey, portions of the karate 
classes and study visit  focus group s will be videotaped. For a more in -depth look, 2-[ADDRESS_605392], ages 30 -90, living in Chicago, and with 
Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stage 1 (unilateral symptoms, no balance issues), stag e 2 (bilateral symptoms, no 
balance issues), or stage 3 (bilateral symptoms, some postural or balance involvement). Subjects must 
be able to ambulate independently (i.e., they must not require the use of an assistive device or a care 
partner to ambulate).  
 
II. Characteristics of the Research Population  
II.a. Number of Subjects  
Total Number of Subjects : 52; 26 in Arm 1, 2 6 in Arm 2, assuming up to 25% drop -out.  
Our sample size calculation  (see table below) is based on  the results from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_472204]. We powered our original study based on existing literature, in 
which the mean TUG score for individuals with PD is 14.[ADDRESS_605393] a difference of 2 seconds with 90% 
power, how ever this may not be plausible (i.e., 9 seconds may be close to the limit of how quickly 
anyone can complete the TUG task). If, however, participants have a more modest baseline to start, 
which may be expected when recruiting more broadly than at a tertiar y referral center, we yield the 
second half of the table below. Here, we are extrapolating a baseline mean TUG of 12.5 with SD 4.0 
(between our pi[INVESTIGATOR_472205]); with 19 individuals per arm, we would be 90% 
powered to detect a 3s dif ference between pre - and post -intervention TUG.  
If we assume up to 25% attrition in this group of older adults with a chronic neurodegenerative disease, 
particularly in a longitudinal study over six months, we need to enroll 5 2 individuals (2 6 per arm) to  yield 
a total of [ADDRESS_605394] data.  
II.e. Inclusion Criteria for All Subjects:  
1. Each subject must be between [ADDRESS_605395] may be of either gender, any 
race/ethnicity.  
2. Subjects will be those diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease by a treating healthcare provider  
a. If the subject is seen at Rush University Medical Center, this will be verified via chart review.  
b. If the subject is seen elsewhere, he or she will be asked to have their healthcare provider  
sign a form confirming the diagnosi s of Parkinson’s Disease and indicating th at the patient 
can ambulate independently as of  the most recent visit , to be sent back to the Research 
Coordinator  for eligibility verification . 
3. English speaking.  
4. Living within the Chicago area.  
5. Subjects may be untreated for Parkinson’s Disease, or may be taking any individual PD medication or 
combination thereof. Subjects may or may not have had Deep Brain Stimulation. Subjects may or 
may not be receiving physical or occupational therapy. Subject s will be encouraged to maintain their 
same medication regimen throughout the duration of the study, however if issues arise requiring 
medication changes, the subject will be prompted to indicat e medication changes in the bimonthly 
online survey, and will not be disqualified  from study participation .  
 
II.f. Exclusion Criteria for  All Subjects  
1. Subjects requiring an assistive device (cane, walker, wheelchair) or the assistance of another person 
in order to ambulate . 
2. Subjects with active psychosis or exhibiti ng symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder.  
3. Subjects unable to commit to attending, or to travel to, two classes weekly for six months . 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_605396] 30 days.  
5. Subjects with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_116250], including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System 
Atrophy, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Corticobasal Syndrome, drug -induced parkinsonism, vascular 
parkinsonism, or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_472206] e specified, according to the referring 
healthcare provider .  
 
II.g. Vulnerable Subjects – This study will not include children, prisoners, and homeless persons.  The 
consent form will state that participation in our study will not affect their clinical care.  
III.   Methods and Procedures  
Study Visits  
Screening Phone Call 
Subjects who are interested in participating based on review of printed or electronic recruitment 
materials will be directed to contact [CONTACT_472224], who will provide them with 
information about the study and the opportunity to as k questions about it in detail; those who express 
continued interest in participation will be screened for eligibility and ability to attend the scheduled 
classes, held at one of the five Fonseca Martial Arts dojos in Glenview, Wilmette, Park Ridge, Evanst on, 
or Roscoe Village . Arm [ADDRESS_605397] from participating in either weekend/weekday daytime 
class es, or weekday/weekday evening class es, depending on their availability and proximity to each 
dojo’ s geographic location. Screening will occur on a rolling basis until the [ADDRESS_605398] will be individually visited by a member of the study team 
to review and sign the informed consent form (ICF). No reconsenting will be necessary because Phase I 
participants will not be eligible to participate in Phase II, with the exception of participants who 
withdrew early from Phase I, who may enroll in Phase II  provided that their reason for withdrawal no 
longer applies and these individuals will need to be newly consented with the Phase II consent 
document . 
 
Subjects will complete a brief demographic and health questionnaire, including duration of PD diagnosis 
in years, current medication regimen, baseline activity level, prior involvement with karate or other 
martial arts, number of falls in the past 12 months, and subjects will complete the Parkinson’s Disease 
Questionnaire -8 (PDQ -8)18, a brief, validated, PD -specific 8 -item measure of quality of life. Subjects will 
complete the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS). Subjects will also write  their response to 
the open -ended prompt, “What do you hope to achieve in this class?”  
 
Subjects will then meet with a study team member to complete the TUG  (see description below)  . 
Subjects will meet with another study team member to complete the MoCA, DST, and SDMT (cognitive 
testing). Next, the subject will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_472207] a private room  for the 
motor portion of the MDS -UPDRS  to test  bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural stability .   
 
  
 
Subjects will then proceed with the instrumented g ait, functional mobility and balance analysis .  
The use of body wearable inertial motion sensors is a relatively new paradigm in gait, functional mobility 
and balance analysis.  These portable systems allow  less costly, less time consuming and noninvasive 
testing in natural environments compared to traditional marker based approaches (which are conducted 
in gait laboratories).  Gait and functional mobility variables including sit to stand and turn to sit 
mea sures using this technology correlate highly with those obtained from traditional optical marker 
based motion analysis and forceplate approaches.   
The instrumented -Timed -Up and Go (i -TUG) and instrumented 2 minute walk (i -WALK) tests will be 
used for qua ntitative functional mobility and gait and turn analysis.   The TUG is an important functional 
gait and mobility task and is widely used clinically to determine fall risk. The TUG is also used for our 
power calculation in this study. The traditional TUG qua ntifies the time it takes to get up from a chair, 
walk [ADDRESS_605399] variability is an indicator of gait instability and fall risk. Stride length and stride velocity variability 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_472225].  Comprehensive gait 
and functional mobility analysis will be performed using the commercially available APDM Mobility Lab™ 
six inertial sensor system (APDMTM; Oregon).  This contains the instrumented Timed  up and Go (i -TUG) 
and instrumented WALK (i -WALK) plug -in that quantitate spatiotemporal aspects of gait, turning, sit to 
stand, and turn to sit while subjects are in their normal street clothing. These parameters are 
automatically calculated from previous  algorithms developed by [CONTACT_3455]. The sensors are 
attached via velcro straps at the midfoot, at the dorsum of the wrists, on the lumbar trunk at the level of 
L5, (approximate location of body center of mass) and on the upper trunk [ADDRESS_605400] performance.  Measured 
parameters include stride length, velocity, and  stride variability; stride length asymmetry, cadence, 
swing, stance, double limb support time; trunk rotation, turn duration, peak turn velocity, steps to turn; 
arm, lower leg, and trunk range of motion; peak shank and arm swing velocities, and any asymmetries in 
these parameters.  
 
The instrumented SWAY (i -SWAY) using one Opal APDM sensor described  above will be used to assess 
balance and postural sway.    Subjects will be ask to stand still with their hands across their chests and 
their feet positioned a set distance apart (scaled to their height) with the sensor applied to the lumbar 
trunk recordin g parameters including mean total sway area, path length, jerk, and sway distance in the 
mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.  Postural sway is assessed in standing under the following 
conditions for 30 seconds for each trial:  
1) Eyes open (EO) on a f irm support surface with the feet apart  
2) Eyes closed (EC) on a firm support surface with the feet apart.  
3) Eyes open (EO) on a foam support surface with the feet  apart  
4) Eyes closed (EC) on a foam support surface with the feet  apart  
 
Note that trials [ADDRESS_605401] the sensory systems (vision, proprioception, vestibular) that may be 
deficient and unable to allow for good postural control  in patients with neurological disorders, including 
PD.  The trials will be conducted in a non -random order from 1 -4 (in order of greater difficulty).  Subjects 
will be carefully monitored during all trials by [CONTACT_24478] -Investigator who is a Physical Therapis t and well 
trained in safe and accurate test administration; she will stand directly next to the subject during the 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_605402] and will also 
allow more accurate calculation of gait variability indices by [CONTACT_472226]; the subject 
will walk [ADDRESS_605403] 
twice weekly, and subjects will be required to attend their assigned class time/location , or make up 
missed classes at another dojo locati on, if possible . Each class will last approximately [ADDRESS_605404]’s name, not linked to their unique study ID; the attendance lo g will be shared  with the Research 
Coordinator  following the final class. The study staff will be available by [CONTACT_472227].  
 
Bimonthly online survey  
Using the  survey functionality of the HIPAA -secure, password -protected REDCap electronic database, all 
participants in both arms will automatically receive a personalized email every two months directing 
them to indicate how frequently they have attended karate cla sses (Arm 1) or how frequently they have 
engaged in exercise as discussed at the initial study visit (Arm 2), whether their PD medication regimen 
has changed (as a potential confounder), and complete the IPAQ, HADS, and PDQ -8. In addition, the 
survey will contain the Physical Activity Group Environment Questionnaire ( PAGEQ) to measure 
camaraderie, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) for the subject’s global impression of 
change.  
 
Six-month  study visit  
Following six months of classes for Arm 1, and six months of usual exercise for  Arm 2, the study team 
will contact [CONTACT_472228] a six -month study visit, consisting of a repeated TUG, HADS, PDQ -8, 
SDMT, DST , MoCa , medication regimen and falls questi onnaire, PAGEQ, PGIC , and MDS -UPDRS 
 
 examination . Each subject in Arm 1 will receive their initial response to the “What do you hope to 
achieve in this class?” prompt, and will be asked to reflect in a written, open -ended manner on whether 
they feel that th ey achieved their goal. Individuals in Arm 1 will be reminded that they may continue to 
attend karate classes, but the usual class fee per the dojo will no longer be waived. Individuals in Arm 2 
will be informed that they may now begin karate classes at th eir dojo of choice for the following six 
months. This 6 -month study visit is different than the 6 -month follow -up call that was part of the initial 
KICK OUT PD pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; this six -month study visit is conducted in person, not by [CONTACT_648], and involves 
retes ting of all of the measures from the initial, baseline visit. There will not be a [ADDRESS_605405] will receive their initial 
response to the “What do you hope to achieve in this class?” prompt, and will be asked to reflect in a 
written, open -ended manner on whether they feel that they achieved their goal.  In addition, subjects 
will indicate their response to the following questions regarding feasibility:  “Would you recommend this 
program to someone else with PD?” and “If available, would you continue to participate in this or a 
similar karate class?”  Following completion of all as sessments, all subjects will be asked to stay and 
participate in a brief focus group to reflect on the entire study. Given the number of subjects, study staff 
may divide the group into Arm [ADDRESS_605406] the opportunity to speak. The script for both groups will 
be identical.  
 
As noted above, due to the Covid -19 outbreak, r emaining 12 -month data assessments will be 
administered electronically for participants . Treatment, HADS, IPAQ, PDQ -8, Attendance and 
Camaraderie, Global Impression of Change, & Post -Intervention questionnaires will be administered 
over the phone and/or video call. UPDRS will be administered over video call. Cognitive test DST will be 
admini stered over the phone. Necessary visual components for the cognitive tests SDMT and MoCA will 
be emailed to participants to complete and return, and the remainder of these assessments will be 
administered over the phone. Study team will directly enter all data into REDCap.  
 
 
Documentary  
Portions of the karate classes  and [ADDRESS_605407] which means  subjects  will not participate in the in -depth video 
interviews , and they will not be included in individual or group video shots during the focus groups and 
karate classes.   
 
Assessments : Subjects who agree to be part of the study and sign the Informed Consent Form will be 
asked to complete a series of assessments to determine their current neurological  status and overall 
wellbeing . There is no known risk associated with participation in the se assessments , and they are a part 
of routine clinical care for these conditions . These tests are typi[INVESTIGATOR_472208]. Administration of these assessments may take up to [ADDRESS_605408] at the p re-
intervention study vis it, 6-month study visit, and 12 -month study visit. Administration of the bimonthly 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/2020   
 online survey assessments may take up to 20 minutes . All or some of the following assessments and self -
report measures may be administered but are not limited to:  
 
• Demograp hic/disease questionnaire:  This brief, one -page questionnaire will ask for the subject’s 
name, , age, gender, race, ethnicity, PD duration in years, prior exposure to karate or martial 
arts classes, baseline activity level, and number of falls in the past 12 months. There will be one 
open -ended question asking, “What do you hope to achieve in this class?”  
 
• Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HY): A system used for describing how Parkinson's symptoms progress 
and the relative level of disability. There are five stages: Stage 0 – No signs of disease; Stage 1 – 
Unilateral disease; Stage 1.5 – Unilateral plus axial involvement; Stage 2 – Bilateral disease, 
without impairment of balance; Stage 2.5 – Mild bilateral disease with recovery on pull test; 
Stage 3 – Mild to moderat e bilateral disease; some postural instability; physically independent; 
Stage 4 – Severe disability; still able to walk or stand unassisted; Stage 5 – Wheelchair bound or 
bedridden unless aided.19 
 
• Timed Up and Go (TUG) : A well -validated, brief measure of mobility. Administered by a study 
team member with a st opwatch who has previously measured out the distance between a 
standard arm chair and a taped line on the ground 10 feet (3 meters) away, subjects sit in a 
standard arm chair and are instructed that when the team member says “Go”, they should stand 
up from  the chair, walk at their normal pace to the line, turn, walk back to their chair at a 
normal pace, and sit down again. The study team member will record the TUG results in seconds 
using a stopwatch.  This is a recommended test of balance in PD.20    
 
Instrumented - Timed Up and Go (i -TUG):  study team member wil l follow same procedure as TUG  
described above . For the first trial, subjects will be instruc ted to walk 3 meters.  During the 
second trial, the distance between the arm chair and a taped line will be increased to 7 m eters . 
• Instrumented - WALK (i -WALK):  a test to examine fatigue over time and will also allow  more 
accurate calculation of gait variability indices by  [CONTACT_472226]. T he subject will 
walk 25 meters, turn and walk back, and repeat this until 2 minutes has elapsed.  
 
• Instrumented - SWAY (i -SWAY):  a test to assess balance and postural sway. Subjects will be ask ed 
to stand still with their hands across their chests and their feet positioned a set distance apart 
(scaled to their height) with the APDM sensor applied to the lumbar trunk recording param eters 
including mean total sway area, path length, jerk, and sway distance in the mediolateral and 
anteroposterior directions.   
 
 
 
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS):  Brief, 14 -item highly validated scale for 
measuring anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items), where scores of >8 for either anxiety or 
depression indicate probable symptoms .3 The HADS was selected due to its use in prior peer 
mentoring studies and strong psychometric profile  
 
• Modified Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( MDS -UPDRS) : The motor subscale will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_179167] , assessing rigidity, resting /postural/intention  tremor, 
 
 bradykinesia , gait, and balance .  
 
• Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa):  a screening instrument designed to help health 
professionals detect mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses numerous cognitive  domains: 
attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, 
conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.  
 
• Patient Glo bal Impression of Change (PGIC) : This single -item rating scale asks subjects  to rate 
their overall response to the intervention using a 7 -point rating scale, with the options of “very 
much improved”, “much improved”, “minimally improved”, “no change”, “minimally worse”, 
“much worse” and “very much worse”. Recommendations for asses sing importance of this scale 
include reporting the percentages of subjects endorsing each of the 7 response options.  
 
• Physical Activity Group Environment Questionnaire ( PAGEQ):  a measure  of group cohesion used 
in sports psychology. This conceptual model  of cohesion  is a modified version of the GEQ (Group 
Environment Questionnaire) . PAGEQ  is divided into two levels of perceptions: an individual’s 
perspective of a group as a whole (collective) and an individual ’s attraction to a group  
(personal). These two levels are further defined by  [CONTACT_472229] . All these components 
are categorized into four constructs: Group Integration -Social (GI -S), Group Integration -Task (GI -
T), Individual Attractions to the Group -Social (ATG -S), and Individual Attractions  to the Group -
Task (ATG -T). 
 
• Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire - Short Form (PDQ -8): A validated and shortened version of 
the PDQ -39, with 8 items each representing one domain of the PDQ -39, also with a summary 
index score standardized to a scale of 0 -100, with higher scores signifying worse quality of life; 
this scale is recommended for use in PD by [CONTACT_340196].  
 
• Symbol Digit Modalities Test:  This uses a reference key while the examinee has [ADDRESS_605409]. Norms for adults are separated by [CONTACT_472230].  
 
• Digit Span Test:  This tests the number of digits a person can absorb and recall in correct serial 
order after hearing them or seeing them. Here the person has to remember a small amount of 
information for a relatively short time, and the order of recall is i mportant. To test the auditory 
digit s pan of a person, the administrator says numbers slowly in one second intervals, in a 
monotone vo ice. For example, the administrator  will say [ADDRESS_605410] the person repeat it 
back in the order it was given or the r everse order. If the person is able to say a 4 digit sequence 
back correctly 75% of the time on the first try, it will be considered a short term memory of 4, 
and is the same for each higher digit. The average in our society for a seven -year old to adult i s 
7. 
 
III.b. Data Analysis and Data Monitoring  
 
Oversight of the data will be maintained by [CONTACT_079]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_472209]: Jori Fleisher, MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/2020   
 review study procedures annually and report any concerns in the IRB continuation application. This is a 
Level I, Low, Minimal Risk study; therefore, there is minimal risk of unanticipated problems with the 
exception of breaches in confidentiality. The data for the study will be entered into a secured database 
using an electronic d ata capture program, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).[ADDRESS_605411] will be updated annually . Breaches of 
confidentiality will be reported to the IRB immediately with the “Reportable Event/Unanti cipated 
Problem Form.”   
 
Data will be exported from REDCap in de -identified format for statistical analysis, with all PHI stripped 
from the dataset prior to analysis by [CONTACT_657].  We will summarize categorical variables by 
[CONTACT_22977] a nd will assess continuous variables for normality, summarized by 
[CONTACT_8477]/standard deviation, or median/interquartile range. We will report the basic descriptive statistics 
of the cohort, including baseline demographics, TUG , MDS -UPDRS, HADS,  PDQ -8, IPAQ, SDMT , MoCa , 
and DST . We will report on attendance, defined as the percentage of classes attended , in each arm once 
active . We will analyze the change in TUG, MDS -UPDRS, HADS, PDQ -8, IPAQ, SDMT, DST,  MoCa,  and 
PAGEQ  respectively, from baseline to six months, comparing Arm 1 and 2 (active vs. control), and again 
at twelve months to determine whether longer participation yields additional benefits, using paired t-
tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon sign rank test s, as appropriate. We will rep ort on the percentage of 
subjects endorsing each of the 7 PGIC response options  at six and twelve months, between Arms, 
respectively . We will report the descriptive statistics concerning whether subjects’ individual predefined 
goal for the class was achiev ed (binary outcome), and will present de -identified qualitative comments 
noted in the feedback at the study visit focus groups . We will report descriptive statistics on continued 
interest and likelihood of recommending the program to someone else with PD. We will analyze 
descriptive statistics on continued involvement in karate/martial arts, and will again report the 
percentage of subjects endorsing each PGIC response option.  
 
The qualitative data from the study visit focus groups  will be audio -recorded an d transcribed, with all 
identifying information stripped from the transcripts. Once transcribed, the audio recordings will be 
destroyed. The qualitative data will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach to identify pertinent 
themes, with data stored a s password -protected files behind the Rush firewall, accessible only to study 
staff.  
 
All v ideo footage will be the sole property of the PI. Videos will have identifying information (i.e. image 
of patient’s face, first name). Video files will be stored an d password -protected behind the Rush and the 
Columbia firewall s. The video along with the data collected from the focus groups and karate classes 
may be used as part of the diss emination of the study results  and for educational purposes.  
 
The PI, co -investigators, and/or study staff will review all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for 
data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance.  To maintain blinding, the Research 
Coordinator  will maintain a codesheet linking the subject ID numbers and subject names, which will be 
password -protected. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_472210] a safety concern. The data will be 
reviewed on a quarterly basis:  
• Subject accrual (including compliance with enrollment criteria)  
• Statu s of all enrolled subjects  
• Adherence data regarding study visits and procedures  
 
 
 Safety data (AEs and SAEs) will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_472211]’s regulations. Any significant findings (i .e. protocol deviations) will be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with requirements and will be documented accordingly.  
III.c. Data Storage and Confidentiality   
All subjects will be assigned unique ID numbers. All research data files will be stored at the Rush 
University Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Program  in secured file cabinets , including hard 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_20569], informed consent forms a nd informed consent documentation checklists . 
Data will be entered into a secured database (REDCap). The database will be stored on a secure 
password -protected server and not on individual desktop computers. The code sheet will be password 
protected and th e password will be updated annually . Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_472212]. Signed informed consent forms, containing subj ect names, will be stored 
separately in the regulatory binder, which will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the PI’s office. Class 
attendance records will be maintained using name [INVESTIGATOR_13701], not subject ID, by [CONTACT_472231]. These 
records will then be given to the Research Coordinator  following the final class, who will then link the 
attendance information with the subjects’ data using the code sheet. A ttendance infor mation will be 
entered into REDCap . Subject records will be kept for ten years in accord ance  with  Rush policy , after 
which time, the hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/source documents will be destroyed, and the database will remain in its 
electronic format but with identifying information removed, anonymizing th e data.  
 
Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_472213] . 
Data will be stored in a format suitable for research inquiries by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_472214] a retrospective manner for other Rush -based research studies. If a particular researcher/collaborator 
has an interest in a study population, then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_472215](s) will then be contact[CONTACT_426] a 
member of this study team whom the subject has already met to see if they are interested in 
participating in the particular study. If a participant is interested, he or she will be referred to th at Rush 
study team and will be scheduled for a  separate consent procedure with the individual Rush researcher 
for that particular study and at that point the participant can choose whether to participate or not in 
that particular study. The results of the Karate for PD  study may be published in a book , journal, and 
other media or used for teaching purposes. However, all published data will be made anonymous.  
 
IV. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
IV.a. Risk 
There are no known risks from participating in neurological or neuropsychological tests. Subjects may 
experience mild boredom or cognitive fatigue; however, most individuals with like symptoms find the 
tests interesting and are able to tolerate up to two -hour duration of testing well. There is, however, a 
risk of falls or injury associated with participation in any exercise, including karate, for which subjects 
assume the risk and liability as they would with participation in any voluntary exercise activity . The risks 
will be minimized to the extent possible by 1) having all instructors undergo basic instruction in 
principles of PD by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_472216]; 2) having all classes held at quieter times in the dojo, so 
as to avoid overcrowding and ris ks of falls or freezing of gait in crowded, busy situations; 3) having small 
instructor to subject ratios to allow for maximal supervision and guidance ; 4) having study staff available 
by [CONTACT_472232] .  
 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_472197], MD MSCE    Version date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_605412]’s  image may be captured . However full names will not be used during interviews with the 
subjects who agree to answer questions about their experiences with the ka rate classes.  
 
IV.b. Potential Benefit to Subjects  
 
Potential benefits to subj ects include the following: 1) cognitive and physical improvements i n PD 
symptoms related to both vigorous physical activity and mindful exercise ; 2) benefits of mindful exercise  
on quality of life ; 3) the enjoyment of participating in a new a ctivity in a social environment with other 
individuals with PD; 3)  the satis faction of learning a new skill; 4) the knowledge that by [CONTACT_114363], 
subjects are contributing to the understan ding of how karate impacts individuals with PD ; 5) the 
altruistic benefit of contributing to the development of a fun, novel intervention for themselves and  
potentially others . Additional benefits include the opportunity to be active in the community and f orm 
relationships with peers. The positive effects on subjects with PD also have the potential to impact the 
wellbeing of their  families and caregivers , as this karate class offers a new option for fun, therapeutic 
activity. The potential benefits to socie ty include furthering the involvement of individuals with chronic 
diseases in community activities and the potential physical benefits may help modify the disease 
progress for the many affected by [CONTACT_4002].  
 
V.  Subject Identification, Recruitment, and Consent/Assent  
V.a. Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Individuals will be recruited via posted fliers, print and electronic newsletter postings, and social media 
postings from the Rush University Par kinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Program, electronic 
newsletter postings in the Rush University Medical Center Research Newsletter, Rush clinical trials 
website, via electronic and printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_472217]  ([ADDRESS_605413] Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE])  including the departments of Neurological Sciences, 
Neurosurgery, Geriatrics, Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Psychiatry, Physical Medicine and 
Rehabilitation, and other relevant departments caring for people with PD; Rush Oak Park Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  ([ADDRESS_605414] Oak Park, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , Northwestern University  ([ADDRESS_605415] Abbott Hall, 11th Fl 
Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , University of Chicago  ([ADDRESS_605416] MC 2030 Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , University 
of Illinois -Chicag o ([ADDRESS_605417] Ste 4E Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
([ADDRESS_605418] Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center  ([ADDRESS_605419] North Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  ([ADDRESS_605420] Hines, IL [ZIP_CODE]) , Evanston 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( [ADDRESS_605421]. , Evanston, IL [ZIP_CODE]), Glenbrook Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([ADDRESS_605422] , Glenview, 
IL  [ZIP_CODE] ), Highland Park Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( [ADDRESS_605423] , Highland Park, IL [ZIP_CODE]), Skokie Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([ADDRESS_605424] , Skokie, IL [ZIP_CODE]) including general neurologists and movement disorder specialists. 
Information will be disseminated to PD patients at monthly support group meetings and other 
educational and research fairs , in-person and via emailed recruitment fliers , as opportunities  arise. 
Information will also be sent to all Chicago senior centers, Area Agencies on Aging, AARP Illinois , and 
libraries and recreation centers near each dojo . Recruitment fliers will be shared with the Parkinson 
Foundation for possible distribution through their electronic newsletters and social media avenues to 
increase reach to other potential subject s throughout the Chicago area. We will also post to 
clinicaltrials.gov within [ADDRESS_605425] will be individually visited  by a member of the study team to review the informed 
consent form (ICF) , engage in capacity assessment as described below, and assuming capacity, sign the 
ICF, witnessed by [CONTACT_118734] . The study team member will complete an ICF documentation 
checklist, as well.   
 
V.c. Subject Capacity  
Capacity to consent will be assessed by [CONTACT_472233]/or the PI. 
Throughout the consent process, the study staff member will assess the participant’s comprehension by 
[CONTACT_472234] e consent form particularly the sections 
of the consent form that explains that they are being asked whether they agree to be contact[CONTACT_472235], as well as aspects of the consent form that explain the inclusion of PHI in the database, 
how their confidentiality will be protected, and how their data will be stored for future use.   Subject’s 
capacity is not expected to fluctuate significantl y during the 6-months  of the study, and would not be 
expected to be significantly impaired in early to middle stage PD.  
During the consent process, subjects will have the opportunity to indicate whether they wish to be 
contact[CONTACT_472236] e studies conducted by [CONTACT_472237] . 
Subjects who agree to participate in the program will also have an opportunity to authorize having their 
Personal History Information (PHI) shared with our collaborators. PHI data will NOT  be shared unless 
written authorization is obtained from the subject. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed IRB 
approved Informed Consent Form for their future reference.   Signed consent forms will be stored in a 
locked cabinet in the PI’s office at  Rush , separate from the study data.   
V.d. Debriefing Procedures  
 
Subjects  will be debriefed about the aims and study hypotheses following administration of all study 
procedures .  This will occur after the end of the intervention in order to avoid introdu cing bias into 
subjects’ responses to questions .  
 
V.e. Documentation of Consent   
 
A Consent Process Documentation Form will be included in the subjects ’ research chart that will 
document the informed consent process that took place.   
 
V.f. Costs  to the Subject  
  
Subjects will not receive any inducements before, or  rewards or compensation (i.e. c ash, taxi fares, 
medical care, gifts, etc.) after the study.  Subjects will be provided with a traditional uniform for class. 
Subjects will be provided with a parking validation voucher for each study visit. There will be no other 
costs to subjects associated with participation in this study  for the first 6 -months of classes; if individuals 
in Arm 1 opt to continue participating in karate classes beyond six months, they will need to pay the 
membership fee at the dojo .

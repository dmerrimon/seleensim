Node-negative disease with tumor [ADDRESS_319673] similar 
relative risk reduction for these tumors (approximately 50%) as seen in the overall study 
population.  Because the absolute benefit of trastuzumab for low-risk HER2-positive 
tumors remains unknown, the role of trastuzumab in patients with small, node-negative 
tumors remains controversial.  Current consensus guidelines from the NCCN do not 
recommend adjuvant trastuzumab for tumors <1 cm in size, owing to the lack of data for 
safety and efficacy in this patient population (see www.nccn.org).  Based on historical 
experience, it is reasonable to expect that the absolute benefit of chemotherapy and 
trastuzumab is more modest in node-negative breast cancer, as these tumors have in 
general a better prognosis and thus lower gains with adjuvant therapy.  Thus, the decisions 
to use adjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as anthracyclines and taxanes, and the use 
of adjuvant trastuzumab, may be informed by [CONTACT_262942].  In clinical practice, 
oncologists have taken many different approaches in this group of women.  While some 
have held back on treatment entirely, others have given chemotherapy alone, adriamycin 
and cytoxan (AC) followed by [CONTACT_30522] (H), AC followed by [CONTACT_262943] (AC-TH), docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (T 2CH), or paclitaxel and 
trastuzumab (TH).
This trial is designed to characterize the clinical course of women with small, node 
negative breast cancer who are treated with a uniform trastuzumab-containing regimen. 
The inclusion criteria specifically target women who were generally not eligible for 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319674] adjuvant trastuzumab trials administered trastuzumab for 52 weeks of treatment.  The 
small but provocative FinHER trial included only 232 patients, but administered only 9 
weeks of trastuzumab paired with taxane therapy.  This study demonstrated relative risk 
reduction of >50% for the use of trastuzumab, suggesting indirectly that concurrent taxane-
trastuzumab therapy can be effective treatment for early stage breast cancer and is superior 
to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy given in the absence of trastuzumab. Preliminary 
analyses of NCCTG N9831 suggest that concurrent use of taxane-trastuzumab therapy is 
superior to sequential use, further justifying a combination treatment program.
The most worrisome toxicity of adjuvant trastuzumab is congestive heart failure and 
cardiomyopathy, which arises in 2-4% of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab and 
anthracyclines (see Table below).  Limited clinical experience suggests a substantially 
lower risk of cardiomyopathy (on the order of 1%) for patients receiving non-anthracycline 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab.  In an attempt to potentially reduce toxicity, while 
maintaining efficacy, weekly paclitaxel therapy was selected as the agent of choice to be 
administered with trastuzumab therapy.  Paclitaxel has been shown to be efficacious in 
standard combination chemotherapy regimens in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings.  
While anthracyclines have been shown to be effective in the treatment of HER2-positive 
breast cancer, we believe that the potential cardiac toxicity that may result from 
administration of both an anthracycline and trastuzumab would outweigh the benefits in 
this lower-risk population.

small, node-negative HER2-positive breast cancer. 
3.[ADDRESS_319675] Cancer
Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20-25% of all breast cancers.[ADDRESS_319676] cancers express hormone 
receptors for estrogen and/or progesterone, they may be relatively resistant to tamoxifen.[ADDRESS_319677] cancer, its mechanism of action is not 
clear.  It is thought that trastuzumab binds to the HER2 protein, resulting in apoptosis, 
down-regulation of surface HER2 expression, and alteration of downstream signaling.

Page 9 of 913.3 Testing for HER2 Overexpression
Initial clinical trials were performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine 
which patients had HER2-positive breast cancer.  This test measures HER2 protein levels 
on the cell surface, to determine HER2-positivity in breast cancer specimens.  IHC scoring 
is performed by a pathologist on a subjective basis.  HER2 immunostaining is graded as 0, 
1+, 2+, or 3+ based on the percentage of malignant cells stained and the degree of 
membrane staining present in these malignant cells.7 Two types of IHC tests are approved 
by [CONTACT_1622]: HerceptTest (Dako, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_13384], CA) and PATHWAY (Ventana Medical 
Systems, Inc, Tucson, AZ).
More recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been developed to identify 
patients with HER2-positive tumors.  This test directly measures HER2 gene amplification.  
Three types of FISH tests are approved by [CONTACT_1622]: PathyVysion (Vysis Inc, Downers 
Grove, IL; 2.0 ratio HER2:CEP17 considered amplified), INFORM (Ventana Medical 
Systems Inc; ;  5.0 gene copi[INVESTIGATOR_262917]2 considered amplified), and HER2 FISH pharmDx 
(Dako; 2.0 ratio HER2:CEN-17 considered amplified).
A strongly HER2-positive tumor is associated with the most clinical benefit from 
trastuzumab.  Subgroup analysis in a large phase III trial showed that patients with IHC 3+ 
tumors experienced significant improvement in all clinical outcomes with trastuzumab 
therapy, however, the benefit in patients with IHC 2+ tumors was minimal.[ADDRESS_319678] of trastuzumab 
therapy.  When local and central evaluation used the same methodology, concordance was 
88.1% for FISH and 81.6% for IHC.7 Furthermore, the IHC 2+ category is the most likely 
to be discordant with FISH HER2 status.  In comparing FISH with HercepTest in central 
laboratories, agreement rates between FISH and IHC were 97% for IHC 0, 93% for IHC 
1+, 24% for IHC 2+, and 89% for IHC3+.[ADDRESS_319679] cancer.10 
Both trials enrolled patients with node-positive disease.  N-9831 also enrolled patients with 
high-risk node-negative disease, defined as ER- or PR-positive with tumor size >2cm or 
ER- and PR-negative with tumor size >1cm.  Node-negative patients represented 0.1% of 
all patients on this study.  Due to similar eligibility and treatment protocols, the decision 
was made to perform a combined analysis.  The NSABP B-31 compared doxorubicin 60 
mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_114461]

Page 10 of 91trastuzumab, and the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab initiated concomitantly 
with paclitaxel.  Because trastuzumab was not given concurrently in the second arm, this 
arm was not included in the overall analysis.  Overall, there were 1,736 patients in the B-31 
trial and 1,615 patients in N-9831, and at the time of the combined analysis, the median 
follow-up was 2.0 years.  Compared with the control arm, the trastuzumab arm showed a 
statistically signficant increase in 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), 75.4% vs 87.1% 
respectively, p<0.0001; and a significant increase in overall survival (OS), 91.7% vs 
94.3%.   The cumulative incidence of class III or IV heart failure was 0.8% in the control 
group and 4.1% in the trastuzumab group.  
The HERA (Herceptin Adjuvant) trial focused on determining the optimal duration of 
trastuzumab for early-stage breast cancer.11 Patients were randomized to one of three arms: 
observation, trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 1 year, or trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 2 
years.  Trastuzumab was dosed with 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks 
thereafter.  Patients had either node-negative disease if tumor size >1cm (32.1%) or node-
positive disease, and all patients had HER2-positive tumors.  At a median follow-up of 2 
years, the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a 
statistically signficant improvement in DFS (86.1% vs 78%) and overall survival (96.9% vs 
93.6%).  Further analysis is expected to determine if 2 years is superior to a year of 
treatment.  
The BCIRG 006 trial aimed at maximizing the efficacy of trastuzumab while minimizing 
cardiac toxicity.12 The trial enrolled 3,222 patients with node-positive or high-risk lymph 
node-negative HER2-positive tumors to 1 of 3 arms: doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_222892] 3 weeks for 4 cycles (ACT); or the same 
regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab,weekly during chemotherapy then every 3 weeks 
during follow-up (ACTH); or docetaxel-carboplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles plus 52 
weeks of trastuzumab with the same schedule as given in arm 2 (TCH). At a [ADDRESS_319680] Conference, the 2 trastuzumab arms 
showed a statistically significant improvement in DFS compared with the control arm. 
Symptomatic cardiac events and an LVEF decline >15% were statistically significantly 
greater in the ACTH group compared with the ACT.  There was no statistically significant 
difference between the ACT and TCH groups in terms of cardiac side-effects.  This trial 
shows that fewer cardiac events are observed when trastuzumab is administered without 
prior anthracycline-based therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in terms 
of disease free survival across the two trastuzumab-containing arms.  A recent trial in the 
metastatic setting revealed that carboplatin does not improve response rates, time to 
progression, or overall response rate when added to docetaxel and trastuzumab.[ADDRESS_319681] 
certainly associated with less cardiotoxicity.  In patients at lower risk of recurrence, 
toxicity associated with adjuvant therapy becomes a major concern.
The FinHer trial involved 1,010 patients randomized to docetaxel every 3 weeks for three 
doses versus 9 weeks of vinorelbine followed, in both groups, by [CONTACT_262944], epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and fluoruracil (CEF).14   The 232 patients found to be

Paclitaxel has been compared to FAC (5-FU, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in the 
neoadjuvant setting.22 Patients with T1-3, N0-1 disease were randomized to receive either 
paclitaxel (250 mg/m2) as a 24-hour infusion or FAC every 3 weeks.  Each patient 
received 4 cycles of preoperative therapy, and the extent of residual disease at the time of 
surgery was similar between the two arms.
A recent trial compared nonanthracycline adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) 
to doxorubicine and cyclophosphamide (AC) as adjuvant chemotherapy for women with 
operable breast cancer.23  In this study, 1016 patients were randomized to AC or TC given 
every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  At a median follow-up of 66 months, patients treated with TC 
had significantly improved disease-free survival compared with AC-treated patients (86% 
vs 80%, p=0.015) and a favorable overall survival (90% vs 87%, =0.13).  There was 
significantly more grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia in the TC arm and more grade 3 or 4 
nausea and vomiting in the AC arm.  This study adds to the evidence that taxanes should be 
a part of adjuvant therapy, and suggests that omission of anthracycline therapy is possible.
When studied in the metastatic setting, paclitaxel resulted in similar response rates to 
patients receiving CMFP (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, and prednisone).[ADDRESS_319692] equivalent to FAC in the neoadjuvant setting, and to 
CMFP in the metastatic setting.  Also, CMF has been shown to be equivalent to AC as an 
adjuvant therapy in NSABP B-15, suggesting that paclitaxel will likely be equivalent to 
AC in the adjuvant setting.  There is an ongoing study, CALGB [ZIP_CODE] which is comparing 
4-6 cycles of AC to 4-6 cycles of paclitaxel, and this will help further compare paclitaxel to 
an anthracycline-based regimen.

cancer chemotherapy regimens are associated with chemotherapy-related amenorrhea 
(CRA) as well as with a risk of infertility.  Menses may cease temporarily or permanently 
during or shortly after chemotherapy.  Women may also continue menstruating normally (or 
resume menses after a period of amenorrhea) only to experience premature ovarian failure 
later on.  The risk of CRA with paclitaxel-trastuzumab therapy is unknown.   
Risk of CRA is known to increase with older age and when greater cumulative dose of 
alkylating agents are used.[ADDRESS_319696] Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) Trial 
V, 31% of the 188 premenopausal women with node-positive disease who received only 
one cycle of perioperative cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (CMF) reported at 
least three months of amenorrhea within the nine months after surgery, compared with 68% 
of the 387 similar patients who received 6-7 cycles of CMF.28  A recent retrospective 
evaluation of long-term follow-up data from IBCSG Trials V and VI (which also 
administered variable numbers of CMF cycles) showed that the 227 women who remained 
premenopausal after 6 cycles of adjuvant CMF had high probabilities of menopause at five 
years after start of CMF, even in younger age cohorts.29,30  In IBCSG V or VI, a woman 
who was 30 years old at time of diagnosis with continued menstruation after six cycles of 
CMF had a 37% risk of menopause at age 35 and an 84% risk at age 40.  Thus, alkylating 
agents can induce both immediate amenorrhea and eventual premature ovarian failure. 
However, the occurrence of not immediate, but nevertheless premature menopause 
following adjuvant chemotherapy is not well studied, as most studies of amenorrhea have 
focused on earlier endpoints.  
For example, a prospective study of 25-[ADDRESS_319697] cancer undergoing 
either doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC, 120 pts), doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199

Page 14 of 91paclitaxel (ACT, 168 pts), CMF (83 pts), 5-FU-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (FAC, 38 
pts), doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-docetaxel (ACD, 19 pts), or another regimen (58 pts) 
found that menstrual cycles were more likely to persist after the regimens that contained a 
lower cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide (AC, ACT, or ACD rather than FAC or 
CMF).[ADDRESS_319698], or 
ACD to bleed during the one month following chemotherapy (approx 50% vs. 20%, odds 
ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5), one year later the likelihood of menses was less in the CMF group 
(OR .37, 95% CI .37-.67).  
A meta-analysis of twelve studies confirmed that amenorrhea occurred after CMF 
chemotherapy in approximately 40% of women younger than 40, and in 76% of women 
older than 40.32  Anthracycline-containing regimens including cyclophosphamide-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]-5-FU (CEF) may be even more gonadotoxic than CMF.  In one study, 
premenopausal women who received CEF had a 51% risk of amenorrhea compared to a 
42.6% risk in women who received CMF at the 6 month follow-up (an 8% difference).33 
However, in this study, percents of amenorrhea were slightly closer in the two groups at 12 
months (76% in CEF group, 71% in CMF group, a 5% difference), highlighting the 
importance of longer term follow-up.
Because trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against Her2-expressing cells, it does not 
carry a risk of ovarian damage.  However, because paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor, it does 
carry at least a theoretical risk of amenorrhea, and the gonadotoxic effect of taxanes remains 
uncertain.  A small prospective evaluation of [ADDRESS_319699] cancer patients under 
age 50 found that it was only among women aged 40 or younger that adding a taxane to AC 
increased the likelihood of six months of CRA beginning within a year of the start of 
chemotherapy (40% vs 61%, p=.04 in the <40 group; 81% vs 84%, p=.35 in the >40 
group).35  In this study, however, many resumed menses in the <40 group after this period 
of CRA (33% in the AC alone group, 43% in the ACT group).  In contrast, a 
retrospective evaluation of 235 premenopausal women younger than 40 treated with AC 
followed by a taxane showed only 17% had amenorrhea, which was no higher than historic 
controls treated with AC alone. 36  Similarly, a retrospective study of 403 patients evaluated 
after treatment with AC or AC followed by [CONTACT_262946] 14 or 21 days revealed no 
significant increase in amenorrhea at six months or later with the addition of paclitaxel (OR 
1.45, 95% CI .78-2.69), when controlling for age and other variables.[ADDRESS_319700] evaluated percents of amenorrhea using paclitaxel 
without an anthracycline.  Study 07-199 will investigate the incidence of amenorrhea during 
and after therapy with paclitaxel-trastuzumab.  It is important that data on menstrual history 
is collected before start of treatment in order to establish a baseline, then again at the 
completion of chemotherapy to investigate how regular menses were during exposure to 
these agents, and then at each follow-up visit (every six months) in order to assess for 
duration of amenorrhea and also premature ovarian failure.  This information will be 
valuable to physicians and premenopausal patients making decisions regarding adjuvant 
therapy, as well as in their follow-up care and concerns.

assessments retrospectively and the menstrual forms for future scheduled 
assessments prospectively.  Those who agree to participate in the sub-study

follow-up assessments will occur as close to the following specified timepoints as 
possible: on the final day of chemotherapy using the 12-week Menstrual Status 
Form (Appendix 2); at the office visit three months later using the Menstrual 
Follow-up Form (Appendix 3); and every six months to [ADDRESS_319702] enrollment, using the Menstrual Follow-Up Form 
(Appendix 3).   The surveys will be given to patients in clinic or mailed to them to

Outcomes: The primary endpoint of this sub-study will be to estimate the proportion 
of women who have menstruated at least once in the period of 6 to 12 months after 
enrollment on 07-199 (Trastuzumab therapy ends at the 12 month point.)   Although 
some women may lose or recover menses soon after this time point, the one-year 
mark should allow time for most women who will resume ovarian cycling to do so.  
The secondary endpoints will be to estimate the proportion of women who report at 
least one menstrual period over the six month period that encompasses the 12 weeks 
of chemotherapy (so including 3 months of menstrual history before starting 07-
199), and the proportion of women who report at least one period in the prior six 
months at each of the follow-up points (every six months to [ADDRESS_319703] enrollment).  An exploratory secondary endpoint 
will be to examine possible predictors of menstruating at least once in the period 6 
to 12 months after enrollment on 07-199.

3.10.1 Molecular Alterations of Small HER2+ cancer
Determining molecular alterations within cancer can help provide predictive and prognostic 
information.  Since there is currently no standard of care treatment for early stage HER2-
positive breast cancer, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a better understanding of this subtype may provide 
deeper insights into therapeutic approaches for this disease.  
We propose performing sequencing on all archival tumor which yields adequate DNA from 
to better characterize molecular alterations within this subset of HER2-positive breast 
cancer.  We will also obtain tumor samples from biopsies performed at the time of relapse 
and perform next generation sequencing on these samples as well.
We anticipate that we will be able to get adequate DNA from approximately 50% of 
samples (n=200).  All slides will initially be reviewed to localize invasive cancer.  These 
areas will be extracted for DNA by [CONTACT_262949]-
Farber Cancer Institute.  Nikhil Wagle at the Broad Institute will be responsible for 
performing generation sequencing, and for the analysis.
We will analyze all baseline samples paired with the recurrence samples for sequencing, 
assuming adequate DNA can be obtained from samples.  We will explore results to see if 
there are particular baseline molecular alterations that predict recurrence, and will explore 
how frequent of an alteration this is within this molecular subtype.  Additionally we will 
explore what alterations occur at time of recurrence to help define what escape mechanism 
may be responsible for development of recurrent disease.  Defining these molecular 
alterations may help us develop better therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262919].

Paclitaxel is a novel chemotherapy agent derived from the bark of the yew tree (Taxus 
Brevifolia) that promotes microtubule assembly and stabilizes tubulin formation.[ADDRESS_319706] shown the polymorphic CYP2C8 has diminished catalytic activity for 
converting paclitaxel into 6-α-hydroxytaxol.59 The effects of this polymorphism on 
paclitaxel’s metabolism in vivo have not been determined and it is therefore a goal of this 
study to examine its correlation with increased paclitaxel’s toxicity.

DNA extraction and SNP analysis: The goal of this study is to identify SNPs that are 
associated with paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. SNPs can be isolated from DNA from 
multiple tissue sources including whole blood, buccal swabs and formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue.60-62  DNA will be extracted from whole blood as described by [CONTACT_262950]® Tissue kit.  DNA samples will be assayed for genetic polymorphisms as

measurements will be performed using the ABI Prism [ADDRESS_319708] and high-throughput approach. However, development of alternative assays will 
also be considered based on the anticipated need for future genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If we encounter 
any SNPs that we cannot be reliably assayed from whole genome amplified DNA, we will 
use our expertise in other assays to design assays using alternative methods.  We currently 
run multiple different SNP assays for several other types of assays such as TaqMan

4.3 Outcome Measures
4.3.1 Primary Outcome Measure
The primary end-point of this study is disease-free survival (local invasive breast 
cancer recurrence, a new local invasive breast cancer, regional recurrence, distant 
recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, and death before recurrence are all 
counted as “events that end disease-free survival).  The study is designed to have a 
large chance of declaring the regimen worthy of further research if the true 3 year 
failure percent is as small as 5% and a small chance of declaring the regimen worthy 
of further research if the true 3 year failure percent is as large as 9.2%.

4.5.1 Tumor Tissue
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (or 15 sections of paraffin-embedded tissue on 
uncharged slides) from archived tumor tissue samples (from time of biopsy or 
surgical resection) will be tested using gene sequencing to define molecular 
alterations that characterize these small tumors.  Fifteen (15) sections of paraffin-
embedded tissue on uncharged slides (or a tissue block of sufficient size to make 15 
slides) should be sent to DFCI for testing.

[IP_ADDRESS] Concurrent Phase with Paclitaxel: Patients will receive a 4 mg/kg IV 
loading dose on day 1 followed by 2 mg/kg IV dose weekly (+/- 2 
days), for a total of 12 doses.  When trastuzumab is being 
administered concomitantly with paclitaxel, trastuzumab 
administration may occur prior to, or after, chemotherapy 
administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maintenance Phase after Paclitaxel: After completion of 12 weeks of 
trastuzumab, trastuzumab dosing may be on either of two schedules: 
Weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg IV weekly (+/- 2 days) (over 30 minutes) x 
40 weeks
Every 3 week schedule: 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (+/- 7 days) (over 
[ADDRESS_319739] operating procedures) x 40 weeks.  
A total of 13 doses should be administered, if there are no missed 
doses, or treatment delays during therapy.
Trastuzumab monotherapy should begin no sooner than 1 week after 
the completion of combination therapy and no later than 3 weeks 
after the completion of combination therapy.  It is permissible to 
switch from weekly to every 3 week dosing and vice versa.  When 
switching from weekly to every 3 weeks there is no need for the 8 
mg/kg loading dose.  When switching from every 3 week to weekly, 
there is no need for the 4 mg/kg loading dose.
Trastuzumab monotherapy may be administered at a non-
participating institution.  The referring site is responsible for 
initiating contact [CONTACT_262957]-participating institution 
and ensuring the local provider has all protocol-related instructions 
regarding administration of trastuzumab per protocol.  The lead site 
is responsible for obtaining and reviewing all source documentation

[IP_ADDRESS] Any patient experiencing grade [ADDRESS_319749] be discussed with the study chair.
9.1.9 Dose Modifications for Obese Patients
[IP_ADDRESS] There is no clearly documented adverse impact of treatment of obese 
patients when dosing is performed according to actual body weight.
[IP_ADDRESS] All dosing is to be determined solely by [CONTACT_102]’s BSA as 
calculated from actual weight, OR actual weight without any 
modification unless explicitly described in the protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS] This will eliminate the risk of calculation error and the possible 
introduction of variability in dose administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure to use actual body weight in the calculation of drug dosages 
will be considered a major protocol deviation.

Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 43 of [IP_ADDRESS] Physicians who are uncomfortable with administering chemotherapy 
dose based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients on 
this protocol.
9.2 Trastuzumab
No cardioprotective drugs are permitted. There are no data for the use of 
cardioprotective agents such as dexrazoxane (Zinecard)
No dose modifications are permitted.

9.2.1 Infusion-associated symptoms
[IP_ADDRESS] During the first infusion, a symptom complex of fever and/or chills 
may occur.  These are usually mild-to-moderate and may be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, headache, dizziness, rigors, pain, 
hypotension, rash, and asthenia.  These symptoms occur infrequently 
during subsequent infusions.  
9.2.2 Trastuzumab when paclitaxel is delayed or discontinued
[IP_ADDRESS] If paclitaxel is delayed for any reason other than cardiotoxicity or 
severe hypersensitivity reactions that occurred when both paclitaxel 
and trastuzumab were administered, trastuzumab may be continued.
9.2.3 Cardiac Dysfunction
[IP_ADDRESS] Initiation of trastuzumab will depend on review of the initial MUGA 
scan/echocardiogram results.
[IP_ADDRESS] If trastuzumab is initiated, a decision about whether to continue or 
discontinue must occur after completion of all chemotherapy and 
while the patient is on trastuzumab alone.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual patients should have their MUGA scans/echocardiograms 
performed at the same radiology facility to eliminate variability 
between facilities.
[IP_ADDRESS] Asymptomatic decrease in LVEF:

Qualified personnel who are experienced with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handing, and safe 
disposal of chemotherapeutic agents in a self-contained, protective environment.
Discard unused portions of injectable chemotherapeutic agents that do not contain a 
bacteriostatic agent or are prepared with unpreserved diluents (i.e. sterile water for injection

risk of bacterial contamination
The total administered dose of chemotherapy may be rounded up or down within a range of 
5% of the actual calculated dose.
10.1 Trastuzumab (Trastuzumab)
10.1.1 Availability 
Trastuzumab is a commercially available sterile, white to pale yellow, 
preservative-free- lyophilized powder for intravenous (IV) administration.  Each vial 
of trastuzumab contains 440 mg of trastuzumab, 9.9 mg of L-histadine HCl, 6.4 mg 
of L-histadine, 400 mg of ,-trehalose dihydrate, and 1.8 mg of polysorbate 20, 
USP.  Reconstitution with 20 mL of the supplied Bacteriostatic Water for Injection 
(BWFI) USP, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, yields 21 mL of a 
multidose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at a pH of ~6.
10.1.2 Preparation
[IP_ADDRESS] Use appropriate aseptic technique.  Each vial of trastuzumab should 
be reconstituted with 20 mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol 
preserved, as supplied, to yield a multidose solution containing 21 
mg/mL trastuzumab.  Immediately upon reconstitution with BWFI, 
the vial of trastuzumab must be labeled in the area marked “Do not 
use after” with the future date that is 28 days from the date of 
reconstitution.
[IP_ADDRESS] If the patient has known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, 
trastuzumab must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection. 
Trastuzumab which has been reconstituted with SWFI must be used 
immediately and any unused portion discarded.  Use of other 
reconstitution diluents should be avoided.
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 49 of 9110.1.2.3 Determine the dose of trastuzumab needed, based on a 
loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight for 
weekly dosing schedules or a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg 
trastuzumab/kg body weight for weekly dosing schedules 
(OR 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight during q3wk 
dosing).  Calculate the correct dose using  21 mg/mL 
trastuzumab solution.  Withdraw this amount from the vial 
and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% 
sodium chloride, USP.  DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION 
SHOULD NOT BE USED.  Gently invert the bag to mix 
the solution.  The reconstituted preparation results in a 
colorless to pale yellow transparent solution.  Parenteral 
drug products should be inspected visually for particulates 
and discoloration prior to administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] No incompatibilities between trastuzumab and 
polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags have been 
observed.
10.1.3 Storage and Stability
Vials of trastuzumab are stable at 2C–8C (36F–46F) prior to 
reconstitution.  Do not use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_30473].  
A vial of Trastuzumab reconstituted with BWFI, as supplied, is stable for 28 
days after reconstitution when stored refrigerated at 2C–8C (36F–46F), 
and the solution is preserved for multiple use.  Discard any remaining 
multi-dose reconstituted solution after 28 days.  If unpreserved SWFI (not 
supplied) is used, the reconstituted trastuzumab solution should be used 
immediately and any unused portion must be discarded.  DO NOT FREEZE 
TRASTUZUMAB THAT HAS BEEN RECONSTITUTED.
The solution of trastuzumab for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or 
polyethylene bags containing 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP, may 
be stored at 2C–8C (36F–46F) for up to 24 hours prior to use.  Diluted 
trastuzumab has been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours at room 
temperature 15C–25C; however, since diluted trastuzumab contains no 
effective preservative the reconstituted and diluted solution should be stored 
refrigerated (2C–8C).

10.1.5 Toxicities
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Toxicity
Trastuzumab may result in clinically manageable left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, and occasionally advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) in a 
small proportion of patients. The incidence and severity of cardiac 
dysfunction has been greatest in patients who received trastuzumab in 
combination with an anthracycline.  In the pooled NSABP/NCCTG 
experience, the risk of cardiac events was 4% among those treated with 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab, as compared with .6% for those given 
chemotherapy alone. There are data suggesting that the risk is lower when 
sequential chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_262958].  Furthermore, 
older patients and those patients with borderline normal LVEF at baseline 
may be at greater risk for cardiac events.  The incidence of class III or IV 
cardiac dysfunction was 2% for those receiving concurrent paclitaxel plus 
trastuzumab.[ADDRESS_319756] patients who receive supportive medical treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Associated symptoms
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_319757] infusion of trastuzumab, symptoms 
consisting of chills and/or fever are observed in about 
40% of patients.  Other symptoms may include nausea, 
vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, cough, dizziness, rash, 
and asthenia.  These symptoms are usually mild to 
moderate in severity, and occur infrequently with 
subsequent trastuzumab infusions.

11.0 DEFINITION OF PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND REMOVAL OF 
PATIENTS FROM THERAPY 
11.1 Primary Endpoint: Disease-Free Survival (DFS)
Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined to end at the time of the first of the 
following events: local/regional ipsilateral invasive recurrence (or ipsilateral 
invasive new primary), contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, 
or death from any cause.  Local/regional recurrence is defined as an invasive 
ipsilateral breast cancer invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph 
nodes, chest wall, or skin of the ipsilateral breast.   A distant recurrence is 
metastatic disease that has either been biopsy confirmed or clinically 
diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer.   A single new lesion on a bone 
scan without evidence of lytic disease on x-ray and without symptoms does 
not in and of itself constitute distant recurrence, but multiple new bone 
lesions, or increased isotope uptake associated with new bone symptoms are 
more likely due to metastases.  Bone metastases must be documented with x-
rays and clinical description.  Contralateral invasive breast cancer will be 
included as an event.  Death attributable to any cause, including breast cancer, 
non-breast cancer, or unknown cause will be included as an event.  In situ 
cancer will not be included as an event that ends DFS.  If a patients has in situ 
breast cancer (on the ipsilateral or contralateral side) diagnosed during follow-
up before any of the events which are defined to end DFS, then the patient 
should continue to be followed for DFS on study (even if she is given 
hormonal therapy after the in situ diagnosis).  The primary endpoint is to 
estimate disease-free survival (DFS). Yearly mammograms will not be used to 
determine DFS. Any abnormality on imaging alone is not used towards the 
DFS endpoint. A disease recurrence, or a new primary breast cancer can only 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 54 of 91be determined by a biopsy. There is therefore no need for central review of 
mammography.
11.1.1 If a patient is diagnosed with a cancer of another site (i.e. other than a 
new breast cancer, a breast cancer recurrence, or breast cancer 
metastases) that is NOT a non-melanoma skin cancer or a 
cervical/vaginal carcinoma in situ, then the patient will be removed 
from study treatment.  These patients will still be followed for 
survival.  If a patient is diagnosed with a non-melanoma skin cancer 
or a cervical/vaginal carcinoma in situ, she will continue on this 
study and continue to be followed for DFS. 
11.2 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy (patients should still 
be followed for study endpoints)
11.2.1 Patients will be removed from protocol therapy if they experience toxicities 
per the guidelines in section 9 of the protocol.  Patients should still be 
followed for study endpoints after removal from protocol therapy.
11.2.2 Disease Progression
[IP_ADDRESS] If a patient has a DFS event (see section 11.1) treatment should be 
permanently discontinued.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extraordinary Medical Circumstances
[IP_ADDRESS] If at any time the constraints of this protocol are 
detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no 
longer wishes to continue on protocol therapy, protocol 
therapy shall be discontinued.  In this event:
Notify study chair
Document the reasons for discontinuation of therapy
At the time of removal of patients from protocol therapy, participating sites are responsible 
for completing the treatment ending part of the treatment completion/off-study form found 
in appendix [ADDRESS_319765] at [PHONE_2095] and inputing this information in 
the eDC system.  This patient will continue in follow-up on study (for DFS and survival if 
the reason for discontinuing treatment is something other than a DFS event, and for survival 
if the reason for discontinuing treatment is a DFS event).  This form must be submitted 
again when the patient goes off study.  
12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
12.1 Study Design
This is a single arm, three stage study evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of weekly 
paclitaxel chemotherapy x 12 with weekly trastuzumab x 12 followed by [CONTACT_262959] 3 weeks or weekly, for a total of 52 weeks in node-negative HER2-positive 
patients with tumors  3cm.
12.2 End Points
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319766] of this section (section 12), a patient with any one of these events 
is said to have a “failure”.  At any particular calendar time after the study 
opens for accrual, each patient who has entered the study and who has 
already had a failure has a time (from entry) to failure. Each patient who has 
entered the study and has not yet had a failure has a censored time (which is 
either the time between study entry and the diagnosis of a non-breast cancer 
other than those listed in section 11.1, or else the time between entry on 
study and the most recent date that patient is known to not have a failure, 
which may be zero for a patient who has recently entered and has no follow-
up yet).  The phrase “patient-years of follow-up” refers to the sum of failure 
times for all patients who have failed plus the sum of censored times for all 
patients who have not yet failed.
12.2.3 The secondary endpoints are listed in section 2.2 (describe DFS in patients 
grouped by [CONTACT_262960], evaluate the incidence of serious 
cardiac toxicity, evaluate the incidence of serious neurotoxicity, ,characterize 
molecular alterations in small HER2+ breast cancers,  investigate the 
percentage of patients with amenorrhea at various times after start of 
treatment in premenopausal  and explore predictors of amenorrhea). 
12.[ADDRESS_319767] look if the true 3 year 
failure percent is as large as 14%, want a small chance of declaring the regimen worthy of 
further research if the true 3 year failure percent is around 9%, and want a large chance of 
declaring the regimen worthy of further research if the true 3 year failure percent is as 
small as 5%.
 
Using the exact Poisson distribution and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262931], the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262932] (225 patient-years of follow-up) is 0.88 if the true 3 year failure 
percent is 14%, is 0.74 if the true 3 year failure percent is 12%, and is 0.53 if the true 3 year 
failure percent is 10%. Using the exact conditional Poisson distribution, the probability that 
the regimen is declared worthy of further research is 0.05 if the true 3 year failure percent is 
9.2% and is 0.95 if the true 3 year failure percent is 5%.  
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319768] a failure rate 
that is not much different from those who receive bisphosphonate therapy. In addition, it is 
expected that fewer than 20 (5%) of patients who are enrolled will be receiving adjuvant 
bisphosphonate therapy (such as in S0307). Therefore, it is hypothesized that the overall 3 
year failure percent (combining patients who do not receive bisphosphonates with those 
receving bisphosphonates) will be the same as that of the original cohort.
It is hypothesized that the failure rate is higher among patients with micrometasis, however 
little is known about the 3 year failure percent in this group. With the inclusion of patients 
with micrometastasis, the overall 3 year failure percent (taking both cohorts together) is 
anticipated to be higher and therefore the probability that the regimen will be declared not 
worthy of further study will be higher.  It is estimated that patients with micrometastasis 
will account for at most 10% of accrual.  If the 3 year failure percent remains 9.2% among 
patients without micrometastasis (original cohort) and it is up to 50% higher among patients 
with micrometastasis (13.8%), then approximately the overall 3 year failure percent is 
hypothesized to be 9.7% and the probability that the regimen is declared not worthy of 
further study will be at most 3% higher. In an extreme case where 20% of patients have 
micrometastasis, the overall 3 year failure percent will be 10.1% and the probability will be 
at most 4% higher.  These calculations are based on an overall [ADDRESS_319769] LookProbability That

12.4 Statistical Analysis
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 57 of 9112.4.1 The primary analysis will include all patients enrolled to the study. Kaplan-
Meier estimates of DFS will be plotted for the study as a whole and for 
subgroups of patients determined by [CONTACT_44871] (≤1 cm vs. >1 cm) and 
hormone receptor status (positive vs. negative).  If the regimen is deemed to 
be worthy of further research, there will be at most 40 failures at the time of 
final analysis, and if the hypothesis of a true 5% [ADDRESS_319770], it is expected that there will be only 26 failures, or about 6.5% of the 
400 patients (at a median follow-up at about 4 years).  So analysis of DFS 
will not be much more powerful than the analysis of the percentage of 
patients who have failed.  If 25% of the patients entered have tumor size ≤ [ADDRESS_319771] adequate (85%) power to declare that the two size 
groups differ significantly if the true percents of patients with failures (at a 
median follow-up of 4 years) are 1% and 8.3%.  If 25% of the patients are 
ER positive, this study will have adequate (85%) power to declare the two 
hormone receptor status groups differ significantly if the true percents of 
patients with failures are 1% and 8.3%.  These calculations assume that one-
sided 0.[ADDRESS_319772] tests are used and that there is no adjustment for 
multiple comparisons. 
12.4.2 The incidence of grade 3 or worse cardiac toxicity will be estimated, with a 
95% confidence interval.  If the study accrues 400 patients (i.e., the study is 
not terminated before accrual is complete), then the 95% Binomial 
confidence intervals for grade 3 or worse cardiac toxicity will be 0 to 0.7% if 
no cases of serious or worse cardiac toxicity are observed, 0.3 to 2.5% if 4 
cases are observed, 0.8 to 3.9% if 8 cases are observed, 1.5 to 5.2% if 12 
cases are observed, 2.3 to 6.4% if 16 cases are observed, and 3.1 to 7.6% if 
20 cases are observed.
12.4.3 The incidence of grade III/IV neurotoxicity will be estimated, with a 95% 
confidence interval.  If the study accrues 400 patients (i.e., the study is not 
terminated before accrual is complete), then the 95% Binomial confidence 
intervals for serious neurotoxicity will be 3.1 to 7.6% if 20 cases are 
observed, 5.5 to 11.1% if 32 cases are observed, and 7.2 to 13.4% if 40 cases 
are observed.  The incidence of grade 2-4 neuropathy reported for prior 
studies of 12 weeks of paclitaxel (ECOG 1199) is approximately 27%. 
Assuming there are [ADDRESS_319773] the CYP2C8*[ADDRESS_319774] the polymorphism among the 400 patients, and the 
incidence of grade 2-4 neuropathy is 27% among those without the polymorphism, 
there is 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 20%  (27% versus 47%) in 
the grade 2-[ADDRESS_319775] neurotoxicity from paclitaxel.
12.4.4 For the correlative objective to characterizes the molecular alterations by 
[CONTACT_262961], descriptive statistics will be used to 
report the types and frequencies of molecular events seen using 95% 
Binomial exact confidence intervals for the observed proportions. Based on 
the few DFS events expected, no statistical inferences will be used to assess 
associations, and all point and interval estimates will be reported as 
exploratory and hypothesis generating.    
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 58 of 9112.4.4.1  Since approximately 25% of breast cancer patients 
are premenopausal, we expect there will be a 90% chance that 
there will be at least [ADDRESS_319776] one menstrual period in 
the time period 6 to 12 months after protocol entry (termed 
“percent still menstruating at 12 months” below).  [IP_ADDRESS] 
We will first explore whether the proportions of patients still 
menstruating at 12 months differ between the patients 
assessed for menstrual history at the time of registration to 
07-199 and patients assessed after registration (because the 
latter will be answering questions about menstruation further 
in the past).  If these proportions differ by [CONTACT_21316] 15%, then 
the results of all patients reporting they were premenopausal 
at the time of enrollment on 07-199 will be combined.  If 
these proportions differ by 15% or more, then the primary 
analysis will involve only those patients who were assessed 
for menstrual history at the time of enrollment on 07-199.
[IP_ADDRESS] We will report the proportion of patients with at least 
one menstrual period in the past 6 months for the group as a 
whole (either all patients, or all patients who were assessed 
for menstrual history at the time of enrollment on 07-199) and 
also by [CONTACT_551] (<40 years vs. >40 years) and by [CONTACT_262962] (BMI <30 or ≥30) at each time point.  Exact binomial 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the percent of patients 
will menstruating at 12 months overall and in these 4 
subgroups will be calculated; they will not be corrected for 
multiple comparisons.  If there are at least [ADDRESS_319777] 10 patients not still 
menstruating at 12 months (in the overall group), then factors 
associated with the probability of still menstruating at 12 
months will also be evaluated in an exploratory manner using 
logistic regression, with one covariate at a time and using a 
step-up procedure with the logistic regression.  Covariates 
that will be considered include age, (<40 years vs. ≥40), body 
mass index (<30 or ≥30), and whether the patient had some 
grade 3 toxicity (other than amenorrhea) on study.  
Exploratory descriptive statistics regarding the approximate 
frequency of recent (within the last 6 months) menses (once 
monthly, every two months, twice a month, every 2-6 months, 
or less than every six months) will also be presented for each 
time point.
If at least 89 patients who are menstruating at study entry are accrued and 
one year menstrual data is gathered on all of them and the patients assessed 
for menstrual history at the time of study registration can be combined with 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319778] width of the 
95% confidence interval for the proportion still menstruating at 12 months 
will be 21% (i.e., 40% to 61% if 45 of the 89 are still menstruating).  If 
approximately 75% of the patients are observed to be menstruating at 12 
months, the 95% confidence interval will be 65%-84%.  
The number of premenopausal patients accrued will be small, which means 
that the confidence intervals on percent still menstruating at any time point 
will be large and also means that only exploratory analysis can be done on 
factors affecting the proportion still menstruating.  Also, if the study stops 
accrual early, there will be fewer patients available for estimating 
amenorrhea.  In addition, there may be a difference in recall between patients 
first questioned about their menstrual history at protocol entry (before 
treatment starts) and patients first questioned later. However, data resulting 
from this assessment will provide preliminary estimates of percents of 
amenorrhea in the population receiving this regimen.

Page 61 of 91not related to the study drugs to the Principal Investigator, Genentech (if applicable per 
guidelines specified below), and per participating local IRB reporting requirements.  
DF/HCC and DF/PCC institutions must report all SAEs directly to the DFCI IRB using the 
DFCI IRB-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form found on the Oncology Protocol System 
website in addition to notifying the Principal Investigator.  All other participating 
institutions SAE report notifications will be reviewed by [CONTACT_262964].  If the event does meet the DFCI IRB SAE 
reporting requirements, the study coordinator or designee at the lead institution will submit 
the event information to the DFCI IRB using the DFCI IRB IND Safety Reporting Form.  
Investigators are required to report to Genentech Drug Safety any serious adverse event, 
whether expected or unexpected, and which is assessed by [CONTACT_262965].  All events meeting these 
criteria will be reported for the time period beginning with any amount of exposure to 
trastuzumab through the protocol-defined follow-up period.  Serious criteria, definitions, 
and guidance for reporting follow.
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an 
investigational study or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can 
be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an 
investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
During the course of this study, only grade 2 or higher adverse events will be followed and 
recorded in the electric data capture system (eDC). During the follow up period only Grade 
2 neurotoxicity and cardiac events need to be reported.
Serious adverse events (SAE) are adverse events occurring at any dose which meet one or 
more of the following serious criteria:
Results in death (i.e. the AE caused or led to death)
Is life-threatening (i.e. the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not 
apply to an AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it were more severe)
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e. the AE required at least a 24-hour 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine 
check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134])
Is disabling (i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry 
out normal life functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a 
subject exposed to the study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy)
Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 62 of 91Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure. 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (I.B.).  This includes adverse events for which the specificity or 
severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Associated with Trastuzumab
All SAEs that are serious and reasonably or probably related to the use of trastuzumab (this 
applies to both expected and unexpected events) should be recorded on a MedWatch 3500 
Form and faxed to:
Genentech Drug Safety Contact [CONTACT_262966]: [PHONE_483]
Fax:  ([PHONE_166]/ ([PHONE_484] 
AND:
Study Coordination Center/Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_262933]: 
 
MedWatch 3500 Reporting Guidelines:
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication 
information, the report should include the following information within the Event 
Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500 form:
Protocol description (and number, if assigned)
Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known
Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics

product and suspect medication
Follow-up information:  
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_51756]:
Adding to the original MedWatch 3500 report and submitting as follow-up
Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the 
original MedWatch 3500 form 
Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including subject 
identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject number), protocol description and number, if 
assigned, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or follow-up 
information is being submitted). The patient identifiers are important so that the new 
information is added to the correct initial report)
Occasionally Genentech may contact [CONTACT_15483], clarification, 
or current status of the subject for whom and adverse event was reported.  For questions 
regarding SAE reporting, you may contact [CONTACT_262967].
Study Drug Relationship:
The investigator will determine which events are associated with the use of study drug.  For 
reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as possibly related to the use of trastuzumab 
if the investigator believes:
There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and trastuzumab 
administration; and/or
There is a biologically plausible mechanism for trastuzumab to cause or contribute to 
the AE; and
The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures.

Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319798] (i.e. chemotherapy, radiation, 
surgery etc) is stopped due to the various reasons listed below (1-10).  
The date treatment ended is linked to Chemo-order entry as applicable.  
Therefore, it is critical that as subjects complete protocol therapy that this 
is documented in the QACT registration system.  
OFF STUDY This is when the subject will no longer be followed on the protocol due to 
the reasons listed below (1-10).  Subjects can come off treatment before 
they come off study if they are still being followed on protocol or, they may 
come off treatment at the same time.  This often is protocol dependent.
1. Subject Canceled-This is selected only when a subject never starts protocol treatment  (i.e. 
chemotherapy, radiation, surgery etc).  This should be selected for both off 
treatment and off study if the subject never started treatment.
2. Subject Ineligible-This is selected when a subject has already begun treatment (i.e. 
chemotherapy, radiation, surgery etc) and has been deemed 
ineligible. Some protocols require follow-up for ineligible subjects so 
the subject may continue on follow-up.  This may be selected for off 
treatment or off study.
NOTE: The subject will be taken Off Treatment AND taken Off Study when 
selecting this number, unless ‘Yes’ is selected for Follow-up.
3. Subject Completed 
Protocol RequirementsThis is selected when a subject has finished the protocol 
requirements.  (may mean treatment is finished or follow-up is 
finished).  This may be selected for off treatment or off study.
4. Unacceptable ToxicityThis is selected when a subject experiences toxicity that either the subject or 
physician find unacceptable. Please specify the toxicity and if a Phase I trial select 
Yes or No to indicate if the toxicity is a protocol DLT. This may be selected for off 
treatment or off study.
5. Progressive 
disease/RelapsedThis is selected when a subject’s disease worsens and meets the criteria in the 
protocol for progression; i.e. the tumor is measured and evaluated according to the 
tumor evaluation criteria written in the protocol (RECIST, WHO, etc) and it is 
deemed “progressive” (the tumor has grown larger or the disease has spread to 
other parts of the body).  This may be selected for off treatment or off study.
6. Subject Withdrawal of 
Consent and Follow-upThis is selected when a subject, at any time during the study, 
decides to no longer participate in either the treatment portion of the 
protocol or the follow-up portion.  Subject must be off treatment and 
off study.
7. Subject Died-If the subject dies while still receiving protocol treatment this option can be chosen 
for off treatment.  If the subject has completed treatment but is in follow-up then 
this reason can be chosen for off-study but should not be selected for off-

NOTE: The subject will be taken Off Treatment AND taken Off Study when 
selecting this number.
For DFCI only: PI [INVESTIGATOR_262937]/Health Information Services, [EMAIL_5032]
8. Lost to Follow-up This is selected when the subject cannot be located during the treatment or follow-
up portion of the protocol and all communication is lost.  Subject must be off 
treatment and off protocol.
9. OtherThis is selected when the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262938].  A description of the reason MUST be 
written in.  This may be selected for off treatment or off study.
10. Subject Withdrawal of 
Consent but Agrees to be 
FollowedThis is selected when a subject, at any time during the study, decides to no longer 
participate in the treatment portion of the protocol BUT agrees to participate in the 
follow-up portion. Used for off treatment only.
11.  Subject unable to 
proceed to treatmentThis is selected when a subject meets eligibility requirements, is registered, and 
has study specific procedures performed but is unable to proceed to the study 
treatment (for example: transplant). This could be due to progression prior to the 
study intervention, subject no longer medically fit to receive transplant, donor 
unavailable, or in the case of vaccine studies, vaccine cannot be made.  This 
should be selected for both off treatment and off study.

Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DF/HCC 
DSMP) outlines the procedures for a DF/HCC Multi-Center research protocol. 
1.1 Purpose
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Multi-
center protocol will comply with Federal regulations (21 CFR Part 11); Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
Guidelines; and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements in 
accordance with the CTEP Multi-center Guidelines.       
1.2 Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  Components
The Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan includes the following components:
DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol:  One or more outside institutions collaborating with Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center on a research protocol where DF/HCC is the Lead Institution. Dana-
Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) Network Clinical Trial Affiliates are not viewed as outside 
sites in this definition.
Lead Institution:  Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will be the Lead Institution and will be responsible 
for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of a protocol as well as its subsequent 
amendments per the DFCI IRB and applicable regulatory guidelines (CTEP, FDA, OBA etc.). 
DF/HCC Contract Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_262939]/HCC Project. This most often will be 
the Protocol Chair, but occasionally this may be the overall grant or contract holder, as applicable.
Protocol Chair:  [CONTACT_262976] is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89397]/HCC protocol submitted 
as the Lead Institution.  For applicable protocols, the Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with 
any regulatory agencies (ie.CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO), FDA, OBA etc.). 
Participating Institution:  A participating institution is an institution that desires to collaborate with 
DF/HCC and commits to accruing participants to a DF/HCC protocol.  The participating institution 
acknowledges the Protocol Chair as having the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall 
conduct of the study.   
Coordinating Center: The Lead Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-center 
Protocol. The Coordinating Center will provide the administrative support to the Protocol Chair in 
order that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the DSMP and as specified in applicable 
regulatory guidelines (ie. CTEP Multi-Center Guidelines).  In addition to the Lead Institution, the 
Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) provides support services to assist the Protocol 
Chair.

5.5 IRB Re-Approval
         
Annual IRB re-approval from the Participating institution is required in order to register participants 
onto a protocol.  There is no grace period for annual re-approvals.
Protocol registrations will not be completed if a re-approval letter is not received by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC 
Lead Institution or designee from the Participating Institutions on or before the anniversary of the 
previous approval date.  
5.[ADDRESS_319803] 
14, 2002, which has modified the privacy rule in significant ways vis-à-vis research.
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course of a 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol the study participant must sign an Authorization.  This Authorization 
may or may not be separate from the Informed Consent.  The DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol, with 
the approval from the DFCI IRB and if applicable NCI/CTEP, will provide an Informed Consent 
template, which covered entities (DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol participating institutions) must use. 
The DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information 
in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must 
be collected per National Cancer Institute requirements. These are the primary reasons why DF/HCC 
has chosen to use Authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_89438], rather than limited data sets 
with data use agreements.  
5.7 DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol Case Number
Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant is 
assigned a five-digit protocol case number.  This number is unique to the participant on this trial and 
must be used for QACT CRF/eCRF completion and written on all data and QACT correspondence 
for the participant.
5.8 DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol Registration Policy
    5.8.1 Initiation of Therapy: Participants must be registered with the DF/HCC QACT before 
receiving treatment.  Treatment may not be initiated until the site receives a faxed or e-
mailed copy of the participant’s Registration Confirmation memo from the DF/HCC 
QACT. Therapy must be initiated per protocol guidelines.  The Protocol Chair and DFCI 
IRB must be notified of any exceptions to this policy. 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 83 of 915.8.2 Eligibility Exceptions: The DF/HCC QACT will make no exceptions to the eligibility 
requirements for a protocol.  In addition, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) 
specifically prohibits registration of a participant on any NCI Sponsored protocol that 
does not fully and completely meet all eligibility requirements. The DF/HCC QACT 
requires each institution to fully comply with this requirement.
5.8.3 Verification of Registration, Dose Levels, and Arm Designation: A registration 
confirmation memo for participants registered to DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol will be 
faxed or emailed to the registering institution within one working day of the registration. 
Treatment may not be initiated until the site receives a faxed or e-mailed copy of the 
registration confirmation memo. 
5.8.4 Confidentiality: All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the 
participant are strictly confidential. Any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology 
Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Lead Institution or 
designee must have the participant’s full name & social security number “blacked out” 
and the assigned DF/HCC QACT case number and protocol number written in (with the 
exception of the signed informed consent document). Participant initials may only be 
included or retained for cross verification of identification.
5.9  Schedule of Data Submission
The DF/HCC QACT develops a set of either paper or electronic case report forms, (CRF/eCRFs) 
for use with the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.  These forms are designed to collect data for each 
study. The schedule for submission of case report forms to the DF/HCC QACT is generally 
specified in each protocol. 
5.10. Eligibility Checklist
Purpose - Outlines protocol-specific eligibility criteria and includes the following:
             
Participant Demographics (address, zip code, sex, race, ethnicity, initials, date of birth)
1) Parameters for eligibility

of registration.
5.10.1 Off Treatment/Off Study Form
Purpose - The Off Treatment/Off Study Form is submitted when the participant is 
removed from the study or has completed all protocol treatment.  Note: If the participant 
dies while on protocol, the Off Study Form is the last form submitted.
Schedule of Submission – Submitted within 14 days after completing treatment or taken off 
study for any reason.
5.10.2   Follow up / Survival Form
Purpose - Summarizes participant status at a given point in time after being removed from 
treatment. 
Schedule of Submission  – Submitted within 14 days after the protocol defined follow up visit 
date or call.   
5.11 Data Form Review
When data forms arrive at the DF/HCC QACT, they are reviewed for:
 
Timeliness: 
Did the form arrive on time as specified in the protocol?
Completeness: 
Is all the information provided as required per protocol?
Participant Eligibility: 
Does the participant meet the eligibility requirements for the study based on the demographic data, 
lab values and measurements provided?
Stratification: 
Are the stratification parameters consistent with what was given at the time of registration?
Protocol Treatment Compliance: 
Are the body surface area (BSA) and drug dosage calculations correct?  The dose must be within 
10% of the calculated protocol dose.
 
Adverse Events (Toxicities): 
Did the participant experience adverse events (toxicities or side effects) associated with the 
treatment? Was the treatment delayed due to the adverse event? What was the most severe degree 
of toxicity experienced by [CONTACT_2299]?
Notations concerning adverse events will address relationship to protocol treatment for each 
adverse event grade.  All adverse events encountered during the study will be evaluated according 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_319807] be noted 
on the participant's Adverse Event (Toxicity) Forms.
5.12 Missing and Deficient Memorandum
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. Participating 
institutions are notified of their data submission delinquencies in accordance with the following 
policies and procedures:
Incomplete or Questionable Data
If study forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will receive 
a written query from the DF/HCC QACT Data Analyst.  Responses to the query should be 
completed and returned within [ADDRESS_319808] be attached to the specific data being 
re-submitted in response.  
Missing Forms
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the participating institution will receive a Missing 
Form Report from the DF/HCC QACT noting the missing forms.  These reports are compi[INVESTIGATOR_262941]/HCC QACT and distributed a minimum of three times a year. 
6.0 REQUISUITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG
The ordering of investigational agent is generally specified in the protocol. 
Participating sites should order their own agent regardless of the supplier (i.e., NCI or a 
pharmaceutical company.) 
If the agent is commercially available, check with the local Director of Pharmacy and/or the Research 
Pharmacy to ensure that the agent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, ensure that the agent can be 
ordered once the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_1036]. If the agent is investigational, ensure that the 
pharmacy will be able to receive and store the agent. The local IRB should be kept informed of who 
will supply the agent (i.e., NCI or a pharmaceutical company) so that any regulatory responsibilities 
can be met in a timely fashion. 
7.0 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND TOXICITY MONITORING
All participants receiving investigational agents will be evaluated for safety.   The safety parameters 
include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and 
spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities 
encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria assigned to the 
protocol (CTCAE Version 3.0) and recorded prior to each course of therapy.  Life-threatening 
toxicities should be reported immediately to the Protocol Chair and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). Protocols using CTEP supplied agents should also report these toxicities via the AdEERS 
system.
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 86 of 91Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol.
7.1 Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience at any dose that results  in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions in a participant who has never had seizure activity in the 
past that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or abuse.
Unless otherwise specified in the protocol, the study will utilize the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 for 
Toxicity and Adverse Event reporting.  A copy of the CTC or CTCAE Criteria can be downloaded 
from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  
7.2 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Guidelines for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be followed as is delineated in the 
protocol.
Participating Institutions must report serious adverse events for CTEP trials online using AdEERS.  
This applies to any medical event equivalent to an unexpected grade [ADDRESS_319809] grade 3 and all grade 4 and grade 5 (death) toxicities regardless of study 
phase or attribution. 
In addition, the Participating Institutions must report the serious adverse events to the Protocol 
Chair and the Coordinating Center (Lead Institution) at the time SAEs are submitted. 
The Lead Institution will maintain documentation of all Adverse Event Reporting and be 
responsible for communicating all SAEs to all Participating sites.
7.3 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety Reports 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require sponsors of clinical studies to 
notify the FDA and all participating investigators of any serious and unexpected adverse experiences 
that are possibly related to the investigational agent. In compliance with these FDA regulations, 
CTEP will notify the Participating sites via the DF/HCC Lead Institution by [CONTACT_51856]:
IND Safety Reports: Investigators will be sent a copy of expedited adverse events which CTEP has 
sent to the FDA. CTEP will notify the Protocol Chair at the Lead Institution. Within [ADDRESS_319810] the letters to the 
Participating sites with protocol specific instructions for IRB submissions, participant notifications, 
etc. For routine IND Safety Reports, CTEP does not generally require an immediate revision to the 
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 87 of 91protocol and/or model informed consent documents. The investigators are to file a copy with their 
protocol file and send a copy to their IRB according to their local IRB’s policies and procedures.
8.0 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS AND DEVIATIONS
Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines define the terms “protocol violation” or “protocol 
deviation.”  All DF/HCC Protocol Chairs must adhere to those policies set by [CONTACT_89426], the 
definitions for protocol violation and deviation as described by [CONTACT_89442]/HCC Multi-center Protocol. 
  
8.1 Definitions
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB-approved 
protocol.
Protocol Violation: Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved by [CONTACT_89443]. 
8.2 Reporting Procedures
The Protocol Chair: is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record to describe all protocol deviations and violations. 
The Protocol Chair will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol violations/deviations are 
promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines. 
Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from DFCI IRB. The 
Participating institution must submit the deviation request to the Protocol Chair and Lead Institution 
or designee, who will submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the 
deviation should be submitted to the participating site’s own IRB, per its policy.
Protocol violations occurring at a participating institution will be submitted to that site’s own IRB.   
A copy of the participating institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the 
DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee by [CONTACT_2319], facsimile, or via e-mail within 10 business days after 
the original submission. 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the participating 
institution, the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee will submit the report to the Protocol Chair for 
review. Subsequently, the participating institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be 
submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. DF/HCC will forward all 
violation reports to CTEP via an internal DF/HCC process, as applicable.
9.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE
1) The quality assurance process for a clinical trial research study requires verification of protocol 
compliance and data accuracy. As the Coordinating Center, the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee 
with the aid of the QACT provides quality assurance oversight for the DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol.
9.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance
Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab  DF/HCC Protocol #: 07-199
Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 88 of 91All data submitted to the DF/HCC QACT will be monitored for timeliness of submission, completeness, 
and adherence to protocol requirements.  Monitoring will begin at the time of participant registration and 
will continue during protocol performance and completion.  The Lead Institution or designee and if 
applicable QACT Data Analysts assigned to the Protocol will perform the ongoing protocol compliance 
monitoring with the support of the participating institution’s Coordinators, the Principal Investigators, 
and the Protocol Chair. 
9.[ADDRESS_319811]:  Eligibility criteria are checked on a protocol-specific eligibility checklist 
and faxed to the DF/HCC QACT prior to registration on protocol.  A DF/HCC QACT Protocol Registrar 
reviews the checklist and informed consent document before the participant can be registered on a 
protocol.  The DF/HCC QACT cannot make exceptions to the eligibility requirements.
9.2.5  Accrual of Eligible Participants: Annual accrual rates for eligible participants enrolled onto 
therapeutic clinical trials is calculated for each institution. Institutions are expected to maintain the 
minimum annual average accrual as defined by [CONTACT_89444].

Protocol Version Date: 11/18/2021
Page 89 of 919.3 On-Site Auditing
9.3.1 DF/HCC Sponsored Trials
For all DF/HCC sponsored protocols:
The participating institutions may be required to submit subject source documents to the 
DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee for monitoring. Also, the participating institution may be 
subject to on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Lead Institution or designee.
After a participating site has accrued 4-[ADDRESS_319812] year of enrollment as specified in the protocol, 
section 13.3. One visit to each site will be planned during the 18 month expected enrollment 
period of the trial. If significant violations are uncovered during the audit, a follow-up audit 
may be requested. The final audit reports for the external sites will be reported to the Overall PI, 
as well as the DF/HCC Audit Subcommittee, as is standard practice.
9.3.2 Participating Institution
It is the participating institution’s responsibility to notify the DF/HCC Lead Institution or 
designee of all scheduled audit dates (internal or NCI) and re-audit dates (if applicable), which 
involve the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol. All institutions will forward a copy of final audit 
and/or re-audit reports and corrective action plans (if applicable) to the DF/HCC Lead 
Institution or designee within 12 weeks after the audit date. 
9.3.3 Coordinating Center (Lead Institution or designee) 
The Protocol Chair will review all DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Final Audit reports and 
corrective action plans if applicable. The Lead Institution or designee must forward these 
reports to the DF/HCC QACT per DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit 
Subcommittee. Based upon the audit assessments the DF/HCC Audit Subcommittee could 
accept or conditionally accept the audit rating and final report. Conditional approval could 
require the Protocol Chair to implement recommendations or require further follow-up.  For 
unacceptable audits, the Audit Subcommittee would forward the final audit report and

Study drug  Artesunate  
Title  A Phase I study of intravaginally administered Artesunate  
In women with High Grade Cervical Intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_97596] (CIN2/3)  
Indication  Female patients, 18 years and older, with CIN2/3  
Study 
population  Women with biopsy -confirmed CIN2/[ADDRESS_595826] 
commonly associated with squamous cancers, disease 
remains very common, even in high -resource settings, and 
is likely to remain so for decades.  Infection with a high -risk 
HPV type is necessary but not sufficient for the development of squamous cervical cancer  (SCCx)  and its 
precursor lesion, high grade cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601]  (CIN2/3) .  Both SCCx and CIN2/[ADDRESS_595827] increased levels of intracellular iron, 
compared to normal cells [
1].  This observation raised the 
possibility of treating preinvasive HPV disease (i.e., 
CIN2/3) with an effective anti -malarial drug, Artesunate . 
Artesunate  contain s an endoperoxide bridge that reacts 
with intracellular ferrous iron to generate free radicals, leading to cell death [ 2, 3]. Artesunate , formulated as a 
suppository, is WHO -approved for first -line treatment for 
acute malaria in children who are remote from health care 
settings  [4].  The toxicity profile of this formulation is well -
documented. Preclinical data suggest that Artesunate  
mediates cytotoxic effect on HPV -infected cells, while 
having no effect on normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  Thus, it is pro posed 
to investigate the use of Artesunate  formulated in 
suppositories  applied intravaginally to treat CIN2/ 3. 
Evaluation 
Criteria  
 Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_464843].  Subjects will be monitored at each 
visit  for the appearance of erythema; itching, burning, pain; 
infection; desquamation; tenesmus; bleeding; dizziness; or 
other unexpected AEs. Circulating blood cells will be 
monitored weekly for any quantitative changes.

 Efficacy will be determined by [CONTACT_464844]/absence of 
HPV, by [CONTACT_464845], and by [CONTACT_464846]. The 
presence of HPV will be determined by [CONTACT_464847]- and post -treatment. Histologic endpoints will be 
assessed with colposcopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -directed biopsies obtained 
before and after tre atment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] A rtesunate.   
 
In this population, it is feasible to directly visualize, serially 
quantitate, and perform therapeutic resection of 
premalignant lesions.  By [CONTACT_464848] (systemic) compartment  
with measures obtained from the site of the lesion, pre-  and 
post -drug administration, we expect to derive insights 
which will inform immune therapeutic strategies for incipi[INVESTIGATOR_464795].

2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1 HPV -associated malignancies of the cervix  
Virtually all squamous cervical cancers (SCCx) are caused by a common virus, human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV). Exposure to HPV occurs with the onset of sexual activity. While  
most persons clear their infection without intervention, and without sequelae, a subset 
do not.  Persistent infection  with a high -risk HPV type is the proximate cause of SCCs 
and their precursor intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184], cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN2/3). Other factors contribute to the development of SCC, as viral integration into the host 
genome is  necessary but not sufficient  for the initiation and persistence of malignant 
transformation .  Currently there are no available treatments that can er adicate HPV 
infection.  Successful prevention of SCC in infected individuals is based on early detection of preinvasive lesions  prior to the development of cancer . 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_464798] , inexpensive, noninvasive  screening strategies to 
detect precursor lesions, the incidence of HPV disease (SCC and CIN 2/3) in women  
remains high. An effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_464799].  Globally,  ten percent of malignancies in women are caused by  [CONTACT_33968]. 
Cervical cancer  is the second leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide , and in 
the [LOCATION_002] , cervical cancer remains the sixth most commonly diag nosed 
malignancy among women.  Over the past decade, SEER data have documented a 17% 
increase in incidence in the U.S., normalized for population growth, with a disproportionate increase among young women [5] . Although preventative vaccines 
that protect against infection with HPV types [ADDRESS_595830] has not yet real ized as the rates of vaccination remain 
low in the [LOCATION_002].  Recent data indicate that the rate of preventive vaccination in 
eligible girls, in 2012, was only 33% [6].  
 
The primary strategy to decrease disease burden in HPV -infected individuals is to 
intervene when premalignant cervical disease, CIN2/3, is detected prior to the development of SCCs. All treatments for  CIN2/3, including cryotherapy, laser 
vaporization, or c one excisions, are ablative and require repeated visits to health care

the potential for adverse sequelae, and furthermore, are not always curative.  Among 
treated CI N2/3 in immunocompetent women, the overall risk of recurrence is less than 
ten percent when all surgical margins are clear. This risk increases to approximately 
25% in women with positive endocervical margins. Women who have undergone 
cervical conization h ave three times the risk of cervical  stenosis as those who have not  
[7].  Several authors have documented a significantly increased risk of premature 
delivery in pregnancies subsequent to cervical conization, and subsequent neonatal low birth weight. [ 7, 8] Moreover, tissue destruction from therapeutic interventions can 
make subsequent detection and treatment of recurrent disease more difficult, as the healing process tends to draw the transition zone of the cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_464800], 
into the endocervical canal  [9]. While these complications are not insurmountable, an 
effective local immunotherapy such as intravaginal Artesunate  suppositories is clinically 
meaningful to obviate the need for surgeries.  
 2.2 Noninvasive topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l therapy for cervical dysplasia  
The development of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_464801]2/[ADDRESS_595832], carries a  social stigma [ 10].  The development of a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_464802] -admin istered, would be empowering for 
women with preinvasive lesions. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_464803].  
 2.3 Rationale for study drug  
Artesunate  is a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin, a plant compound extracted 
from the leaves of sweet wormwood, Artemisia annua , an herb used in Chinese 
traditional medicine for a ntimalarial tre atment for over two thousand years, with 
marketed formulations since the late 1980s  [11].  The safe ty profile of  Artesunate  and 
related compounds has been established based on  million s of malaria patients , ranging 
from infants to adults , over decades  [12].  Artesunate  has been shown to be safe and 
well-tolerated w hen administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or intra -
rectally, as a suppository  [4, 5, 13-15]. Reports submitted to the FDA by [CONTACT_464852] s tudies conducted with artemisinin and 
its derivatives, including Artesunate  [16-18]. 
 
Recently, Artesunate  compounds have been shown to have antitumor activity against 
several human solid tumor  cell lines , including  breast, colon, ovarian , prostate, renal , 
and non -small cell lung cancer  [13]. Of particular relevance, artemisinin derivatives 
have also been shown to have a cytotoxic effect on HPV -immortalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]  
[13] .  
 
A Phase I Study of intravaginally administered Artesunate  in women with high grade cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN2/3)  
 ________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version 6.0: August 7, [ADDRESS_595833] been shown to decrease cell 
proliferation, redu ce angiogenesis and trigger apoptosis in cancer cells  [14, 15, 19]. 
Although the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, in human solid 
cancers, sensitivity to Artesunate  has been reported to be a ssociated  with  expressi on of 
angiogenesis -related gene transcripts  [20].  Tumor susceptibility has  also been reported 
to be correlated with cell surface over expression of transferrin receptor  [21, 22] and with 
intracellular ferrous iron  [1].  It has been demonstrated that artemisinin and its 
derivatives contain an endoperoxide bridge that reacts with intracellular ferrous iron to genera te free radicals, leading to cell death [3,4].  
 Both SCC and CIN2/[ADDRESS_595834] increased levels of intracellular iron, 
compared to normal cells [ 1].  Because cervical squamous cancers and their precursor, 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] (CIN ) overexpress the transferrin receptor [ 21, 22], these 
observations prompted a subsequent study of the cytotoxic effect of dihydroartemisinin  
(DHA), the bioactive form of Artesunate , on papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] -expressing epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] 
[23] .  In vitro  studies demonstrated that, while DHA had little effect on normal cervical 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], it had a significant cytotoxic effect on HPV -immortalized cervic al cells 
[23]. In addition, formulated as a local treatment in an oral mucosal canine nonclinical 
model, DHA has been reported to inhibit papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] - induced tumor formation 
[23].  
 
Together, these findings suggest th at topi[INVESTIGATOR_464804].   Given the unmet need 
for a local treatment for CIN2/3 lesions and that Artesunate  has demonstrated a 
favorable safety profile for decades in both children and adults, a prospective, dose-
escalation, Phase 1 study of  an Artesunate  suppository, administered intravaginally to 
achieve local, mucosal distribution of study drug, is proposed.   
 
2.4 Nonclinical safety literature review  
Extensive reviews of the effects of Artesunate  on the central and peripheral nervous 
system, and on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_464805] (mice, rabbits, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], dogs, and monkeys) have been compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]  [18, 
24] . There are also some recent sub -chronic and chronic toxicological studies of 
Artesunate  in dogs  [25, 26] . These reports contain data on Artesunate  toxicity when 
administered via different routes, including oral, intravenous, intramuscular and intra -
peritoneal injections at doses of up to 640 mg/kg, which is well above therapeutic levels. In general, minimal pathological changes were observed in animal studies at doses 
under 60 mg/kg  [18, 25, 26]. The toxic effects would not therefore be considered to be of 
clinical concern in regard to human therapeutic use  [18, 24] . In this clinical study, we 
propose to evaluate intravaginal suppository doses up to 200 mg (approximately ≤4 mg/kg for subjects who weigh ≥50 kg, an inclusion criterion of this study) that are considerably less than doses associated with toxicities in animals (>60 mg/kg) and the

 rectal suppository doses used in children (approximately 10 mg/kg) and adults 
(approximately 8.3 mg/kg) for malaria treatment  [18]. 
 
2.4.1  Acute (Single Dose) Toxicity  
In single -dose toxicity studies of Artesunate  administered intravenously or 
intramuscularly in mice, LD 50 values of 520 and 475 mg/kg were determined 
respectively  [18]. In another mice study, Artesunate  exhibited a higher intravenous LD 50 
of 699 mg/kg [18]. Rats exhibited a slightly lower intravenous LD 50 at 488mg/kg  [27]. 
Maximum tolerated intravenous doses for guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, dogs and monkeys were 
240, 160, 80 and 60 mg/kg, respectively, and the minimum lethal doses for these 
spec ies were found to be 480, 640, 480 and 160 mg/kg, respectively  [18]. Toxicity 
symptoms observed included CNS effects (depression, unstable gait, tremor, 
convulsions) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_278875]  [18, 28] . Oral administration of Artesunate  
was better tolerated and resulted in LD 50 values of approximately 1000- 1300 mg/kg in 
mice, and 600- 900 mg/kg in rats. In dogs, reticulocyte counts were decreased at doses 
of ≥80 mg/kg, while histopathology showed some liver damage at ≥120 mg/kg [18].  
 
2.4.2  Sub -acute (Repeated Dose) Toxicity  
In repeated -dose toxicity studies, intravenous administration of Artesunate  to dogs at 
doses of 10 and 40 mg/kg for 14 days did not produce clinical symptoms or significant  
hematological, biochemical or histopathological changes  [18]. Similar results were 
obtained in monkeys given daily 10 and 32 mg/kg intravenous injections for 14 days 
[18]. In rats, intravenous administration of Artesunate  for 3 consecutive days at doses of 
up to 240 mg/kg induced a dose -dependent decrease in reticulocyte numbers, as well as 
decreases in erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin  [18]. The decrease in 
reticulocyte numbers was generally the most sensitive measure of Artesunate  effects, 
since  statistical significance of the difference to the treatment controls was reached in 
females at 7.5 and in males at 15 mg/kg. At doses ≥60 mg/kg, body weight was also 
depressed  [18]. Lastly, when Artesunate  was administered intramuscularly to rats at a 
daily dose of 50 mg/kg for [ADDRESS_595835] or second dose. Body weight also decreased over the treatment time. However, all these effects were reversible upon cessation of treatment  [18].  
 
2.4.3  Subchronic Toxicity  
A 3-month study of orally administered Artesunate  (6mg/kg) in d ogs revealed no 
neurotoxicity  [25]. Nor were any gross pathological changes observed. There was, 
however, evidence of some damage to the mitochondrial ultra -structure when studied 
using an electron microscope  [25].  
 
2.4.4  Organ and system toxicities  
Artemisinins exhibit a distinctive embryotoxicity that has a very steep dose -response 
relationship  [18]. In rats, treatment with Artesunate  and other artemisinin deriv atives 
results in large embryonic losses at modest doses  . In mice, 100% resorptions were 
observed at a dose of 21.4 mg/kg, while in rats and rabbits, resorptions were observed in 
A Phase I Study of intravaginally administered Artesunate  in women with high grade cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN2/3)

Version 6.0: August 7, 2017   Page 15 
 over 90% of rats and rabbits at doses of 10.7 and 2.7 mg/kg, respectively  [29]. An 
embryo -fetal no -observable -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of  8mg/kg was recently 
established in rats  [30]. Importantly, no artemisinin -induced embryotoxicity has been 
reported in humans  [24]. This is remarkable because malaria treatment in much of 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_464806]  [31]. The parasite is widely thought to have a protective effect against 
artemisinin -induced decrease in reticulocyte count which is a mark er for erythropoietic 
toxicity  [31]. In any case, the use of Artesunate  and other artemisinins in the first 
trimester of pregnancy is contraindicated based on observations of embryotox icity 
between gestation days 9 –11 in mice, 6 –15 in rats, 7 –18 rabbits, and 26 -36 in monkeys  
[32].  
 
Neurotoxicity associated with artemisinins appears to be not only dependent on the 
dose, but also on the route of administration and the particular artemisinin derivative [24]. The vehicle used to deliver the drug is also important with the water -soluble 
Artesunate  showing markedly less neurotoxicity in laboratory animals than the oil -
soluble arteether and artemether presumably because of the slower release and 
distribution of the latter compounds in blood plasma  [24]. In mice, neurotoxic effects of 
Artesunate  and DHA in a 28 -day or al study were observed at a dose of >200 mg/kg/day  
[33]. Other effects included sedation at doses ≥200 mg/kg in mice and lower body 
temperature in rats at a dose of 450 mg/kg, and in rabbits and dogs at doses of >160 
mg/kg. In rabbits, respi[INVESTIGATOR_464807] ≥320 mg/kg, without any changes in the blood gases and blood pH  [18, 24] . In mice, artemether in doses of 
30, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg, and Artesunate  in doses of 30, 50 and 100 mg/kg, 
administered daily as intramuscular injections for 28 days, resulted in greater mortality 
in the high dose artemether cohort, compared to mice that received Artesunate  at the 
same dose  [34]. No significant effects on body weight were observed at the lowest dose. 
In the high -dose cohorts, differences in body weight were apparent between artemether 
and Artesunate  [34]. Neurological observations at the high dose showed a clear 
distinction between Artesunate , which had practically no ill effect, and artemether, 
which elicited neurologic effects in 90% of treated animals. Lastly, olfactory responses, 
scored as the time needed to find food, were significantly impaired in the artemether but not in the Artesunate -treated groups  [18, 34]. Overall, artemether appeared to have 
greater impact on neurological parameters than Artesunate , and intramuscular injection 
appeared to elicit more side effects than oral formulations  [18, 24, 33, 34]  .  
 
Hematopoietic toxicities are either erythropoietic or leukopoietic. In animal 
experiments, artemisinins effects on erythropoiesis are frequently encountered  [24, 31] . 
The effects are however mild and reversible in humans  [31]. The data on artemisinin 
effects on leukocytes are contrad ictory, with some authors describing suppressed 
immune response, while others reported enhancements such as increased phagocytosis 
and interferon production  [24].

 of cardiotoxicity in dogs, no impairment of heart function has  been observed in 
numerous malarial therapy trials in humans  [24].  
 
Finally, at an elevated dosage of 240mg/kg/day (i.v. for 3 days), Artesun ate causes renal 
failure and tubular necrosis in rats that were not infected with malaria  [35]. The 
nephrotoxic effects were however reversible.  
 2.[ADDRESS_595836] conducted several nonclinical 
studies to evaluate the cytotoxic, apoptotic and anti -tumor activity of Artesunate  and its 
active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The effects of a rtemisinin, Artesunate , and 
DHA were studied on a panel of cell lines including primary, HPV -immortalized, and 
cervical tumor cell lines. Both HPV -immortalized and cervical tumor cell lines are 
sensitive to DHA and Artesunate . These cells express higher levels of transferrin 
receptor and intracellular iron as compared to normal ectocervical cells. Iron is required for the drug -induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of 
caspases, and subsequent apoptosis  [23].

In the clinical setting of SCCx and its precursor lesion, CIN2/3, expression of both the 
E6 and E7 viral proteins is constitutive, and functionally required to maintain the 
transformed state [ 37, 38]. Cell surface expression of the transferrin receptor is 
increased in cells expressing these oncoproteins  [21]. Because internalization of DHA is 
mediated in part by [CONTACT_464855], we tested the effect of DHA on normal cells, on E6 - 
and E7 - transformed cells, on epi[INVESTIGATOR_464811] E6 or E7, but were 
not transformed, and on HPV cancer ce ll lines SiHa, CaSki, and HeLa.   
 As shown in Figure 1C, DHA had a strong cytotoxic effect on all cells expressing E6 or 
E7, regardless of whether they were frankly malignant. On the other hand, DHA had no 
effect on the viability of normal cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (Figure 1C).  
 
2.5.2  In vitro  apoptosis assay  
Correlation of transferrin receptor level with DHA sensitivity  
It is known that the antimalarial activity of Artesunate  and DHA depends on the high 
intraparasitic iron content  [11]. The same panel of cells as in Figu re 1C was examined for 
transferrin receptor level and cellular iron content. Cells, at a concentration of 1 x 10
6, 
were cultured for 24 hours and harvested for Western blot analysis (with anti -
transferrin receptor antibody, 1:1000) to determine the level o f transferrin receptor. As 
shown in Figure 2A, the blot shows a clear increase in the amount of transferrin receptor 
in HPV -immortalized and tumorigenic cell lines (1.7 - to 2.5 -fold) than corresponding 
normal cells (HCX) . The increased level of transferrin  receptor in vitro correlates with 
in vivo  data showing increased transferrin receptors in high -grade cervical lesions and 
cancers as measured by [CONTACT_9064] [ 21, 22, 39].  
 Transferrin receptor overexpression correlated with total intracellular iron as measured 
by [CONTACT_464856]  [23]. HeLa cells contained 
50% more iron th an normal cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], i.e. 1.[ADDRESS_595843] not been able to quantify the level of 
ferrous iron, the form that reacts with the DHA endoperoxide bond to generate ROS  
[23]. It is possible that there is a greater difference in the level of ferrous iron in the 
normal and HPV -expressing cells. In addition, because HPV -expressing cells are 
sensitized  to apoptosis by [CONTACT_941] E6 and E7 proteins, it is conceivable that slight increases 
in iron content may amplify toxicity of DHA in HPV -infected cells.

Version 6.0: August 7, [ADDRESS_595844] evidence for the role of iron in DHA -induced cytotoxicity, a 
study was conducted involving an iron chelator -  desferrioxamine (DFOM). HeLa cells , 
at a concentration of 2 x 104, were incubated for 6 hours with DFOM at concentrations 
ranging from 0 to 200 µM. Media containing DHA  at concentrations of up to 150 µM 
and DFOM at the original concentration were subsequently added and incubated for 24 
hours before cell viability was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2B, DHA cytotoxicity was 
reversed in a dose -dependent manner, indicating an es sential role for iron. To 
circumvent potential toxicity associated with prolonged exposure of cells to desferrioxamine [40], these experiments were repeated with increased amounts of 
DHA, and decreasing exposure from [ADDRESS_595845] of desferrioxamine on cell viability.  
 
Figure 2.  Transferrin receptor levels correlate with DHA sensitivity and iron -dependent toxicity in HeLa 
cells. (A) The same panel of cells as in Fig. 1C was analyzed by [CONTACT_464857]. A clear increase in the amount of transferrin receptor in immortalized and tumorigenic cell lines as 
compared with normal cells (HCX) was observed. Dens itometry was done on the scanned image; numbers 
below the lanes, increase in transferrin receptor levels when HCX was set at 1. Jurkat cell extract was 
included as a positive control. (B) Viability of desferrioxamine pre -treated HeLa cells exposed to DHA. 
DFOM  antagonized the cytotoxic effects of DHA and increased cell survival in a dose -dependent manner 
with >85% cell survival when the cells were pretreated with 200 µM desferrioxamine. Each point 
represents the mean cell viability of three wells from exper iments carried out in triplicate.  
 
DHA dose -dependent increase in presence of iron -dependent reactive 
oxygen species  
To determine whether the DHA cytotoxicity observed in HeLa cells was a function of generation of iron -dependent ROS, the induction of ROS in HeLa cells was measured by 
a non -fluorescent probe, 6 -carboxy -2V, 7V -dihydrofluorescein -diacetate. This probe is 
oxidized by [CONTACT_464858] a fluorescent compound, 2V, 7V -dichlorofluorescein 
to provide a measurable indicator for the level of ROS . HeLa cells, at a concentration of 
1 x 10
6, were incubated for 1 hour in 5 µM 6 -carboxy -2V, 7V -dihydrofluoresceindiacetate 
in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM). Subsequently, the probe was removed 
by [CONTACT_464859]. Cells were incubated with either fresh DMEM, 
DMEM + DHA (25 or 100 µM) or DMEM containing 150 µM DFOM and DHA ( 25 or

(FACS) analysis.  
 
As shown in the left panel of Figure 3A, The DH A-treated HeLa cells demonstrated a 
dose -dependent increase in fluorescence (2 -fold and 4.2 -fold at 25 and 100 µM doses, 
respectively), indicating an increase in production of ROS in response to DHA treatment. This increase in ROS was abrogated when the ce lls were pretreated with 
DFOM as shown in the right panel of Figure 3A. Altogether, these data underscore the essential role for intracellular iron in mediating the cytotoxic effects of DHA, via 
generation of ROS.  
 
DHA -induced apoptosis 
We further hypothe sized that the cytotoxicity mediated by [CONTACT_464860]. This is based on the observation that DHA -treated 
cervical cancer cells ceased proliferating, rounded up, and detached from the plate, 
suggesting an apopto tic process.

2.5.3  In vivo activity of DHA in a canine oral mucosa model  
To determine whether in vitro activities of DHA shown in previous sections were 
applicable in vivo , a canine oral papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (COPV) mod el was used. This animal 
model emulates the effects of HPV on the mucosal sites in human  [41] and has been 
previously used for efficacy evaluation of papi[INVESTIGATOR_464816]. In this model, 100% 
of challenged animals become infected and develop tumors. Canine oral papi[INVESTIGATOR_464817] 4 –8 weeks following inoculation, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_464818] 4 -8 weeks  [42].  
 
The maxillary buccal mucosae of six 10- week -old, female beagles were abraded with a 
sterile wire brush. Wart homogenate containing 500 ng (based on L1 concentration) of oncogenic COPV was then applied to the excoriated mucosa with a cotton swab. After 24 
hours, the infected areas of three beagles were treated topi[INVESTIGATOR_223456] 2.22 mg DHA dissolved in 100 µL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (78 mM) . The infected areas of the 
other three beagles were treated with 100 µL DMSO as the placebo control. Treatment was applied once daily, five times a week, for 6 weeks.  
 
Figure 4A depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039] a schematic of viral challenge, drug treatment, tumor appearance, and 
tumor regression. In all control animals, tumors appeared approximately 3
 weeks after 
the COPV challenge. Figure 4B is a photograph of virus -infected dogs treated with 
DMSO (left) or DHA (right) at [ADDRESS_595846], DHA treatment abolished tumor formation in two of three infected animals. The lesions that developed in the DHA -treated animal (dog 5) underwent regression 2 
weeks earlier than those in the animals treated with DMSO alone, although the mass was of comparable size to those in control animals.

images of dogs with and without tumor formation.  
 
Although the study sample size was small, precluding statistical analysis, it should be 
emphasized that the COPV model resulted in a 100% tumor formation rate during 
decades of working with this model by [CONTACT_48990]. Thus, the absence of tumors in [ADDRESS_595849] -challenge identified 
a similar mucosal ‘‘roughness’’ in all of the challenged dogs, including the DHA -treated 
animals, indicative of early papi[INVESTIGATOR_464819]. We postulated that DHA might be inhibiting tumor formation rather than virus infection.  
 To determine whether the DHA -treated dogs had a subclinical viral infection, serum 
samples obtained at the end of the trial were used to detect and quantify antibody 
responses to t he L1 viral capsid protein. Serum samples were analyzed for 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_464820]. The results are shown in Figure 5B. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_464821] -treated dog developed a tumor, all DHA -
treated animals developed antib ody titers against the L1 protein, suggesting that the 
tumor -free animals indeed had been infected with virus and that the virus had 
replicated and synthesized significant amounts of L1 protein. These data suggest that 
DHA inhibits tumor formation rather than viral replication. As anticipated, all of the

 control animals also developed antibodies to L1, which is normally observed during the 
natural regression of these tumors.

than the tumors in DMSO -treated  dogs. (B)  ELISA results from dog serum collected during the last week

Dogs [ADDRESS_595850] L1, su ggesting DHA can inhibit 
tumor formation without inhibiting the initial infection or replication of the virus.  
 
In summary, and taking into account the large body of clinical experience garnered from 
the use of systemically administered Artesunate  for the treatment of acute malaria, these 
data provide rationale for the use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_464823], intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_464824].

Version 6.0: August 7, [ADDRESS_595851] 5 -fold higher than the suppository dosing 
proposed in this clinical trial. Rectal suppository formulations are approved for use as a 
second -line treatment for acute malarial infections in children, and used off -label in 
adults, who cannot tolerate oral administration and are distant from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]  
[4]. For severe malaria during pregnancy, there is less certainty about the safety of 
Artesunate  during the first trimester, but Artesunate  is recommended as first -line 
therapy during the second and third trimesters  [43]. Two reports submitted to the FDA 
by [CONTACT_464862] h 
artemisinin and its derivatives, including Artesunate  [4, 17, 18, 29].  
 For young children of less than 5 years of age, r ectal Artesunate  suppository 
administered at a single dose of 10 mg/kg is the only WHO recommended safe pre-
referral treatment for severe malaria. Rectal suppository dosing has also been tested in 
adults, including regimens of 500 mg/day for 5 consecutive days  [44]. No local or 
serious systemic side effects have been reported at these doses. The initial starting intravaginal supp ository doses proposed, 50 mg ( ≤1 mg/kg in individuals who weigh 
≥[ADDRESS_595852] inclusion criterion for this study) and the highest proposed dose, 200 
mg ( ≤4 mg/kg) are approximately [ADDRESS_595853] included 
mild gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and tinnitus, albeit with weak evidence of 
association [45]. There have also been reports of transient reticulocytopenia, 
neutropenia and elevated liver enzyme values, though none has been considered to be of 
clinical significance [45]. Electrocardiographic abnormalities such as bradycardia and 
prolongation of the QT interval, have been reported but again, no impairment of heart function has been observed in numerous malarial therapy trials in humans  [24, 45] . 
The only potentially serious adverse effects that have been convincingly associated with administration of artemisinin compounds are the type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in 
approximately 1 in 3000 patients  [46]. In nonclinical studies in mice, CN S effects have 
been observed; however, such effects have not been observed in humans. Because  the 
dosage evaluated in mice (100 mg/kg, i.m., artemotil and artemether) is at least 6 fold 
higher than therapeutic doses in humans, these toxicities are likely  of little clinical 
relevance (see nonclinical toxicology section 2.4 above).  
 
With regard to strong nonclinical evidence of artemisinin compounds -induced 
embryotoxicity, the tight relationship to a specific period of the gestational cycle has 
informed the contraindication of their usage during the first trimester of pregnancy in 
humans  [29, 32] . Importantly, in malaria treatment, there is no evidence for adverse 
effects on the fetus following exposure during the second and third trimesters, when 
these d rugs are recommended depending on the safety profile of the partner drug in the 
artemisinin -based combination treatment  [45]. This recommendation can be

 sidestepped in cases of severe malaria where artemisinin  derivatives are clearly superior 
in terms of life- saving efficacy  [45]. Prospective tracking of over 1000 pregnancies did 
not reveal any significant adverse effects following artemisinins’ use during the 2nd and 
3rd trimesters  [47, 48].  
 
Finally, a rtemisinins are generally well tolerated and human studies with the various 
drugs used in combinatorial therapy against malaria have not revealed major clinical 
concerns regarding untoward drug interactions. However, because such interactions are 
peculiar to the compounds themselves, each potential drug interaction has to be 
considered on its own  [18, 49].  
 
In this clinical protocol, intra- vaginal Artesunate  suppo sitories will be tested. Direct 
application to the mucosal surface at the doses we propose is unlikely to result in significant systemic absorption. While there are no published pharmacologic data for 
intra -vaginal administration of Artesunate  suppositories, clinical pharmacology of 
Artesunate  and its metabolite DHA following rectal, IV, IM, and oral administration are 
well documented in the anti- malaria literature  [4, 18, 24, 28, 50-52]. Years of 
pharmacokinetic data already performed with Artesunate  informed the choice of in tra-
vaginal dosing  [49-51, 53, 54].  A review of c linical toxicology and pharmacology 
assessments of Artesunate  and its metabolite DHA is summarized in Table 1.  
 Artesunate  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y absorbed, with peak plasma levels occurring 1.5 h, 2 h and 0.5 h 
after oral, rectal and intramuscular administration, respectively  [3, 55-58].  It is almost 
entirely converted to its active metabolite DHA  [59].  Elimination of Artesunate  is very 
rapid, and its activity is determined by [CONTACT_464863],  which has a half -life of 
approximately 45 min [11, 52].

 Based on clinical safety studies of Artesunate  in the U.S.  [62], tests on daily IV boluses 
of up to 8 mg/kg of Artesunate  did not result in dose -limit ing toxicities  [55].  At 8 
mg/kg, a transient, reduced reticulocyte count had been observed, but resolved  without intervention over a timeframe of 4 -7 days  [24].  Drug concentrations did not accumulate 
in subjects receiving multiple daily IV treatments, corroborating with known rapid elimination r ates for artemisinin derivatives  [50].  A significantly lower maximum 
plasma concentration after intra- vaginal administration is expected, compared to IV 
administration. This prediction is based on the pharmacokinetic studies of IM Artesunate  [52], in which the rate of tissue absorption slows drug distribution; on 
average, one thirtieth and one fifth of C
max observed by [CONTACT_464867], respectively. The differences between Artesunate  and its principal metabolite are 
due to a combination of differences in solubility, and to rapid conversion of Artesunate  
to DHA  [52].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_464825], rapid 
elimination following intra -vaginal  administration would be expected, as seen with IM 
administration  [52].

cohort of subjects will be a run -in of three patients receiving 50mg suppositories.  If no 
mucosal or systemic adverse events are reported, we will proceed with 200mg dosing.  
 A five- day dosing regimen with a single dose of  200 mg per  24-hour period is selected 
based on the clinical toxicology and pharmacology database from anti -malarial and 
cancer trials  as well as  the performance data presented on the inhibition of HPV infected 
cells in vitro and in vivo . We anticipate that intra -vaginal administration of 200 mg 
Artesunate  suppositories to the cervix w ill provide a local drug concentration well above 
IC
50 of HPV -infected cells .  Based on our experimental experience in non clinical studies, 
we plan to assess more than one 5 -day treatme nt cycle  to explore potential dosing 
regimen s suitable for subsequent phases of clinical studies .   
 The doses selected for this study are 50 mg and 200 mg. A dose  level of 200 mg is 
equivalent to ≤ 4mg/kg based on a minimum body weight of [ADDRESS_595858]  inclusion 
criterion.  The proposed dose level should be extremely safe as it is  well within WHO 
recommended pre- referral dose for parenteral Artesunate  treatment of severe malaria in 
young children; that is a single dose of 10mg/ kg body weight .  The  proposed dosing 
regimen  also resembles  WHO recommen ded multi -day dosing  regimen  for adults and 
children with severe malaria upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; that is 2.4 mg/kg IV or IM TID on day 
1 (or 7.2 mg/kg) and continued daily dosing  at 2.4mg/kg for a total of 7 days  [43].  Due 
to the rapid rate of elimination  in vivo , negligible systemic accumulation of Artesunate  
or DHA metabolite is expected over multi- day dosing , especially in the case of local 
administration . 
 In summary, l ocal intravaginal administration of  Artesunate  as a suppository at the 
highest dose in this study, 200 mg or approximately ≤ 4 mg/kg is not expected to cause 
any systemic toxicity . Although no serious adverse events are antici pated with the 
proposed doses, dose escalation will only occur if no mucosal or systemic adverse events 
are reported in the first cohort of three subjects who receive the lowest dose. S ubject s 
will be monitored for any unexpected adverse  events locally and systemically.

4.2 Known Potential Benefits  
This study  is designed to assess safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using Artesunate  
suppositories in  women with CIN2/[ADDRESS_595861] will be expanded  (see 
Section 12 for details) .  At each vaginal exam, cervical swabs will be obtained and 
cryopreserved.  Peripheral blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_464869], and at 
study weeks 5, 15, an d 28, 41, and the postop visit , and will be cryopreserved for 
assessment of biomarkers.  
 This clinical cohort, healthy subjects with colposcopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]- directed, biopsy -confirmed 
CIN2/3, was selected for safety reasons. The study protocol window (15 weeks), i s within 
the standard of care.  In pregnant women who have a cervical HSIL, the standard of care is to follow colposcopi[INVESTIGATOR_464826] [ 7]. We and others have reported that the 
probability that CIN2/3 will progress in this timeframe is essentially zero [ 63]. In fact, 
A Phase I Study of intravaginally administered Artesunate  in women with high grade cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN2/3)  
 ________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version 6.0: August 7, [ADDRESS_595862] also reported that in this timeframe, approximately 20 -25% of 
CIN2/3 lesions associated with HPV16 will undergo regression  [63].  Lesions that are 
associated with HPV genotypes other than HPV16 are even more likely to regress in this 
timeframe [64].  Moreover, in this population, it is feasible to visualize directly, 
quantitate serially, and perform therapeutic resection of premalignant lesions.   Based on 
safety and tolerability data in pediatric populations receiving intrarectal s uppositories at 
a dose that is approximately five -fold compared to the regimen we propose in this 
clinical pr otocol , we do not expect dose -limiting toxicities with the dosage and regimen 
proposed in this proof -of-principle study. The Trimble group has a decade of experienc e 
in the design and execution of prospective clinical protocols specific for this patient cohort, testing immunotherapeutic interventions prior to standard therapeutic resection of any residual lesions. [ 65, 66]. The parallel design of this trial will allow comparison of 
tissue -based endpoints in this cohort.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_464827], it is still not clear what measures of imm une response are relevant to lesion regression.  In 
particular, it does not appear that classic measures of immune response, measured in the circulation, correlate at all with clinical response.  Because the biology of HPV 
disease is extensively characterized; because there are known, quantifiable risk factors 
for persistence and progression of disease; because we have ready access to an immunocompetent population of patients at elevated risk for carcinoma development; 
and because we can directly visualize and subsequently therapeutically resect and 
analyze affected tissue; we are presented with an opportunity to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_464828], characterize relevant immune responses, and provide direction 
for future interventions, both in this disease and in other tumor models.  The relatively 
long precursor phase in HPV disease also provides many opportunities for intervention, 
including, optimally, prophylaxis against the development of cancer.  
A larger goal of these clinical trials is to correlate m easures of immune response with 
known clinical parameters of disease. The larger implications of this effort lie in the identification of appropriate and relevant measures of the mucosal immune 
microenvironment. The identification of intermediate biomarker s in the tissue not only 
serves to further our understanding of the immune response and our efforts to manipulate it, but also has practical implications in the setting of monitoring patients at risk for disease recurrence or progression.  In the case of h igh grade cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601], lesion size and viral load are both quantifiable risk factors for persistent and progressive HPV disease.  Therefore in these trials we will quantitate both outcome measures sequentially and correlate them with  local tissue and peripheral 
measures of immune response.

is well -tolerated in women with CIN2/3.

 The primary obj ective  is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the intra -vaginal 
administration  of Artesunate  in study subjects.   
 
The secondary objective is to explore clinical activity, such as clearance of HPV dis ease, 
corresponding to intra -vaginal administration of Artesunate .  
 7.0 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES  
7.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_464870], including dose related limiting 
AEs. Subjects will be monitored for the appearance of erythema, itching, burning, pain, 
infection, desquamation, tenesm us, bleeding, dizziness, and any unexpected AEs.  
7.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
Indicators of drug efficacy (see below) will be drawn from any evidence demonstrating a significant difference (by [CONTACT_464871] -square analysis; p<0.1) between treated subjects 
and the baseline data in the Johns Hopkins Colposcopy database  
 
• Extent of lesion cl earance (by [CONTACT_464872], size, and/or area of coverage)  
• Presence/absence of HPV DNA  
• Regression of CIN stage by [CONTACT_26745] (comparison of initial biopsy to LEEP /cone excisi on-procured tissue).  
 
Histologic regression will be judged as none (persistent CIN2/3 in week 15 resection              
specimen ) or total (no CIN2/3 in resection specimen).   
 
Virologic HPV viral load.  Longitudinally obtained cervical swabs will be used to 
quantitate HPV viral load as a continuous variable.   
 Tissue sections from the diagnostic biopsy obtained as part of the screening process, and 
from the resection specimen obtained post -treatment will be assessed for expression of 
CD8 (effector T cells), CD71 (transferrin receptor), and cleaved caspase 3 (apoptotic cell death).  
 
8.0 STUDY DESIGN  
Prior to enrollment, patients referred for evaluation of an  HSIL pap smear will undergo 
a full colposcopic evaluation, with biopsy confirmation.  Clinical, histopathologic, 
virologic, and immunologic parameters will be assessed longitudinally in each study 
participant, as outlined below.  The trial is a dose -escalation  design, with a run -in cohort 
to assess the likelihood of mucosal irritation.  
These serial assessments will directly parallel those obtained in the currently open CIN2/3  cohort study (JHMI JCCI# 99 -08-27-04).  Those patients who have measurable 
disease after biopsy will be eligible for study participation.

Version 6.0: August 7, 2017   Page 33 
 Cervical tissue specimens obtained as routine diagnostic and therapeutic specimens will 
be analyzed to characterize local tissue immune response.  Diagnostic biopsies obtained 
at initial colposcopy will be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIN2/3.   The initial 
diagnostic biopsy specimens will also be characterized in terms of type and quantitation 
of inflammatory cell infiltrates.  Immunocytochemical techniques will be used to 
determine presence and numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells,  B cells, and 
NK cells.  We will also use standard staining techniques to detect cleaved caspase 3. As 
tissue availability permits, the specimens will also be analyzed for other immune cells.  We will be comparing tissue profiles with those obtained on cir culating PBLs in our 
study population.  In the post - suppository administration, therapeutic LEEP /cone 
biopsy  specimens, markers of local tissue immune response will be similarly 
characterized and quantitated.  [CONTACT_464883] will review all of the histologic  slides.  
 9.0 STUDY POPULATION AND  ENROLLMENT  
Patients with high -grade cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] (CIN2/3) will participate in this 
study.  At Johns Hopkins,  patients will be recruited from the Johns Hopkins Colposcopy 
Service, and from referring physici ans.  Annually, the Colposcopy Service treats over 
800 patients, approximately 15% of whom have high -grade lesions.  In terms of 
feasibility, over the past [ADDRESS_595864] recruited nearly 500 patients for screening to our cohort and vaccine studies, whic h consists of the same study population as the one 
described for this interventional trial.    Of the HSIL patients approached for study entry, 80% have consented for screening.  Of the patients who consented for screening, 33% were African American.  This  percentage is representative of our colposcopy 
population.  It is anticipated that as therapeutic options become available through the upcoming Phase I trial, that referral volume will continue to increase.

10.1 Screening  
All subjects will receive medical care that is routine to clinical practice.  
 
Drs. Trimble  (JHU) and Levinson (GBMC) and the study nurse s or coordinators  will 
recruit patients at the time they are seen for their initial clinical evaluation, or when they 
return to discuss their colposcopy results.  All eligible patients will be asked if they 
would like to be screened for participation in this clinical trial.  Dr s. Trimble  and 
Levinson  and the study nurse s or coordinators  will be res ponsible for recruiting study 
participants and for obtaining written informed consent.  They will allow as much time as necessary to review the consent forms with subjects, and to allow them to ask

investigator.  
Demographic data/medical history  
The patient’s age, weight, height, and ethnicity will be ascertained at the screening visit.  Information will be collected on the patient’s past significant medical history including 
tobacco exposure, gynecologic and obstetric history including contracept ive use, total 
and current number of partners, and current medical status.    
History of HPV disease  
The following information will be noted at the screening visit:  
• month/year of detection of CIN lesions  
• Details of previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_464830]; at the screening visit, and at weeks 6, 15, 28.   Exfoliated cell samples will be obtained using Digene swabs at the time 
of colposcopy, for HPV typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Specimens for HPV geno typi[INVESTIGATOR_464831], Nichols Institute.  Specimens for quantitation of HPV viral load should be directed to the GYN biorepository, where they will be processed and 
cryopreserved for batch analysis.  Swabs of cervical secretions will be banked in the 
tissue bank.  Cervical lymphocyte samples will be processed directly.  
 
LEEP/Cone Excisional Biopsy P rocedure  
After week 15, if there is residual colposcopic disease, the affected area will be excised 
using standard LEEP or cold knife cone technique.  The res ection specimens will be 
taken fresh to surgical pathology.  Frozen section will be performed to confirm the 
presence or absence of CIN2/3.  The frozen section block will be banked at – 70°C, and a 
sliver of tissue immediately facing the frozen section will be reserved for isolation of 
immune cells. This will allow unhampered routine diagnostic ability as well as preserve 
tissue sections frozen for characterization of inflammatory cell infil trates.  Routinely 
processed formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded sections will also be analyzed for the 
characterization and quantitation of tissue infiltrates.    
Peripheral blood samples  
Blood will be drawn at various visits as noted in the protocol for an alysis of various 
parameters and markers.  The volume of blood will vary depending on the tests to be 
performed.

Patients will be monitored throughout the study for both known potential risks and for 
unexpected risks.  During office visits, patients will be monitored specifically for any 
signs of:  
• Symptoms of itching, bur ning, pain, warmth, or tenesmus  
• Signs of skin breakdown including erythema, blistering, desquamation, ulceration or bleeding  
• Neurologic symptoms  
• Unexpected adverse events  
 Subjects will be given diary cards to record local and general signs and symptoms mo st 
likely to occur  between office visits .  The diary cards will be collected, signs and 
symptoms verified, and inserted into the CRF at each subsequent visit.   
Subjects who become pregnant during study will be required to discontinue the use of suppositor ies.  Subjects removed from the study will be replaced in the treatment group. 
Although not considered an adverse event, pregnancy will be reported in the same way.  
Whenever possible, a pregnancy should be followed to term, and the status of mother 
and ch ild reported.  The Pregnancy Notification form will be sent by [CONTACT_464877]  
([CONTACT_464883]) and to the sponsor (Frantz Viral Therapeutics)  within 48 hours of discovery.  Whenever possible, the Follow -up Pregnancy Outcome Form will be filled 
after delivery.   
  11.5 Management of Toxicities  
All local reactions will be considered causally related to administration of the suppositories.  Causality of all other adverse events will be assessed individually.  We

The rate at which invasive cancer develops from CIN is slow and can take years and 
perhaps decades [ 49]. The fifteen -week treatment study window precedes the standard 
LEEP or cone excisional biopsy procedure given to the targeted study population, and

 12.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
 
12.1  Study Design/Endpoints/Accrual  
The primary statistical outcome of the trial is safety. The treatment groups will be 
filled sequentially in a non -blinded manner. Study dropouts will be replaced.  
The dose escalation algorithm is described as follows  (see Table [ADDRESS_595887] ed): 
1. A run-in cohort of three patients  will be treated  with  one [ADDRESS_595888] suppository, then the dose level will be considered safe.  
With th e dose escalation algorithm, there will be less than 9% probability to 
escalate to the next higher dose level if the DLT rate for the current dose level is 30%.

Version 6.0: August 7, [ADDRESS_595889] decreases in viral load (from baseline at Week 
15) and lesion clearance to CIN1 or less  will be selected  (see Section 12.2 for 
details) . If none of the safe doses achieve si gnificance for decrease in viral load and 
lesion clearance , a decision will be made based on the totality of safety and efficacy 
profiles of the dose levels considered safe.   
A cohort of 12 patients will be enrolled and treated at the selected dose level a t the 
expansion phase to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Artesunate . 
 
12.2  Secondary  Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include change in histology ( CIN2/3  or no CIN2/3 ) at week 
[ADDRESS_595890] been shown to be modulated in response to intervention in other trial s.[67]  The histologic al outcome will be determined by [CONTACT_464879].  HPV viral load will be ascertained from longitudinally obtained cervical cell samples, using 
quantitative PCR. [68]  This data will be used to estimate the regression rate within  
the fifteen -week window  in the exploratory analysis . 
Secondary endpoints will also include change in lesion size by [CONTACT_280967], and 
characterization of peripheral and local tissue response to the suppository.  These measures will be correlated with clinic al response, and with preclinical 
experimental data  in the exploratory analysis .  In every case possible, changes in 
lesion size by [CONTACT_464880] .  Measures of immune response will be ascertained on serially 
obtained peripheral blood specimens, and on flash frozen tissue from the therapeutic resection specimens.  
 
To test that HPV viral load is different during and after treatment as compared to 
before treatment, paired t -tests and si gned rank tests will be used.  L og 
transformation (or other appropriate transform) will be performed to symmetrize 
the distributions  and achieve normality .  For each of these variables, a paired t -test 
will be performed.  Due to the small sample size and p otential non -normality of 
the data, the non -parametric signed rank test will also be used.  The paired t -test 
tests whether or not the mean HPV viral loads at baseline and follow -up are

12.3  Other Efficacy Endpoints  
In every case possible, c hange in lesion size from week 0 to week 15 will be 
measured using serial digital colpographs.   Changes in HPV16 E7 -specific T -cell 
response (CD8) will be compared at week 0 to week 15.   Differences will be 
calculated between baseline and follow -up and the appropriate transform 
performed.  Point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing (i.e. paired t -test and signed rank test) will be done.

random effects model will be used to model the distribution of HPV viral load over time:  
hpv t tit i it =+++ βββε0 1 22 
where hpv it is individual i’s HPV viral load at week t .  Correlations between 
observations within an individual are accounted for by [CONTACT_464881] (i.e. random effect) term.  A quadratic model is used to account for non -linearity in the 
change of HPV viral load.  From the fitted model, we can estimate the effect of the vaccine treatment on viral load.  The plot below is based on simulated data and 
shows the type of result we hypothesize:  a downward trend in HPV viral load that 
flattens as time increases.  Based on the random effects model shown above, we can estimate the average response (denoted by [CONTACT_464882]) and better 
understand the association between the vaccine and response and specifically 
when changes in viral load tend to occur.

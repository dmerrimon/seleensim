WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY ? 
If you agree to participate you will be “randomized” into one of the study groups described below.  
Randomization means that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364].  It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  Neither you nor 
the researcher will choose what group you will be in.  You will have an equal chance of being given either 
type of bandage.   
 
You will receive either a standard dressing or a PI[INVESTIGATOR_64424]. The standard dressing will be a type of 
absorbent gauze. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_778806] a pump. The 
pump creates a continuous negative pressure (suction) at the incision site. The pump is battery operated, 
and is about the size of a deck of cards. The pump is attached to the dressing by a flexible tube, and the 
pump can be kept in your pocket, or you can lay it beside you. There is typi[INVESTIGATOR_778807]. The pump does make an intermittent buzzing sound.  
B

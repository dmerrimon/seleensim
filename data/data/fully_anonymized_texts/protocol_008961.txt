Signature       [CONTACT_265726], Sandoval HP   [ADDRESS_323135] already enjoyed freedom from  glasses and would like to continue after the 
cataracts are removed. Different options are available. These options include: mono -vision and 
presby[CONTACT_265717] (IOL).  
Mono -vision can be achieved using monofocal IOLs by [CONTACT_265718] -dominant eye to -1.75 (range may 
vary according to patient’s preference -1.25 to -2.50 D) and the dominant eye to plano at time of 
cataract surgery, or  postoperatively  using contact [CONTACT_13276] , or undergoing LASIK.   
Presby[CONTACT_265719] (PCIOLs) include accommodative, multifocal ( MIOLs, bi and tr ifocals ) and 
extended  depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs .   Patients’ complaints of glare and halos are common with all 
MIOLs  and EDOF . The severity of these symptoms varies  according to the actual IOL design . These 
optical phenomena  may prevent a large percentage of patients fr om choosing a PCIOL  even though they 
still want to achieve spectacle independence postoperatively  at all distances . 
Monofocal lenses correct only at the target distance chosen (i.e., distance without intermediate or near 
vision improvement or near without distance improvement). Intermediate vision has become important 
for many daily activities such as reading a mobile p hone or tablet. Tecnis Eyhance IOL, recently approved  
by [CONTACT_1622],A is a new generation of monofocal lenses designed to improve and/or enhance intermediate 
vision without compromising the distance vision with low incidence of halo, glare or starburst. Auffa rth 
et al1 in a study that included [ADDRESS_323136] monofocal IOL (ZCB00) . 
Additionally, they reported no differences between the [ADDRESS_323137] sensitivity and visual 
disturbances complains.  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes of a monofocal IOL with an enhanced 
intermediate function, in patients with or without astigmatism , when both eyes are targeted for 
emmetropia and when the non -dominant eye is targeted for mini monovision ( -0.75 D) in patients 
undergoing routine cataract surgery.  
 
1. OBJECTIVE:  
 
The main objective of this study is to  evaluate the visual outcomes of a monofocal IOL with an enhanced 
intermediate function, in patients with or without astigmatism , when both eyes are targeted for 
emmetropia and when the non -dominant eye is targeted for mini mono vision ( -0.75 D) in patients 
undergoing  routine cataract surgery.

4. Study endpoint criteria  
 
A. Patient Completion of Study: If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 5) of the 
study, he/she is considered to have completed the study.  
 
B. Patient Discontinuation: Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time 
they choose.  Study patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., 
non-compliance, failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discont inued from the study.  Study 
patients discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be 
replaced.  
 
C. Patient Termination: A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe 
adverse event that may be related to the study.  A study patient will receive appropriate 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator.  Notification of ter mination will be clearly 
documented.  These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be 
replaced.  
 
D. Study Termination: The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, 
after clinical observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he 
may stop the study.  
 
E. Study Completion: The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit [ADDRESS_323142] deviation (SD) for logMAR 
UCIVA. Assuming a SD of 0.12 (from a previous Eyhance study), for the two -sided t -test (alpha 
=0.05) for the intermediate visual acuity endpoint, we will need 31 subjects in each group 
(emmetropia / mini monovision) to detect differences of 0.1 logMAR (1 l ine difference) with 
90% power.  Total sample size = 62.  Allowing 10 % for the potential confounding factor of 
having 2 sites, and 10% assumed dropout rat e, 74 subjects will be enrolled (37 in each group). 
Table 2 summarizes the sample size estimate.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 
A. Description  
The Eyhance  IOLs (DIB00 and DIUxxx ) are monofocal refractive IOLs design ed to enhance  
intermediate distance vision without compromising distance vision.    The lens power continuously 
increases from its edge to the center extending the range of vision when compared to a standard 
monofocal IOL.  
 
B. Treatment/Dosing Regimen  
The Tecnis Eyhance IOL  is intended for primary implantation for the visual correction of aphakia 
secondary to removal of a cataractous lens in adult patients. The IOL will be implanted at time of 
uncomplicated routine cataract surgery. Intraocular lenses are implantable medical  devices and are 
intended for long term use over the lifetime of the patient.  
 
C. Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment/Dosing Groups  
Each site  will be provide d with  randomization envelopes. The envelopes will be sequentially 
numbered . 
 
D. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Since the IOL is implanted at time of cataract surgery, subject compliance will not be an issue in this 
particular study.  
 
E. Packaging, Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
An account will be set up with the manufacturer of the lens (Johnson and Johnson Vision) that will  
provide the lens at no cost to the participants. IOLs will be ordered once the subject’s qualification  
for the study has been confirmed. IOLs will be shipped to the site and will be stored and dispensed  
following the routine standard of care for cataract surgery. Unused IOLs will be returned to Johnson  
and Johnson Vision following their instructions.  
 
Or, Johnson and Johnson Vision will provide a consignment of lenses that will be stored at the site  
and unused IOLs will be returned to Johnson and Johnson Vision following their instructions at the  
 
Solomon KD, Sandoval HP   [ADDRESS_323149]’s study records including the dates and reasons for each deviation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50965] t ensure that 
all aspects of the trial are in compliance with the applicable regulatory laws and conditions of 
approval imposed by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
10. RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
The risk of being in the study is not greater than the risk of undergoing routine cataract surgery with 
implantation of monofocal intraocular lenses. However, there is always the risk that uncommon or 
previously unknown side effects may occur.  The study includes additional postoperative 
examinations at no cost.  
 
11. IN CASE OF AN INJURY RELATED TO THIS RESEARCH STUDY  
 
Every effort to prevent study -related injury will be taken by [CONTACT_139473]. In the event 
a patient is injured as a direct result of the study while following the study instructions and 
requirements, the patient will be instructed to immediate ly contact [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
study staff.  Treatment will be provided as needed for those injuries caused directly by [CONTACT_265724]. In the event of injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_98140], all 
charges for medical care provided will be billed to the patient’s insurance company. The medical 
care costs for injuries or illnesses that are not caused directly by [CONTACT_265725].  
 
12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY  
The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons outside of the 
Study.  Results will be submitted for publication and presentation at national and/or international 
meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer -review journals for publication but there is no 
guarantee of acceptance.

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 2.1 Background  
 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  infection  is a leading cause of morbidity a nd mortality among 
those with HI V-1.  Non-liver related morbidity and mortality, including cardiovascular 
outcomes, are poo rly characterized in HIV/HCV co infection. All -cause mortality is 
increa sed in HIV patients with HCV coinfection, independent of HIV disease 
progression.1 Not only liver -related, but non -liver related deaths may be reduced with 
HCV treatment.2,3 However, non -liver related outcomes in HIV/HCV co infection remain 
poorly characterized.  Large retrospective observational studies have suggested an 
increased risk of CVD events in HCV -infected individuals, both with and without HIV 
infection.4-[ADDRESS_503992], including 
hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus.7,8 Chronic immune activation, 
implicated in HIV -associated accelerated atherosclerosis, is further increased with HCV 
coinfection.9,10  
 
Endothelial function, a predictor of CVD risk, has not been adequat ely characterized in 
HIV/HCV co infection.  Endothe lial dysfunction mediates development and progression of 
atherosclerosis.[ADDRESS_503993] impaired endothelial function compared to 
non-HIV-infected patients.12 In a single small cross -sectional analysis by [CONTACT_399901], no 
difference was seen in endothelial function measured by [CONTACT_104703] -mediat ed dilation 
(FMD) in HIV/HCV co infec ted versus HIV monoinfected persons, but interpretation of 
their findings is limited by [CONTACT_399902], which 
has a clear impact on these measures.13  Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) is an 
established, non- invasive method for assessment of endothelial function that has been 
shown to both correlate with known CVD risk factors and predict CVD risk in multiple 
non-HIV infected populations.14-[ADDRESS_503994] 
  Version 4.0 
 3/22/[ADDRESS_503995] improved pred ictive utility in HIV/HCV coinfection 
include: soluble ICAM -1 (sICAM -1), soluble E -selectin (sE -selectin), lipoprotein -
associated phospholipase A2 (Lp -PLA2), D -dimer, and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6).  In large 
prospective studies, levels of these biomarkers predi cted future CVD events and were 
consistently associated with classical risk factors.23-[ADDRESS_503996] compared sICAM -1 and sE -selectin levels in HIV/HCV versus HIV - or HCV -
monoinfected controls and found higher baseline levels with HIV/HCV co infection,29,30,[ADDRESS_503997] appropriately controlled for key confounders such as HIV viremia or 
traditional CVD risk factors.  One study attempted to correlate levels of vascular 
adhesion molecules w ith endothelial dysfunction by [CONTACT_17501], but interpretation of their 
findings is similarly limited by [CONTACT_399903].13 Thus, the predictive utility of these markers remains unknown.  
 
Microparticles  (MPs) are a novel marker of endothelial dysfunction.  MPs are cell 
membrane blebs produced by [CONTACT_399904].37  While a stimulus such as infection or tissue injury is 
believed to trigger MP formation, MPs stimulate a “sterile,” self -propagating, 
inflammatory cascade. MPs are understudied in HIV infection, but T cell MP numbers correlate with  severity of hepatic disease in HCV mono -infection,
38 and endothelial cell 
MP numbers correlate strongly with degree of endothelial dysfunction in the general population.
39,40 Similar to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), MP phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_399895], but MPs can be measured on frozen plasma and are not subject to 
the same viabi lity concerns as PBMCs.  
 
Successful HCV therapy may improve CVD outcomes.  CVD risk factors such as hepatic 
steatosis and insulin resistance improve with HCV clearance.41-[ADDRESS_503998] be better characterized. There are no existing prospective, longitudinal cohorts 
designed to investigate endothelial function in this population.  It is not widely recognized by [CONTACT_399905] -produced CVD risk markers used in routine clinical 
practice may be unreliable in coinfected persons, and data characterizing non -hepatic 
markers in this population are lacking.  Through a unique, multi -disciplinary collaboration 
between the four UCLA CTSI institu tions, we will establish a HIV/HCV co infected cohort 
                                                                              [ADDRESS_503999] 
  Version 4.0 
 3/22/[ADDRESS_504000] to race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic class, and mode of HCV 
transmission, in a large catchment area,  and for whom outcomes have not been 
described.  The HIV/HCV cohort will be matched with HIV monoinfected controls, all with 
HIV suppression on stable ART, for cross -sectional and longitudinal evaluation of 
endothelial function, as well as improved charact erization of both novel and traditional 
CVD risk biomarkers.  We will conduct  novel exploratory analysis of the effect of HCV 
treatment  and virologic suppression  on endothelial function.  The project  is intended to 
generate preliminary data for application  for R01 or program project funding to continue 
the cohort and improve our understanding of CVD and metabolic o utcomes with chronic 
HIV/HCV co infection. 
 
2.2      Study Population  
There will be two study groups: Group A will be  HIV/HCV coinfected  subjects and Group 
B will be  HIV monoinfected  subjects .  All HCV coinfected subjects will have evidence of 
ongoing  HCV replication on study entry.  The HIV/HCV group may include  both HCV 
treatment -naïve subjects and  treatment -experienced subjects who have failed pr ior HCV 
therapy , as ongoing HCV replication, irrespective of prior HCV treatment, is believed to 
be the primary driver of HCV -associated chronic inflammation and immune activation 
and end- organ disease.  To control for the effect of HIV infection on the outcomes of 
interest, all subjects are to have undetectable HIV RNA (<50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) and CD4 cell 
count ≥ 200 cells/mm3.  All HCV genotypes are permitted in the study. Subjects who  
initiate  HCV treatment following study entry are included to allow exploratory analysis of  
the potential benefit of HCV treatment and virologic clearance on CVD.  
 
2.3 Selection of PAT as measure of endothelial function and correlate for CVD risk.  
 Endothelial dysfunction represents an early stage of coronary
 artery disease (CAD).[ADDRESS_504001] demonstrated 
changes in endothelial function measured by [CONTACT_399906] 1 year or less, including with 
interventions.49-51 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal study of two groups, Group A, HIV/HCV 
coinfected  subjects and Group B, HIV monoinfected subjects .   The HIV/HCV subjects 
                                                                              [ADDRESS_504002] 
  Version 4.0

will be  frequency -matched to the HIV monoinfected subjects by [CONTACT_654] (<40, 40 -49, 50 -54, 
and ≥55 years) , race  (white, black, other) , sex  at birth , diabetes  (yes/no), smoking status  
(current  or not) , HMG Co -A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) and hormonal therapy use, and 
CD4 cell count  (200-349 and ≥350 cells/mm3) at baseline.  All subjects will be followed 
for a minimum of 1 year.  A subset of the HIV/HCV  coinfected group are expected to 
initiate HCV treatment dur ing this time and will be followed through up to 24 weeks 
following end of HCV treatment.  All subjects will be included in baseline cross -sectional 
analysis of endothelial function, measured by [CONTACT_28189] (PAT) and 
laboratory testing fo r circulating CVD biomarkers. All subjects  will have follow- up PAT 
and laboratory testing and clinical follow -up.  Those HIV/HCV coinfected that do not 
begin HCV treatment and all HIV moninfected will have follow -up PAT and laboratory 
testing at 1 year.  T hose HIV/HCV coinfected who begin HCV treatment will have follow -
up PAT and laboratory testing at  4 weeks after end of HCV treatmen t, but will be 
followed clinically for up to 24 weeks after end of treatment to capture complete HCV treatment response data.

non-fasting state, they should be asked to return in a fasting state within the required 
visit window (please refer to section 6.1 for more information regarding visit window). If 
that is not possible, a non -fasting specimen should be obtained the same day, and the 
non-fasting state should be recorded on the C RF.  Stored plasma will be collected at the 
indicated visits (section 6.1) for centralized testing for endothelial, monocyte, and T -cell 
microparticles in the laboratory of [CONTACT_399924] (UCLA Division of Infectious Diseases).  Samples should be collected,  processed, and stored on -site frozen at -70°C until

accompanying pulse waves.17,46 A blood pressure cuff will be placed on one 
upper arm (study arm), while the other arm will serve as a control (control arm).   
Peripheral arterial tonometry probes will be placed on one finger of each hand for 
continuous recording of the PAT signal (baseline arterial pulse wave amplitude, 
PWA).  After a 5-minute equilibration period, the blood pressure cuff will be 
inflated to s uprasystolic pressures for 5 minutes (the ischemic stimulus).  The 
cuff will then be deflated while PAT recording is continued for 5 minutes (Figure 
1).  Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is  the primary measure of endothelial 
function.  The RHI  is automatical ly derived using Endo PAT version 3.0.4 
software, as the ratio of the average PWA over a 1 minute  interval starting 1 
minute  following cuff release to the pre -occlusion PWA  (average amplitude over 
3.5 minutes before cuff inflation) , normalized to the contr ol arm.

9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
9.3.1 The primary comparison is of baseline RHI between the HIV/HCV coinfected and 
HIV monoinfected groups. The estimated difference in RHI between the 2 groups 
is assumed to be the difference between high -risk CVD (HIV/HCV) and 
moderate -risk CVD (HIV).  RHI is exp ected then to be 1.6 in HIV/HCV and 1.[ADDRESS_504042] deviation (SD) of 0.37.
52  With a sample size of 80 HIV/HCV 
and [ADDRESS_504043] an estimated power of 99% for detection of th e expected 
difference in RHI between the HIV/HCV and HIV groups.  However, if we 
conservatively estimate the difference in baseline RHI to be 0.[ADDRESS_504044] 80% power with this sample size. For select secondary 
analyses of differences in the CVD biomarkers of sICAM -1 (expected difference 
of 779 vs1284 ng/mL, SD=526) and sE -selectin (118 vs 223 ng/mL, SD=190),
[ADDRESS_504045] 99% and 81% power, respectively, with this sample size.  
 Accrual of about 20 subjects per month is expected, to complete enrollment in 6 
months.  
 9.3.2 With 80 HCV/HIV subjects, we will have 80% power to detect a correlation 
between any one marker and RHI of > 0.31.  With [ADDRESS_504046] 80% power to detect a  correlation >0.42, correlations that have been seen in 
other populations.
53,54   
 9.3.3  Among 80 HIV/HCV su bjects, we expect about 40 (50%) will initiate HCV 
treatment. Out of [ADDRESS_504047] about 27 (67%) will 
be responders and 13 will be non- responders. To compare responders (n=27) 
with subjects without treatment (n=40), we will have  80% power to detect a 
difference of 0.[ADDRESS_504048] size. To compare HIV  monoinfected controls (n=40)

of 0.[ADDRESS_504050] size.  
 
9.4       Data Analysis Plan  
 
9.4.1    Objective: To determine the effect of HCV coinfection on endothelial function in  
the HIV -1-infected cohort at baseline. 
 
Descriptive statistics, including mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, and  
interquartile range, will be provided for the overall cohort, by [CONTACT_399917], and by 
[CONTACT_399918], RHI, CVD biomarkers, 
HOMA -IR, hemoglobin A1c, and FRS.  Histograms and scatter plots will be 
produced to visually inspect the distributions and pairwise association. Log -
transformation as necessary will be done for RHI, if its distribution is found to be 
skewed. ANOVA (analysis of variance) will be used to compare continuous 
variables by [CONTACT_399919] -square test will be used to compare 
categorical variables. A ll tests will be [ADDRESS_504051] or Wilcoxon rank sum will be performed to compare RHI in the 
HIV/HCV vs HIV groups. Multiple linear regression analysis will also be carr ied 
out to compare RHI in HIV/HCV vs HIV, adjusting for PAT performance site and 
any differences in baseline characteristics including CD4 nadir  and ART type.  
Subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity and gender will be conducted.  Similar 
analyses will be carr ied out to compare biomarkers between the HIV/HCV and 
HIV groups. Given multiple comparisons, in addition to unadjusted p- values, we 
will report significance according to Benjamini -Hochberg false discovery rate 
method.

9.4.2  Objective: To assess whether non -hepatic biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction ,  
inflammation, and thrombosis (sICAM -1, sE -selectin, Lp -PLA2, IL -6, and D -
dimer) are better correlates of endothelial function than traditional hepatic -
derived biomarkers (hsCRP and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) in HIV/HCV -coinfected in cross -sectional 
assessment.  
  Correlation analysis (Pearson or Spearman) will be conducted to evaluate the association of each circulating biomarker as the predictor and RHI as a 
continuous outcome variable.  Further correlation of biomarkers with each other 
and with RHI will be perfor med by [CONTACT_399920].   Multiple linear 
regression models will be used while controlling for confounders as in Aim [ADDRESS_504052] 
  Version 4.0 
 3/22/[ADDRESS_504053] stronger correlation with RHI than 
hepatically -derived biomarkers.    
 
9.4.3  Objective: To determine the effect of HCV co -infection and HCV virologic 
suppression  post treatment on endothelial function and CVD biomarkers in the 
HIV-1-infected cohort over one year of follow -up. 
 
Change in RHI and change in biomarkers from baseline to follow -up will be 
compared among 4 groups of subjects (HCV treatment responders and non-
responders, untreated HIV/HCV subjects, and HIV controls). Boxplots will be used to visually display the difference among [ADDRESS_504054]. Correlation 
analysis will be carried out between change in biomarkers and change in RHI .  
 
 
10.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING 
 
10.1 Records to Be Kept  
 
Case report forms (CRF) will be provided for each subject. Subjects must not be 
identified by  [CONTACT_68405]. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_399921] (PID)  in the REDCap database .  Data must be keyed in  to the 
study database, REDCap.   
 No personally identifiable information (PII) may be entered into REDCap .  A code key 
must be maintained at each site for all subjects who sign the study informed consent 
form.   
 
Users of REDcap must have completed HIPAA training or access will not be assigned.  
All REDCap operations will be tracked through audit trail.  REDCap is a web -based data 
management system.  The REDCap web server uses SSL encryption and system 
updates are automatically applied when they are available.  For added security, the 
REDCap database server sits within a firewall.  Both the web and database se rvers are 
backed up daily.

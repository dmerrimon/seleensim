Protocol: Randomized Controlled Trial of Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy for Fatigue Interference with Functioning in 
Metastatic Breast Cancer  
 
Last approval date: 8/20/2024   
                                                  IRB#: [PHONE_15112] 
 
  Page [ADDRESS_993310] of our telephone -based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT ) program on 
fatigue interference (i.e., the degree to which fatigue negatively affects activities, mood, and 
cognition) in metastatic breast cancer ( MBC) patients. A telephone -based approach can be 
readily disseminated to geographically dispersed patients and those with significant symptom burden and functional impairment that limit their ability to access in -person treat ments. We will 
randomly assign MBC patients (
N = 250) with significant fatigue interference to (1) six weekly 
50-minute telephone sessions of ACT or (2) six weekly 50 -minute telephone sessions of an 
education/support condition. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_993311] intervention’s effects.  The study object ives are: 
 
 Primary Objective:  To test the effect of telephone -based ACT on fatigue 
interference in MBC patients.  
H1: ACT will lead to an improved primary outcome of fatigue interference as compared 
to education/support.  
 
 Secondary Objectives:  
(a) To test the effects of telephone -based ACT on sleep interference, engagement in daily 
activities, and quality of life (QoL ) in MBC patients.  
H2: ACT will lead to improved secondary outcomes of sleep interference, engagement         
in daily activities, and QoL as compared to education/support.  
(b) To examine change in psychological flexibility as a mediator of ACT’s effect on fatigue interference.  
H3: Increases in psychological flexibility will mediate the beneficial effect of ACT on   
fatigue interference . 
 
 Exploratory Objective:   
To explore changes in the two core aspects of psychological flexibility (i.e.,   mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change processes) as mediators of 
ACT’s effect on fatigue interference.  
 
2.0 Outcome Measures/Endpoints  
All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and [ADDRESS_993312] -
intervention.  
 
 Primary Outcome Measure :  
The primary outcome measure is the 7- item Fatigue Interference subscale of the Fatigue 
Symptom Inventory.1, 2 
 
 Secondary Outcome Measures:

 Timing  Procedure and person(s) responsible  
At least 3 weeks after the patient’s 
Stage IV breast cancer diagnosis  (1) The potential participant will receive a 
letter by [CONTACT_727457]. 
Anyone interested will be invited to call for 
more details. The letter will have an "opt out" component; thus, patients who are not 
interested in the study may call the study 
team to indicate that they do not wish to be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. The mailing will also include copi[INVESTIGATOR_727437], study consent 
form, and authorization form.  
 (2) A research assistant will call all those who 
do not opt out to provide an overview of the study  and screen interested MBC patients for 
eligibility . The research assistant will obtain 
verbal informed consent for study participation  
from interested and eligible patients  (see 
“recruitment process” and “informed consent 
process” below).   
Target date = w ithin a pproximately 1 
week after recruitment. The baseline 
assessment can be completed up to 1 
month after recruitment.   (3) Patients who consent to participate will 
complete a baseline assessment over the 
phone (see “interview procedures” below). 
This interview will be administered by a trained research assistant or a trained doctoral 
student in clinical psychology.  
Sessions will occur approximately [ADDRESS_993315] up to 12 weeks 
to complete the 6 sessions .  (4) Patients will participate  in six, 50-minute 
telephone -based sessions of the  ACT 
intervention or education/support condition .  
Sessions will occur approximately [ADDRESS_993316] intervention 
session . Assessments can be 
completed as early as 7 days prior to 
the target follow- up date or as late as 
21 days following the target follow- up 
date. (5) Patients will complete a follow -up 
assessment over the phone at approximately [ADDRESS_993317]-
intervention (see “interview procedures” below).  Assessments will be administered by a trained research assistant or a trained 
doctoral student in clinical psychology who is 
blinded to the intervention arm.  
 
5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
Following baseline assessments, patients ( N = 250) will be randomly assigned to the ACT 
intervention or education/support condition using a stratified block randomization scheme to balance the groups by [CONTACT_727458] (<65 vs. >65 years) and  performance status (Eastern

potentially eligible patients may receive information about the study.  An introductory letter 
signed by [CONTACT_102]’s oncologist (the site PI, [CONTACT_727473] if a Community Health Network 
patient  or the site PI, [CONTACT_727474] if a Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center patient ) 
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_727439] (see Appendix A). The recruitment brochure (Appendix B), consent form, and authorization form will also be included in the initial mailing with the introductory letter.  Any  interested patients will be invited 
to call for more details. The letter also will have an "opt out" component; thus, patients who are not interested in the study may call the study office  to indicate that they do not wish to be 
contact[CONTACT_23322].  
 A research assistant will call all prospective participants who do not opt out within 
approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the letter is mailed. The research assistant will describe the 
study, review the consent form and authorization form, and ask if they wou ld like to participate 
(see Appendix C for telephone script).  During that initial call, interested patients will complete 
the eligibility screening assessment  (Appendix D) .  The assessment will begin with the 
administration of the 7-item Fatigue Interference subscale of the FSI.

  Page [ADDRESS_993322] prior to consenting.  In addition, the authorization form will be reviewed with the potential participant.  If the patient  needs more time or wants more 
information, an appointment to call again to obtain verbal consent will be made. If requested, a 
new consent form and authorization form will be either mailed or emailed to them (based on 
their preference).  
 
For patients who decline to participate in this study, we will ask if they would be willing to provide a reason for their decision.  With the patient’s permission, we will also document their 
age and race/ethnicity.  Regarding patients who agree to complete the screening assessment 
and are found to be ineligible, we will also document their age and race/ethnicity with their permission.  This information will be obtained solely for the purpose of determining potential 
sample selection biases.  Should non -participants decline to answer these questions, we will 
discontinue all further contact [CONTACT_116744].  
 
Informed Consent Process  
All potential participants will be informed as to their rights as volunteers in a research study and 
will provide informed consent for research participation. The key elements of the informed 
consent procedure which will be explained to prospective partici pants are: 1) the research 
status of the study; 2) the potential risks and the provisions for them; 3) the lack of guarantee of benefit from participation; 4) the voluntary nature of the study; 5) the lack of consequence 
to medical care of the decision to consent or refuse to participate; and 6) the freedom to withdraw from the study or to refuse to answer specific questions or to participate in any aspect 
of the study at any time. Consenting patients will have the option of providing the name [CONTACT_13255] i nformation for an emergency contact [CONTACT_727460]  (see Appendix O) .  
 
Interview Procedures  
MBC patients ( N = 250) who are eligible and provide informed consent will complete 
assessments at baseline and approximately 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following the 
final intervention session  (see Table 1 in section 5.0 above for allowable assessment windows).  
The baseline assessment takes about 35 minutes, and each follow- up assessment takes about 
30 minutes.  Assessments will include questions regarding demographics, medical history, primary and secondary outcomes, and potential mediating variables .  Participants will be 
provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_727440] 
(see Appendix E). Each participant will receive $[ADDRESS_993323] s via postal mail for each 
completed assessment  (baseline and 2- week, 3 -month, and 6- month follow- ups) for a possible 
total of $[ADDRESS_993324] to study participants.  Table 2 below outlines the 
assessment schedule at baseline and the three  follow- ups.

 F-G).  Baseline and follow- up assessments will be audio -recorded so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained 
member of the study team may audit the assessments for adherence to the study protocol.  
Demographic information. The following demographic information will be assessed at 
baseline: age, race/ethnicity, marital/partner status,  number of household members  and their 
relationship to the patient, education, income, and employment status. Rural status will be 
determined by [CONTACT_727461]’s county of residence based on U.S. Census Bureau data.11   
Medical factors and healthcare use .  As in prior NIH- funded trials with cancer patients,12, 13 
we will assess medical comorbidities, functional status, cancer information (e.g., date of breast cancer diagnosis, cancer treatments  received ), and physical and mental healthcare use.
12, 14 
Medical comorbidities will be assessed at baseline only; functional status, cancer information, and healthcare use data will be collected at baseline and the three follow- up assessments. Self-
reported medical comorbidities will be assessed via a checklist  of nine chronic health conditions. 
Functional status will be measured with the 1- item PG -SGA, a valid patient -reported version of 
the ECOG score.
8 Cancer information, such as time since diagnosis and treatments  received , will 
be assessed via chart review. Additionally, seven items will assess physical and mental 
healthcare use, including outpatient and emergency room visits, use of complementary and 
alternative healthcare services,  and (at baseline only) prior mindfulness training.12, 14 Patients 
will also report their prescribed and over -the-counter medications.  
Primary outcome: Fatigue interference.  The primary outcome measure is the 7- item Fatigue 
Interference subscale of the FSI.1, 2 Items are rated on 11- point scales (0=no interference; 
10=extreme interference) that assess the extent to which fatigue in the past week interfered 
with general level of activity, ability to bathe and dress, normal work activity (including 
housework), ability to concentrate, relations with others, enjoyment of life, and mood. This 
measure has been extensively used with cancer patients with strong evidence of construct 
validity and internal consistency reliability.[ADDRESS_993328] psychometric quality rating relative to other fatigue measures.16 
Cronbach’s alphas have been excellent in prior studies (αs = .91- .95)15 and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_727441] (αs = .92 -.94). 
Secondary outcomes .  Two secondary outcomes will be assessed with Patient -Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, which have many advantages. PROMIS measures were developed using sophisticated measurement techniques and tested with over 21,[ADDRESS_993329] strong 
evidence of reliability and validity and showed good internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_727442].
21 Additionally, standardized T- scores 
facilitate comparisons with population norms. T -score distributions are standardized such that a 
score of 50 (SD = 10) represents the mean for the U.S. general population. U.S. cancer -specific 
reference values have been  published for various PROMIS domains.[ADDRESS_993330] -

(including housework).  
3) QoL will be measured with the 27- item FACT -G,6 consisting of four subscales: Physical 
Well-Being, Social/Family Well- Being, Emotional Well -Being, and Functional Well -Being. An 
overall score is computed to represent general QoL.  
Mediators .  Psychological flexibility as measured by [CONTACT_941] 7- item Acceptance and Action 
Questionnaire -II (AAQ- II)23 will be assessed as a hypothesized mediator of the intervention’s 
effect on fatigue interference. Research has supported the reliability and validity of the AAQ -II 
for use with cancer patients.24-26 The two core components of psychological flexibility 
(mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change) will also be assessed as 
exploratory mediators. First, mindfulness/acceptance will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 10- item Cognitive 
and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS -R).27 The scale provides a comprehensive 
assessment of mindfulness processes, including attention, present -focus, awareness, and 
acceptance/non -judgement. The measure showed strong evidence of reliability and validity in 
healthy samples,27 and our team has an ongoing study to examine its psychometric properties 
in 200 MBC and other advanced cancer patients. Data collection is finished, and we are currently preparing the data for analyses.  Second, commitment/behavior change will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 5- item Value Progress subscale of the Valuing Questionnaire.

focus on fatigue interference because it is the most common concern of MBC patients,
[ADDRESS_993332] model,35 the intervention is designed to increase psychological flexibility

psychological flexibility is cultivated through the practice of six psychological skills: acceptance, 
values, defusion, contact [CONTACT_727463], self as context, and committed action. 
These skills constitute mindfulness and acceptance processes and commitment and behavior 
change processes. Each session has a primary focus on one of the six psychological skills (see Table 3),  although in -session exercises and home practice generally promote multiple skills 
simultaneously. During the first session, the patient’s background and fatigue management strategies will be discussed, and the concept of mindfulness will be introduced. Participants will

Sessions will incorporate discussion of patients’ cancer experience, as their energy level and 
personal goals wil l be discussed in the context of th eir current medical care, functional status, 
and emotional responses to cancer. Each session will include assessing and recording the 
patient’s home practice of mindfulness and other skills and will end with a discussion of practice 
for the week ahead. Thr ough skill practice, participants will learn new and more adaptive ways 
to respond to fatigue and other unwanted internal experiences (e.g., anxiety). Handouts 
summarizing the topi[INVESTIGATOR_727445] (Appendix J) and a CD that our team developed  to 
guide mi ndfulness practices will be mailed to participants. Participants will also have the option 
of receiving the mindfulness recordings via an emailed link from IU Box.

 Education/Support Condition  Procedures  
The education/support control condition was tested in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688].45 The manual is 
found in Appendix K . Patients randomized to the education/support condition will discuss their 
concerns, including symptoms and other cancer -related stressors, with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727446]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727447] h ealth 
information and contact [CONTACT_727466]. Thus, this study tests whether 
ACT is superior to supportive listening and education regarding medical center and community resources, consistent with common 
interventions in clinical 
settings.
 
Licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727448]/support intervention. Table [ADDRESS_993336] up 
to 12 weeks to complete 
the 6 sessions. 
Education/support participants will complete the same weekly  fatigue 
and distress  assessments 
as those in the ACT condition. Sessions will 
include an orientation to the patient’s medical center and treatment team, education 
regarding common QoL 
concerns and symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_76428], and an overview of medical center and community 
resources for addressing 
these concerns. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727449]. Education/support participants will receive handouts summarizing the topi[INVESTIGATOR_727450]  (Appendix L) . ACT concepts will not be 
discussed in the education/support  condition; t hus, there is no overlap in intervention content 
between study conditions.

7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Design and data considerations . The primary and secondary outcomes in the proposed study 
are scaled continuously. For these outcomes, a linear mixed model using the SAS procedure 
MIXED will be employed.47, 48 Because parameter estimation in MIXED employs full information 
maximum likelihood, all data the individual provides are included in the analysis even if some of 
the data are missing.  
 
Preliminary analyses: Distributional issues. Univariate and descriptive analyses will be performed 
on all dependent variables, and if necessary, normalizing and/or variance stabilizing 
transformations will be sought in the family of power transformations and applied to the data 
before inferential analyses are undertaken. Missing data/subject attrition . We anticipate some 
missing data due to participant death, medical factors, and other reasons. For individuals who 
complete the first assessment but withdraw from the study, we will examine demographic , 
medical, and symptom factors that might be predictive of dropout using logistic regr ession. In 
the analyses for the primary and secondary objectives described below, all randomized 
participants will be included in intent -to-treat analyses,[ADDRESS_993338] been assigned. We plan t o use the random effects pattern -mixture 
model proposed by [CONTACT_501926]
50 to address missing data. Analyses of potential 
covariates . Because patients will be randomly assigned to the two study conditions, significant 
differences on the baseline values of all measured variables are not expected. T -tests and chi -
square analyses will be performed to determine whether there are differences between the groups on potential baseline covariates (e.g., demographic and medical variables), and if there are differences these variables will be used as cov ariates in subsequent analyses.  
 
Primary objective (2.1): To test the effect of telephone -based ACT on fatigue interference in 
MBC patients . A linear mixed -model repeated measures approach (SAS Proc -Mixed)[ADDRESS_993339] the hypothesis (#1) that ACT will improve fatigue interference as compared to the education/support condition. The model will include the main effect of time (as categorical) and study group (ACT vs. education/support) and the time -by-study group interaction. A treatment 
effect will be evidenced by a significant interaction between time and study group. If the treatment effect is significant, follow- up tests will be conducted to examine group differences at 
each follow- up, controlling for the outcome at baseline.  
 St
atistical power.  Our sample size is calculated based on the estimated difference 
between study conditions (ACT vs. education/support) on the primary outcome of fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993340] (
d = -
.30) of study condition on fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993341] -intervention. It should be noted 
that only about half of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_727455] (unlike the proposed study, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_727456] a ll eligible patients to have clinically significant 
levels of fatigue interference); thus, the effect size is likely to be higher in the proposed study where the sample will have uniformly elevated fatigue interference at study entry. Indeed, 
                                                  IRB#: [PHONE_15112] 
 
  Page [ADDRESS_993342] ( d = -.59) of study condition on fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993343] size of d = -.[ADDRESS_993344] -intervention (assuming 
21% attrition), we will have 80% power ( p = .05, two -tailed) to detect a Cohen’s d of -.40 in a 
linear mixed model.51 At the final, 6- month follow -up with a sample size of 163 (assuming 35% 
attrition), we will have 80% power ( p = .05, two -tailed) to detect a Cohen’s d of -.44.51  
 
Secondary objective (2.2a): To test the effects of telephone -based ACT on secondary outcomes 
in MBC patients . Linear mixed models will be run in SAS Proc -Mixed48 to test the hypothesis 
(#2) that ACT will improve sleep interference, engagement in daily activities, and QoL as 
compared to the education/support condition. Each model will include the main effect of time (as categorical) and study group and the time -by-study group interaction. A t reatment effect 
will be evidenced by a significant interaction between time and study group.  Probabilities for 
secondary outcomes will be Sidak adjusted for correlated multiple outcomes to control the familywise Type I error rat e. If treatment effects are significant, follow- up tests will be 
conducted to examine group differences at each follow- up, controlling for the outcome at 
baseline.  
 
Secondary objective (2.2b): To examine change in psychological flexibility as a mediator of 
ACT’s effect on fatigue interference . The PROCESS macro for SAS developed by [CONTACT_727472]52 
will be used to test the hypothesis  (#3) that increases in psychological flexibility will mediate 
the effect of ACT on fatigue interference. This analysis employs ordinary least squares regression. Bootstrapped confidence intervals will be computed for the indirect effect of study 
group on fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993345] -intervention (via change in psychological 
flexibility over the same time period ). The analysis will control for baseline levels of the 
mediator and outcome.  We will also compute the indirect effects of study group on fatigue 
interference at [ADDRESS_993346] -intervention (via change in psychological flexibility at [ADDRESS_993347] -intervention). These analyses will also control for baseline levels of the mediato r 
and outcome.  
 
Exploratory objective (2.3): To explore changes in the two core aspects of psychological 
flexibility (i.e., mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change) as mediators of 
ACT’s effect on fatigue interference . The PROCESS macro for SAS52 will be used to explore the 
extent to which changes in mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change 
processes mediate the effect of ACT on fatigue interference. Both potential mediators will be 
entered into the same model. Bootstrapped confidence  intervals will be computed for the 
indirect effect of study group on fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993348] -intervention (via change 
in mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change processes over the same time 
period ). The analysis will control for  baseline levels of the mediators and outcome.  We will also 
compute the indirect effects of study group on fatigue interference at [ADDRESS_993349] -
intervention (via changes in mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior change processes at [ADDRESS_993350] -intervention). These analyses will also con trol for baseline levels of 
the mediators and outcome.  
 
Other exploratory analyses . To inform future research, we will explore the extent to which 
sociodemographics (e.g., age, education) and clinical characteristics (e.g., cancer treatments, baseline fatigue severity) moderate the effects of ACT on primary and secondary outcomes. For 
                                                  IRB#: [PHONE_15112]

 these analyses, we will use linear mixed modeling at a two -sided significance level of 0.05. 
Preliminary findings or hypotheses generated from these moderation analyses will be further 
tested in a future trial.

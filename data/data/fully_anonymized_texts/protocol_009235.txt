2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy defined by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO) as a myeloid neoplasm with 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood or bone 
marrow.[ADDRESS_933151] 
common form of acute leukemia in adults, with a projected estimate of 19,520 new cases and 
10,670 deaths in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in 2018.[ADDRESS_933152] induction or intensive chemotherapy, the majority are treated with less 
intensi ve therapi[INVESTIGATOR_688053] (HMAs, such as azacitidine or decitabine), low -dose 
cytarabine or best supportive care.  Similarly, younger patients with significant cardiac, pulmonary or 
other comorbidities may not be eligible to receive stand ard induction therapy.  Several studies have 
demonstrated the benefits of induction therapy over supportive care only, with respect to survival and 
quality of life, suggesting that treatment should be offered to all patients diagnosed with AML.6,7
In Europe, azacitidine and decitabine are approved as single agents for patients with treatment naïve 
AML.  However, the reported overall response rate ( complete remission [CR] + complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi] ) in a randomized trial was 25.6% and a with median overall 
survival of 7.7 months with decitabine compared with 7.8% and 5.0 months in treatment arms 
consisting of either subcutaneous (SC) cytarabine (88.5% of pa tients) or supportive care (11.5% of 
patients).7  In another study of azacitidine, the reported overall response (CR +CRi) rate and median 
overall survival were 27.8% and 10.4 months with azacitidine versus 25.1% and 6.[ADDRESS_933153] supportive care, low -dose cytarabine or 
intensive chemotherapy.8  Both of these trials in AML patients who were ≥ [ADDRESS_933154] induction therapy.
B-cell lymphoma (BCL) -2 overexpression has been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML 
cells and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics.  In addition, high levels of BCL -2 
were associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with AML.9,10

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].[COMPANY_013] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a pote nt, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of BCL -2, 
venetoclax (also referred to as ABT -199, A -1195425.0, GDC- 0199, RO5537382, Venclexta®, and 
Venclyxto®), that may address some of the needs for patients with AML.  In addition, veneto clax is being 
evaluated for the treatment of patients with Non -Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma (MM).
Venetoclax binds with high affinity (inhibition rate constant [K i] < 0.010 nM) to anti -apoptotic protein 
BCL-2 and with lower affinity to other anti -apoptotic BCL -2 family proteins, like B -cell lymphoma extra -
large (BCL -XL) and B -cell lymphoma -Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (BCL -w) (> 4,000 -fold and > 2,000 -to 
>20,000 -fold lo wer affinity than to BCL -2, respectively).  The anticipated and observed venetoclax -
associated toxicities are also mechanism based; in particular, BCL -2-mediated effects on lymphocytes.9,11  
Venetoclax, as a BCL -2-selective (BCL -XL-sparing) inhibitor, is projected to yiel d an improved therapeutic 
profile compared to dual BCL -2/BCL -XLinhibitors.  Because survival of platelets depends on BCL -XL,12
thrombocytopenia, a major dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) caused by [CONTACT_688070] -XLin the clinic,13is 
not expected to be dose -limiting for venetoclax.
Based on the mechanism of action, as well as the nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the 
safety profile of venetoclax is well described.  The most common adverse drug reactions across all 
indications are nausea, diarrhea, hematological effects, and serious and/or opportunistic infections.  
Hematologic effects include neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ane mia, and 
lymphopenia.  Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_688054].  Tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS) is an important identified risk and is predominantly seen in the CLL population with high 
tumor burden.  Based on pre -clinical data, decreased spermatogenesis has been identified as a potential 
risk for subjects treated with venetoclax.
Venetoclax has been evaluated as a single agent (Study M14 -212)14in patients with relapsed/refractory 
AML or frontline in patients with AML who were unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy and in 
combination with azacitidine or decitabine (Study M14 -358)15or low- dose cytarabine (Study M14 -387)[ADDRESS_933155] common adverse 
events observed in ≥30% of the subjects were nausea (59.4%); diarrhea (56.3%); hypokalemia, vomiting 
(40.6% each); fatigue, he adache (34.4% each); hypomagnesemia (37.5%); febrile neutropenia (31.3%); 
abdominal pain, cough, hypophosphatemia (28.1% each); epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, 
malignant neoplasm progression (25.0% each); dyspnea, hypotension, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and 
pneumonia (21.9% each).  Serious adverse events were reported in 27 subjects (84.4%), the most 
common being febrile neutropenia (28.1%), malignant neoplasm progression (25.0%), and pneumonia 
(15.6%).  No cases of TLS occurred during venetocla x treatment.  Efficacy data for Study M14 -212 are 
available for all 32 subjects.  The majority (30, 94%) of the subjects had relapsed/refractory AML and a 
few (2 subjects, 6%) were deemed unfit for intensive therapy.  The objective response rate (ORR) was 
19% (6 of 32 subjects), with CR in 2 subjects (6%) and CRi in 4 subjects (13%).  Anti -leukemic activity was 
observed in an additional 7 subjects (22%), with ≥50% bone marrow reduction with hematologic 
recovery in 4 of these subjects.
In Study M14 -358, ven etoclax was administered daily in a three day ramp -up from 100 to 200 to 400 mg 
and coadministered with either azacitidine 75 mg/m2IV or SC on Days 1 -7 or decitabine 20 mg/m2IV 
on Days 1 -5 within each 28 day cycle.15  Dose adjustments for venetoclax were implemented for

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].concomitant medications routinely used for prophylaxis with known drug -drug interactions.  Safety and 
efficacy were evalua ted.  Of 115 subjects treated with the 400 mg dose of venetoclax, 84 subjects were 
treated with venetoclax and azacitidine, and 31 subjects received venetoclax and decitabine.  The 
median age for subjects treated with azacitidine or decitabine were 75 (ran ge:  61 –90) and 72 
(range:   65 –86), respectively.  Key adverse events of Grade ≥3, across all subjects, were febrile 
neutropenia (44%), anemia (28%), pneumonia (25%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and neutropenia (18%).  
For subjects treated with azacitidine or decitabine, 70% and 74% of subjects achieved CR/CRi, 
respectively, and the median time to first response was 1.2 and 1.9 months, respectively.  The median 
overall survival was 14.9 months for subjects treated with azacitidine and 16.2 months for subje cts 
treated with decitabine.  Subjects who received venetoclax dose reduction for cytochrome (CYP) P450 
3A inhibitors had similar responses compared to those without dose reduction.
Study M14 -387 evaluated the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combinati on with low -dose cytarabine 
in patients with previously untreated AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy due to 
comorbidities or age.16  Venetoclax was initiated at 50 or 100 m g daily and dose escalated over 4 -
5days to reach 600 mg.  In subsequent 28 -day cycles, venetoclax was administered at 600 mg on all 
days.  Low -dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2daily) was administered SC on Days 1 –[ADDRESS_933156] udy, concomitant strong and moderate cytochrome P450 3A isoform subfamily 
(CYP3A) inhibitor use was prohibited; however, as additional safety and pharmacokinetic data became 
available, their use was allowed with appropriate venetoclax dose adjustments.  The most common 
adverse events of Grade ≥3 across all subjects were febrile neutropenia (43%), thrombocytopenia 
(38%), neutropenia (27%), and anemia (27%).  Laboratory evidence of Grade 3 TLS was observed in 
2subjects; both subjects achieved the target dos e of venetoclax.  Forty seven percent of subjects 
received moderate (40%) or strong (7%) CYP3A inhibitors for at least 7 days (predominantly azole 
antifungals); no relevant differences in serious adverse event rates were observed.  Median time to first 
response was 1.4 months, and 54% and 46% of subjects achieved CR/CRi and CR/complete remission 
with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), respectively.  The rates of CR/CRi for subjects with secondary 
and de novo AML were 35% and 71%, respectively; median durat ion of response for those with 
secondary and de novo AML was 8.1 and 11.6 months, respectively.
Supported by [CONTACT_63015], 2 randomized trials (Studies M15 -656 and M16 -043) have been initiated 
evaluating venetoclax in combination with the common frontline treatments of azacitidine or low -dose 
cytarabine in subjects with treatment -naïve AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
With the general improvement seen in AML treatment over the last decades, an interest to move AML 
treatment towards outpat ient care has emerged.  Potential benefits with outpatient care that have been 
cited include reduction of healthcare costs, improvement in quality of life, and decreased risk of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infections.17  Given the severity of the disease, there are potential safety issues related 
to outpatient ma nagement that need to be addressed:  one of these issues is the introduction of new 
treatment options and how they can be safely and effectively administered in an outpatient setting.
In Studies M14 -358 and M14 -387, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40175] a requirement during treatment initiation and 
drug ramp -up.  There is a need to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the administration and ramp -
up of venetoclax in patients treated in an outpatient setting.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The clinical trial described in this Protocol is designed to asce rtain whether venetoclax, in combination 
with azacitidine or decitabine, can be safely initiated in an outpatient setting and to assess clinical 
effectiveness in a community setting.
The clinical hypothesis for this study is that venetoclax, in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, 
can safely be given in an outpatient setting during the ramp -up phase for AML patients who are 
ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy as demonstrated by a composite complete remission rate 
(CR + CRi) of approximately 60% in a community setting and consistent with Phase 1/[ADDRESS_933157] monitoring.  The dosing 
regimen will also enable interruptions and extensions at dose levels if rapid tumor lysis is observed.
For further details, please see findings from completed and ongoing studie s, including safety data in the 
current Venetoclax Investigator's Brochure.18
Considering the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects receiving venetoclax, azacitidine, or 
decitabine may be at an increased risk for CO VID-19 infection or experience serious illness if infected.  
Management of these adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with consideration of 
benefit/risk.  However, based on the population and disease being studied and the anticipation that 
COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially between study subjects and the broader 
population of subjects receiving treatment for AML, no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in 
this study is expected.

receive intensive chemotherapy.
Primary
The primary objective of this study is:
To determine composite complete remission rate (CR + CRi), during the initial 6 cycles of 
treatment, as determined by [CONTACT_688071] (IWG) criteria, of 
venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine given in an outpatient setting to 
treatment -naïve subjects wit h AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy
Secondary
The secondary objectives of this study are:
To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events including, but not limited to, rates of 
TLS and neutropenia
To assess the rate of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet independence upon treatment with 
venetoclax and azacitidine or decitabine
3.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the Composite Complete Remission Rate (CR + CRi):  complete remission (CR) 
plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) as described by [CONTACT_688072].
3.3 Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints are:
Overall Response Rates (CR, CRi):  complete remission (CR) or complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) as described by [CONTACT_688073].

Screening
Screening procedures must be performed within [ADDRESS_933159] dose of study drug administration.  
Longer intervals require discussion with the Medical Monitor.  Once screening procedures are complete 
and eligibilit y is confirmed, subjects will be enrolled.
Study Treatment
All subjects will receive venetoclax (daily for 28 days), in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, 
beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Depending on investigator's choice, subjects will receive eithe r azacitidine 
for [ADDRESS_933160] -of-care treatments for venetoclax and azacitidine or de citabine.
Cycle Length –(28 Days)
Venetoclax orally daily:  100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, 200 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2, and 400 mg on 
Cycle 1 Days 3 –28; 400 mg daily for each 28 -day cycle thereafter.
Azacitidine 75 mg/m2subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) for 7 days beginning on Day 1 of 
each cycle, as per institutional practice.
Decitabine 20 mg/m2intravenous (IV) for 5 days beginning on Day 1 of each cycle, as per 
institutional practice.
Subjects with progressive disease for whom the treating physician feels are still deriving clinical benefit 
can be continued on treatment after discussion with the medical monitor or until no longer achieving

meets other protocol criteria for discontinuation (whichever occurs first).  All subjects will have a Final 
Visit performed when treatment is discontinued or when the end of the 6th cycle has been achieved 
unless the subject has withdrawn consent to participate in the study.  Baseline laboratory assessments 
will be obtained at Cycle [ADDRESS_933162] dose of study drug administration.  Disease assessments 
by [CONTACT_265334] (Operations M anual, Section 3.16) will be performed at the timepoints 
described in Section 3.[ADDRESS_933163] demonstrated that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine 
can induce responses for patients with AML and be dosed safely.  Additionally, these clinical studies 
indicate that the combina tion may be more efficacious than either agent alone (Study M14 -358).  
Therefore, given the prognosis, current limited effective options, safety of venetoclax and HMAs to date, 
and the preclinical signals of efficacy, the subject population is suitable.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The currently approved venetoclax dose is [ADDRESS_933164] 
monitoring.  The dosing regimen will also enable interruptions and extensions at dose levels if rapid 
tumor lysis is observed.  To date, this strategy has been effective at minimizing the risk of clinical TLS 
with a rate across the AML pr ogram at < 1%.

product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device mus t be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfa vorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the 
use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations," which must be reported whether associated with an adverse event or not.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse 
event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the 
surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition 
deteriorates une xpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the 
deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered 
an adverse event.

be collected as an adverse event on the eCRF.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following adverse events of special interest will be monitored during the study:
Cytopenias
TLS
Subjects will be monitored for blood counts through resolution of cytopenias.  Myelosuppression and 
the related adverse events (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia) are 
common in subjects with AML.  Subjects with baseline neutropenia or those with secondary AML might 
be particularly at high risk for associated adverse events.  Additional details are provided in Section 6.2.
If additional dose reductions are thought to be necessary by [CONTACT_093], a discussion with the 
[COMPANY_013] medical monitor is required.  Subjects experiencing delays for a medical event unrelated to study 
treatment may delay study treatm ent up to [ADDRESS_933197] be discussed 
with the [COMPANY_013] Primary TA MD or a designee.
Anti- infective prophylaxis should be implemented per regional guidelines or institutional standards 
including appropriate prophylaxis for bacteri al, viral, and fungal infections.  Potential for drug -drug 
interactions should be considered and appropriate dose adjustments made if required.
Subjects with resistant disease, based on modified IWG criteria (as described in the Operations Manual, 
Section 3.16), after End of Cycle 1 will need a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_688058] 2.  Subjects with resistant disease after end of Cycle 2, based on modified IWG criteria (as 
described in the Operations Manual, Section 3.16) will need a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_688059] 4.  Subjects who have not recovered absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) ≥500/μL within 14 days of drug interruption or require longer duration of interruption between 
treatment cycles, bone marrow a spi[INVESTIGATOR_688060], as determined by [CONTACT_093], to assess 
disease status before resuming treatment with next cycle.
Guidelines for TLS management are provided in Section 6.2.  Chemistry labs (including creatinine, 
potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid) will be performed 
real-time pre -dose, [ADDRESS_933198] -dose for each vene toclax dose escalation, 
and also as deemed necessary per investigator to monitor TLS.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 5.0).  If a reported adverse event 
increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given final outcome date and a new adverse 
event must be reported to reflect the change in severity.  T he dates on the adverse events cannot 
overlap.  For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also 
need to be updated to reflect any changes due to the increase in severity.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_416992], the following should be used:
Grade [ADDRESS_933199] (mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_933200]'s usual activities 
(moderate) .
Grade [ADDRESS_933201]'s usual activities and 
may be incapacitating (moderate to severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life -threatening and requires urgent intervention (severe).
Grade [ADDRESS_933202] (severe).
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologi c plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_933203] 
be discontinued (Section 5.5).
All subjects should be informed of the contraceptive measure requirements.  If a pregnancy occurs in a 
study subject or in the partner of a study subject, information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome 
will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent for 
release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any 
pregnancy -specific information, and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome.
[COMPANY_013] will provide a separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject's partners will be 
collected from the date of the first dose through [ADDRESS_933204] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within

Appendix E (Howard grading classification).  If a subject experiences blood chemistry changes suggestive 
of TLS, the dose of venetoclax may be withheld and/or reductions may be required.
Tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis must be initiated in all subjects before the first dose of study drug or 
first new escalated dose.  For subjects who had dose delay or interruptions TLS prophylactic measures 
may need to be implemented based on the disease status prior to resuming treatm ent.  Below are the 
minimum requirements for TLS prophylaxis and management.  Additional prophylaxis and monitoring 
procedures for TLS should be implemented as per institutional/regional standards.
An oral agent to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopur inol) to be initiated at least [ADDRESS_933206] 72 hours prior to dosing or rasburicase on the day of 
treatment (prior to venetoclax dosing).
Adequate hydration per day starting from at least [ADDRESS_933207] dose or any dose 
escalation.
TLS Chemistry panel (creatinine, potassi um, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and uric acid) will be performed real -time pre -dose, [ADDRESS_933208] -dose for each venetoclax dose escalation, and as deemed necessary per 
investigator to monitor TLS.
TLS Ch emistry panel results (creatinine, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and uric acid) must be reviewed by [CONTACT_688079]'s next dose to ensure appropriate subject management .
If any clinically significant laboratory changes are observed within the first 24 hours after 
initiation of dosing or after a dose escalation, see Appendix F for management guidelines.  Refer 
to table in Appendix E for definitions of laboratory and clinical TLS.
If subjects develop TLS and the treatme nt is withheld, they should be admitted and managed as 
inpatient until the ramp- up is complete and TLS labs have normalized.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Subjects with reduced renal function (CLcr < 80 mL/min, Cockcroft -Gault formula) require more 
intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS when initiating treatment with 
venetoclax.  For subjects with a higher risk for TLS and lower creatinine clearance, additional measures 
with more intensive lab monitoring and intervention should be implemented ( Appendix F ).
If a subject meets criteria for clinically significant laboratory or clinical TLS please follow institutional 
guidelines or recommendations in Appendix G ; no additional venetoclax dose should be administered 
until resolution.
For continued dosing of venetoclax, monitor for evidence of TLS during stud y treatment, and manage 
abnormalities of serum creatinine, and electrolytes promptly.  After resolution of electrolyte imbalances 
(Appendix F), ven etoclax may be continued at the original dose after discussion between the 
investigator and the [COMPANY_013] TA MD. 
Management of Cytopenias
Myelosuppression and the related adverse events (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and febrile 
neutropenia) are com mon in both treated and untreated patients with AML.  Subjects with baseline 
neutropenia or those who have significant bone marrow involvement may be particularly at high risk.
If a subject achieves CRi or has a morphologic leukemia free bone marrow (MLFS) (i.e., bone marrow 
blasts < 5%) after completion of Cycle 1, venetoclax should be interrupted to allow for ANC recovery 
from Day 29 until ANC ≥500/μL or up to 14 days.
Cycle 2 administration of azacitidine or decitabine will also be delayed until ANC ≥ 500/μL.  Both 
venetoclax and azacitidine or decitabine will resume on the same day after the interruption.  If a subject 
presents with new onset Grade 4 neutropenia for more than 1 week during subsequent cycles, unless it 
is thought to be due to the underly ing disease, dosing with venetoclax and azacitidine or decitabine may 
be interrupted until ANC is ≥ 500/ μL.
After Cycle 3, for subjects in CR/CRi who required interruption or delay of study drug administration for 
cytopenias (neutropenia [≤ 500/μL] or thro mbocytopenia [≤ 50 ×103/μL]) venetoclax should be 
administered for 21 days out of 28 days during each of the subsequent cycles.  The treatment cycle 
should also be delayed to allow for count recovery until ANC ≥ 500/ μL, platelet count ≥50 ×103/μL, or 
for up to 14 days, whichever occurs earlier.
Subjects with resistant disease, based on modified IWG criteria (as described in the Operations Manual, 
Section 3.16) after Cycle 1 should receive subsequent cycles of study treatment with no dose 
interruption/del ay until a repeat bone marrow assessment demonstrates CRi or MLFS.  Transfuse blood 
products, administer prophylactics, and administer treatment anti- infectives as clinically indicated and 
as per institutional practice.  Once CRi or MLFS is achieved, dose interruptions and reduction in duration 
of venetoclax administration for neutropenia should be implemented as described above, beginning 
from the cycle where a CRi or MLFS is demonstrated.  If hematologic recovery (ANC or platelets) is 
achieved within 14 d ays after completion of the cycle (where the CRi or MLFS is demonstrated), the 
duration of venetoclax is reduced to 21 days of the subsequent 28 -day cycle.

During subsequent cycles, if hematologic recovery with > 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by 
[CONTACT_2006] 28, reassess counts every 7 days.  If a 25% increase has not been achieved within 14 days after the 
completion of a cycle, based on the bone marrow biopsy cellularity, azacitidine dose adjustment can be 
made per Table 3, or according to institutional standards.

Decitabine
If a dose reduction for decitabine is believed to be necessary, a discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical 
monitor is required.
Management of Non -TLS Serum Electrolytes and Renal Impairment
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to < 20 mEq/L occur, azacitidine dosage should be 
reduced by 50% on the next course.  Similarly, if unexplained elevations of blood urea nit rogen (BUN) or 
serum creatinine occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and 
the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next treatment course.
Management of Decrease in Spermatogenesis
Venetoclax may cause a decrease in spermatogenesis.  Male subjects considering preservation of 
fertility should bank sperm before initiating treatment with venetoclax.
Management of Other Toxicities
If other events occur that are related to venetoclax, azacitidine, or decitabine, the inv estigator, in 
consultation with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor, may interrupt or reduce the dose of venetoclax and/or 
azacitidine or decitabine, as appropriate.  Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea when additional s upportive care fails or neurotoxicity, AST, ALT, or bilirubin 
increased), that is related to venetoclax, azacitidine, or decitabine will require interruption and possible 
discontinuation of dosing.  Venetoclax, azacitidine, or decitabine may be reintroduce d, but only at a 
reduced dose, (in consultation with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor) if the toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to 
baseline if Grade 2 at study entry.
Management of Infections
Anti- infective prophylaxis should be implemented per regional guideline s or institutional standards 
including appropriate prophylaxis for bacterial, viral and fungal infections.  Potential for drug -drug 
interactions should be considered.

7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.[ADDRESS_933210] AML, will be treatment -naïve, 
and will be ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Eff ectiveness
Endpoints
The primary objective for the study is to determine the composite complete remission rate (CR + CRi), 
during the initial 6 cycles of treatment, in AML subjects treated with venetoclax and either azacitidine or 
decitabine in an outpatie nt setting.  The composite complete remission rate will be achieved if IWG 
criteria for complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR + CRi) 
have been met.
Secondary effectiveness endpoints include:
Overall Response (CR, CRi).
RBC and platelet transfusion independence.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Exploratory effectiveness endpoints include:
Time to blood count improvements and duration of blood count improvements
Remissions (CR/CRi) in molecular subtypes.
Details on the primary and other effective ness analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
The planned study will enroll approximately 60 subjects.  A sample size of 60 subjects would ensure that 
the true CR + CRi rate will be within 13% of the observed CR + CRi rate with 95% confiden ce.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine will be assessed by [CONTACT_688080], adverse events, serious adverse events, and deaths, as well as changes in 
laboratory and vital sign parameters.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed for all treated subjects and for azacitidine or decitabine 
separately.
Details on the statistical analyses for safety will be provided in the SAP.

Please refer to Section 4.2and Section 4.3.
3.5 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
For all subjects, the Eastern C ooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be performed 
as outlined in Section 2.1and Section 2.2.
It is recommended, when possible, that a subject's performance status be assessed by [CONTACT_544030].  ECOG performance status will be assessed as follows:
Grade Description
0 Fully active, able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or 
sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work.
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self -care but unable to carry out any work activities.  Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours.
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours.
[ADDRESS_933231] will wear lightweight clothing and 
no shoes during weighing.
3.7 Physical Examination
A physical examination (complete and targeted) will be pe rformed at the designated study visits as 
specified in Section 2.1and Section 2.2.  The complete physical examination performed at Screening will 
serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study.  If the screening physical examination is 
performed within [ADDRESS_933232]'s medical history.  Any significant physical examination findings after 
the first dose of study drug administration will be recorded as adverse events.  All findings, whether 
related to an adverse event or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the 
appropriate eCRF page.

conditions, symptoms, or concerns.  Targeted exams can be performed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_688064] ( e.g., sub -investigator, nurse practitioner, etc.).  At any time, a 
symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].
3.[ADDRESS_933233] 3 minutes.
3.9 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the Screening visit as specified in Section 2, and 
when clinically indicated per Investigator's determination.  
ECGs will be recorded after the su bject has been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.  Subjects 
will be instructed to remain completely stationary (no talking, laughing, deep breathing, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or 
swallowing) for approximately 10 seconds during the ECG recording.  While ECGs ar e being acquired, 
subjects and staff are prohibited from having devices (e.g., cellular telephones, fans, heaters, etc.) that 
emit electrical interference in the room.
Each ECG will be printed and evaluated by [CONTACT_589174] (preferab ly a cardiologist)
at the study site (the "local reader") who will determine if any findings outside normal physiological 
variation are clinically significant.  The local reading of the ECG will be used by [CONTACT_688084], including adverse event determination and management, and decision on 
whether a subject will be discontinued from the study.
The local reader will sign and date allsafety ECG s and provide a global interpretation for each ECG using 
the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –Not clinically significant (NCS)
Abnormal ECG –Clinically significant (CS)
Unable to evaluate
All local reader evaluations of ECGs will be entered into the electronic source documents, electronic 
case report forms (CRFs), or paper CRFs.  If the global interpretation is Abnormal (NCS or CS), the local 
reader will provide further information (e.g., sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia).
All ECG source documentation will be retained at the study site.  The automatic cardiograph reading 
(i.e., cardiograph -generated measurements and interpretations) will not be collected for analysis.

The baseline laboratory tests will be reviewed for eligibility before study drug administration.  Beg inning 
with Cycle 3 Day 1, chemistry, hematology, and coagulation may be performed within 72 hours prior to 
the scheduled visit.  For cycles with bone marrow assessments, hematology laboratory tests should be 
performed on the same day as the bone marrow as sessment.  If the assessment occurs outside of the 
chemistry and hematology visit window, then the laboratory tests should be repeated prior to dosing.  
All Day 1 chemistry and hematology assessments should be performed pre -dose and the results should 
be a vailable prior to the administration of treatment.
For chemistry labs performed for TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during the dose ramp -up period in 
Cycle 1, refer to the Protocol, Section 6.2 (Toxicity Management) and the Protocol, Appendix F 
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome) for specific requirements.
If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator:
may repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value;
will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution; or
may discontinue the subject from the study or require the subject to receive treatment; in this 
case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an adverse event.

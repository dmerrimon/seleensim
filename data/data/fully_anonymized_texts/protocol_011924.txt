Title: Comparison of Duodenal Stenting vs Trans -pyloric and Duodenal Stenting for Malignant 
Obstruction  
Principle Investigator : Kulwinder Dua  
Primary Contact : [CONTACT_335174]:  
Enteral self -expanding metal stents (SEMS) are routinely used to palliate malignant gastric 
outlet obstruction (pancreas cancer, duodenal cancer, gastric cancer and metastasis) in patients 
not fit for surgical by[CONTACT_6476] . The technical success in placing these stents approaches ~100% and 
many of these proc edures can be performed in an outpatient setting. However , the functional 
success (patient's ability to eat  after stenting ) is much lower than the technical success. One of 
the major reasons for this discrepancy is these patients are on narcotics  which are  known to be 
associated with poor gastric motility. At the discretion of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], FDA approved enteral 
stents are placed either completely within the duodenum bridging the obstruction or placed 
across the pyloric opening besides bridging the duoden al obstruc tion.  
The significance of this study is to determine if trans -pyloric extension of an intra -duodenal stent 
facilitates better gastric emptying compared to an  intra-duodenal stent without trans -pyloric 
extension.  
Background : 
No studies have shown whether duodenal stenting by [CONTACT_335175] -
pyloric extension is superior in patients with duodenal obstruction secondary to malignancy. In 
one study, refractory gastroparesis  secondary to benign etiologies (id iopathic, diabetes, and 
post-surgical)  was managed with endoscopic trans -pyloric stent placement. In this study, clinical 
response was observed in 75% of patients. There was a predominant response in the patient's 
symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Gastric e mptying studies were done post -stenting which 
showed the mean 4 -hours gastric emptying normalized in 6 patients and significantly improved 
in 5 patients. In light of the success of trans -pyloric stenting in the setting of refractory 
gastroparesis due to be nign pathology, we hope to show the same level of effectiveness in the 
setting of malignancy  for which these stents are approved by [CONTACT_8415] . 
Hypothesis:  
Enteral self -expanding metal stents deployed across the malignant duodenal obstruction with 
trans -pyloric e xtension will facilitate better gastric emptying and thereby [CONTACT_335176] -expanding metal stents deployed completely with in the duodenum.  
 
 
 
Aims/Objectives:  
The objective of this study is to compare  symptom relief and gastric emptying  in the following 
two groups of patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction who have enteral self -expanding 
metal stents deployed 1) across the malignant duodenal obstruction with trans -pyloric 
extension  and 2)  enteral self -expanding metal stents deployed completely with the duodenum 
without trans -pyloric extension  
Recruitment Methods:   
Inpatients and outp atients referred to the Gastroenterology service at Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335169]. These patients are generally directly referred to 
the advance endoscopy faculty or are referred through the GI consult service.  
Inclusion Criteria  
• Confirmed diagnosis of cancer  
• Evidence of a single small bowel  obstruction  
• Considered palliative (can be on narcotics, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy)  
• Not a surgical candidate  
• >18 years of age  
• Able to give consent  
• Eligible for endoscopy (medically fit)  
• Able to traverse past obstruction with a guidewire  
Exclusion Criteria  
• <18 years of age  
• Unable to give consent  
• Pregnant  
• Have evidence of multiple sites of obstruction in the small bowel  
• Have evidence of duodenal obstruction secondary to gastric cancer  
• Ineligible for endoscopy (due to comorbidities or acuity of illness)  
• Unable to traverse past obstruction with a guidewire  
Methods /Procedures : 
This is a prospective chart review study. All the procedures are being done for clinic al 
indications. Since patients will b e randomized to group A or Group  B as below, a consent form 
will be used.  
• Prospectively enr oll patients based on inclusion -exclusion criteria.  
• Stent deployment completely intra-duodenal vs with trans -pyloric extension based on 
randomization . 
• Computer -generated randomization will be cond ucted. We expect to randomize 20  
patients each  to either complete intra -duodenal stenting (Group A) or with trans -pyloric 
extension (Group B).  
• Symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction: heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, bloating, 
belching, fullness after meals and epi[INVESTIGATOR_335170] -up clinic visits . 
• Medical record review of post -stent deployment ([ADDRESS_413723] -deployment to allow for 
full expansion of the stent) gastric emptying studies.  
• Solid and liquid T1/2 will be compared between these 2 groups using statistical analysis.  
• An interim statistical ly analysis will be performed to determine if we need to study more 
patients.  
Statistics : 
We plan to study 40 patients prospectively (20  in each arm) and then using statistical software, 
conduct an interim analysis to determine if more patients are required. Solid and liquid T1/[ADDRESS_413724]. 
Risks to Participants  
Patient will incur no additional risks associated with extending a stent trans-pyloric as opposed 
to leaving the stent completely intra -duodenal. Both these approaches are currently being 
practiced without any studies showing one approach being better or w orse than the other.  Also, 
patient’s private and confidential information may be breached in case the data is accessed by 
[CONTACT_259550]. In order to deal with this risk of confidentiality, the following measures 
will be taken:  
• Personal identifying  information will be available only to [CONTACT_335180] and authorized study 
staff who are officially part of the study.  
• Additionally, any paper forms will be kept in a locked cabinet at the gastroenterology 
department at MCW where the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335171]. The computer is password protected and only research members will have 
access to it. Any paper forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in the GI department.  
• Once the data is complete from MCW, the data will be stored in an excel spread sheet 
that is password protected. The data will be stored for the duration of the study and 
analysis, and once the study is completed, all the de -identified data will be stored for no 
more than 10 years.   
• Only [CONTACT_335180] and other authorized pers onnel will have access to the study folder.   
Consent Process  
The study will be described in detail to the patient by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_335172]. Perceived risks and benefits of the study will be 
described in detail. All patient question will be answered. The patient will be asked to sign a 
written informed consent document for the study. Consent can occur in two settings. If the 
patient is admitted, physical contact [CONTACT_335177] h in person consent being 
obtained. If the patient is to be done as an outpatient, the patient will be consented on the day of 
the procedure. Patient will be given enough time (at least a minimum of 15 minutes) to read the 
consent form and ask any question s. Study procedures can begin as soon as the consent is 
signed. Each subject will have the opportunity to decline participation in the study at any time, 
and will be assured that declining to participate will have no effect on their future medical care.

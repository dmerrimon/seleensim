INTRODUCTION AND RAT
IONALE
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Influenza virus causes seasonal epi[INVESTIGATOR_33754]. According to the World Health Organization
 
(WHO)
, the 
annual global attack rate of influenza is estimated to be 5%
–
10% in adults and 20%
–
30% in 
children; worldwide these annual epi[INVESTIGATOR_33755] 3 to 5 million c
ases of severe illness 
and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths 
[
1
]
. 
The
 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 
(CDC)
 
estimates that a pandemic 
i
nfluenza outbreak costs the [LOCATION_002] between $71 billion 
and $[ADDRESS_485774] on commerce and society
 
[

]
.
 
Infl
uenza is a
n
 
enveloped, 
negative
 
single
-
stra
nd
ed
 
(
-
ss)
 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus 
that 
belongs to the family 
Orthomyxoviridae
. Of the 
five
 
genera of influenza circulating in nature,
 
only 
influenza A and B 
are known to cause epi[INVESTIGATOR_387666]
s 
[

]
.
 
 
Influenza A viruses 
consist of 8 RNA g
ene 
segments and
 
are 
classified 
based on
 
the antigenicity 
of their surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 
There are 18 
different HA subtypes (H1 through H18) and [ADDRESS_485775], but only three HA 
subtypes (H1, 
H
2
, and
 
H3) and two NA subtypes (N1 and N2) have caused significant human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]
 
[
4
]
.
 
 
The HA is the predominant viral antigen target for antibo
dy neutralization
 
[
5
]
.
 
HA glycoprotein 
consists of a globular head 
domain 
(which is highly variant
 
in structure
 
between HA subtypes)
 
and 
a stem
 
domain
 
(which is 
highly 
conserved across HA subtypes)
 
[
6
]
. 
Most of the antibodies 
produced by [CONTACT_387688]
, 
whereas the stem 
domain is recognized by 
a
 
small population of antibodies 
[
7
-
9
]
. 
The anti
-
head antibo
dies are 
very 
potent
 
but are strain
-
specific 
while
 
the
 
anti
-
stem
 
antibodies
 
are less potent 
and
 
are cross
-
reactive across 
HA 
strains
 
[
10
]
. 
 
Influenza exhibits genetic flexib
ility and antigenic variability because of its ability to go through 
antigenic “drift” (the gradual accumulation of mutations over time) and antigenic “shift” (the 
replacement of the hemagglutinin gene by [CONTACT_387689] a 
host by [CONTACT_387690])
.
 
T
he emergence of new influenza strains
 
through
 
c
ontinuous mutation
 
and reassortment
 
of circulating virus diminish
es
 
the effectiveness of annual 
influenza 
vaccines
 
[
11
, 
12
]
.
 
F
urthermore, 
in the United 
States
, the
 
current
 
manufacturing process in egg
-
based systems can 
lead to lower yields and significant lag times 
due to 
virus strain identification
 
and
 
vaccine 
production, 
availability, and distribution
 
[
13
, 
14
]
.
 
T
hese 
limitations 
have raised the need 
for
 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a universal influenza vaccine that can 
provide durable, cross
-
strain protection against different influenza viruses, with a rapid 
manufacturing process in which large vaccine quantities could be produced under well
-
controlled con
ditions. 
A univ
ersal influenza vaccine would
 
eliminat
e
 
the need for annual 
reformulation and revaccination, and improv
e
 
pandemic preparedness
 
[

With
 
the goal of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a universal influenza vaccine, 
t
he Vacc

ligibility, and 
pregnancy 
test 
for females of reproductive potential. 
 
If screening evaluations suggest a current concerning health condition or infection
,
 
such as 
hepatitis, 
then 
appropriate lab

tests may be conducted to evaluate these conditions. 
Additional assessments of 
health may 
be conducted
 
at screening based on clinical judgment. 
Screening evaluations for specific eligibility criteria (
Section

Mucosal Sample Collection
 
Throughout the study, nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnostic purposes will be requested from 
subjects who me
et criteria for influenza
-
like illness (ILI) as defined in Section 
5.[ADDRESS_485806]
 
for research
. 
The
 
aphe
resis
 
procedure will be carried out by [CONTACT_387703] (DTM) medical staff using automated cell separator 
devices. 
 
A
pheresis performed 
for
 
this protocol will be performed solely for research purposes. 
All study 
subjects will be treated according to standard 
DTM 
whole blood and apheresis donation policies 
and procedures.
 
Prior to the schedul
ing apheresis
, the subject must have a venous assessm
ent 
performed by [CONTACT_33827]
. 
 
In order to undergo apheresis procedures, a subject must 
meet the apheresis eligibility criteria
 
as 
described in Section 
4.2.[ADDRESS_485807] a 
hemoglobin value less than permitted by [CONTACT_289629], then the apheresis will not be 
initiated,
 
and the ordering provider will be notified. 
 
In this study, the procedure will require two antecubital venous access sites and will involve 
processing 1 to 4 liters of whole blood. The expected mononuclear cell yield is approximately 
0.5 to 1.0 x 10
9
 
cells
 
per liter processed, and the apheresis device can process about 2
 
to 
3 liters 
per hour. Thus, 1 to 2 hours are required to process 1 to 4 liters of blood and obtain about 1
 
to 
4 
x 10
9
 
leukocytes. The packed red cell loss during the procedure is the equiva
lent of a 
6
 
mL blood 
draw; this is the volume that will 
be used
 
for the purposes of calculating cumulative blood draw 
when apheresis is performed.
 
During or following an apheresis visit, if there is any concern about the well
-
being of the subject, 
the DTM 
clinic may conduct appropriate medical evaluations by [CONTACT_969]

taking, physical 
examination, laboratory tests, and/or other testing.

compliance is the failure of investigator(s) to follow the applicable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing the protection of human subjects in research, or the requirements 
or determinations of the
 
IRB, whether intentional or not.
 
Non
-
compliance may be unintentional (e.g. due to lack of understanding, knowledge, or

The study 
ICF
 
describes the investigational product to be used and all aspects involved in 
protocol participation.
 
Before a subject’s participat

must
 
obtain written informed 
consent from the subject, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol
-

An IRB

approved 
AoU
, intended to assist in the evaluation of the subject’s understanding of this 
study, is administered as part of the consent process.
 
The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the subject’s medical records, as 
required by [ADDRESS_485849]’s anonymity is 
maintained and
 
will ensure that no 
information identifyi
ng the subject will 
be released
 
to any unauthorized party. Subjects will not 
be identified
 
in any reports on this study. All records will be kept confidential to the extent 
provided by [CONTACT_1032], state and local law. Medical records 
are made
 
available for re
view when 
required by [CONTACT_387713], such as the vaccine manufacturer, only under the 
guidelines set by [CONTACT_33842]. Direct access includes examining, analyzing,

representatives 
will review their study
-
related records without violating the confidentiality of the subjects. 
Stored study research samples a

Risks of Specimen Collections
 
•
 
Blood drawing
:
 
The risks of blood sample collection are minimal and consist of mild 
discomfort at the sample collection site. The procedure 
may cause pain, bruising, 
fainting, and, rarely, infection at the site where the blood 
is taken
.
 
•
 
Apheresis
:
 
The procedure
 
may cause
 
pain, bruising, and discomfort in the arms w
h
ere the 
needles are placed. It may also cause chills, nausea, heartburn, mild muscle cramps and 
tingling sensation around the mouth or in the fingers, however this can usually be 
relieved by [CONTACT_387714] a 
calcium containing antacid, such as Tums®. Other possible side effects are anxiety, 
vomiting and lightheadedness. Temporary lowering of the blood pressure may develop. 
There is the rare possibility of in
fection, fainting or seizure. Very rarely a nerve problem 
at the needle placement site may occur. Also, very rarely, a machine malfunction may 
occur, resulting in the loss of about one unit of blood. There may be additional risks of 
apheresis
 
that are unkn
own at this time.

Assessment of Relationship of an Adverse Event to Study Vaccine
: 
 
 
The 
relationship between an AE and the vaccine will be assessed by [CONTACT_289644].
 
•
 
Definitely Related
. 
The AE and administration of study agent are related in time, and 
a direct associati
on can be demonstrated.
 
•
 
Probably Related
. 
The AE and administration of study agent are reasonably related 
in time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_33857]. 
 
•
 
Possibly Related
. The AE and administration of study agent are 
reasonably related in 
time, but the AE can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_33858].
 
•
 
Not Related
. 
The 
AE
 
is clearly explained by [CONTACT_33859].
 
 
For purposes of preparing summary data reports in which 
AE
 
a
ttributions are simplified to 
“Related” or “Not Related”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Possibly” attributions 
above will be mapped to the “Related” category, while the “Unlikely/Probably Not Related” and 
“Not Related” attributions above 
will be mapped to the “Not Related” category. The definitions 
that apply when these two attribution categories alone are used are as follows:
 
•
 
Related
 
–
 
There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study 
product(s).
 
•
 
Not Related
 
–
 
Ther
e is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
product(s).
 
Grading the Severity of Adverse Events
:
 
The FDA Guidance for Industry (September 2007): “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preven
tive Vaccine Clinical Trials” is the basis for the 
severity grading of 
AE
s in this protocol. Several modifications were made to the table as follows:
 
•
 
“Emergency room visit” is not automatically considered a life
-
threatening event; these 
wor
ds have been rem
oved from any “G
rade 4
”
 
definition where they appear in the table 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_33786].
 
•
 
L
aboratory value shown as a “graded” value in the table that is within the institutional 
normal range will not be severity graded or recorded as an 
AE
.
 
•
 
Sev
erity grading for hemoglobin decrease on the basis of the magnitude of decrease from 
bas
eline is not applicable at the G
rade 1 level; only absolute hem
oglobin will be used to 
define G
rade 1
.
 
•
 
Severity grading for Grade [ADDRESS_485889]
 
(Erythema/Redness and 
Induration/Swelling) refer to necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis “requiring medical 
attention.”
 
•
 
Bruising or skin lesion associated with study injection will be assessed using the same 
severity grading as 
for 
erythema/redness.

When not otherwise specified, the following guidance will be used to assign a severity grade:
 
•
 
Grade 1 (Mild)
: No 
effect on activities of daily living
 
•
 
Grade 2 (Moderate)
: Some interference with activity not requiring medical intervention
 
•
 
Grade 3 (Severe)
: Prevents daily activity and requires medical intervention 
 
•
 
Grade 4 (
Potentially 
Life
-
threatening)
: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
; immediate medical 
intervention or therapy required to prevent death.
 
•
 
Grade 5 (Death)
: Death is assigned a Grade 5 severity. Only the single 
AE
 
that is

This consent form describes a research study and is designed to help you decide if you would like 
to be a part of the research study.  
You are being asked to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
Members of the study team will talk with you about the information described in this document. 
Some people have personal, religious, or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or 
research treatments they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions). Take the time needed 
to ask any questions and discuss this study with NIH staff, and with your family, friends, and 
personal health care providers. Taking part in research at the NIH is your choice.
IT IS YOUR CHOICE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY
You may choose not to take part in this study for any reason. If you join this study, you may change 
your mind and stop participating in the study at any time and for any reason. In either case, you 
will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. However, to be seen at the NIH, you 
must be taking part in a study or are being considered for a study. If you do choose to leave the 
study, please inform your study team to ensure a safe withdrawal from the research.  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
This is the first study in people of this experimental vaccine for prevention of H1 influenza (flu).

Administration (FDA). The FDA allows this vaccine to be used for research purposes only. We do 
not know if this vaccine works. The main purpose of this study is to see if the experimental vaccine 
is safe and if there are any side effects. We also want to study immune responses to this vaccine.
STUDY VACCINE
Vaccines are given to teach the body to prevent or fight an infection. In this study, we are testing 
one experimental vaccine that was developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC) at the NIH: 
H1 Stabilized Stem Ferritin vaccine, VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP. In this consent form, the study 
vaccine will be called the “H1 Ferritin vaccine.”
This vaccine is intended to help the body to make an immune response to H1 flu, which is a strain 
of flu that infects humans.
Most vaccines are made of proteins that are injected into a muscle. Proteins are natural substances 
that the body uses as building blocks. This vaccine is made in the laboratory with two proteins: 
one protein from the H1 flu virus and one protein from a type of bacteria called 
Helicobacter pylori 
(
H. pylori
). These two proteins have been modified in the laboratory. When combined, they make 
a particle that looks like the outside of the H1 flu virus. The body’s immune system may respond 
to this particle. There is no virus or bacteria in the vaccine, so you cannot get an H1 flu infection 
or
 H. pylori
 infection from this vaccine.
We do not know if the H1 Ferritin vaccine will protect you from flu.

STUDY PLAN
About 53 people will take part in this study at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. 
If you are enrolled in Group 1, you will get one vaccination and remain in the study for about one 
year. 
If you are enrolled in Groups 2A, Group 2B, Group 2C, or Group 2D you will get two vaccinations 
and remain in the study for about one year and three months.
You will get the experimental vaccine by [CONTACT_33864] (shots) in the upper arm muscle. This is called 
an intramuscular “IM” injection. We will use a needle and syringe to give you the H1 Ferritin 
vaccine. We will check you for any side effects from the vaccine. 
We will tell you if we learn anything new during this study that might cause you to change your 
mind about staying in the study. At the end of the study, we will tell you when study results may 
be available and how to learn about them.
There will be two different doses of vaccine given in this study, a lower dose (20 mcg) and a higher 
dose (60 mcg).
Group 1 will get the lower dose of the H1 Ferritin vaccine one time on the day of enrollment. If 
there are no safety concerns at this dose after 2 weeks of follow-up, we will start enrolling people 
to get the higher dose.
Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D will get the higher dose of the H1 Ferritin vaccine on the day of the 
enrollment and about 4 months later (week 16). Groups are based on age. This is done so that 
researchers may compare the immune response of people of different ages.

STUDY PROCEDURES
If you agree to take part in the study and are enrolled in:
Group 1: you will have 1 vaccination visit, 1 phone follow-up, and 9 follow-up clinic visits. 
Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D: you will have [ADDRESS_485933] follow-up clinic visits will take about 1 
to 2 hours; the optional apheresis visit will take [ADDRESS_485934] results show 
a health problem. Some blood samples will be used for research only so that we can study your 
immune response to the vaccine. Results of these research tests are not used to check your health 
and will not be given to you.
Mucosal Swab
: It is very important to report symptoms including fever of [ADDRESS_485935] this sample. Each swab is new and 
sterile and is safe for use in sensitive parts of the body.

Apheresis
: For subjects enrolled in Group 2A, Group 2B, Group 2C, and Group 2D, after your 
last study injection, we would like to collect your blood by a method called “apheresis.” This 
procedure is optional and choosing not to take part in it will not affect your study participation.
To be eligible for apheresis:

You must not have an unstable heart as indicated by [CONTACT_33867]

You must not have blood pressure greater than 180/100

You must not have a known blood clotting disorder

You must not be pregnant or breast feeding

You must not have a condition that the attending physician or the apheresis clinic staff 
considers a reason to not do an apheresis procedure.
Before apheresis, we will check your weight, pulse and blood pressure. We will ask questions 
about your general health and medical history.  If you are a woman who can get pregnant, we will 
do a pregnancy test before the apheresis procedure. The test must show that you are not pregnant.
During the procedure, you will lie on a recliner, couch, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33798]. The procedure requires 
that a needle be placed into a vein in both arms using a sterile method. The kits used to collect 
apheresis samples are sterile, single-use, disposable sets that are not in contact [CONTACT_33868]’s 
bodily fluids other than yours. No blood products are given to you during these procedures. The 
apheresis is done at the NIH Clinical Center, and a physician from the NIH Department of 
Transfusion Medicine will be available in or near the apheresis area at all times.
In the apheresis procedure, blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm, spun in a 
machine that separates the desired blood components (white blood cells) and then the rest of your 
blood is returned to you through a needle in the other arm. Citrate, a medication to prevent blood 
from clotting, is added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting.
The purpose of this procedure is to allow us to get and study a larger number of white blood cells 
that cannot be collected by [CONTACT_33869]. The number of white blood cells collected is a 
small fraction of the total amount in your body. The body quickly replaces cells that have been 
removed. The Blood Bank of the NIH Clinical Center and other blood banks use similar procedures 
every day to collect blood samples from donors and as a form of therapy for some diseases. 
However, we will not use your samples for transfusion or therapy. The procedure will take 
approximately 1-3 hours.

typi[INVESTIGATOR_31545]. These tests are not used to check your health and we will not tell you the results. 
A special genetic test, called HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], is done by [CONTACT_387719]. 
These results will be in your medical record, but they will not be used to check your health. Any 
genetic testing, including HLA testing, is for research purposes only. Any genetic information 
collected or learned about you will be kept confidential. Medical records, including HLA test 
results are kept securely. We will not give any genetic information that is in your medical record 
to anyone without your permission.
STORED SAMPLES
We will collect blood samples from you during the study. We will keep these samples for future 
research indefinitely to learn more about flu virus, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
research questions. Results from research with your samples will not be in your medical record or 
reported to you.
Labeling of Stored Samples
: Your stored samples will be labeled by a special code or number 
and not your personal information. Only the study team can link this code to you. Any identifying 
information about you (like name [CONTACT_40234]) will be kept as confidential as allowable by [CONTACT_2371].
Risks of Stored Samples
: There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your medical 
record. The chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person without your 
permission is very small. Possible problems with the unplanned release of information include 
discrimination when applying for insurance or employment. Similar problems may occur if you 
give information about yourself or agree to have your medical record released.
Future studies: 
In the future, other investigators at NIH or outside of NIH may wish to study your 
stored samples. When your stored samples are shared, they will be marked with a code. Your 
samples will not have any identifying information on them. Some information about you, like your 
gender, age, health history, or ethnicity may be shared with other researchers. Any future research

Your stored samples will only be used for research and will not be sold. The research done with 
your materials may be used to develop new products in the future, but you will not receive payment 
for such products.
Making your Choice: 
You cannot take part in this study if you do not want us to collect or store 
your blood samples. If you agree to take part in this study, you must also agree to let us keep any 
of your samples and data for future research.
If you decide not to take part in this study, you may still take part in other studies at NIH.
POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS
Possible 
risks of injections: 
Temporary stinging, pain, redness, soreness, itchiness, swelling, or 
bruising. 
Possible 
risks of any vaccine: 
Fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, 
and feeling tired and/or unwell. These types of reactions are usually greatest within the first [ADDRESS_485939] 1 to 3 days. Over-the-counter medicine, like 
acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen, may be used to help these symptoms. 
Very rarely, a serious allergic reaction with symptoms like hives, trouble breathing, or sudden 
weakness may occur shortly after any vaccination. This is called “anaphylaxis” and may be life-
threatening. While you are waiting in the clinic after the vaccination, we will monitor you for 
anaphylaxis. Treatment for anaphylaxis will be given right away if it occurs.
Possible
 risks of the H1 Ferritin vaccine
: The H1 Ferritin vaccine has not been given to people 
before. It may have unknown risks. It has been tested in mice and rabbits. The vaccine did not 
cause any unusual side effects and met the safety criteria to be tested in humans.
Possible 
risks of blood drawing:
 Pain, bleeding, bruising, feeling lightheaded, and fainting. 
Rarely, infection may occur at the site where the blood is taken.
Possible 
risks of mucosal sample collection: 
Samples collected by [CONTACT_387720], or a little bleeding.
Possible
 risks of apheresis
: Apheresis is generally safe and side effects are rare. Pain, bruising or 
discomfort at the needle placement site may occur. Sometimes apheresis causes a tingling 
sensation around the lips, nose and mouth, coolness all over and slight nausea. This can usually be 
relieved by [CONTACT_33874][INVESTIGATOR_387685], 
like Tums
®
. Other possible side effects are anxiety, vomiting and lightheadedness. Temporary 
lowering of the blood pressure may develop. There is the rare possibility of infection, fainting or

seizure. Very rarely a nerve problem at the needle placement site may occur. Also, very rarely, a 
machine malfunction may occur and result in the loss of about one unit (one pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]) of blood.
There are theoretical risks from re-infusion of the blood after processing by [CONTACT_289649]. However, this has not been seen in many 
thousands of volunteers who have undergone this or similar procedures to date. There may be other 
risks of apheresis that are unknown at this time.
Unknown
 safety risks
: There may be side effects from the study vaccines - even serious or life-
threatening ones- that we do not yet know about. Please tell the study staff about any side effect 
you think you are having. This is important for your safety.
Possible
 risks of genetic testing
: Unplanned release of information that could be used by [CONTACT_387721]; discovering a gene that suggests risk of 
disease for you or your family; discovering unknown family relationships.
Possible
 risks of data sharing:  
Information in the shared databases could be linked back to you 
and used to discriminate against you or your family.  State and federal laws provide some 
protections against genetic and pre-existing conditions discrimination.
Possible
 risks during pregnancy
: We do not know how the experimental vaccines may affect a 
fetus or nursing infant. Therefore, women who can become pregnant must have a negative 
pregnancy test before each injection and agree to use effective birth control beginning at least [ADDRESS_485941] if you become pregnant or think that you might be pregnant 
during the study. If you are pregnant, you will not get any more vaccinations. You will be asked 
to continue with follow-up visits so that we can check your health. We will ask you the outcome 
of the pregnancy.
Possible
 other risks
: We do not know if the study vaccine will change how your body responds 
to flu virus infections in the future.
You may not donate blood at a blood bank while taking part in this study. You may not donate 
blood for one year after the last experimental vaccine injection.
POSSIBLE BENEFITS
This study is not designed to benefit you. We do not know if the vaccines will work. The study is 
not designed to protect you from flu. You and others may benefit in the future from the information 
that will be learned from the study. The study visits are used to check your health for research 
purposes, not to provide health care. However, we will tell you right away if any of your test results 
show a possible health problem.

REASONS FOR STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_387686]. Reasons for this may include:

You don’t keep appointments or follow procedures

You get a serious illness that needs ongoing medical care.

You have a serious side effect, thought to be due to the study vaccine.

You become pregnant.

You need to get treatment with a medication that affects your immune system (such as 
a steroid like prednisone).

The study is stopped by [CONTACT_17513], the study sponsor or study investigators. 
If this happens, we will tell you why.
If you agree to take part in this study, it is important for you to keep all of your appointments. Your 
participation in this study is completely voluntary. You can choose to stop taking part in the study 
at any time. There is no penalty or loss of benefits if you choose to leave the study.
If you are not able to get the second injection (for Groups 2A, Group 2B, Group 2C, and Group 
2D), we will adjust your schedule but will ask that you still have study visits. It is important that 
we continue to check your health even if you do not get a second injection.
ALTERNATIVES
This study is not designed to treat or prevent any disease. You may choose to not take part in this 
study. You may be eligible for other studies. 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The NIH research staff is checked yearly for conflicts of interest. You may ask the research team 
for more information. This study may have investigators who are not NIH employees. Non-NIH 
investigators are expected to follow the principles of the Protocol Review Guide but are not 
required to report their personal financial holdings to the NIH. 
The NIH, including some members of the VRC scientific staff, developed the investigational 
vaccines being used in this research study. The results of this study could play a role in whether 
the FDA will approve the vaccine for sale at some time in the future. If approved, the future sale 
of the vaccine could lead to payments to NIH and some NIH scientists. By U.S. law, government 
scientists are required to receive such payments for their inventions. You will not get any money 
from the development or sale of the product.

of compensation, if any, is guided by [CONTACT_100438].
You will be compensated for your time and inconvenience by [CONTACT_387722]. It is possible that you may have some expenses that are not covered by [CONTACT_387723].
The compensation is $275 for each vaccination visit. You will get $25 total for the timely 
completion of all 7 days of an electronic diary. You will get $175 for each scheduled follow-up 
visit that includes a research blood draw. You will get $75 for all other clinic visits that do not 
include research blood draws or mucosal sample collection. You will get $250 for apheresis 
procedure. You will get an additional $50 for any visit that also includes a nose and throat swab.
If you are enrolled in Group 1, the total compensation for completion of all study visits is about 
$1,875.
If you are enrolled in Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, or 2D, the total compensation for completion of all study 
visits is about $2,525 without apheresis and about $2,600 with apheresis.
If you are unable to finish the study, you will receive compensation for the visits and for the parts 
you completed.  
With few exceptions, study compensation is considered taxable income that is reportable to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A “Form 1099-Other Income” will be sent to you if your total 
payments for research participation are $[ADDRESS_485944] payment by [CONTACT_100440]?
Some NIH Clinical Center studies offer reimbursement or payment for travel, lodging or meals 
while participating in the research. The amount, if any, is guided by [CONTACT_100438].

you or your doctors anything that we find that is not related to infection or immunity. However, if 
we find something in your DNA that we think is urgent to deal with because of your health, we 
will confirm the result and then tell you about it. We think this sort of problem will be very rare.
Genetic Data Sharing
Following genetic testing for transcriptome sequencing, your sequence data may be shared in a 
controlled access public database, for other investigators to benefit from it. However, no personal, 
identifiable information will be shared in this process, as the shared results will be coded with no 
link back to you.

Act protections differ from the Certificate of Confidentiality.  For example, sometimes the Privacy 
Act allows release of information from your record without your permission, for example, if it is 
requested by [CONTACT_100444]. Information may also be released for certain research purposes with due 
consideration and protection, to those engaged by [CONTACT_100445], to certain 
federal and state agencies, for HIV partner notification, for infectious disease or abuse or neglect 
reporting,  to tumor registries, for quality assessment and medical audits, or when the NIH is 
involved in a lawsuit.  However, NIH will only release information from your medical record if it 
is permitted by [CONTACT_289651].
POLICY REGARDING RESEARCH-RELATED INJURIES  
The NIH Clinical Center will provide short-term medical care for any injury resulting from your 
participation in research here. In general, no long-term medical care or financial compensation for 
research-related injuries will be provided by [CONTACT_18121], the NIH Clinical Center, or the Federal 
Government. However, you have the right to pursue legal remedy if you believe that your injury 
justifies such action.

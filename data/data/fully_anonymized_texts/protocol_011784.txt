In addition to screening, pre -dose FEV 1 and FVC will be assessed at -45 minutes and -15 minutes prior to dosing on 
Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21. Trough FEV 1 will be assessed on Day 22 (ie, 24 hours after the Day 21 dose).  
On Day 1 and Day 21, FEV 1 will be recorded, at the following time points after the mor ning dose: immediately 
post-dose at 5 minutes (± 3 minute s), 15 minutes (±2 minutes), 30 minutes (±5 minutes), 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 
2 hours (120 minutes); and post -dose at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, [ADDRESS_1217922] dose. The 
window for 1 -hour spi[INVESTIGATOR_872045] ±[ADDRESS_1217923] effort (Test 1) regardless of whether this is 
an acceptab le effort   instead of  “start time of first spi[INVESTIGATOR_177549]  ” as described in the protocol.  
 
FEV 1: FEV 1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second as measured by a spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007].  
Peak FEV 1: It is defined as the maximum FEV [ADDRESS_1217924] -morning dose.  
Trough FEV 1: It is defined as the mean FEV [ADDRESS_1217925] -morning 
dose of the previous day.  
Baseline FEV 1: It is defined as the average of the pre -dose FEV 1 measured at -45 minutes and -15 minutes at Day  1 
FVC: FVC is the amount of air which can be forcib ly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath 
possible.  
Baseline FVC: It is defined as the average of the pre -dose FVC measured at -45 minutes and -15 minutes at Day  1. 
Safety:  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all A dverse Events (AE s) and serious adverse events  
(SAEs)  including treatment related AEs and SAEs as well as AEs leading to discontinuation , clinical laboratory 
measurements, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, and physical examinations.

    Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, have received at least [ADDRESS_1217926] -baseline PD assessment. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for the PD endpoints.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. All safety 
endpoints will use the SAF unless otherwise specified.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PP)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, received  at least [ADDRESS_1217927] exclusionary major protocol deviations.  Major and exclusionary protocol deviations will be defined 
in this SAP and by [CONTACT_872082].  
PK Analysis Set (PKAS)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, received at least [ADDRESS_1217928] 90% power to detect a differe nce in mean change from 
baseline in trough FEV 1 of 150 mL between GSP304 and GSP304 placebo assuming a 2 -sided alpha of 5% and a 
standard deviation (SD) of 170 mL. These assumptions are based on available literature from similar studies 
conducted for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872046]® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]®. 
Given the overall 1:1:1:1:1 study  treatment allocation ratio, 140 subjects are required for the analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Assuming a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 155 subjects (31 subjects per treatment arm) will be 
randomized.  
This sample size is also considered to be sufficient for the relative bioavailability endpoint.  
Pharmacodynamics  Analyses  
The PD comparisons will be made between each dose of GSP304 and GSP304 placebo  as well as Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872047] . 
Analysis of Primary Pharmacodynamics  Endpoint.  
Change from baseline in trough FEV [ADDRESS_1217929] dose of treatment on Day 21 in comparison to 
GSP304 placebo. The primary endpoint measures the  change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough 
FEV [ADDRESS_1217930] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217931] -dose measurements) . This will be analyzed using a Mixed -effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) 
model to produce treatment differences for each dose of GSP 304 vs GSP304 placebo. The MMRM model will 
include  the trough FEV 1 assessment on day 1 and  pre-dose data from all visits (Days 7, 14, and 21 , which are the 
trough FEV 1 assessments on days 6, 13 and 20 ) and fixed terms for treatment, visit, baseline, center, treatment by 
[CONTACT_872083]. The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment 
differences for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiple 
imputation -based methods will be considered as a sensitivity analysis for missing dat a, with further detail provided.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS and primary inference will be based on Day [ADDRESS_1217932] dose on Day 1 and Day 21: This endpoint measures the 
peak FEV [ADDRESS_1217933] to that of the primary endpoint to 
produce treatment differences for each dose o f GSP304 versus GSP304 placebo.  
Change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at approximately [ADDRESS_1217934] 
dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217935] -dose measurements ) will be analyzed using 
MMRM in a similar way to that of the primary endpoint to produce treatment differences for each dose of GSP304 
versus GSP304 placebo.  
Change from baseline in time -normalized area under the curve for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours on Da y 1 and Day 
21: The endpoint measures a series of FEV 1 readings taken within 12 hours of dosing.  
The trapezoidal rule will be used to calculate AUC 0-12h and then normalized to the length of time. The change from 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -[ADDRESS_1217936] to that of the primary endpoint to produce treatment 
differences for each dose of GSP304 versus GSP304 placebo.  
All PD data will also be displayed in summaries and listings.  
Time to steady -state: This is the time period from the first dose to two consecutive similar trough FEV 1 or FVC  
measurements. The trough values  will be tabulated and plotted  by [CONTACT_872084].  
Time to onset of action ( of both a 12% increase and 200 mL increase in FEV 1 within 12  hours of dosing ): This is the 
time period from the first dose to first onset of at least 12  percent and 200 mL improvement in FEV1 over the  
baseline value. The trough values will be tabulated and plotted by [CONTACT_872085] .  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenomics , and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using the PKAS.  
Plasma : Individual subject p lasma PK parameters will be determined from plasma concentrations using non-
compartmental methods for each subject. Actual collection times will be used for the analyses.  
Urine : Amount and fraction of dose of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_872048]. Nominal  colle ction times and urine volumes wi ll be used for the estimation.  
Additional parameters may be evaluated depending on the data obtained during the study. The derived PK 
parameters will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject and day and summarized by [CONTACT_55419]. Wherever appropriate, 
data will be visualized by [CONTACT_872086]. For the summaries, descriptive statistics for all 
relevant PK parameters will include: n, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, 
geometric  mean %CV, median, minimum and maximum. The plasma concentrations and amount in urine of 
tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_872049] , summarized by [CONTACT_3148], and presented  graphically as mean plots, and  
spaghetti  plots.   
Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the ln -transformed PK parameters AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS. 
The ANOVA model will include treatment as fixed effect. The results from the model will be back -transformed and 
the adj usted geometrics means for each treatment and the estimated treatment ratios for the treatment comparisons 
will be p resented together with 90% CIs.  
The ratios and corresponding 90% CIs will be expressed as a percentage.  
The following comparisons will be ma de: 
GSP304 (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893]) Inhalation Solution, 10 μg  
GSP304 (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893]) Inhalation Solution, 20 μg  
GSP304 (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893]) I nhalation Solution, 40 μg  
For GSP304, dose -proportionality of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] C maxSS and AUC 0-tauSS parameters will be  assessed using a power 
model (linear regression relating log -transformed C maxSS and AUC 0-tauSS to the log - transformed dose). Estimates of 
the mean slopes of log -transformed dose will be reported along with corresponding 90% CIs. Dose proportionality 
will also be assessed based on amount of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_872050] .  
Pharmacogenomics , and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Not applicable.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the SAF and will be presented by [CONTACT_104841]. Safety data will be 
summarized descriptively. Data describing quantitative measures will be summarized as mean, SD, median and 
range (minimum and maximum). Qualitative variables will be presented as counts and percentages.  
All safety data will  also be displayed in lis tings.  
Other Analyses   
Not applicable.

4.3. Sample Size Considerations  
4.3.1.  Sample Size Justifications  
 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_1217950] 90% power to detect a difference in 
mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1 of 150 mL between GSP304 and GSP304 placebo 
assuming a 2 -sided alpha of 5% and a standard deviation ( SD) of 170 mL. These assumptions ar e 
based on available literature from similar studies conducted for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]® (Caillaud  et 
al., 2007) .  Given the overall 1:1:1:1:1 study  treatment allocation ratio, 140 subjects are required 
for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Assuming a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 155 subjects 
(31 subjects per treatment arm) will be randomized.  
This sample size is also considered to be sufficient for the relative bioavailabili ty endpoint . 
 
4.3.2.  Sample Size Re -estimation  
No sample size re -estimation is planned for this study.  
4.4. Randomization  
Randomization and investigational product (IP) assignment will occur in the morning of Day [ADDRESS_1217951] for the study confirmed. Randomization numbers will be issued centrally using  
interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interact ive web response system (IWRS). Randomized

    subjects who termi nate their study participatio n for any reason, regardless of whether study drug 
has been taken or not, will retain their randomization number.  
Subjects will be assigned in the ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 to re ceive treatments with either of double -
blind GSP304 at 1  of 3 dose levels, open -label Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]®, or double -blind GSP304 
placebo based on a computer -generated randomizati on scheme that will be reviewed and 
approved by a statistician. The randomization scheme will  be stored within the IVRS/IWRS 
database until unblinding of this study is requeste d. The randomization scheme and identification 
for each subject will be included in the final clinical study report for this study.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Values Below the Limit of Quantification  
All plasma/urine concentrations below the  lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) or missing data 
will be labeled as below the limit of quantification (BLQ) or missing, respectively, in the 
concentration data listings.  
Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for the generation of plasma PK Parame ters 
and for plotting of individual plasma PK concentration data  
BLQ values will be imputed in the PK concentration dataset used for the derivation of PK 
parameters. The following rules will be applied:  
 BLQs at the beginning of a subject profile (ie before  the first incidence of a 
measurable concentration on the first day of dosing) will be assigned to zero;  
 BLQs at the end of a subject profile (ie after the last incidence of a measurable 
concentration on last day of dosing) will be set to missing;  
 Single o r consecutive BLQs which fall between measurable concentrations will be set 
to missing.  
 Quantifiable concentrations falling between two BLQ values might be set to missing 
if considered anomalous by [CONTACT_872090].  
For linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be included in the plot  while missing values will 
be ignored . For log -linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be assigned a ½ LLOQ value  
with the exception of the pre -dose sample collected on Day 1  while missing concentrations at the 
end of the profile will be ignored .

    Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for summarizing plasma PK concentration 
data  
BLQ values will be imputed for mean concentration -time plots and tabular summaries according 
to the following rules:  
 All BLQ values will be set to zero, except when an individual BLQ falls between two 
measurable values  or one or more BLQs fall at the end of a subject profile , in which  
case  they will be set to missing;  
 Mean values will be reported  only if calculated on a minimum of 3 quantifiable 
concentrations. The number of subjects contributing to the calculation of the mean 
will be specified in a footnote to the mean plots (both in linear and semi -log scales) if 
lower than the t otal amount of s amples available per time point;  
A high proportion of BLQ values may affect derivation of SD; if more than 30% of values at a 
time-point are imputed, then SD will not be displayed.  
Tabular summaries for concentration -time data will report N (number of subj ects who received 
treatment), n (number of subjects with non -missing values) and, if applicable, number imputed 
(number of subjects with imputed values (ie, BLQ assigned zero concentration).  
Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for summarizing urine PK concentration data  
 For instances in which the subject did not void during the specified interval and ‘NS’ 
is present in the listing, the concentration value will be set to missing.   
Considerations in the handling of missing data for the generation of u rine PK Parameters  
 For instances in which the subject did not void during the specified interval the 
concentration will be set to zero to allow calculation of urine PK parameters . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetic Parameters Calculation Methods  
PK parameters will be calcula ted by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analysis methods from the 
concentr ation -time data following these guidelines:  
 Actual sampling times relative to dosing rather than nominal times will be used in the 
calculation of all derived PK parameters;  
 There will be no imputat ion of missing data;  
 Any subjects with missing concentration data will be included in the PK analysis set 
provided that at least C maxSS  and/or AUC 0-tauSS can be reliably calculated . A decision 
will be taken on a case by [CONTACT_872091] r consultation with the 
sponsor ; 
 Cmax and C maxSS  will be obtained directly from the concentration -time data ; 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 30  
     tmax is the time at which  Cmax or C maxSS  is observed ; 
 λZ will be estim ated at terminal phase by [CONTACT_872092] -transformation of 
the concentrations : 
o Only those data points that are judged to describe the terminal log -linear 
decline will be used in the regression  
o A minimum number of three data points in the terminal phase will be used in 
calculation λz with the line of regression starting at any post -Cmax data point  
(Cmax should not be part of the regression slope).  The adjusted correlation 
coefficient (R2 adjusted) in general should be greater than 0.80.  
o The interval used to determine λz should be eq ual or greater than 1.5-fold the 
estimated half -life or otherwise flagged and used at the PK scientist’s best 
knowledge and judgment. The corresponding estimated t1/2 will need to be 
flagged or excluded from statistical analysis accordingly.  
 t1/2 will be calculated as ln2/λ Z; 
 CavSS will be calculated as AUC 0-tauSS/tau; 
 AUC 0-tau and AUC 0-tauSS will be calculated using the linear up/linear down method;  
 CminSS will be obtained directly from the concentration -time data. In the event of a 
minimum concentration during the dosing interval at steady state (C minSS) not 
coinciding with the pre -dose concentration at steady state (C trough on day 21 ), both 
parameters will be reported;  
 Rac(AUC) will be calculated as AUC 0-tauSS/AUC 0-tau;  
 Rac(Cmax) will be calculated as C maxSS /Cmax; 
 Aetau is the c umulative amount excreted over the dosing interval and will be 
calculated as the sum of the products of concentration and urine volume over the 
appropriate collection intervals.  For the calculation of urine PK parameters the 
proto col time intervals should be used. If a subject urinates into the toilet or a urine 
sample is lost any other way, or if no urine volume has been recorded for a sampling 
interval, the cumulative amount excreted starting with this interval cannot be 
calculat ed. If, however, a subject is unable to urinate, no amount excreted has been 
lost and the cumulative amount can continue to be calculated past that collection 
interval. For the affected time interval, the partial amount will be zero ; 
 Fe% is the fraction of  unchanged drug in urine expressed as a percentage and will be 
calculated as Fe%=(A etau/Dose)*100.

Any inconsistency between plasma and urine PK would be will be further investigated and might 
be flagged and/or excluded from the analysis at the discretion of the PK Scientist after 
consultation with the sponsor . 
An exploratory PK/ glomerular filtration rate (GFR) analysis of GSP304 in urine and plasma 
may be performed if deemed appropriate following review of the summary PK and GFR data. 
The decision to perform this analysis will be made by [CONTACT_872093], 
figures and listings produced at the end of the study. If the decision is made not to proceed with 
the PK/ GFR analysis, this section of the SAP will not be applicable and the outputs described 
herein will not be presented.  
6.7.7.  Pharmacodynamics Parameter Calculat ion: Time -normalized Area under the 
Curve (AUC) for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours  
 
Time -normalized Area under the Curve (AUC) for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours  is defined as 
the area between baseline FEV 1 and the FEV 1 curve from 0 to 12 hours divided by 12 hours.   
12 hour serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_872057] 1 and Day 21  of each treatment period: 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_872058] 5 minutes (± 3 minute s), 15 minutes (±2 minutes), 
30 minutes (±5 minutes),  60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 2 hours (120 minutes); and post -dose at 4, 
6, 8, 10, 12, 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes.  
 
AUC is calculated from zero time to 12 hours (AUC 0-12), using the trapezoidal method, divided 
by 12 hours to give the   AUC 0-12/12h values in litres.   Non-missing FEV 1 values at the following 
time points are required in order to calculate the normalised AUC 0-12/12h: pre-dose; at least one 
value between [ADDRESS_1217975] -dose (inclusive); and at least one value after [ADDRESS_1217976]-dose. Otherwise the normalised AUC 0-12/12h will be missing.    
 
AUC 0-12/12h is calculated as follows:  
AUC 0−12/12ℎ= 1

Where d i is the spi[INVESTIGATOR_872059] (FEV 1) obtained at time t i; ti is the time (in hours) for which d i 
is measured: t 0 = 0, t 1 = 0.08 , t2 = 0.25, t3 = 0.5 , t4 = 1, t5 = 1.5, t6 = 2, t7 = 4, t 8 = 6, t 9 = 8, t 10 = 10

handling  missing data.   
6.8.2.  Missing Start and Stop Dates for Prior and Concomitant Medication  
For the purpose of inclusion in prior and/or conco mitant medication tables, incomplete 
medication start and stop dates will be imputed as follows:  
 If year and month are present and day is missing, then set day to first day of month 
for start date, and set day to last day of month for end date  
 If year and day are present and month is missing, then set month to January for start 
date, and set month to December for end date  
 If year is present and month and day are missing, then set month and day to January 1 
for start date, and set month and day to December 31 for end date  
 Completely missing date will not be imputed  
The partial dates will be provided as such in the subject data listings (with the imputed dates).  
When imputing a start date, ensure that the new imputed date is sensible ie is prior to the end 
date of prior and concomitant medication s. 
 
6.8.3.  Missing Start and Stop Dates for Adverse Events  
Due diligence will be done to obtain accurate AE information. If all planned methods to obtain 
accurate AE information have failed, missing and partial AE onset and end dates will be 
imputed. Imputed dates will be flagged in the in dividual supportive subject listings. Unless 
otherwise specified, the following conventions will be used:  
Missing and Partial AE onset dates

 38  
    Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be permitted throughout the study as rescue medication  and will 
be dispensed to the subjects at Visit 2 or at the start of washout (if the subject requires washout) 
and at subse quent scheduled visits as required, for self -administration as needed, at home . 
Subjects will be trained to abstain from using albuterol/salbutamol MDI, 6 hours prior to start 
ofeach visit. If this is not possible, the visit will need to be rescheduled. An y rescue 
medication(s ) taken will be recorded in the subject diary and appropriate eCRFs.  A summar y 
showing the number of subjects  who used rescue mediation at any time post randomization  
(based on the information reported in the subject diary)  and a descr iptive summary of the amount 
of rescue medication used (based on the information reported in the subject diary) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_2939], as change as from baseline in daily and weekly averages.  A by -
subject listing of all rescue  medication used, as reported on the patient diary,  will also be 
provided.  
All concomitant medication will be coded using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) [ADDRESS_1217982] be recorded in the EDC system for each concomitant 
medic ation: preferred name [CONTACT_111446] , route of administration, start date, stop date, dose 
level, total daily dose, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a concomitant 
medication must be recorded in the EDC system.  
Medications will be assi gned to a time period (prior and/or concomitant) as follows:  
 If both the start and stop date exist and are before the first dose date of study drug, the 
medication will be counted as prior.  
 If the start  date is on or after the first dose date of study drug , the medication will be 
counted as concomitant.  
 If the start date and stop date is on the first dose date of study drug, the medication 
will be counted as prior.  
 If the start date is before the first dose date of study drug and the stop date is after the  
first dose date of study drug or the medication is continuing, the medication will be 
counted as prior and concomitant.   
 If the start date is missing and the stop date is before the first dose of study drug, the 
medication will be counted as prior.  
 If the  start date is missing and the stop date is after the first dose of study drug or the 
medication is continuing, the medication will be counted as concomitant.  
 If the start and stop dates are missing, the medication will be counted as concomitant.  
Summaries  showing number of subjects and percentage taking each medication will be provided 
for each preferred medication term by [CONTACT_2939].  This will be done separately for prior and

The number of subjects exposed to each study treatment will be summarized.  
The number of day s on treatment and the number of days on study ( screening  through to end of 
study/follow -up) will be summarized by [CONTACT_204282].  
Treatment compliance will be calculated (the total number of doses actually taken / total number 
of doses expected*100). Fo r subjects who have completed the study:  
 Compliance Criteria  
Study Period  Duration  Scheduled Doses  Not less than 
80% (doses)  Not more than 120% (doses)  
Randomized Treatment  21 Days  21 17  25 
For subjects who are early terminated, treatment compliance will be determined from their 
duration in the study, up to the time they are considered early terminated. Subjects taking fewer 
than 80% or more than 120% of the required doses will be considered non-compliant with 
dosing.  
In addition, treatment compliance will be classified into four categories (<80%, ≥80% - ≤100%, 
>100% - <120%, ≥120%). Treatment compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_872095].

    logarithm of data expressed in anti -logarithmically as a percent (ie 100 ×√exp( 𝑆𝐷2)−1).  For 
tmax and t last , only median, minimum and maximum values will be presented. No descriptive 
statistics will be determined when fewer than three individual PK parameters are available.  
Combined individual plasma concentrations versus actual times will be pl otted by [CONTACT_872097] (spaghetti plots) . 
For doses  of GSP304, the arithmetic mean  plasma  concentration versus nominal times will be 
presented overlaid with the arithmetic mean profile of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]®Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]® by [CONTACT_872098] -logarithmic scale s.  
The following rules will be followed with regards to t he number of decimal places and 
presentation of data in the tables and listings of concentration data:  
 The individual concentrations will be reported to the same precision as the source 
data (for example, if the source data is presented to five significant digits, the

    8.3. Statement of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses  
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted for the  primary pharmacokinetic endpoints.  
8.4. Analysis of the Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The primary endpoint , AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS , will be analyzed using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA)  model.  An ANOVA will  be performed on the ln -transformed   AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS . 
The ANOVA model will include treatment as fixed  effect. The results from the model will be 
back -transformed and the adjusted geometric means for each treatment and the estimated 
treatment ratios for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 90% CIs. The 
ratios and corresponding 90% CIs will be expressed as a percentage. The foll owing comparisons 
will be made:  
 GSP304 10 μg vs Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]® 
 GSP304 20 μg vs Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]®

for the treatment comparisons will also be plotted, with corresponding 9 0% confidence intervals . 
8.5. Expl oratory Analysis   
 
Dose -proportionality  
Dose -proportionality of t iotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] C maxSS  and AUC 0-tauSS parameters will be assessed using  an 
ln-transformed power model:  
log 𝑒 Yj =  α+ β log 𝑒dose j +εj, 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 43  
    where  Yj  = CmaxSS or AUC 0-tauSS   at j th dose level. If β=0, then it implies that the response is 
independent from the dose and when β=1, dose -proportionality can be declared .  
 
A mixed effect model can be used to fit the Power Model. Estimates of the mean slopes of log -
transformed dose will be reported along with corresponding 90% CIs. If the  90% confidence 
interval for β is entirely contained within the a priori  equivalence  region, then dose 
proportionality is declared. If not, then dose non -proportionality is declared.   Dose 
proportionality will be declared if the estimate of slope lies between 0.5 - 2. Dose proportionality 
will also be assessed based on amount of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_872060].  Finally, dose normalized 
AUC 0-tauSS and C maxSS  will also be evaluated across doses. Dose proportionality will be 
confirmed if the dose normalized parameters remain substantially constant in the range of 
explored doses.

9.1. Overview of Pharmacodynamics Analyses  
The primary analysis of the primary pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performed on both the 
FAS (primary) and the PP (supportive) population. The secondary analysis of the primary 
pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performed on the FAS. The analysis of the secondary 
pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performe d on the FAS.  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough FEV [ADDRESS_1217984] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217985] -dose measurements), in comparison w ith GSP304 placebo.

    9.2. General Considerations  
All tests will be 2 -sided and at 5% level of significance unless otherwise stated.  
In addition to the analyses described below, all endpoints  will be summarized over time, by 
[CONTACT_3148] , as appropriate.  
All endpoints will also  be listed by [CONTACT_68592].  The interpretation of results from 
statistical tests will be based on the FAS. The PP  population  will be used to assess the robustness 
of the results from the statistical tests based on the FAS.  Unless otherwise stated,  ‘treatment’ 
refers to treatment group as randomized, rather than based on the actual treatment received.   
9.3. Testing Statistical Assumptions Including Comparability at Baseline  
All baseline data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070]. No formal 
hypothesis testing w ill be conducted. Differences may occur by [CONTACT_3364].  If there are any 
clinically meaningful differences identified, analyses may be adjusted to account for these 
imbalances through inclusion of additional covariates in the statistical models.  
The PD endpoin ts (FEV 1, FVC) are assumed to be normally distributed and will be analyzed 
under this assumption.  The assumptions of normality and constant variance will be verified 
using diagnostic plots (normal quantile plots and scatter plots of residuals by [CONTACT_2948]).  
If assumptions are violated , either an appropriate transformation will be used or data will be 
analyzed using non -parametric methods. The methods use will be documented in the clinical 
study report.  
9.4. Statement of the Null and Alternate Hypotheses  
 
A significance test will be made for the primary pharmacodynamics endpoint in order to assess 
for superiority of GSP304 versus GSP3 04 placebo. Demonstration of superiority for this 
treatment comparison will be based on a hypothesis testing approach, whereby [CONTACT_872100] a dif ference between the treatment groups.  
A 2-sided 5% risk associated with incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (significance level) is 
considered acceptable for this study.  
9.5. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
As this is a phase 2 study, no adjustments for multiplicity are planned. The nominal p -values of 
all hypothesis tests will not be adjusted for multiplicity.

    9.6. Analysis of the Primary Pharmacodynamics Endpoint  
9.6.1.  Primary Pharmacodynamics  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint , change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough FEV [ADDRESS_1217991] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217992] -dose measurements)  will be analyzed using a mixed -effect repeated 
measures ( MMRM ) model . This model will assume that any missing data is Missing at Random 
(MAR). The model will include trough data from all visits (Days 1, 6, 13, 20 and Day 21) ,and 
fixed terms for treatment, visit, center, baseline, treatment by [CONTACT_872101].   If an interaction  term is significant, further ad -hoc analysis may be conducted. 
Subject will be included as a random term to account for the correlation between repeated 
measurements within a subject, and unstructured covariance structure will be used.   If the model 
fails to converge, alternative structures ( VC, AR1 , TOEP1, and CS ) or removing terms will be 
investigated .  The covariance structure that provides the best fit (as determined by [CONTACT_872102]) will be used.   
The statements of a SAS® PROC MIXED analysis would be:  
PROC MIXED   data= dataset method= REML ; 
    CLASS subject treatment center visit ;  
    MODEL change  = treatment center visit baseline treatment*visit   baseline*visit  /s ddfm =kr;  
    REPEATED visit/subject=subject type=UN;  
    LSMEANS treatment*visit /at mean cl  diff e;   
RUN;  
 
The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment 
comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals , along with p -values for 
the treatment comparisons . The adjusted means and estimated treatm ent differences for the 
treatment comparisons  (each GSP304 vs placebo , total GSP304 vs placebo, and  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872062])  will also be plotted, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
9.6.2.  Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary  Pharmacodynamics  Results  
Sensitivity analyses  will be performed on the FAS only. Subjects with at least one post -baseline 
assessment  will be used  in modeling.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pattern -Mixture Model  
 
The Mixed -effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model will be fitted when some of the 
response values are missing by [CONTACT_872103] (MAR). This will be 
done computationally using Restricted Maximum -Likelihood (REML). However, this 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 48  
    assumption is unverifiable. It is necessary to perform se nsitivity analyses under different 
assumptions regarding missing data. When the MAR assumptions do not hold, the data are 
assumed to be Missing Not At Random (MNAR). One possible way forward is to model a 
separate distribution for each pattern of missingne ss. A sensitivity analysis for missing data will 
be conducted based on multiple imputation -based methods with a form of pattern -mixture model 
(PMM).  
PMMs will be fitted  based on  multiple imputations  method . In the multiple imputation approach, 
a model will be fitted to the incomplete data and  a pseudo -independent sample drawn from the 
posterior distribution of parameters. Each member of the sample leads to a separate imputed 
dataset, in which the missing values will be  replaced by [CONTACT_872104]. This distribution is based on the observed data and the covariates for 
that subject using the imputation model and the sampled parameter values. Each dataset is then 
analyzed as if these were real data, leading to a ser ies of estimates for a parameter. These are 
then combined to supply an overall estimate and standard error based on Rubin’s classic rules 
(Rubin, 1987) for combining across imputations.  
The primary endpoint will also be analyzed using a Jump to Reference ( J2R) approach , that is, 
all the patterns have the same profile up to withdrawal (that estimated in the parameter 
estimation model), but after withdrawal the profile jumps to the estimated profile for the 
reference arm. Thisapproach is a multiple imputation  technique and works  under the assumption 
that data is missing not at random (MNAR).    
The J2R approach involves three distinct steps:  
1. The missing data are filled in m times  to generate m complete data sets  (m will be 
selected to provide sufficiently stab le and reproducible results) . 
 In J2R method, all the patterns have the same profile up to withdrawal (that 
estimated in the parameter estimation model), but after withdrawal the profile 
jumps to the estimated profile for the reference arm.  A new model is simulated 
from the posterior predictive distribution of the fitted model and missing values of 
the variable are imputed based on the new model.       
 The MNAR statement together with a MONOTON statement in PROC MI will be 
used. The variables  that have missing values are imputed seq uentially in each 
imputation. If the missing pattern is arbitrary, first the MCMC method will be 
used to partially impute data in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern.  
2. The missing data are filled in m times to generate m complete data sets.  The m complete 
data sets are analyzed by [CONTACT_2329] a procedure.  
 ANCOVA analysis for change from baseline in trough FEV 1 is performed using 
PROC MIXED with LSMEANS statement.  
3. Results of the ANCOVA analysis on m imputed data sets can be combined to derive an 
overall result. PROC MIANALYZE in SAS will be used to combine the results.

    The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment 
comparisons will be presented together with 95% con fidence intervals for the differences and p -
values for th e treatment comparisons.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_324250]  (Region)  Approach  
The primary endpoint will  also be analyzed using a special application of multiple imputation of 
missing values known as the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_872063]. The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_872064]. This sensitivity analysis involves multiple imputations and is also under the MNAR 
assumption in which one search es for a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]  (region)  that reverses the study conclusion.  
This approach is iterative in nature which tests how severe departures from MAR must be in 
order to overturn conclusions from the primary analysis.  If these departures from MAR i n order 
to change the results from statistically significance (p<=0.05) to statistically insignificance 
(p>0.05) are deemed to be implausible, the results will be said to be robust to the departure from 
MAR assumption.   
The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_872065].  In the MMRM , the dependent variable is change from baseline while the covariates are 
treatment, site, baseline value and study day as the within -subject effect.  
The imputation will be done on the missing cases of change from baseline values for GSP304  
treatment  and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444] . Under the MNAR assumption, the imputed values for observations in the 
active treatment group  and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444] , as well as placebo , will be adjusted dir ectly using a shift 
parameter.  Missing values are imputed under the assumption that the distribution of the missing 
observations has a lower expected value than  that of the observed only by a shift parameter 
value. The maximum shift parameter  is set at 80 mL for being  about 50% of treatment efficacy 
when assuming that a difference in mean change from baseline at the end of treatment in trough 
FEV [ADDRESS_1217993] multiple imputation (MI) steps using SAS:  
a) The missing data are filled in m times to generate m complete data sets using PROC  MI.  
b) The m complete data sets are analyzed using PROC MIXED .  
c) The results from the m complete data sets are combined for the inference using PROC 
MIANALYZE.

Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 50  
    d) Repeat the steps (a) to generate multiple imputed data sets with a specified shift 
parameter that adjusts the imputed values for observations in the  active treatment and  
placebo group s. 
e) Repeat the step (b) for the imputed data sets with shift parameter applied.  
f) Repeat the step (c) to obtain the p -value to see if the p -value is still <=0.05.  
g) If nee ded, r epeat the  steps (d)-(f) with more stringent shift parameter applied until the p -
value >0.05.  
The iteration for each value of the shift parameter will be summarized in a table where the 
estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparisons wil l be presented together with 
95% confidence intervals for the differences and p -values for the treatment comparisons.  
9.6.3.  Exploratory Analysis     
 
If appropriate, a dose response model will be fitted to the primary endpoint to estimate the dose 
response relati onship.  Dose response models to be evaluated will include E max (3-parameter) and 
linear models.  
 
The E max model will be fitted as follows:  
 
 Endpoint = E0+ Emax Dose
Dose +ED50  +  𝜀 
 
where  E0  = Response at dose 0, E max  = Maximum effect, ED50 = Dose at which 50% of the 
maximum effect is reached and  𝜀  = Residual error.  
 
The linear model will be fitted as follows:  
Endpoint = E0+  βDose +  𝜀 
 
where E 0 = Response at Dose 0, β  = slope and   𝜀  = Residual error  
 
Should thes e models not fit the data appropriately other models may be explored. For all of the 
models, baseline will be included as a covariate at E 0. However, baseline may be fitted at ED50 
or E max  for the E max model depending on how the model fits the data best. Other covariates will 
be explored. Depending upon the adequacy of model fitting some parameters may need to be 
parameterized on the log scale (e.g. variance, ED50, E max). The most appropriate model will be 
assessed visually, by [CONTACT_872105]. To build confidence in 
the chosen model, the null model :  
Endpoint = E0  
 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -[ADDRESS_1217994] will be computed; i.e. 
the change in deviance ( -2 Log Likelihood) between the chos en model and the null model will be 
compared to a chi -squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the 
number of parameters in the two models.  
 
Dose response model parameter estimates, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals , 
from the final dose response model will be presented .   
9.7. Analysis of the Secondary Pharmacodynamics Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Change from baseline in peak FEV [ADDRESS_1217995] -dose on Day 1 and 21  
 Change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at 
approximately [ADDRESS_1217996] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217997] -dose measurements)  
 Change from baseline in time -normalized area under the curve for FEV 1 measured 
over 12 hours on Day 1 and 21  
 Time to onset of response, d efined as at least 12% and 200 mL increase  in FEV 1 
within 12 hours of dosing on Day 1  
 Time to achieving steady state  as measured by [CONTACT_10266] 1 trough assessments  
 Time to achieving steady state  as measured by [CONTACT_872106] (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at approximately [ADDRESS_1217998] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1217999] -dose m easurements)  will 
be analysed using the same model as described above for the anlaysis of the primary endpoint.  
The change from baseline for the secondary pharmacodynamics endpoint s of;  Change from 
baseline in peak FEV [ADDRESS_1218000] repeated measures (MMRM) model. This model will assume that 
any missing data is Missing at Random  (MAR). The model will include data from Day [ADDRESS_1218001], and unstructured covariance structure will be used.   If the model 
fails to converge, alternative structures (CS) or removing terms will be investigated.  The 
covariance structure that provides the best fit (as determined by [CONTACT_872107]) will be 
used.  The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the

    treatment comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals, along with p -
values for the treatment comparisons. The adjusted means and estimated treatment differences 
for the treatment comparisons  (each GSP304 vs placebo, total GSP304 vs placebo, and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872066])  will also be plotted, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
For the secondary endpoint of time to onset of response of both a 12% and 200 mL increase from 
baseline  in FEV 1, the unadjusted mean change from baseline and unadjusted percent mean 
change from baseline will be summarized for day 1.  The unadjusted means will also be plotted 
over time, for day 1. For the secondary endpoints of time to steady state in FEV 1 and FVC, the 
adjusted means from the MMRM model discussed above will be summarized by [CONTACT_4475] (Days 1, 6, 
13, 20 and 21) and also plotted over time.

    10.2. Adverse Event Preferred Term and Body/Organ System Summary 
Tables  
10.2.1.  Summaries of Adverse Event for Al l Subject s 
 
For each AE, the following information is to be recorded; the start date, the stop dat e (or whether 
the AE is ongoing at study completion/discontinuation), the severity and the investigator 
relationship of the AE to study drug, the therapy for the AE, the action taken with study drug, 
and whether or not the AE is considered serious.  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) Version 18.0 or later.  
Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs (identified by [CONTACT_6214]) that begins or that 
worsens in severity after at least one dose of study treatment has been administered, and last upto 
the AE stop date or the follow -up visit or the last study participation day.   The n umber and 
percentage of subjects  reporting at least one occurrence of a TEAE for each unique System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term will be tabulated by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_872110]. For multiple occurrence of the same TEAE with the different severity, 
the TEAE with the highest severity will be tabulated. For multiple occurrences of the same 
TEAE with different relationship to study drug (related and n ot related), the TEAE will be 
tabulated as related. All TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment will also be tab ulated. All 
AEs for all subjects  will b e presented in a data listing.  
Pre-Treatment AEs  (PTAEs) are defined as AEs (identified by [CONTACT_6214]) tha t begin or that worsen in 
severity between  study Day -[ADDRESS_1218002] up to the AE stop date.     
 
The severity o f AE is classified as follows:  
Mild  The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject.  
The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention  
Moderate  The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic intervention.  
The AE produces no sequelae.  
Severe  The AE results in a mark ed impairment of function and may lead to temporary inability to 
resume usual life pattern.  
  The AE produces sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention.  
 
The relationship of AEs to study medication is classified as follows:  
 Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility

     Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility  
A COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening of the  following [ADDRESS_1218003] 2 consecutive days: dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence or a worsening of any 
[ADDRESS_1218004] 
2 consecutive days: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever without 
other cause, and cough. A COPD exacerbation shall be reported as an AE and may be considered 
serious if it meets the seriousness criteria for SAE reporting.  
All serious AEs that occur after administration of the first dose of study drug will be listed by 
[CONTACT_1196], Preferred Term, and relationship to study drug  as assessed by [CONTACT_1275] . In addition to three treatment levels, a GSP 304 total wil l be presented in AE/SAE -
related summary tables.

Refers to section 6.8.3   
10.2.3.  Summaries of Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Adverse Event Dropouts, and 
Death  
For SAEs that are considered to be related to study drug, the number and p ercentage of subjects  
reporting at least one occurrence of an SAE for each unique System Organ Class will be 
tabulated. SAEs that lead to  study discontinuation  will be tabulated by [CONTACT_872111], Preferred Term and relationship to study drug. A ll SAEs resulting  in death will also be 
tabulated.  
All SAEs will be p resented for individual subjects  in data listings , as well as premature 
discontinuations due to all causality. Deaths of all causes, study -drug related (occurring during 
study participation and up to [ADDRESS_1218005] -treatment) or not, will be presented in a separate 
listing . 
10.3. Concomitant and Other Medications  
Concomitant medication  will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) Version 18.[ADDRESS_1218006].

and urinalysis), will be summarized for  Visit 4 to Vi sit 7 (the Final Visit).   Descriptive statistics 
(number of   subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be presented for 
laboratory data as well as change from baseline by [CONTACT_10659].  In addition, values outside 
the respective normal r ange and values deemed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_872112].  
The number of subjects with values of potential clinical significance determined by [CONTACT_872113].  
Shift tables will pre sent changes from baseline in laboratory data (categorized as normal; 
abnormal, not clinically significant; and abnormal, clinically significant) to end of treatment.  
All laboratory data will be listed by [CONTACT_68592].  
Estimated Glomerular filtrat ion rate (eGFR) will be estimated using the Cock croft -Gault 
approach.   
10.5. Vital Signs  
The subject’s baseline and post-baseline vital signs will be recorded (pulse rates, sitting  or lying 
down  systolic and diastolic blood pressure) at Visits 3 to Visit 7 .  Height and weight will also be 
recorded  at Screening Visit (Day -28 to  Day -15). Descriptive statistics  (number of subjects, 
mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum)  will be used to summarize vital sign results and 
changes from baseline by [CONTACT_22058] t group and visit.  
Values outside the respective normal range and values deemed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_872114].  
The number of subjects with values of potential clinical significance determined by [CONTACT_872113].  
All vital sign data will be l isted by [CONTACT_68592].  
10.6. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Baseline and post-baseline electrocardiograms (12 -lead ECG) will be performed at Visit 3 and 
Visit 6.  The parameters to be report ed are Heart Rat e, PR Int erval,  QRS duration, QT interval , 
and QTc interval  (QTcF  and QTcB ).   
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters and changes from baseline will be presented by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Shift tables will present changes from baseline to end of treatment in ECG 
interpretation (categorized as normal; abnormal, not clinically significant; and abnormal, 
clinically significant).  
Glenmark Specialty SA

examination results by [CONTACT_6764], treatment group and visit. In addition, the number of 
subjec ts with values of potential clinical significance determined by [CONTACT_872115].  
All physical examination  data will be listed by [CONTACT_68592].  
10.8. Study Termination Status  
 
If the Investigator  or the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor becomes awa re of conditions or events that 
suggest a possible hazard to subjects if the study continues, the study  may be terminated after 
appropriate consultat ion between the relevant parties. The study may also be terminate d early at 
the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding.  
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
 The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects  
enrolled in the study;  
 Failure to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate;  
 A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or  discontinue development of the 
drug product.     
10.9. Changes fro m Protocol  
 
The following changes from the protocol were made in the SAP.  
 
1) The definition of the primary endpoint was clarified  from change from baseline in trough 
forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1) at [ADDRESS_1218009] dose of treatmen t on 
Day 21 in comparision with placebo to  change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in 
trough FEV [ADDRESS_1218010] dose (average of [ADDRESS_1218011] -dose measurements . 
 
2) The languag e used for definition of the secondary endpoint of change from baseline in trough 
FVC, and the associated analyses related to this endpoint, was modified to align it with the 
language that has been used for the primary endpoint.  
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 58  
     
3) The following secondary  endpoints were added;  
 Time to onset of response, defined as at least 12% and 200 mL increase  in FEV 1 
within 12 hours of dosing on Day 1  
 Time to achieving steady state as measured by [CONTACT_10266] 1 trough assessments  
 Time to achieving steady state as measured by [CONTACT_872116]  
 
4) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872067]: will use the first effort (Test 1) regardless of whether this is an 
acceptable effort or not.   Instead of “start time of first spi[INVESTIGATOR_177549]” (per protocol), we are 
using the end time of the first s pi[INVESTIGATOR_177549].

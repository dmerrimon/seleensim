section 3.6.[ADDRESS_1097550] is approximately 64 weeks.Statistical methods
The primary efficacy variable is the annual COPD exacerbation rate and the two key 
secondary endpoints are change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator FEV
1at Week 
[ADDRESS_1097551]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) at Week 56. The exacerbation rate in each of the three benralizumab dose groups will be compared to 
the exacerbation rate in the placebo group using a negative binomial model including 
covariates of treatment group, eosinophil cohort (220-299/ OL or K300/OL), country, 
background therapy (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA, or ICS/LABA/LAMA), and the number of 
exacerbations in the year before the study. The logarithm of the follow-up time will be used as 
an offset variable in the model. Change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator FEV
1at 
Week 56 will be compared between each of the three benralizumab dose groups and placebo 
using a repeated measures analysis. Treatment group will be fitted as the explanatory variable. 
Eosinophil cohort (220-299/ OL or K300/OL), country, background therapy (ICS/LABA, 
LABA/LAMA, or ICS/LABA/LAMA), and baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV 1will be fitted as 
covariates. Visit will be fitted as a categorical variable. 
Change from baseline in St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) total score at Week 
56 will be analyzed using a similar model as the model for change from baseline in pre-
dose/pre-bronchodilator FEV 1. 
The primary endpoint and the two key secondary endpoints will be analyzed primarily using 
the subjects with baseline blood eosinophil counts K220/OL in the full analysis set. The full 
analysis set includes all randomised subjects who received any dose of investigational 
product. In addition, the exacerbation rate and the two key secondary endpoints will also be summarized in subjects with baseline blood eosinophil counts <220/ OL, <150/OL, 150-
219/OL, 220-299/ OL, 300-449/ OL, and K450/OL separately for descriptive purpose only. 
Multiplicity will be adjusted for the primary endpoint and the two key secondary endpoints on 
the analysis of subjects with baseline blood eosinophils K220/OL for the comparisons of 30mg 
vs. placebo and 100mg vs. placebo according to a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502] (see section 8.5). 
Multiplicity will also be adjusted for the primary endpoint and the two key secondary endpoints on the analysis of subjects with baseline blood eosinophils K220/OL for the 
comparisons of 10mg vs. placebo according to a serial gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502] (see section 
8.5).
The study will recruit subjects with blood eosinophil counts K220/OL and <220/ OL at a ratio 
of approximately 2:1 and the study is powered for the primary efficacy analysis of the subjects 
with blood eosinophils K220/OL. For the primary endpoint annual COPD exacerbation rate, 
348 subjects with baseline blood eosinophil counts K220/OL per treatment arm (1392 total) 
will need to be randomised to achieve 90% power of detecting a 30% reduction in both the

8 (111)30mg and 100mg benralizumab dose groups versus placebo after multiplicity adjustment. This 
calculation has assumed two-sided 4% alpha level test, an annual placebo rate of 0.93 
events/subject (1.0 events/subject/56 weeks), a negative binomial shape parameter of 0.4, and a dropout rate of 10%. The sample size calculation is based on simulations and has accounted 
for the power loss from a proposed futility analysis. According to the approximately 2:1 ratio, 
the study will also enrol 174 subjects/arm (696 total) with baseline blood eosinophil counts <220/OL. An additional 20 subjects/arm will also be recruited to the 220-299/ OL cohort to 
better characterize patients within this cohort. This addition results in 368 subjects/arm in the 
K220/OL cohort (1472 total). A total of 2168 subjects are expected to be randomised in the 
study. Details of the estimated numbers of recruited subjects/arm in each cohort (<220/ OL, 
220-299/OL, K300/OL) are described in the SAP.
An unblinded futility analysis based on the primary endpoint will be conducted in this study. 
The futility analysis will be carried out using pre-defined rules by [CONTACT_795744]. 
Furthermore, an internal blinded estimate of the overall exacerbation rate and shape parameter will be conducted before the last subject with eosinophil counts K220/OL is randomised. The 
review may result in an adjustment to the sample size.
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively. Safety analyses will be based on the 
safety analysis set, defined as all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1097552].

18 (111)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence 
and is projected to be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2020 (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD 2013 )).
Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are responsible for a large portion of the economic 
burden of COPD. An AECOPD is defined as a sustained worsening of the patient’s condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and 
necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD ( Rodriquez-
Roisin R 2000 ). In addition to a substantial economic burden, AECOPD is also responsible for 
much of the morbidity and mortality from COPD. Patients with frequent AECOPD show 
associated increased inflammation and accelerated decline in lung function as compared to 
patients with infrequent exacerbations ( Donaldson et al 2002 ).
While airway inflammation in COPD has been traditionally described as being predominately
neutrophilic, elevated blood and sputum eosinophils have been reported in a subset of COPD 
patients ( Saha and Brightling 2006 ; Bafadhel et al 2011 ). Approximately 30-40% of patients 
with COPD have elevated levels of eosinophils in the airway as measured by [CONTACT_795745] (BAL; Brightling et al 2000 ; Brightling et al 2005 ;
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_310332] 1998 ; Leigh et al 2006 ; Saha and Brightling 2006 ). The prevalence of elevated 
blood eosinophils in COPD has been less well characterized; however, blood eosinophils have 
been reported to be an accurate predictor of >3% sputum eosinophils in COPD ( Bafadhel et al 
2011 ).
In some patients with COPD, the response to oral and inhaled corticosteroids may be related 
to the degree of airway eosinophilic inflammation ( Brightling et al 2000 ; Brightling et al 
2005 ). In several studies, a sputum eosinophilia K3% has been demonstrated to be a good 
predictor of response to steroids in COPD ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_310332] 1998 ; Leigh et al 2006 ; Siva et al 
2007 ). Befadhel et al ( Bafadhel et al 2009 ) showed that a management strategy that aims to 
minimize eosinophilic airway inflammation and symptoms is associated with a significant reduction in the frequency of COPD exacerbations requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Evidence 
also indicates that COPD patients with increased sputum eosinophil counts had significant 
improvements in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV
1) and quality of life-scores that 
were associated with decreased sputum eosinophil counts, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), 
and IL-5 levels ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_310332] 1998 ;Bafadhel et al 2009 ). There are some reports indicating 
that steroids were not able to reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation in COPD ( Brightling et 
al 2005 ). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that patients with elevated eosinophils in 
blood may have an inappropriate response to systemic steroids with worsening in several 
biomarkers ( Bafadhel et al 2011 )

19 (111)These data suggest that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795688], particularly inhaled steroids. Treatment options are limited in severe exacerbations of 
COPD and by [CONTACT_795746]; benralizumab may be an 
alternative treatment option for this high unmet need in COPD associated with elevated blood and/or sputum eosinophils.
Interleukin-[ADDRESS_1097559] cells, and 
eosinophils and is involved in regulating the differentiation, proliferation, and activation of eosinophils via the human IL-5 receptor (IL-5R; Kouro and Takatsu 2009 ). The human IL-5R 
is a heterodimer consisting of an V-chain and a N-chain. Monomeric IL-5R V is a low affinity 
receptor, while dimerization of IL-5R V with the N-chain produces a high affinity receptor 
(Tavernier et al 1991 ). In the absence of IL-5 interaction with the V-chain, binding to the N 
chain alone by [CONTACT_795747] ( Takatsu 1995 ). Expression of the IL-5R V chain is 
restricted largely to eosinophils, basophils, and some mast cells in humans ( Toba et al 1999 ; 
Dahl et al 2004 ). The V-chain exclusively binds IL-5 and the intracellular portion of IL-5R V is 
associated with Janus kinase 2, a protein tyrosine-kinase essential in IL-5 signal transduction 
(Ogata et al 1998 ; Takaki et al 1994 ). Interleukin-5 is the key growth/survival factor for 
eosinophils; therefore, suppression of eosinophils by [CONTACT_795748]-5R V should have a 
beneficial effect in COPD.
Benralizumab (MEDI-563) is a humanized, afucosylated, monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically to the human IL-5 receptor alpha subunit (IL-5R V) on the target cell. 
Benralizumab is being developed for the treatment of both chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and persistent (i.e., nonseasonal) asthma associated with elevated eosinophils. The IND for benralizumab was originally submitted by [CONTACT_795749], Inc, a member of the Kyowa 
Hakko Kirin (KHK) Group, on 29 Jun2006. MedImmune accepted transfer of IND 100237 on 
07Mar2007 and assumed responsibility for the clinical development program outside of specific Asian countries. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) is also being developed by [CONTACT_795750] “KHK4563” in parallel with our development program for the 
asthma indication.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
The final results of study MI-CP196 support conducting this Phase 3 study in patients with COPD with severe and very severe disease, treated with double (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA) 
and triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), who have elevated peripheral eosinophils. The 
greatest improvements in the annual exacerbation rate were observed in patients withincreasing blood eosinophils (specifically K200 and K300/OL) based on a pre-specified 
subgroup analysis (predose FEV
1and health-related quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_312495]-C). 
In patients with low eosinophil counts (<300/ QL), the exacerbation signal was not 
commensurate with what was observed in the high eosinophil group, and the exacerbation rate 
was not favourable for benralizumab, although the changes in FEV 1and SGRQ-C were 
directionally similar to the high eosinophil group.

20 (111)The clinical development program for benralizumab is designed to evaluate benralizumab’s 
ability to reduce the COPD exacerbation rate in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.
The proposed Phase [ADDRESS_1097560]-bronchodilator FEV 1>20% and T65% of predicted normal ( GOLD 2013 ).
It was not considered appropriate to include patients with mild to moderate disease without 
exacerbations, or those being treated with single therapy. This is similar to the population explored in recent trials such as SPARK ( Wedzicha et al 2013 ), which essentially evaluated 
the effect of triple versus double therapy in a severe to very severe patient population. Patients 
on monotherapy have several therapeutic options available before a biologic becomes part of their therapeutic options.
The proposed benralizumab Phase [ADDRESS_1097561] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (double such as ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA or triple such as ICS/LABA/LAMA) as evidenced by 2 or more 
moderate exacerbations or 1 or more severe exacerbation(s) in the previous year. Moderate 
exacerbations are defined as those requiring treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations are defined as those requiring a COPD related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795689]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795690] K24 hours in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], in an observation area, the emergency department or 
other equivalent healthcare facility depending on the country and healthcare system .
Subjects in this Phase 3 study will be stratified by [CONTACT_795751] 
(K300/QL or <300/ QL) with a blood eosinophils boundary of K220/QL used for the primary 
and secondary efficacy analyses. Randomization will be capped at the study level for the 
baseline eosinophil cohorts (<220/ OL, 220-299/ OL, K300/OL) in order to keep predefined 
cohort sample size and approximately 2:1 ratio of subjects above and below the boundary of 220/QL.
Based on the efficacy observed in CP196 and recent data in the literature ( Pascoe S et al 
2015 ), the primary endpoint will be powered and conducted in subjects with blood eosinophil 
count K220/OL. Subjects with lower blood eosinophils levels (<220/ QL) will be included to 
assess the benefit:risk relationship of benralizumab in COPD patients with a broad range of 
blood eosinophil levels. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess efficacy in COPD subjects across a broad spectrum of eosinophil levels as detailed in the SAP in order to better identify 
patients who are likely to benefit from benralizumab and also to evaluate inflection points for 
efficacy and safety to better define which patients need to be treated with this compound.
Three dose levels 10, 30 and 100 mg Q8W benralizumab will be evaluated in this Phase 3 
study in COPD subjects, based on PK and eosinophil modelling, observed incidence of ADA, 
clinical efficacy, and safety. 
Since only one dose level was investigated in Study MI-CP196, the dose-efficacy relationship 
of benralizumab in COPD has not been fully evaluated. Simulations indicate that the Q12W 
regimen is associated with a broader distribution of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. This 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (MEDI-563)
Study Code D3251C00004Edition Number 4.0
Date 06 July 2015
21 (111)implies inadequate depletion of eosinophils in many COPD patients following Q12W 
treatment. Considering that a potentially higher ADA incidence may be associated with 
infrequent dosing, low and variable PK level, and likely loss of treatment effect in a small subset of ADA-positive subjects, there is no rationale to pursue the Q12W regimen for Phase 
3 in COPD. On the other hand, given the low ADA incidence in COPD subjects, in terms of 
peripheral blood eosinophil depletion, the Q4W dosing does not appear to convey much apparent improvement over the Q8W regimen.
While a 2 mg dose is expected to reduce the blood eosinophil count by [CONTACT_2016], it is likely 
associated with a higher risk of immunogenicity response and inadequate eosinophil depletion in tissues. In asthma subjects (Study MI-CP220), no apparent therapeutic efficacy on 
exacerbation reduction was observed at this dose level. Doses T10 mg are likely suboptimal in 
terms of tissue eosinophil depletion and therapeutic effect (drug level in lung will be much lower than in blood).
For the asthma program, a dose regimen of 30 mg Q8W (ED90 of AER, ACQ, and FEV
1) was 
selected for Phase [ADDRESS_1097562] of PK variability (body weight, ADA, 
delayed visits) on therapeutic effect of benralizumab. This was supported through eosinophil 
and efficacy modelling and simulations. Since the PK of benralizumab and eosinophil response were similar in asthma and COPD subjects, the [ADDRESS_1097563] and injection device development, as the same dose will be used for both the asthma and COPD indications. The 100 mg Q8W top dose investigated in Studies 
MI-CP196 and MI-CP220, and a NOAEL Q2W dose of 30 mg/kg in nonhuman primates 
provided wide safety margin coverage.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
COPD is a progressive disease which is characterized by [CONTACT_795752] ( GOLD 2013 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_795691], many patients continue to have COPD exacerbations ( Wedzicha et al 2013 ).  
Benralizumab is aimed at decreasing the number of exacerbations in patients with moderate tovery severe COPD who continue to have exacerbations while on standard double or triple 
therapy.
In a previous study patients who had an eosinophil count K300 appeared to have the greatest 
benefit from the drug and remained the main target of the study. The exacerbation rate 
reduction was not evident in the <300 eosinophil group although the sample size was small.  
In order to better identify the eosinophil threshold for predicted response to Benralizumab, and based on recent data in the literature ( Pascoe S et al 2015 ) to support a boundary of 220/
OL for the primary analysis, additional patients will be recruited to a K220/OL in addition to 
the K300/OL blood eosinophil cohort in this study. This will result in including patients above 
and below the 220 eosinophil cutoff in an approximately 2:1 ratio, allowing for exploration of
the benefit risk profile in the broader population.

Theoretical risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_795692] (e.g. anaphylaxis or immune complex disease).
Eosinophils are a prominent feature of the inflammatory response to helminthic parasitic 
infections, and the presence of infiltrating eosinophils has been circumstantially associated 
with a positive prognosis in certain solid tumors. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged eosinophil depletion may diminish the ability to defend against helminthic 
parasites, or negatively impact the natural history of certain malignant tumors. Risk 
minimization measures include exclusion of patients with untreated parasitic infection and active or recent malignancy, in conjunction with the performance of routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
The efficacy and safety data obtained to date support the continued clinical development of 
benralizumab in COPD.
A detailed assessment of the overall risk/benefit of benralizumab in patients with asthma and 
COPD is given in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Overall Study Design
This is a randomised, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of benralizumab (MEDI-563), 
10mg, 30mg and 100mg dose administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection every [ADDRESS_1097564] maintenance therapy (inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 
N2 agonist (ICS/LABA), long-acting N2 agonist /long acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LABA/LAMA) or ICS/LABA/LAMA) with a history of COPD exacerbation(s) in the year 
prior to enrolment (Visit 1).
The study will recruit approximately 2168 subjects randomised 1:1:1:1 to the treatment arms, 
stratified by [CONTACT_568979] ( K300/OL and <300/ OL strata).The subject 
recruitment will be capped at the study level for the cohorts with baseline eosinophil counts 
<220/OL, 220-299/ OL, and K300/OL in order to keep predefined cohort sample size and 
approximately 2:1 ratio of subjects above and below the boundary of 220/ QL. Details of the 
estimated numbers of recruited subjects/arm in each cohort (<220/ OL, 220-299/ OL, K300/OL) 
are described in the SAP.
The investigational product (IP) will be administered at the study centre every [ADDRESS_1097565] treatment evaluation will be performed at week 56.
After the initial enrolment period and confirmation of the entry criteria, subjects will proceed 
to the screening/run-in period for 3 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility 
criteria to be evaluated. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomised to a 56-

3.[ADDRESS_1097575] Enrollment and Randomisation
Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled or randomised subjects are described in 
section 3.4.
Investigator(s) should keep a record of subjects considered for and included in the study on 
the subject screening log.
The Investigator will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential subject before any study specific 
procedures are performed.
2. Assign each potential subject a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‘E# via 
interactive web/voice response system (IWRS/IVRS)
3. Determine subject eligibility.
4. Assign eligible subject unique randomisation code via IWRS/IVRSSubjects will be allocated to the four treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The randomisation 
numbers will be grouped in blocks. The study will recruit approximately 2168 subjects, 
randomised 1:1:1:1 to the treatment arms, stratified by [CONTACT_568979] (K300/OL and <300/ OL strata). Subject recruitment will be capped at the study level for the 
cohorts with baseline eosinophil counts <220/ OL, 220-299/ OL, and K300/OL in order to keep 
predefined cohort sample size and approximately 2:1 ratio of subjects above and below the boundary of 220/ QL. Details of the estimated numbers of recruited subjects/arm in each cohort 
(<220/OL, 220-299/ OL, K300/OL) are described in the SAP. It is expected that the <220/ OL 
cohort will fill first based on prevalence. Instructions for screen failing these subjects from the study after a stratum is closed are noted in the protocol (Section 3.7.2 ).
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in a separate 
manual. If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.

3.5.1 Concomitant medication
Information about any treatment in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 (and 1 year prior to Visit 1 for 
background (maintenance) COPD medications) and all the concomitant treatments given 
during the study, with reason for the treatment, will be collected by [CONTACT_737]/authorized 
delegate at each visit (as shown in Table 2 andTable 3 ) and recorded in the eCRF.
The subject’s usual pre-study double (ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA) or triple 
(ICS/LABA/LAMA) therapy formulation, dose and regimen, and any other additional allowed 
COPD medications that may have been taken prior to enrolment, should be continued throughout the enrolment, screening/run-in and treatment period as outlined below.
Background (maintenance) medication 
All subjects are required to be treated with maintenance double (ICS/LABA or 
LABA/LAMA) or triple (ICS/LABA/LAMA) therapy for COPD throughout the year prior to enrolment (Visit 1) and have to be consistently treated with locally approved COPD 
medications on approved doses for at least 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 and during the course of 
the study (see inclusion criteria 6).
The aim of this study is to establish the treatment effect of benralizumab as add-on therapy. 
Therefore the background medications should be maintained at the same dose and schedule 
from Visit [ADDRESS_1097577]’s 
maintenance therapy are discouraged during the treatment period, unless judged medically necessary by [CONTACT_737]; such changes should be discussed with the [COMPANY_008] Study 
Physician, the justification for treatment changes should be documented in the source notes 
along with the rationale for the change and recorded in the eCRF.

be provided by [CONTACT_795755], in order to maintain 
appropriate oversight and access to these concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795701] 60 unless the patient withdraws informed consent.
Rescue medication 
SABA (short-acting N2-agonists, e.g. salbutamol, albuterol, terbutaline) will be used as rescue 
medication during the study in the event of a worsening of COPD symptoms. In the rare cases where a subject has an adverse or allergic reaction to salbutamol/albuterol, levalbuterol can be 
used. The rescue medication is not regarded as an investigational product, but will be provided 
by [CONTACT_795755], in order to ensure access for this therapy from enrolment and up to Week [ADDRESS_1097578] suggested that treatment with systemic steroids for shorter periods of time results in 
similar outcomes with less systemic steroid exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that 
subjects are treated with a 5 day course of steroids ( Leuppi [CONTACT_2297] 2013 ) and no longer than 14 
days (see section 3.5.2 and Table 1 ).

Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment should return to the study centre and 
complete the procedures described for the EOT 12 weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of IP. 
It is highly recommended that all study procedures, including any scheduled visits and ePRO 
completion, are continued till EOT visit, if possible. The subject will bring the ePRO device to 
the EOT visit. 
At EOT visit the subject will be given two options on how to be followed up: 
! The subject should be encouraged to return for all regular clinic and phone call 
visits until he/she completes a total of 56 weeks in the study. At week 56 all the 
procedures described for Visit 19 are to be conducted 
! If the subject cannot comply or does not wish to comply with the option above,

continuing eDiary completion, until the subject completes [ADDRESS_1097592]’s decision needs to be 
documented and the specific section in the ICF addendum needs to be signed. 
The key elements to be collected are AEs/SAEs, changes in concomitant medications, 
smoking status and COPD exacerbation information.
The Investigator will be instructed to force data transfer from the ePRO device on the day of 
EOT visit and then to redispense the device to subject. ePRO alerts will still be in place to notify both the subject and the study center of a potential symptom worsening event (see 
section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The subject will be asked to return the ePRO device to the study centre after 
the subject completes participation in the study (week 56).
! If the subject refuses the two previous options, he/she will need to sign the specific 
withdrawal of consent portion of the ICF addendum and return all study materials to 
the study centre.
[COMPANY_008] will continue to provide maintenance and rescue medications up to 56 weeks

3.9 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], trial subjects are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:
! meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] 
! are assessed as causally related to study drug, 
! are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented.
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests.

53 (111)4.1 Enrolment and screening/run-in period
4.1.1 Enrolment (from Visit 1 to Visit 2)
Each potential subject will provide written informed consent prior to any study specific 
procedures and undergo assessments applicable for the visit (see Table 2 ).
In cases where subject signs the informed consent form (ICF) prior to Visit 1, Visit [ADDRESS_1097605]’s enrolment via IWRS/IVRS should occur on the day of Visit 1.
The Visit [ADDRESS_1097606] whether the patient meets criteria for chronic bronchitis (chronic cough and mucus production for at least three months in two successive 
years) and if the patient has historical or current radiographic evidence (chest radiograph or 
CT scan) of emphysema.
A historical value of blood eosinophils (highest absolute value of eosinophils in the year prior 
to V1) is an important part of medical history and needs to be recorded in the pertinent CRF 
module (if available).
A record of a physician-diagnosed COPD, ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA/LAMA 
use (Section 3.1, criteria 3and 6) and COPD exacerbation(s) in the previous year (Section 3.1, 
criterion 4) is suggested source documentation.  A subject’s verbal history suggestive of 
COPD symptoms and/or prior COPD exacerbation(s), but without supporting documentation, 
is not sufficient to satisfy these inclusion criteria.
Examples of acceptable documentation of the COPD disease state and prior COPD 
exacerbation(s) include clinic visit (primary or specialist HCP), emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795710] a current problem, plus documentation of at least two moderate or 
one severe exacerbation during the 12 months prior to Visit 1. A qualifying historical COPD exacerbation is:
Use of systemic corticosteroids(a single depot injectable dose of corticosteroids 
is acceptable), and/or
Use of antibiotics, and/or
An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795711], regular use of ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA/LAMA for at least 2 weeks 
prior to enrolment should be documented in the source notes. This documentation may be in

54 (111)the form of a recent, active medication list as per a HCP note, or filled prescriptions based on 
a pharmacy record. 
Following the registration of a subject at the enrolment visit, the screening procedures will be 
initiated to assess the study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria (see Table 2 ). At Visit [ADDRESS_1097607] of care as 
determined by [CONTACT_13144].
Duration of enrolment period (from Visit 1 to Visit 2) is up to 7 days. Visit 1 and Visit 2 can 
occur on the same day if there are no restrictions to medications for spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (and no washout period is needed). Visit [ADDRESS_1097608] as soon as the medication restrictions prior 
to spi[INVESTIGATOR_795682] (see section 5.1.2 ) and should occur no later than one week after Visit 1.
Visit [ADDRESS_1097609] is dispensed with an ePRO device (eDiary) (see section 5.1.3 ).
Enrolment procedures when any of the eosinophil cohorts is closed 
As soon as any of the eosinophil cohorts is closed, it is recommended to split enrolment 
procedures between Visit1 and Visit 2 (as described in  Table 2)  and to allow sufficient time 
between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (up to 7 days) to obtain central eosinophil blood count results. The 
subjects in the completed cohort will be withdrawn from the study (screen failure), no further 
study related procedures are required for those subjects (see section 3.7.2 ).
4.1.2 Screening/Run-in (from Visits 2 to Visit 3)
The run-in period should be 3 weeks (±3 days) in duration (from Visit 2 to Visit 4). Visit 3 
should occur 2 weeks (±3 days) after Visit 2. The subjects should remain on their current 
COPD treatment with no changes throughout screening/run-in period. Assessments applicable for the period are listed in Table 2 .
If there is a need to postpone Randomisation visit, run-in period can be extended by [CONTACT_20904] 7 
days after consultation and in agreement with Study Physician.
Visit 3 (week -1): Safety assessments and other procedures will be performed at this visit as 
listed in Table [ADDRESS_1097610]’s eligibility should be evaluated at each visit during the screening/run-in period 
with the relevant documentation entered in the source and eCRF.

55 (111)4.1.3 Rescreening
Subjects who experience a COPD exacerbation within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the 
enrolment and screening/run-in period should be screen failed. They may be re-screened no 
sooner than [ADDRESS_1097611] dose of systemic steroids.
Subjects with respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], excluding pneumonia, within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 or 
during the enrolment and screening/run-in period, should also be screen failed and may be re-
screened but no sooner than [ADDRESS_1097612] dose of antibiotics.
The subjects who experience pneumonia during the enrolment and screening/run-in period 
should be screen failed. They may be re-screened but no sooner than [ADDRESS_1097613] been screen failed due to 
eosinophil stratum/ cohort closure; those instances need to be discussed with the AZ Study 
Physician.  
If a subject is re-screened, a new informed consent form is to be signed, and re-screening Visit 
[ADDRESS_1097614] keeps an originally assigned enrolment number.
4.2 Randomised treatment period
4.2.1 Randomisation and treatment period
The inclusion/exclusion criteria at the randomisation visit (Visit 4) will be confirmed. Before 
randomisation the subject’s compliance with his/her maintenance medications and ePRO 
completion must be confirmed.
Subjects confirmed to be eligible will be randomised at Visit 4 in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1097615]’s randomisation via the 
IWRS/IVRS.
Following randomisation, the subject will enter the 56-week double-blind treatment period 
with the last dose of benralizumab/placebo administered at Visit 17 (week 48).
Subjects will have scheduled clinic visits at 4-week intervals up to Visit 7 and then at 8 week 
intervals up to Visit 19 to complete protocol-specific assessments and IP administration, as

restrictions noted in section 3.5will continue to apply throughout the treatment period. In case 
of a COPD worsening/exacerbation (see section 5.1.1 ), subjects should be evaluated at the 
study centre, when feasible, at an unscheduled visit, or a scheduled visit if the worsening 
happens to fall within a scheduled visit window.
Subjects will continue to record their COPD symptoms and responses to the questionnaires 
using the ePRO device throughout the 56-week treatment period (see section 5.1.3 for details).
At week 56 subjects will come to the centre for the End of Treatment (EOT) visit.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from IP (see section 3.6) should return to the study 
centre and complete procedures described for the EOT visit 12 weeks (±7 days) after the last 
dose of IP.
Subjects will return the ePRO device and all background/rescue medications at the EOT visit.Subjects will return the ePRO device  at week 56.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from IP should follow the procedures and visit 
schedule described in section 3.6.
Completion, or early termination of the treatment will be registered via IWRS/IVRS for each 
subject.
4.3 Follow-up period
Subjects who complete Visit 19 (week 56) will return at week [ADDRESS_1097616] Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the electronic Case 
Report Forms as (eCRF) specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the 
instructions provided.
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The 
investigator will sign the completed electronic Case Report Forms. A copy of the completed electronic Case Report Forms will be archived at the study centre.

the following:
Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days; a single depot injectable 
dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course of 
systemic corticosteroids and/or
Use of antibiotics
An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244826] (defined as an inpatient admission 
K24 hours in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], in an observation area, the emergency department or 
other equivalent healthcare facility depending on the country and healthcare 
system). 
Exacerbations will be considered moderate if they require treatment with 
systemic steroids and/or antibiotics, and do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198619]. Exacerbations will be considered severe if they result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739669].
Symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_795757] (eDiary) for 
the purposes of a symptom worsening alert. The purpose of this alert is to notify both the 
subject and the study center of a potential symptom worsening event that warrants contact 
[CONTACT_795758].
Each morning the subject will complete 3 questions pertaining to the major symptoms of a 
worsening event (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum color). Subject reported worsening of 
1 or more of these symptoms will trigger assessment of the minor symptoms of a worsening event (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, cough, and wheeze). All questions will 
have a [ADDRESS_1097618] 3 response options (e.g. How breathless have you been in the last 24 hours? Less breathlessness than usual, Usual level of breathlessness, More breathless than usual) 
whereas questions related to the presence or absence of a symptom will have a dichotomous 
response (e.g. Have you had a sore throat in the last 24 hours? No, Yes, I had a sore throat).
If athere is worsening of at least [ADDRESS_1097619] and site will be generated by [CONTACT_795759].
If an event is not associated with ePRO symptom worsening alert as described above (e.g. 
technical issue, subject self-reports symptom worsening/exacerbation event, the exacerbation 
is identified during a visit or phone contact, the exacerbation is evaluated and treated at non-
study centre, or an acute/severe symptom deterioration which is not captured in the ePRO
system occurs), the Investigator should interview the subject and evaluate potential worsening 
and duration of the following symptoms: 
Shortness of breath

Mucus purulence
Cough
Wheezing
Sore throat 
Cold symptoms such as a runny nose or nasal congestion
Fever
Chest Tightness
Other findings
The Investigator should record all pertinent findings  (symptom worsening) associated with 
the exacerbation event and their duration in source documents and in the eCRF exacerbation module.
If an exacerbation is not associated with worsening of COPD symptoms or it was not possible 
to capture the symptoms (e.g. patient intubated upon arrival to the emergency department), the investigator must document the justification for diagnosing and treating the event as an 
exacerbation and record it in the eCRF.
The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids or antibiotic 
treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], whichever occurs earlier, and the end date is defined as the 
last day of systemic corticosteroids or antibiotic treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever 
occurs later.
For the list of allowed medications to treat a COPD exacerbation please refer to section 3.5.[ADDRESS_1097620] dose of systemic steroids (oral, IM, IV) 
or antibiotics or the last day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795712].
The subject may remain in the study after an exacerbation and continue to receive 
investigational product if the Investigator judges that it is medically appropriate for the subject 
to do so.
Study centre evaluations for a COPD worsening may occur as a part of an ordinary centre 
visit, or as an unscheduled visit, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_10670]. A copy of the medical 
record should be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at non-study centres (e.g. by

5.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete PRO assessments at the study center on paper and at home using a 
handheld electronic device (ePRO). PRO assessments must be collected in a systematic way 
to ensure data integrity. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when 
collecting PRO data at the site or via an ePRO device:
For PRO instruments administered during site visits
! Administer before other procedures
Always administer PRO instruments before other study procedures
! Provide the right environment
Provide a quiet and private location to complete the instrument
! No right or wrong answers
Remind subjects that there are no right or wrong answers and that we are 
asking them to complete these questionnaires because we’re interested in hearing directly from them on how they feel.
! Help with procedural questions
Make sure the subject understands how to complete the instrument. Instrument 
instructions are usually self-explanatory but staff may answer questions about 
procedural issues like what it means to “tick a box”. 
! Avoid bias: do not clarify the meaning of questions or responses
Sometimes subjects will ask center staff to clarify the meaning of a question or 
response. To avoid introducing any bias, politely tell the subject that you 
cannot clarify items. Remind them that there are no right or wrong answers. 
Tell them that they should select the response that best answers the question as 
they understand it. 
! No time limits

Date 06 July 2015
62 (111)Although most instruments require only a few minutes to complete the subject 
should be given as much time as is needed
! Review for completeness 
Prompt review of the questionnaire for completeness will minimize missing 
data and data queries. If an item is left blank ask the subject if they intended to 
leave the item blank. Provide an opportunity for the subject to answer if they 
wish.
! Enter PRO data in appropriate modules of eCRF
For PRO instruments captured at home using an ePRO device
! Guidelines similar to paper
Many of the same principles apply for ePRO as paper. Remind subjects that 
there are no right or wrong answers, avoid bias by [CONTACT_72985], remind 
subjects that they should complete the ePRO questions in a quiet and private location without help from others.
! Train the subject on ePRO device usage
Train the subject on how to use the ePRO device using the materials and 
training provided by [CONTACT_70170]
Provide guidance on whom the subject should call if they have problems
! Monitor compliance
Minimizing missing data is a key aspect of study success. Compliance must be 
checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify 
problems early. If compliance drops below 80% a check-in call from the site to 
ask the subject if they are having difficulties is highly recommended.
Recommended background medication compliance during the study is higher 
than 80%. It is recommended that compliance levels below 70% prompt the 
site/investigator to evaluate the reasons for low compliance and to provide re-
education to the patient in regards to the importance of compliance. It is 
strongly recommended that when compliance level falls below 50% the site contacts the Study Physician in order to discuss the potential safety 
implications for the patient and future decisions.
Additional and more specific details concerning PRO instrument administration are provided 
in subsequent sections where each instrument is described.

63 (111)[IP_ADDRESS] St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)
The SGRQ is a 50-item PRO instrument developed to measure the health status of subjects 
with airway obstruction diseases ( Jones et al 1991 ). The questionnaire is divided into two 
parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_568939] 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial 
impacts of the individual’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_22342]. The SGRQ yields a total score and three 
domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall health status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall 
impairment, in which [ADDRESS_1097627] 
possible health status. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment. Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by 
[CONTACT_310425] a user manual ( Jones, 2009 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI)
The BDI/TDI is an instrument developed to provide a multidimensional measure of dyspnea 
in relation to activities of daily living ( Mahler et al 1984 ). The Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) 
provides a measure of dyspnea at a single state, the baseline, and the Transitional Dyspnea 
Index (TDI) evaluates changes in dyspnea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the 
BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 
(unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by [CONTACT_406813] -3 (major 
deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to 
+9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically 
important difference (MCID) ( Mahler et al 2005 ).
The BDI should be captured at Visit 4. The Visit [ADDRESS_1097628]-randomization Visits will be completed using the Visit 4 BDI as a baseline 
reference point.
The BDI/TDI assessments should be completed according to the instructions and before other 
study procedures. The BDI/TDI is completed by a trained interviewer, who asks the 
respondent various questions as part of a medical history, and selects a grade (score) using specific criteria for each of the three components. The same interviewer will complete the BDI 
and the TDI for an individual subject.
[IP_ADDRESS] The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale
The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale uses a simple grading 
system to assess a subject’s level of dyspnea that consists of five statements about perceived 
breathlessness. It is an interviewer-administered ordinal scale on which subjects provide their

[IP_ADDRESS] COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
The CAT is an 8-item PRO developed to measure the impact of COPD on health status ( Jones 
et al 2009 ).  The instrument uses semantic differential six-point response scales which are 
defined by [CONTACT_406815]. Content includes items 
related to cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness going up hills/stairs, activity limitation at home, confidence leaving home, sleep and energy. A CAT total score is the sum 
of item responses. Scores range from 0-[ADDRESS_1097629] on health status.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool – Patient-reported 
Outcome (EXACT-PRO) and EXACT-Respi[INVESTIGATOR_208466] (E-RS)
The EXACT-PRO is a 14-item PRO instrument developed to assess the frequency, severity 
and duration of COPD exacerbations ( Jones et al 2011 , Leidy et al 2011 ). The instrument was 
developed for daily, at home, administration using a handheld electronic device. Respondents are instructed to complete the diary each evening just prior to bedtime and to answer the 
questions while considering their experiences “today”.  The daily EXACT-PRO total score 
has a range of 0-[ADDRESS_1097630]-PRO can provide information on event 
frequency and duration as well as event severity. 
The E-RS is an 11-item PRO developed to evaluate the severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_568965] ( Sexton et al 2010 , Sexton et al 2011 ). The E-RS is a subset of items from the 
EXACT-PRO. The E-RS was designed to be captured as part of the daily EXACT-PRO assessment. Summation of E-RS item responses produces a total score ranging from 0 to 40, 
with higher scores indicating greater severity. In addition to the total score, symptom domain 
scores can be calculated for breathlessness (5 items; score range: 0–17), cough and sputum (3 items; score range: 0–11) and chest symptoms (3 items; score range: 0–11) by [CONTACT_795762] a respective domain. As with the total score, higher domain scores 
indicate greater severity.
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L
The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort 
and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, 
moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty.
The subject will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by [CONTACT_406822] [ADDRESS_1097631] imaginable health state.

[IP_ADDRESS] Major/minor symptom worsening assessment and alert system
Symptoms will be assessed each morning for the purposes of a symptom worsening alert. The 
purpose of this alert is to notify both the subject and the study center of a potential symptom 
worsening event that warrants contact [CONTACT_795763].
Each morning the subject will complete 3 questions pertaining to the major symptoms of a 
worsening event (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum color). Subject reported worsening of 
1 or more of these symptoms will trigger assessment of the minor symptoms of a worsening 
event (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, cough, and wheeze).  All questions will have a [ADDRESS_1097632] 3 response options (e.g. How breathless have you been in the last 24 hours? 
Less breathlessness than usual, Usual level of breathlessness, More breathless than usual) whereas questions related to the presence or absence of a symptom will have a dichotomous 
response (e.g. Have you had a sore throat in the last 24 hours? No, Yes, I had a sore throat).
An alert will be triggered if two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, and 
sputum color) worsen for two consecutive days or if one major symptom and one minor 
symptom (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, cough, and wheeze) worsen for at least 
two consecutive days. When either of these criteria is met the subject will be alerted via the ePRO device to contact [CONTACT_795764]. Likewise 
the study center will be alerted to contact [CONTACT_244961] 24-72 hours if he 
or she has not yet contact[CONTACT_795765].
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Medication Use
Rescue medication usage including reliever inhaler and nebulizer use will be captured twice 
daily. Inhaler usage will be reported as the number of puffs in a given period whereas 
nebulizer use will be reported as the number of times. Rescue medication usage at night will be assessed in the morning and rescue medication used during the day will be assessed in the 
evening.
[IP_ADDRESS] Nocturnal Awakenings
Subjects will be asked to report the occurrence of nocturnal awakenings due to COPD 
symptoms each morning using the ePRO device. A single question with yes/no response 
options will be used.
[IP_ADDRESS] Maintenance Medication Use
Maintenance medication adherence will be assessed each evening via a single yes/no question. 
The subject will be asked if they took their regularly scheduled inhaler (yes/no) and instructed 
not to consider instances of rescue inhaler usage when answering this question.

5.1.5 Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Global Impression 
of Change (PGIC)
The Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC) instruments are used to evaluate overall response to treatment (change from baseline). 
The assessments are independent of each other. The subject completes the assessment without 
reference to the clinician’s rating and the clinician completes the assessment without reference to the subject's rating. Both assessments use a 7-point rating scale: 1 = Very Much Improved; 
2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = 
Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.
The investigator (clinician) and the subject will be asked to rate the degree to which overall 
COPD status may have changed when compared to baseline (i.e. randomization visit/initiation 
of study drug). The CGIC and PGIC will be completed at the site visits as indicated in Table 
3. It is recommended that the same clinician completes the CGIC for an individual subject.

Benralizumab/placebo is to be stored at the study centre in a secured facility with limited 
access and controlled temperature. The temperature should be monitored on daily basis and 
documented in the temperature monitoring log according to the IP Handling instruction.
The IP must be kept in the original outer container and under conditions specified on the label.In the following cases the centre staff should not use affected IP and should immediately 
contact [CONTACT_795771]:
Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the study
Damaged kit upon receipt
Damaged syringe/cartridge
Damaged IP should be documented using the IWRS/IVRS (please refer to IWRS/IVRS 
manual for further details).

6.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomisation codes will be assigned strictly sequentially in each stratum as subjects become eligible for randomisation.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria should not, under any circumstances, 
be randomised or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule.

the personnel carrying out the packaging and labelling of IP
the personnel generating the randomisation list
The information in the randomisation list will be kept from other personnel involved in the 
conduct of the study, and in a secure location until the end of the study.
[COMPANY_008] staff involved in the study, the subjects, and the investigators involved in the 
treatment of the subjects or in their clinical evaluation will not be aware of the treatment 
allocation.
Placebo solution will be visually matched with benralizumab solution. Both benralizumab and 
placebo will be provided in accessorized pre-filled syringes.
Maintaining the blind to the subject’s blood eosinophil counts
While not entirely specific, subjects on active benralizumab treatment are expected to have 
lower blood eosinophil counts than subjects on placebo. Procedures to mitigate unblinding on 
this basis include:
!Per protocol haematology will be run by [CONTACT_2237]. Except for the Visit 1 
screening eosinophil count, eosinophil and basophil counts will be redacted from the 
laboratory reports. Because complete knowledge of the remaining cell types could 
permit deduction of the ‘eosinophil+ basophil’ compartment, monocyte counts will 
also be redacted from the reports. 
!If the Investigator orders any local safety laboratory assessments, the requested tests 
should be restricted to the question at hand. For example, if haemoglobin is desired, 
the Investigator should avoid ordering a complete blood cell count with a differential 
count.
!Handling of laboratory results obtained during the treatment period but ordered 
outside of the clinical trial. Centre staff who are directly involved in the subject’s 
management should remain blinded to any eosinophil, basophil and monocyte results 
included as part of an outside lab reports. To help ensure this, each investigational 
centre will designate an individual (e.g. administrator or another ancillary person) not directly involved in subject management, to receive and blind any eosinophil, 
basophil and monocyte results prior to the report being handed over to the centre staff 
involved in subject’s management and prior to filing as a source document. Similarly, eosinophil and basophil results must be redacted from all communications with the 
Sponsor.

management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment 
given to subject to the [COMPANY_008] staff.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the 
planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject have been made and documented.
6.8 IP administration and treatment compliance
The administration of all study drugs (including investigational products) should be recorded 
in the appropriate sections of the eCRF.
The IP will be administered subcutaneously at the study centre on treatment visits and within 
visit windows as specified in Table [ADDRESS_1097661] should be discontinued from IP, please refer to section 3.6.1 . Minimum interval 
between IP doses should not be less than 3 weeks.
If the dose for Visit 6 is significantly delayed (>1 week) this is the only time at which the dose 
can be skipped, the next dosing should be done at Visit 7 as per Study plan ( Table 3 ).
If IP dosing needs to be delayed, all study procedures for that visit should be postponed until 
the day of dosing. However if any of treatment visit procedures have been already performed, 
there is no need to repeat them provided IP is administered within the next 7 days.

Subjects will have had a pre-assessment (i.e. vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration) and should be observed after IP administration for a minimum of 2 hours for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. 
In order to help understand the potential drug-relatedness of any acute reaction, a blood 
sample should be drawn during the event for possible additional ADA testing (if not already scheduled for this visit). Serum tryptase or other blood or urine testing relevant to the 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis may be obtained at a local lab at the discretion of the Investigator.
7. SAFETY REPORTING
7.1 Adverse events
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_397641].
7.1.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., 
tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory 
findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study 
treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.7.1.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, 
treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death
! Is immediately life-threatening
! Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795729] (MEDI-563)
Study Code D3251C00004Edition Number 4.0
Date 06 July 2015
81 (111)! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.
7.1.[ADDRESS_1097668] signs the informed 
consent throughout the treatment period up to the final follow-up visit (Visit 20, week 60).
For the patients prematurely discontinued from IP all AEs, including SAEs, will be collected 
up to Visit 19, week 56.
Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the end of the study are followed up by [CONTACT_795774], but without further recording in the eCRF. [COMPANY_008] retains 
the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
The requirement to follow-up AEs is not intended to delay database lock or production of the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR). These activities should proceed as planned with ongoing AEs if necessary.
Any follow-up information of ongoing SAEs after database lock will be reported to 
[COMPANY_008].
7.1.4 Variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE:
! AE (verbatim)
! The date when the AE started and stopped
! Maximum intensity of the AE
! Whether the AE is serious or not
! Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no)
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (MEDI-563)
Study Code D3251C00004Edition Number 4.0
Date 06 July 2015
82 (111)! Action taken with regard to investigational product
! AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)
! Outcome
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_253783] 7.1.[ADDRESS_1097669] and each AE, 
and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B  to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.
7.1.[ADDRESS_1097670] or reported in response to the open question 
from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you 
were last asked?’ , or revealed by [CONTACT_178557]. 
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
7.1.[ADDRESS_1097671].
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin

mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events of Pneumonia requiring a confirmed diagnosis
Events of suspected pneumonia should be confirmed by [CONTACT_46917] a new infiltrate on x-
ray within approximately [ADDRESS_1097672] 2 of the following signs and symptoms: increased cough, increased sputum purulence or production, consistent auscultatory findings, 
dyspnea or tachypnea, fever, leukocytosis, or hypoxemia.
Events of confirmed diagnoses of pneumonia must be recorded as the adverse event 
“Pneumonia (confirmed)” in the eCRF.
7.1.8 Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Cases where a subject shows an AST or ALT K3xULN or total bilirubin K2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D  for further instructions in cases of combined 
increase of aminotransferase and total bilirubin.
7.1.[ADDRESS_1097673], or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigators or other centre personnel 
will inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e., immediately but 
no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within one 
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within five calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other centre personnel inform [COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other centre personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC 
system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study centre personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].

The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the [COMPANY_008] 
drug.
7.1.10 Reporting of COPD exacerbations
COPD exacerbations should be captured on a specific eCRF module (COPDEX).
COPD exacerbations should not be reported as Adverse Events unless they meet Serious 
Adverse Event definition (see 7.1.2 ). In such case, COPD exacerbation should be reported 
both as an exacerbation and as a SAE.
7.2 Overdose
! An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module
! An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then 
Investigators or other centre personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 
one day i.e., immediately but no later than [ADDRESS_1097674] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study.

The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 
days for SAEs, see section 7.1.9 and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
The pregnancy (PREGREP) module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the 
pregnancy outcome (PREGOUT) module is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
7.3.2 Paternal exposure 
Male subjects should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 
16 weeks (5 half-lives) following the last dose of IP.
Pregnancy of the subject’s partner is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality) should, if possible, be followed up and documented.
Information on the pregnancy of a male subject’s partner must be obtained directly from the 
subject’s partner; the male subject should not be asked to provide this information. Prior to 
obtaining information related to the pregnancy and outcome of the pregnancy, the Investigator 
must obtain the subject’s partner consent. A consent form specific to this situation must be used. The outcome of any conception occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks 
(5 half-lives) after the last administration of IP should be followed up and documented.
7.4 Independent Adjudication Committee
An Independent Adjudication Committee will be constituted to provide an independent, 
external, systematic and unbiased assessment of  blinded data to confirm the diagnosis of: 1) investigator reported non-fatal  myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, embolic), as well as cardiovascular deaths and 2) investigator reported malignancies during the Phase III trials. The committee will operate in accordance with an Adjudication Committee Charter/Manual of Operations, which will also provide detail on what specific information the committee requires to enable a thorough adjudication.

healing and host defense (infections and infestations).  It will also evaluate the output of the independent adjudication committee (major adverse cardiovascular events and malignancies). This will be done in addition to usual pharmacovigilance programs.
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383]
8.1 Statistical considerations
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until 
database lock and protocol violators identified
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_795775].
8.2 Sample size estimate
The study will recruit subjects with blood eosinophil counts <220/ OL, 220-299/ OL, and 
K300/OL. The approximately 2:1 ratio between K220/OL and <220/ OL allows analysis of the 
primary population for subjects most likely to respond to benralizumab (i.e. K220/OL), while 
still including subjects below this threshold in order to help understand efficacy and safety in this group. The study is powered for the exacerbation rate comparisons of the subjects with 
blood eosinophils K220/OL (primary efficacy analysis).
For the primary endpoint annual COPD exacerbation rate, 348 subjects with baseline blood 
eosinophil counts K220/OL per treatment arm (1392 total) will need to be randomised to 
achieve 90% power of detecting a 30% reduction in both the 30mg and 100mg benralizumab 
dose groups versus placebo based on a Hochberg Procedure ( Hochberg 1988 ). This 
calculation has assumed two-sided 4% alpha level tests, an annual placebo rate of 0.93 
events/subject (1.0 events/subject/56 weeks), a negative binomial shape parameter of 0.4, and 
a dropout rate of 10%. The sample size calculation is based on simulations and has accounted for the power loss from a proposed futility analysis (Section 8.5.6 ).
As stated previously an approximately 2:1 ratio will be used for subjects with blood 
eosinophil counts K220/OL and <220/ OL. Therefore this study will randomise 174
subjects/arm (696 total) with baseline blood eosinophil counts <220/ OL. An additional 20 
subjects/arm will also be recruited to the 220-299/ OL cohort to better characterize patients 
within this cohort. This addition results in 368 subjects/arm in the K220/OL cohort (1472 
total). A total of 2168 subjects are expected to be randomised in this study. Details of the 
estimated numbers of recruited subjects/arm in each cohort (<220/ OL, 220-299/ OL, K300/OL) 
are described in the SAP.
The sample size necessary to achieve a stated power (90% in our case) in this study is 
calculated based on the estimate of overall exacerbation rate and shape parameter from the 
negative binomial model (Section 8.5.1 ). In order to better estimate the overall exacerbation

87 (111)rate and shape parameter, we plan to conduct a single blinded sample size re-estimation in 
both studies D3251C0003 and D3251C0004. Blinded estimates of the overall exacerbation 
rate as well as the shape parameter from data pooled across placebo and all benralizumab doses (for patients with eosinophil counts K220/OL) will be used in the sample size re-
estimation and strictly no treatment information will be used in the review. The pooled study 
summaries will not contain any information that would potentially reveal the treatment assignments (e.g., post-randomization eosinophil levels). The review will be conducted before 
the last patient with eosinophil counts K220/OL is randomized and after the futility analysis 
(Section 8.5.6 ). The exacerbation rate and shape parameter will be estimated using the 
maximum likelihood approach as proposed by [CONTACT_795776] [ADDRESS_1097676] will be 
classified as the higher active dose. All safety summaries and ADA data will be based on this analysis set.
8.3.4 Pharmacokinetic analysis set
All subjects who received benralizumab and from whom PK blood samples are assumed not 
to be affected by [CONTACT_795777] (e.g., disallowed medication) will be included in the PK analysis set. All PK summaries will be based on this analysis set.

the EOT at Visit 19, inclusive.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation rate
The annual COPD exacerbation rate will be used as the primary efficacy variable.
A COPD exacerbation is defined in section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1097678] is approximately 56 weeks; defined 
as the time from randomisation to the date of Visit 19. For a subject lost to follow-up, this will 
be defined as the time from randomisation to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed.
In the statistical analysis, the number of COPD exacerbations experienced by a subject during 
the 56-week double-blind treatment period will be used as response variable, and the logarithm of the subject’s corresponding follow-up time will be used as an offset in the 
analysis to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occur.
For the production of summary statistics, the annual exacerbation rate per subject is 
calculated, and standardized per 56-week period according to the formula described below. 
Annual Exacerbation Rate = Number of Exacerbations*365.25 / (Last follow-up date – Visit 4 
date + 1).
For subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment, efforts will be made to continue 
collecting the exacerbation data until the scheduled Visit 19/ EOT at Week 56 after 
randomisation (refer to section  3.6.1) . In the statistical analysis of exacerbation rate, the data 
collected up to Visit 19/ EOT at Week 56 will be included for the patients who prematurely

during the treatment period the exacerbation data collected up to the date of death will be 
included in the statistical analysis.
If the cause of death is related to COPD or a COPD exacerbation, the event will also be 
included in the rate calculation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Proportion of subjects with M1 COPD exacerbation during 56 weeks of 
treatment
The proportion of subjects with K1 COPD exacerbation during the 56 weeks of treatment will 
be a supportive variable to the primary objective.
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to first exacerbation 
Time from randomisation to the first COPD exacerbation will also be used as a supportive 
variable to the primary objective, and is calculated as follows:
Start Date of first COPD exacerbation d Date of Randomisation + 1.
The time to first COPD exacerbation for subjects who do not experience an COPD 
exacerbation during the treatment period will be censored at the date of their last visit for the 56-week double-blind treatment period, or at the time point after which an exacerbation could 
not be assessed (for lost-to-follow-up subjects).

8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of safety variable(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety variablesThe following safety data will be collected: vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, 
haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and reported AEs.
Change from baseline (Visit 4) to each post-treatment time point where scheduled assessments 
were made will be calculated for relevant measurements. AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_795778].
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events
During the evaluation of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs.
Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant AEs (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.
Examples of these are marked haematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction, or significant additional treatment.

total score at Week 56.
E-RS
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_795733] E-RS.  Individual daily E-RS total and 
subscale scores will be calculated and summarized as a biweekly (14 day) mean. Data 
collected in the two-week period prior to randomisation will be used to calculate the 
individual E-RS total and subscale baseline means.
EXACT-PRO
The number, average duration, and severity of EXACT-PRO defined events will be evaluated. 
EXACT-PRO daily total scores as well as domain scores will be calculated according to the 
developer approved scoring algorithm. The total score will be used to identify event onset and recovery as well as the magnitude (severity) of the event. The baseline total score will be the 
mean within subject score over the [ADDRESS_1097681]-PRO defined event. Event frequency is 
calculated by [CONTACT_795779]. Calculating event duration requires identification of the following five parameters: 1) onset; 2) three-day rolling average; 
3) maximum observed value; 4) threshold for improvement; and 5) recovery. The severity of 
an event is indicated by [CONTACT_568989] (highest) EXACT-PRO total score during an event. Complete details concerning variable calculation are provided in the scoring manual and will 
be provided in the study Statistical analysis plan (SAP).
BDI/TDI
The instrument consists of three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and 
magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 
0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. The 
BDI will be captured at baseline only. For the TDI, changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by [CONTACT_406813] -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are 
added to form a total TDI score from -9 to +9.
8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of pharmacokinetic variables
Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessment will be primarily based on the 
observed steady-state serum trough (predose) concentrations, Ctrough. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_795734].   
The PK data will be merged with those from other clinical studies for a population-based 
meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis will be presented in a separate pharmacometrics 
report outside of the CSR.

92 (111)8.4.5 Calculation or derivation of immunogenicity variables
ADA assessments will be conducted utilizing a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titer).  The 
presence of anti-benralizumab antibodies is determined relative to a cutoff value that is 
calculated for each plate as the mean response of the negative control wells multiplied by a cut point factor.  The cut point factor was statistically determined during assay validation.  
Samples that measure at or above the cut point value are considered as potential positives for 
ADA and are retested in a confirmatory (specificity) assay, both in the absence and presence of excess benralizumab.  Samples are confirmed to be positive for ADA if the percent 
inhibition of response in the presence of benralizumab is greater than or equal to the 
confirmatory cut point established during assay validation.  Confirmed positive samples are then measured in a titer assay.  Titers are performed by [CONTACT_795780] (over the 1:50 
minimum required sample dilution) that measure positive in the assay, before returning a negative response.
Neutralizing antibody (nAb) evaluations will be conducted on those serum samples that test 
positive for ADA at end of treatment and also during the study follow up period.  ADA-positive samples will retested in a competitive ligand-binding assay to determine if the ADA 
present is capable of inhibiting (neutralizing) the binding of benralizumab to soluble 
recombinant human interleukin 5 receptor (IL-5R). The test sample is deemed positive or negative for the presence of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to benralizumab relative to a pre-
determined (in assay validation), statistically derived cut point. Samples positive for nAb to 
benralizumab are then titered to determine relative amounts of nAb present in each test sample.
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The primary analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints will include all data 
captured during the 56-week treatment period, regardless of whether study treatment was 
prematurely discontinued, or delayed, and/or irrespective of protocol adherence.
Demography and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_680247]. In the event that there are major differences between the full analysis set and 
safety analysis set, these summaries will also be repeated for the safety analysis set.
Testing strategy to account for multiplicity considerations
To account for multiplicity to test the primary (exacerbation) and two key secondary 
endpoints (FEV 1and SGRQ) for each of the 30mg and 100mg dose groups (for subjects with 
baseline blood eosinophils K220/OL) a testing strategy will be followed to control the overall 
type I error rate at level 0.05. The testing strategy will be according to the following gate 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]:
Step 1: Perform the two tests of annual COPD exacerbation rate (one test for each dose vs. 
placebo) at the family wise error rate (FWER) of 0.04 using a Hochberg Procedure ( Hochberg

less than 0.02 then proceed to Step 2a; otherwise no null hypothesis is rejected
Step 2: Test the two key secondary endpoints for both doses as one family at the FWER of 
0.05 using a Holm Procedure ( Holm 1979 ).
Step 2a: Test the two secondary endpoints for the smaller-p-value dose at the FWER of 0.01

8.5.1 Primary analysis method(s)
The primary efficacy variable is the annual COPD exacerbation rate and the primary analysis 
is to compare the annual COPD exacerbation rate of each benralizumab dose group with 
placebo in subjects with baseline blood eosinophil counts K220/OL.
For each of the three benralizumab dose groups, the null hypothesis is that the exacerbation 
rate on benralizumab is equal to the exacerbation rate on placebo. The alternative hypothesis 
is that the exacerbation rate on benralizumab is not equal to the exacerbation rate on placebo, i.e.:
H0: Rate ratio (benralizumab vs. Placebo) = 1
Ha: Rate ratio (benralizumab vs. Placebo) e 1
Exacerbation rate in each of the three benralizumab dose groups will be compared to 
exacerbation rate in the placebo group using a negative binomial model. The response variable 
in the model will be the number of COPD exacerbations over the 56-week treatment period. The model will include covariates of treatment group, eosinophil cohort (220-299/ OL or 
K300/OL), country, background therapy (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA, or ICS/LABA/LAMA), 
and the number of exacerbations in the year before the study. The logarithm of the follow-up time will be used as an offset variable in the model.
The estimated treatment effect (i.e., the rate ratio of benralizumab versus placebo), 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and two-sided p-value for the rate ratio will bepresented. In addition, the exacerbation rate and the corresponding 95% CI within each 
treatment group will be presented.
In addition, the exacerbation rate will also be summarized in subjects with baseline blood 
eosinophil counts <220/ OL, <150/OL, 150-219/ OL, 220-299/ OL, 300-449/ OL, and K450/OL 
separately for descriptive purpose only.

change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator FEV 1.
Proportion of subjects with K4-point decrease (improvement) in SGRQ total score at Week 56 
in each of the three benralizumab dose groups will be compared with the proportion in the 
placebo group using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test controlling for eosinophil cohort (220-299/OL or K300/OL), country, and background therapy (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA, or 
ICS/LABA/LAMA). Cumulative distribution function of absolute changes in SGRQ total 
score at week 56 will be plotted in a figure.
The proportion of subjects with K1 COPD exacerbation during the 56 weeks of treatment will 
be addressed as a supportive variable to the primary objective. The proportion in each of the 
three benralizumab dose groups will be compared with the proportion in the placebo group using a logistic regression model with eosinophil cohort (220-299/ OL or K300/OL), country, 
background therapy (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA, or ICS/LABA/LAMA), and number of 
exacerbations in the year before the study as covariates.
Time to first COPD exacerbation will be analyzed as another supportive efficacy variable to 
the primary objective to explore the extent to which treatment with benralizumab delays the 
time to first exacerbation compared with placebo. A Cox proportional hazard model will be fitted to data with the covariates of treatment, eosinophil cohort (220-299/ OL or K300/OL), 
country, background therapy (ICS/LABA, LABA/LAMA, or ICS/LABA/LAMA), and

The futility analysis will be based on the pooled data of study D3251C00003 and study 
D3251C00004 when approximately 15% patients with baseline blood eosinophil countsK220/OL have completed the studies. The percentage of patients is based on the total number 
of patients with eosinophil counts K220/OL expected to be recruited in the studies. In the 
futility analysis, decision will be based on the comparison of the futility boundary and the estimated exacerbation rate reductions of benralizumab doses vs. placebo in patients with 
eosinophil counts K220/OL from the negative binomial model as documented for the final 
analysis in section 8.5.1 . Futility will be declared if the higher exacerbation rate reduction of 
benralizumab 30mg vs. placebo and benralizumab 100mg vs. placebo is less than 8%. A 
futility boundary of 8% was chosen based on the operating characteristics of ~55% chance of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795739] ~2% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795740] 30% for both benralizumab doses vs. placebo.  Full details about the futility

The data will be validated as defined in the Data Management Plan. Quality control 
procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable 
and have been processed correctly. The study Data Management Plan will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various functions and personnel involved in the data 
management process
When all data have been coded, validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared. Any 
treatment revealing data may thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reconciliation
SAE reconciliation reports are produced and reconciled with the Patient Safety database 
and/or the investigational site. 
Data associated with human biological samples
Data associated with biological samples will be transferred from laboratories internal or 
external to [COMPANY_008].
10. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable regulatory requirements and the [COMPANY_008] policy on Bioethics and Human Biological 
Samples.

103 (111)10.[ADDRESS_1097689] data protection
The Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and 
privacy legislation.
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].
Precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the 
identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see 
both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, an [COMPANY_008] Study Physician or an investigator might know a subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also Regulatory authorities 
may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the 
genetic files would remain physically separate.
10.3 Ethics and regulatory review
An Ethics Committee should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of 
the Informed Consent Form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided 
to the subjects. The investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable Ethics Committee, and to the study centre staff.
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_291424]. The investigator should 
submit the written approval to [COMPANY_008] before enrolment of any subject into the study.
The Ethics Committee should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.
[COMPANY_008] should approve any modifications to the Informed Consent Form that are needed 
to meet local requirements.
If required by [CONTACT_427], the protocol should be re-approved by [CONTACT_119009].
Before enrolment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the Informed Consent Form, is approved by [CONTACT_76466] a 
notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.
[COMPANY_008] will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory 
authorities.
[COMPANY_008] will provide Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Principal 
Investigators with safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including S[LOCATION_003]Rs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions), where relevant.

Date 06 July 2015
104 (111)For the US and Canada, may also be applicable to other countries, Each Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_291425]/IRB with reports of any serious and 
unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product.  [COMPANY_008] will provide this information to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153215]/she 
can meet these reporting requirements.
10.4 Informed consent
The Principal Investigator(s) or designee at each centre will:
Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written information 
about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study
Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study 
at any time
Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed 
time to consider the information provided
Ensure each subject provides signed and dated informed consent before 
conducting any procedure specifically for the study
Ensure the original, signed Informed Consent Form(s) is/are stored in the 
Investigator’s Study File
Ensure a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form is given to the subject
Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any provisions 
for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in the informed consent form that is approved by [CONTACT_75399].
10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the International co-ordinating Investigator, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_255684].
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study 
protocol (Revised Clinical Study Protocol).
The amendment is to be approved by [CONTACT_291474], also the 
national regulatory authority approval, before implementation.  Local requirements are to be 
followed for revised protocols.
[COMPANY_008] will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to 
each Principal Investigator(s). For distribution to Ethics Committee see section 10.3.

Drug Substance Benr alizumab (MEDI-563)
Study Code D3251C00004Edition Number 4.0
Date 06 July 2015
105 (111)If a protocol amendment requires a change to a centre’s Informed Consent Form, [COMPANY_008] 
and the centre’s Ethics Committee are to approve the revised Informed Consent Form before 
the revised form is used. 
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by [CONTACT_291475].
10.6 Audits and inspections
Authorised representatives of [COMPANY_008], a regulatory authority, or an Ethics Committee 
may perform audits or inspections at the centre, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-
related activities and documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and 
data were recorded, analysed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any 
applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator will contact [CONTACT_309580] a regulatory agency about an inspection at the centre.

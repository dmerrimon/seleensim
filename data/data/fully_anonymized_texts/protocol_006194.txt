regimens outpatient. 
(a) Outpatient patients with cancer using aromatherapy inhalation will have a 
higher level of quality of life while receiving moderate to high emetogenic 
chemotherapy.
4)Background*
Forty percent of patients with cancer undergoing moderate to high 
emetogenic chemotherapy will experience chemotherapy-induced nausea and 
vomiting (CINV) (Yokoe et al., 2018). Even with medical and treatment 
advancements, CINV remains a significant clinical challenge for patients 
undergoing chemotherapy (American Cancer Society, 2020; Escobar et al., 2015). 
Approximately 71% of breast patients with cancer experienced nausea despi[INVESTIGATOR_118712], and patients consistently ranked nausea over 
vomiting as the worst side effect associated with chemotherapy (Aapro, 2018; 
Escobar et al., 2015). However, healthcare providers frequently underestimate the 
prevalence of acute and delayed CINV, which has left patients' CINV unmanaged. 
The American Cancer Society guidelines recommend that patients use 
antiemetic medicine at the first sign of nausea to prevent vomiting (Hesketh et al., 
2017). However, physiology and risk factors that contribute to nausea are not 
understood clearly, and many of the antiemetic agents currently available do not 
relieve patients' CINV and may produce additional adverse side effects (Aapro, 
2018; Herz, 2005). Previous CINV research has been conducted in patients who 
received highly emetogenic chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin plus 
cyclophosphamide, epi[INVESTIGATOR_118713], and anthracycline-
cyclophosphamide (AC) treatments) (Escobar et al., 2015), and few studies have 
been conducted with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin, 
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) (Nam, 2018). Additionally, research has indicated that 
patients' and healthcare providers' have misperceptions (e.g., cultural difference 
and level of understanding) of nausea and vomiting (Molassiotis et al., 2007; 
Yamaguchi et al., 2009). The patients' and healthcare providers' misperceptions 
may increase CINV, highlighting the need for a patient self-reporting mechanism 
(Escobar et al., 2015; Grunberg et al., 2004).
Literature suggests that essential oil aromatherapy (e.g., peppermint, 
lemon, and lavender) can alleviate nausea and vomiting in a variety of patient 
populations (e.g., oncology, pregnant, and postoperative patients) (Eghbali, 
Varaei, Yekaninelad, Mohammadxadeh, & Shahi, 2017; Howard & Hughes, 
2008; Kia, Safajou, Shahnazi, & Nazemiyeh, 2014; Louis & Kowalski, 2002; Lua 
& Zakaria, 2012). A recent study showed that the use of aromatherapy, in addition 
to antiemetic therapy, can reduce CINV during the acute phase of chemotherapy 
(Farahani et al., 2019). Additionally, aromatherapy is recommended as a 
complementary treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting due to its safe 
and rapid onset, ease of administration, minimal drug interaction, and side effects 
that have shown to reduce anxiety and depression and increase patients well-being 
(Duff, 2009; Louis & Kowalski, 2002). 
The use of aromatherapy in a controlled environment can prevent or 
reduce patients' CINV and psychological distress symptoms after cancer

chemotherapy without utilizing antiemetic medications (Eghbali et al., 2017; 
Herz, 2005; Hodge, McCarthy, & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835], 2014). Similar to aromatherapy, 
resilience, a person's ability to cope positively and adapt to their cancer diagnosis 
and treatment has shown to reduce symptoms such as anxiety and depression and 
increase the patient's well-being (Matzka et al., 2016). This study aims to 
investigate the effect of aromatherapy inhalation as a complimentary non-
pharmaceutical intervention on CINV, resilience, and the use of antiemetics 
among patients with cancer receiving moderate to high emetogenic chemotherapy 
regimens outpatient. The study team used the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN,2020) to identify moderate and high 
emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.

Version: # 2 6
patients' quality of life and well-being at pre-and post-assessment. 
c)Outcome Measure Timeframe: Data collected at baseline and final visit.  
The study objectives and endpoints were selected because (a) more research is necessary to 
understand the effects of aromatherapy on moderate and high emetogenic chemotherapy 
regimens in an outpatient setting; (b) the literature suggests that CINV has a relationship 
with decreased quality of life and increased antiemetic usage and psychological distress 
symptoms; (c) the relationship between CINV and resilience has not been established. 
However, literature has shown a relationship between resilience and a reduction in 
psychological distress symptoms and improved quality of life. 
9)Procedures Involved*
The study will continue as follows:
 
Initial visit 
The study's initial visit will occur while patients are in the CTU or fast-track area as they 
get ready for treatment. The entire study will be explained to the patient when they are preparing 
for their chemotherapy regimen in a comfortable area provided by [CONTACT_118729]. After answering 
the potential participants' questions, the study team member will go through the study's informed 
consent process if the participant is interested and willing to consent. The potential participants 
will have time to review and discuss informed consent. After the patient signs the informed 
consent, the participant will be randomized to the control or the intervention arm.
On the same day, the study team member will meet the participant in the CTU while they 
receive their infusion and provide both the control and intervention groups, access to complete, 
via iPad or laptop, the electronic pre-assessment and demographic form, psychological distress 
VAS, resilience scale, FACIT-G, and a study packet that includes the Antiemesis (MAT) tool, 
antiemetic diary or antiemetic/aromatherapy diary. The study packet will be completed and 
returned to the study team member on the participants' next scheduled chemotherapy infusion. 
The study team member will explain to the participants how to use the MAT tool and how to fill 
the antiemetic diary or antiemetic/aromatherapy diary. The study team member will go through 
the instructions to ensure that they understand the forms and how to complete them.
 
Arm 1 - Control group: 
Participants in the control group will receive standard medical care, consisting of 
antiemetic medicine at the first sign of CINV on a schedule as prescribed by [CONTACT_118730]. The study team member will review with the participant how to use the weekly study 
packet (e.g., MAT tool and antiemetic diary) and explain that a study team member will collect 
the packet on their next scheduled chemotherapy infusion. 
 
Arm 2 - Intervention group: 
Participants in the intervention group will receive an aromatherapy inhaler for 
complementary use with their antiemetic medication. Participants will be encouraged to use the 
aromatherapy inhaler at the first sign of CINV before taking their antiemetic medications that are 
labeled “as needed”. The interventional group will be instructed that one normal inhale is 
equivalent to one dose of aromatherapy and must report essential oils sensitivity to a study team

member. The participant will be withdrawn from the study if essential oils sensitivity is 
identified. Aromatherapy will be used as often as needed or whenever CINV is encountered. 
Participants are advised to take their prescribed antiemetic medications that are labeled “as 
needed” as directed by [CONTACT_118731]. The study team member will explain to the participants that 
they will need to fill out the MAT tool and antiemetic/aromatherapy diary. And study team 
member will collect the packet on their next scheduled chemotherapy infusion.  
Visit 1: Participants' visit one will take place on their next scheduled chemotherapy infusion – 
i.e., the participants' first chemotherapy cycle during their study period.
 
Arm 1 - Control group:
A study team member and participant will meet during the participant's scheduled CTU 
appointment to collect their MAT tool and antiemetic diary. During this interaction, the study 
team member will reinforce instructions and answer any participant's questions, concerns, or 
confusion regarding the MAT tool and antiemetic diary. A new study packet will be provided to 
the participants.
 
Arm 2 - Interventional group:
A study team member and participant will meet during the participant's scheduled CTU 
appointment to collect their MAT tool and antiemetic/aromatherapy diary. During this 
interaction, the study team member will reinforce instructions and answer any participant's 
questions, concerns, or confusion regarding the aromatherapy inhaler, MAT tool, and 
antiemetic/aromatherapy diary. A new study packet and an aromatherapy inhaler, if necessary, 
will be provided to the participants.
Visit 2: Participants' visit two will take place on their next scheduled chemotherapy infusion – 
i.e., the participants' second chemotherapy cycle during their study period.
 
Arm 1 - Control group:
A study team member and participant will meet during the participant's scheduled CTU 
appointment to collect their MAT tool and antiemetic diary. During this interaction, the study 
team member will reinforce instructions and answer any participant's questions, concerns, or 
confusion regarding the MAT tool and antiemetic diary. A new study packet will be provided to 
the participants.

Interventions and Assessment Instruments:
Pre-Assessment and Demographic Checklist:
The participants will complete a pre-assessment and demographic checklist that 
assesses their demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity, age, and education level), 
essential oils sensitivity, and risk factors of CINV. The pre-assessment demographic 
checklist will provide the descriptive characteristics of the study's sample population. 
Additional data, such as medical history (e.g., diagnoses, allergies, 
medications, cancer history, and treatment regimen), family history, and 
recent outpatient and inpatient clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], will be extracted from 
the electronic health record.

Aromatherapy Study IRB # 20201412
Version: # 2 10
Aromatherapy Inhaler (Arm 2 – Intervention Only):
 The study's aromatherapy inhaler can be used when participants' have their first 
sign of CINV and as needed. The aromatherapy inhaler contains a proprietary blend of 
peppermint, spearmint, lavender, and ginger essential oils that can last up to [ADDRESS_132560] open the cap, hold the inhaler below their nose, and take deep 
breaths to activate the aromatherapy inhaler. Once the participant is done, they will close 
the aromatherapy inhaler to turn it off. The aromatherapy vapors can be safely inhaled for 
as long as it takes to provide comfort and relief for the patient. There are no "limits" or 
duration restrictions for any essential oils in the blend. The aromatherapy inhalation 
amount can vary from brief intermittent use to continuous inhalation over several 
minutes. The aromatherapy inhaler has unlimited uses with no time limits. One inhalation 
of aromatherapy is equivalent to one dose. There are no known contraindications. At each 
study visit, the study team member will offer the participant a replacement aromatherapy 
inhalation device. 
Antiemetic/Aromatherapy Diary (Arm 2 - Intervention Only): 
The antiemetic/aromatherapy diary will allow the participants to record their 
weekly usage (date and time) of aromatherapy and antiemetic uses and evaluate the 
aromatherapy and type (name) of antiemetic medications. The evaluation will assess the 
effects of the aromatherapy on CINV by [CONTACT_118732][INVESTIGATOR_118714], 'Did the aromatherapy take away your nausea?' 
answers include: 'it took away my nausea completely' to 'it had no effect on my nausea.' 
If the participants cannot get relief from the aromatherapy, the participants will take the 
prescribed antiemetic, and the participants will document the type of antiemetic 
medication they needed. 
Additionally, there is a space to name [CONTACT_118748]/aromatherapy diary.
MAT Tool: 
The Antiemesis (MAT) tool created by [CONTACT_118733] (Dranisaris et al., 2017) is a user-friendly and reliable tool 
designed to measure acute and delayed CINV across patients entire chemotherapy 
regimen. The MAT tool is available in English and Spanish languages. The MAT tool 
consists of eight items that assess participants' CINV (i.e., occurrence, duration, and 
frequency). Four items assess the participants' acute phase (i.e., first 24 hours after 
receiving chemotherapy), and the last four items assess the delayed phase (i.e., day 2 to 
day 4 after chemotherapy treatment). The MAT tool has been used as a communication 
tool to facilitate discussions about their CINV to their healthcare providers (Alafafsheh & 
Ahmad, 2016; Molassiotis et al., 2007; Yamaguchi et al., 2009). This MAT tool has 
shown good reliability and validity, with Cronbach alpha of 0.77-0.97 in 1200 patients 
with cancer (Alafafsheh & Ahmad, 2016; Dranisaris et al., 2017; Molassiotis et al., 2007; 
Yamaguchi et al., 2009).
Antiemetic Diary (Arm 1 - Control Only):
The antiemetic diary allows the participants to record their usage (date and time) 
and type (name) of antiemetic medications. Additionally, there is a space to name [CONTACT_39785] 
-       Study #: 20201412        Effective Date: 9/13/2023
Aromatherapy Study IRB # 20201412
Version: # 2 11
complementary methods used to relieve CINV and describe how the CINV was 
controlled in the antiemetic diary.
 
Resilience Scale:
The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) will assess the participants' 
resilience pre and post the intervention (Burns & Anstey, 2010). For this study, we will 
use the 10-item questionnaire that includes questions such as: are you 'able to adapt to 
change,' 'can (you) deal with whatever comes,' to 'can handle unpleasant feelings.' This 
scale has shown good reliability and validity, with Cronbach alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_132561] patients with cancer (Matzka, Mayer, Köck-Hódi, Moses-
Passini, Dubey, Jahn, … & Eicher, 2016; Scali, Gandubert, Ritchie, Soulier, Ancelin, 
Chaudieu, & Uddin, 2012).
 
Psychological Distress Symptoms:
A visual analog scale will be used to assess the patients' psychological distress 
symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression at pre and post-assessment. Three individual 
visual analog scales of anxiety, stress, and depression will be measured on a [ADDRESS_132562] 7-days (Benedetto, & Sheehan, 2014; Labaste et al., 2019; Lesage, Berjot, 
& Deschamps, 2012). The scale ranged from "0" (no anxiety, stress, and depression) to 
"10" (worst anxiety, stress, and depression). Visual analog scale is an accurate and 
sensitive tool to rate subjective symptoms. The visual analog scale has been found to be 
less burdensome for research participants. Studies have demonstrated that visual analog 
scale ratings were a reliable and validated instrument used to assess anxiety, stress, 
depression, and other symptoms, in a variety of patient populations (Benedetto, & 
Sheehan, 2014; Labaste et al., 2019; Lesage, Berjot, & Deschamps, 2012).   
Quality of life:
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy General (FACIT-G) measures 
patients' quality of life and well-being on a 27-item, four dimensions of health: physical, 
functional, social, and emotional well-being (Cella et al., 1993). The study will assess 
the patients' quality of life and well-being at pre and post-assessment timepoints. 
Questions range from 'I am forced to spend time in bed,' 'I feel close to my friends,' 'I 
worry about dying,' to 'I am able to enjoy life.' FACIT-G is a reliable and psychometric 
sound instrument with a Cronbach alpha of >0.89 that has been used in a variety of 
patients with cancer (Cella, 2012; Kin-Fong Cheng, 2006; Thomas, Pendey, Ramdas, 
Sebastian, & Nair, 2004). 
Post-Assessment Questionnaire:
The participants will complete a post-assessment questionnaire on their final 
chemotherapy infusion. The post-assessment will evaluate the study and its 
instruments/tools. Questions range from 'Was the MAT tool easy to use,' 'Was the 
antiemetic diary easy to use,' to 'How likely are you to continue using aromatherapy.' The 
intervention group will be asked additional evaluation questions about the inhaler, the 
effects of the aromatherapy, and comments/suggestions.

10)Data and Specimen Banking*
 This section is not applicable.  This research is not banking data or specimens for 
future use. 
11)Data Management*
Data will be stored and managed in REDCap and SPSS. The data file on 
the shared Box (a password-protected digital encrypted shared drive, a part of the 
University of Miami) will be used for analysis purposes so that all research team 
members have access to the most recent version of the file. 
All data will be collected using study participant de-identified ID numbers 
to protect the confidentiality of participants. All participants will be assigned 
unique alphanumeric numbers as they enroll in the study. No personal identifying 
information will appear on any questionnaires or other material. All participant 
information will be de-identified at the Sylvester location. Likewise, information 
matching the participant number to a name [CONTACT_118749] a password-protected shared Box folder that the study's PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_118715]. All other participants' assessment data will be scanned into a 
password-protected shared Box folder labeled only with participants' ID numbers 
and will be entered into REDCap. REDCap database system will be used to help 
input participant demographics and study-related information.
Standard operating procedures specifying the rules, methods, and 
procedures to follow will be used and checked by [CONTACT_118734]. The 
research team members will be in weekly contact [CONTACT_118735] [INVESTIGATOR_118716] 
(i.e., missing data) and ensure data integrity. The Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_118717]. 
Descriptive analysis will be conducted on demographic (e.g., age and gender) 
variables to report the characteristics of the sample. Pre- and post-assessments will be 
analyzed using paired t-tests for normally distributed continuous data and Wilcoxon 
signed-rank for non-normal continuous data. Chi-Square test of independence will be 
used for categorical data. Additionally, descriptive statistics and qualitative content 
analysis will be used to analyze data regarding ease of study.
1. General Approach
All endpoints will be evaluated using parametric analysis to examine the 
difference between the two conditions across the 3-time points for primary endpoints 
(CINV and Use of Antiemetics) and 2-time points for secondary endpoints (resilience, 
psychological distress, and quality of life). The analysis will be conducted using SPSS 
Version 26. For binary outcomes (CINV), logistic regression will be used. For continuous 
outcomes (antiemetic use, resilience, psychological distress, and quality of life) a Mixed 
ANOVA will be used with condition as the between-subjects variable and change over 
time on the outcome as the within-subjects variable. Sphericity and homogeneity of 
variance assumptions will be tested prior to interpretation of the results, and the

Aromatherapy Study IRB # 20201412
Version: # 2 13
Greenhouse-Geisser correction will be implemented if Sphericity is violated. A type I 
error rate of .05 will be used to determine significance for all analyses. 
Outcome Measure Type of measurement 
CINV MAT Binary
Use of antiemetics Antiemetic Diary Continuous
Resilience CD-RISC Continuous
Psychological Distress Visual Analog Scale Continuous 
Quality of Life FACIT-G Continuous 
2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint(s)
For CINV, logistic regression will be used to determine whether the use of 
aromatherapy decreases the risk for any of the following outcomes: acute nausea, delayed 
nausea, acute vomiting, or delated vomiting. For use of antiemetic medication, a Mixed 
ANOVA will be used to evaluate differences between conditions (aromatherapy group 
vs. treatment as usual) across the 3-time points (Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3). Time x 
treatment effects will be evaluated as well as main effects. 
3. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)
For resilience, psychological distress, and quality of life, a Mixed ANOVA will 
be used to evaluate differences between conditions (aromatherapy group vs. treatment as 
usual) across the 2-time points (Initial visit and final visit). Time x treatment effects will 
be evaluated as well as main effects
4. Baseline Descriptive Statistics 
Participant demographic characteristics will be analyzed using descriptive 
statistics. Specifically, frequencies and percentages will be reported for categorical 
variables, and means and standard deviations will be reported for continuous variables. 
12)Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*
This section is not applicable.  The risks of this study are minimal.

Study Design:  This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group,  
Phase 2b dose -ranging study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
modified -release orismilast compared with placebo in patients aged at least [ADDRESS_87450] dose for subsequent Phase 3 studies.  The study will 
be conducted at approximately 48 centers in Europe and U nited States. 
After a Screening visit up to 28 days before Baseline, approximately 2 10 patients  
will be assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_87451] doses (20 mg, 30 mg, or 40 mg) or placebo twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks, with a 4-w eek 
follow -up visit. Administration will begin at Baseline with a dose titration period  of 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87452]  Version  3.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  7 of 108  up to 2 weeks ’ duration depending on the dose level . The maximum duration of 
study participation for each patient is  approximately 24 weeks.  
Patients  will be seen at the site at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16 (End -of-Treatment visit), and 20 (Follow -up visit, 4  weeks after treatment 
completion or discontinuation). The v isit at Week 1 can be conducted via a 
telemedicine procedure at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who have been diagnosed with moderate  to severe AD  for a minimum of 1 
year (before the Screening visit)  using the Hanifin and Rajka criteria with affected 
BSA of at least 10%, EASI score of at least 16, and IGA -AD grade of at least [ADDRESS_87453] 4 weeks  (at least 2 weeks for high potency  topi[INVESTIGATOR_80114]), or as labeled, or for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_80115].  
At Baseline and at each visit from Week 2 onwards, EASI, affected BSA, and IGA -
AD will be assessed. BSA is defined as all areas with eczematous lesional skin and does not include xerosis (dryness), ichthyosis, keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785], urticaria, infection 
(unless there is underlying eczema), or post  inflammatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]. If 
patients need to manage areas with dry skin and/or pruritus, they are allowed to continue using their current emollient  (however, emollients that contai n 
pharmacologically active ingredients such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, alpha-hydroxy acids, or fruit acids  are not allowed  from the S creening  visit). The severity 
of itch will be assessed by [CONTACT_80176]. Disease symptoms will be assessed by P atient Oriented Eczema 
Measure scores at Baseline and at  the Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 visits. Quality of 
life related to the disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_80177] 8, 16 , and 20 visits.  Pulmonary disease status will be 
assessed in patients with asthma by [CONTACT_80178] 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 visits. The severity of disease will be assessed by P atient 
Global Impression of Severity  and Patient Global Impression of C hange  scores  at 
Baseline and at  the Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 , and 20 visits. In addition,  the sleep 
disturbance NRS and skin pain NRS  will be administered  at Baseline and at  the 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 visits.  
Safety evaluations include medical history, adverse events ( AEs), laboratory and 
vital sign assessments, physical examination including body weight  and height , 12-
lead ECG, and  mood change evaluations by [CONTACT_102] (H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_80116] s core) and suicidal behavior and ideation evaluation by [CONTACT_3786] (C -SSRS). 
Before administration of the stu dy drug at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 16, blood 
will be collected for orismilast and the major human metabolite LEO [ZIP_CODE] PK concentration determination. In addition, noninvasive superficial skin sampling using tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_80117] a targe t lesion (lesional and nonlesional 
skin sample) at Baseline and Week 16 (only lesional skin sample) in all patients for 
proteomic analysis.

This sample size is based on assumptions that there is a difference of 25.0% in the 
percent change from baseline in EASI  scores  between each orismilast dose group 
with placebo , respectively, and  that the common standard deviation in the percent 
change from baseline in EASI  score  is 43%. Using 2-sided 2-sample t -test, 
47 patients in each treatment group (188 in total) will achieve a power of 80% at the 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87462]  Version  3.0

Page  10 of 108  significance level of 5%. To account for an early dropout of approximately 10%, an 
additional 22 patients will be randomized.  
Investigational Therapy:  Name: [CONTACT_80247]: 20 mg (2 × 10-mg tablets), 30  mg 
(1 × 30-mg tablet and 1 placebo tablet), and 40 mg (1 × 10-mg tablet and 1  × 30-mg 
tablet)  
Route and frequency of administration: oral, 2 tablets BID (approximately every 12 
hours)  
Use: experimental  
Sourcing: provided centrally by [CONTACT_80180]: provided in individually labeled wallet cards with blistered 
tablets. Each card will be labeled as required per country requirement.  
Reference Therapy:  Matching placebo tablets  
Treatment Duration:  The Treatment Period for this study is 16 weeks, with a 4 -week Follow -up visit. 
Refer to  Table 2  for the dose titration schedule.  
Pharmacokinetics:  Blood samples for PK analysis of orismilast and its major metabolite levels will be 
collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). The 
actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Pa tients will 
be offered optional participation in specific blood sampling for calculation of PK 
profiles. 
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_80124] a separate laboratory manual.  
The concentration of study drug and main metabolite will be determined from the plasma samples using a validated analytical method. Details of the method 
validation and sample analysis will be included with the final clinical study report.  
Pharmaco dynamics:  Stratum corneum skin samples will be collected  at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 4) using the tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_80125]. Tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a minimally invasive, nonscarring 
approach using serial adhesive films to capture the stratum corneum and the upper 
part of the  granular layer.  
At Baseline, before administration of study drug, 1 lesional and 1 nonlesional area will be identified, and 20 consecutive skin samples will be collected from each area. At Week 16, the same procedure will be repeated only from the same lesional areas 
sampled at Baseline.  
Details of stratum corneum skin samples storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_80124] a separate laboratory manual.  
Statistical Methods and Planned 
Analyses:  Details of the statistical analysis will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  For inferential analyses of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, each 
active treatment group will be compared with the placebo group.  
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are to be assessed in the intent -to-treat 
(ITT) p opulation. Missing data for primary and key secondary endpoints will be 
handled with  the multiple imputation method. For  a categorical efficacy endpoint 
based on a continuous variable, the multiple imputation will be first done for the 
continuous variable, then the category  will be  determined using the imputed values. 
Analyses will be repeated on the per-protocol population f or primary and key 
secondary endpoints.  
When appropriate, the raw parameter, its change from Baseline, and percentage 
change from Baseline will be summarized.  
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87463] square means and the 95% CI of the difference between each active treatment and placebo 
will be calculated. The primary analysis set will be the ITT population with  a 
multiple imputation approach to handle missing values. The same analyses will be repeated backward at earlier visits.  
The key secondary and other b inary endpoints (IGA -AD success, EASI50, EASI75, 
EASI90 , and 4-point improvement in the peak pruritus NRS ) will be analyzed using 
the Mantel -Haenszel (MH) test, comparing each active treatment group with 
placebo in the ITT population . 
For categorical endpoints , the MH procedure,  with ridit scores, will be used; this test 
is the same as the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and enhances the analysis when the parameter is not normally distributed. Graphics will be added to facilitate interpretation. IGA -AD scores/full scale will be analyzed using the MH test and the 
row mean score statistics with the ridit transformation.  
The other continuous secondary endpoints  will be ana lyzed using mixed model for 
repeated measures . 
The above endpoints (EASI changes and percentage changes, IGA -AD success, 
EASI50, EASI75, and EASI90) and the percentage change of BSA will be presented 
graphically over time from Baseline to Week 20. In addition, shift tables will be provided between Baseline and each visit for the IGA -AD distribution. The EASI 
percen tage changes from Baseline will be plotted to identify where the best 
separation between treatments occurs . 
All exploratory endpoints , including change from baseline in pulmonary status NRS 
in patients with asthma and skin biomarker s at Week [ADDRESS_87464] a 2 -point improvement in peak pruritis NRS from baseline will be summarized 
descriptively in the ITT p opulation or a subgroup.  
All safety analyses will be conducted using the safety population. AE data will be 
presented and tabulated according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification. Reported AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_80181], as well as by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT); SOC, PT, and severity; and SOC, PT, an d relationship to study product.  
Laboratory (chemistry , urinalysis  and hematology) parameters , 12-lead ECG  values,  
and vital signs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_80182]. The value at each visit, as well as the change from  Baseline, will be presented.  
The plasma levels of the drug and its metabolites will be summarized descriptively 
by [CONTACT_80183].  
No interim analysis is planned in this study.

Page  20 of 108  4 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background on Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis  (AD)  is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by [CONTACT_80185]. Inflammatory infiltrates in these cutaneous lesions consist of T-lymphocytes, 
neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells ( Cooper KD , 1994). High 
levels  of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 activity are also found in leukocytes of these patients 
(Butler JM , 1983).  AD usually begins in childhood. It is estimated that 50% of patients with AD 
have additional allergy symptoms within the first year of life, and up to 85% have symptoms that 
begin before the age of 5 years . Patients often outgrow the condition in late childhood, with 
approximately 70% of patients experiencing spontaneous remission before adolescence. Early childhood AD, on the other hand, is often the first sign that a child may develop asthma and/or allergic rhinitis (hay fever) later in life  (Spergel JM , 2010). The prevalence of adult AD has been 
reported to range from 2.1% to 4.9% across countries, and  patients with  severe AD represent a 
small proportion of the overall AD population regardless of measure or region ( Barbarot S , 
2018). 
There is a limited number of treatments available for moderate  to severe AD. Current treatments 
include phototherapy ( eg, ultraviolet A  light with or without psoralen, ultraviolet B light 
narrowband or broadband) and systemic immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( eg, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]) ( Slater NA , 2015; Newsom M , 2020). More recently , systemic 
therapy options for moderate to severe AD have increased after the approval of the Janus kinase 
inhibitors baricitinib and upadacitinib and the anti –interleukin ( IL)-13 monoclonal antibody 
tralokinumab ( Bieber T, 2021). 
AD is treated primarily with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], mainly with  intermittent, preventive application of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_80129]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726], paired with daily  emollient use 
(McGregor SP , 2017). Intermittent topi[INVESTIGATOR_80130] -associated  adverse effects like skin atrophy, striae formation in sensitive or thin-
skinned areas, and systemic effects that limit their long -term use  (Hanifin J , 2002).  The rate of 
long- term adherence to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588], however, is low ( Snyder A, 2015). Off-label use of other 
conventional systemic oral immunomodulatory agents, such  as azathioprine and methot rexate, in 
adults with AD can be effective, but patients have reported adverse events (AEs)  or 
ineffectiveness as reasons for discontinuation of treatment; use of these drugs poses well -known 
safety  limitations and requires regular laboratory monitoring  (Roekevisch E, 2018; Sidbury R, 
2014). Moderate to  severe AD is often refractory to first -line topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]; while systemic 
immunosuppressants are efficacious, they have significant adverse effects. The desire for new 
treatments along with an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of AD has spurred the 
development of novel treatments targeting IL- 13, IL -31, and the Janus kinase family of proteins 
(Silverberg JI, 2017). Thus, there is interest in investigating a systemic approach for more severe 
forms of AD.

Page  21 of 108  PDEs  constitute a superfamily of enzymes cataly zing the hydrolysis of the intracellular second 
messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate that 
play key roles in mediating biological responses generated by a variety of extracellular signals. 
Eleven families of PDE enzymes have been identified, with the PDE4 family constituting 
approximately 20 members ( Houslay MD, 2005). PDEs represent the only cellular pathway for 
the degradation of cyclic nucleotides, which emphasiz es their critical role in the regulation of the 
intracellular levels of these secondary messengers and, consequently, various functional 
responses of cells ( Dastidar SG , 2007). PDE4 is a cAMP specific PDE expressed by [CONTACT_80186], including T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, dendritic 
cells, and macrophages ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_28947] D, 2008). In these cells, PDE4 is the predominant PDE form, and 
PDE4 inhibitors increase cAMP levels. High cAMP levels tend to decrease proliferation and 
cytokine production, whereas low concentrations have the opposite effect. In allergic skin 
disease, PDE4 inhibitors inhibit the migration of skin dendritic cells,  and this inhibition is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_80187] 9 activity in  epi[INVESTIGATOR_80131]. 
Furthermore, cytokine secretion ( tumo r necrosis factor [ TNF ]-α, IL -1β and IL -12) of human 
dendritic cells is inhibited by [CONTACT_62506]4 inhibitors, and an inhibition of T cell activation is also  
demonstrated in vitro . Both T helper ( Th)1 and Th2 cytokines are reduced by [CONTACT_62506]4 inhibitors in 
vitro  and in inflamed murine skin ( Jin SL, 2012).  
Inhibition of PDE4 has therapeutic potential in the treatment of psoriasis and other skin diseases 
with an immuno -inflammatory component ( Dastidar SG , 2007). S everal PDE4 -specific 
inhibitors are in late stages of clinical development or have recently been marketed. For example, 
the oral PDE4 inhibitor r oflumilast (Daxas®/Daliresp®) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and 
Europe to reduce the risk of exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
and chronic bronchitis ( Roflumilast Summary of Product Characteristics ). The oral PDE4 
inhibitor apremilast (Otezla®) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe for psoriatic arthritis 
and psoriasis ( Apremilast Summary of Product Characteristics ) and it has been studied for AD 
and other chronic inflammatory disease s (Samrao A , 2012).  Anacor Pharmaceuticals (a 
subsidiary of [COMPANY_007]) has developed a topi[INVESTIGATOR_22732]4 inhibitor for treatment of mild to moderate 
AD (Crisabo role [AN 2728]), which has been approved in the United S tates (under the 
tradename [CONTACT_80248]®) and in E urope (under the tradename [CONTACT_80249]®) (Crisaborole – [COMPANY_007] Adis 
Insight ; Staquis – Assessment Report ). 
One of the key challenges for an effective PDE4 therapy has been the narrow therapeutic window. Most of the programs investigating PDE4 inhibitors failed because of safety issues, up 
until the approval of roflumilast and apremilast some years later. Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80132], primarily but not exclusively, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, characterized by [CONTACT_80188]. These undesired GI effects were consistently observed from the beginning 
of treatment,  and this led to the titration of those drugs (apremilast over [ADDRESS_87476] over 
1 month) to reduce side effects ( Roflumilast Summary of Product Characteristics ; Apremilast 
Summary of Product Characteristics ). 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87477] 
showed a 47% and 36% recovery in skin severity score, respe ctively. This effect was more 
potent than the 25% recovery seen with cyclosporine A, especially in the earlier stages of treatment ( Harada D , 2008).  
An open- label prospective trial of  oral apremilast in [ADDRESS_87478] in AD (Samrao A,  2012). The study showed a trend towards an improvement of AD following 
treatment with apremilast. One cohort consisted of [ADDRESS_87479] 20 mg twice 
daily  (BID) for [ADDRESS_87480] 30 mg BID  for 6  months. Patients  in the study were required to remain on topi[INVESTIGATOR_80133] 0.1% for [ADDRESS_87481] common AE , appeared to be dose related was rated as mild and improved 
over the course of the study in all patients. After 3 months of treatment, a significant reduction of 
itch from baseline and improvement in quality of life (assessed via Dermatology Life Quality Index [ DLQI ] score) was seen in cohort 1 ( P =.02 and P =.003, respectively), while Eczema 
Area and Severity Index (EASI) and DLQI scores improved in cohort 2 ( P =.008 and P  =.01, 
respectively). At 6 months, statistically significant improvement was seen in all outcomes in cohort 2, including the itch visual analog scale ( P =.03), DLQI ( P =.03), and EASI ( P =.002). 
A placebo -controlled study showed only modest efficacy for ora l apremilast 40  mg BID versus 
placebo , which was not seen at the 30 mg BID dose. In addition, there were increased rates of 
AEs (6 cases of cellulitis) in the apremilast 40  mg BID group versus none in the placebo or 
30 mg BID group, and thus, treatment with 40  mg BID was halted in this trial ( Simpson EL, 
2019).  
4.[ADDRESS_87482] is a PDE4 inhibitor currently in Phase 2 of clinical development for oral treatment of  
various inflammatory skin diseases including hidradenitis suppurativa, plaque-type psoriasis, and 
AD. During initial development (Phase 1/2a), different oral formulations were tested in the 
clinic. Because the immediate- release tablet appeared to be less well tolerated compared with the 
drug in capsule formulation, newly developed oral orismilast formulation concepts were tested,  
and a modified- release formulation  was selected for further development. This new formulation 
was shown to improve GI tolerability without change in systemic exposure. 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87483] has been investigated using a panel of 76 G protein coupled 
receptors, 40 kinase assays, and patch- clamp tests with 8 cardiac ion channels, and no effects 
were seen , except some inhibition of the human ether-à-go-go–related gene  ion channel current 
amplitudes at 10 μM. 
The pharmacokinetics ( PK) of orismilast ha ve been investigated in mice, rats, rabbits, and 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_80134]. In rats, the area under the curve (AUC) and 
maximum (or peak) serum concentration (C max) generally increased in proportion to dose in the 
tested range (0.5 to 1.75 mg/kg), with female rats having AUC and C max values 1.5 to 3 times 
higher than those in male rats. In mice, rabbits, and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], AUC and C max increased less than, 
or proportional to, the investigated doses (5 to 500 mg/kg, BID  dosing, and 1.0 to 30 mg/kg, 
respectively), and AUC and C max values were generally comparable in females and males. In a 
minipig telemetry study, mean concentrations increased less than proportionally to the 
investigated doses (1.0 to 10 mg/kg) and were lower in females than in males. There was little or no accumulation in mice, rats, rabbits, or minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Orismilast was excreted mainly via the f eces 
in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. 
The in vitro  plasma protein binding of orismilast was low to moderate (35 % to 67%) in a variety 
of species tested (mouse, rat, rabbit, minipig, and human). The in vitro  metabolism of orismilast 
has been investigated using hepatocytes from mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, minipig, dog, 
marmoset, cynomolgus monkey, and human. The extent of metabolism was generally low. 
In safety pharmacology assessments, the in vitro  asse ssment of the effect on human ether-à-go-
go–related gene tail current recorded from human embryonic kidney-[ADDRESS_87484] produce d no treatment -related  effects on heart rate; body 
temperature (measured in the ear) ; QRS, QT , or QTcR intervals ; or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
morphology. An increase in systolic blood pressure was observed in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_80135] (10 mg/k g). No effect was observed on the central nervous system in a modified Irwin 
test or on respi[INVESTIGATOR_80136].  
The outcome and assessment of nonclinical data showed that neither orismilast (LEO [ZIP_CODE]) nor 
its major metabolite LEO [ADDRESS_87485] battery of 
genotoxicity testing that included in  vitro  Ames  and mouse lymphoma assay testing and in  vivo 
micronucleus testing (LEO [ZIP_CODE]). In addition, reproductive toxicity studies on fertility and early embryonic development, as well as embryo f etal development, have been conducted across 
a range of time courses, dose, and exposure levels in rats, mice, minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and rabbits. The 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87486] proposed clinical dosing regimen of 40 mg  BID 
(80 mg/kg/day). 
Overall, treatment was well tolerated at 1 mg/kg. Refer to the investigator’s brochure for further 
details on orismilast nonclinical studies.  
 Clinical Studies  
As of [ADDRESS_87487] clinical development program consists of 8 completed 
trials  with an oral formulation (including 7 Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects and 1 Phase 2a trial 
in patients  with moderate  to severe plaque-type psoriasis) and 1 Phase 1 trial  with a topi [INVESTIGATOR_4815] . 
Oral program: The completed trials include 2 dose-finding and PK trials using a solution and a capsule formulation (drug in capsule; trials LP0058-S01 and LP0058-1114), a PK trial using a capsule (drug in capsule) and modified- release tabl ets (3 different release profiles; trial 
LP0058-1005), a PK trial in healthy Japanese men using a tablet formulation (immediate- release; 
trial LP0058-1362), a PK trial evaluating the PK and safety/tolerability profiles of several new formulations ( trial LP0058-1442), [ADDRESS_87488] 
immediate -release tablet formulation and midazolam (trials LP0058-1267 and LP0058-1324), 
and a proof-of- concept Phase 2a trial in psoriasis using an immediate -release tabl et formulation 
(trial LP0058-1072). Only one trial (LP0058-1442) used the modified- release tablet selected for 
further development. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_80137]: One Phase 1 proof-of-concept study (LP0108-1082) was conducted in male 
adult patients with mild to moderate AD . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology 
Oral Program  
After single and multiple oral dosing of up to [ADDRESS_87489] was steadily absorbed with a median time drug was present at the maximum concentration in serum (t
max) of [ADDRESS_87490] increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. Estimates of 
elimination half -lives varied across studies, from 4 to 6 hours (for dose levels up to 30 mg 
3 times a day) and up to 10 hours (for the 60-mg BID  dose level). After multiple dosing of up to 
[ADDRESS_87491] 
was observed. Dosing after a high- fat meal delayed t max by 2 hours and increased AUC 0-∞ by 
40% compared with dosing in the fasted state. 
Formation of the human-specific metabolite LEO [ADDRESS_87492]. The disposition of the metabolite mirrored that of 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87493], suggesting formation rate -limited elimination of LEO 40 815. The ratio of metabolite 
to parent compound was relatively constant across doses and upon repeated dosing, indicating 
that systemic exposure to LEO [ZIP_CODE] was approximately 53% to  75% lower than to orismilast.  
The PK profile for the orismilast immediate -release tablet formulation, used in trial 
LP0058--1267, appeared similar to the PK profile for the immediate- release capsule formulation 
used in the first [ADDRESS_87494] between races (LP0058 -1362) or sex (LP0058-1114) has  been identified . 
Data from the LP0058-1324 trial showed that the exposure of midazolam was more than 30% higher when midazolam was administered at steady state (Day 17) after administration of [ADDRESS_87495] BID  compared w ith midazolam alone (geometric means of 132% for AUC
0-t 
and 137% for C max). These results classify  orismilast as a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation from trial LP0058-S01 using an ex vivo cytokine release 
assay indicated that orismilast inhibited the secretion of TNF -α and  interferon  (IFN)-γ. 
Maximum inhibition generally occurred between [ADDRESS_87496] dose . There was no clear 
dose-relationship in the maximal response or duration of inhibitory response. Mean decreases 
from Baseline to Day 7 ranged from approximately 67% to  70% for TNF -α and 52% to  77% for 
IFN- γ levels across dose groups receiving 10, 20, and [ADDRESS_87497] were present.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy in Atopic D ermat itis 
A single- center, prospective, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blinded, intra-individual 
trial was conducted to compare the effect of orismilast cream 20 mg/g and cream vehicle when 
applied BID  for 3 weeks on 2 small treatment areas in adults with mild to moderate AD  
(right/left design, on symmetrically located lesion s). Efficacy assessments were performed at 
baseline, Days 8, 15, and 22 on site  with the primary endpoint being the total sign score (TSS) 
assessed at the End -of-Treatment (EOT) . The TSS was defined as the sum of the individual sign 
scores: erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, excoriations, li chenification , and dryness. 
A total of [ADDRESS_87498] 1 application/dose of orismilast 
cream ; 29 subjects completed the trial ( ie, attended visit 5), but all 30 subjects did complete the 
full treatment period.  The TSS at the end of the treatment was 5.2 ( least squares  [LS] mean: 5.1) 
for orismilast cream 20 mg/g and 6.2 (LS mean: 6.3) for the cream vehicle. This corresponds to a 
reduction in disease severity (TSS) of approximately 39% in the orismilast cream 20 mg/g 
treatment and of approximately 25% for the vehicle treatment. The vehicle- effect subtracted 
difference in LS means accounted to -1.2 (95% CI ranging from -2.2 to -0.3), providing evidence for a statistically significant difference ( P =.014) between both treatments. This result was 
confirmed by [CONTACT_80189]. The administration of orismilast cream 20  mg/g was found to be safe and well tolerated in  patients with  AD. No clinically

biochemistry, urinalysis) were detected.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  in O ther Dermatological Disorders  
To date,  1 efficacy trial (LP0058 -1072) with orismilast immediate -release tablets has been 
completed. A total of 36 patients  with moderate  to severe plaque-type psoriasis were randomized 
in the trial in a 1:[ADDRESS_87500] or placebo , administered orally 
as 3 tablets BID  for 16 weeks (1-week dose escalation followed by 15-w eek full dose treatment).  
After 16 weeks of treatment, the mean P soriasis A rea and S everity Index (PASI) score (primary 
endpoint) was statistically significantly lo wer in patients  treated with orismilast tablets ( LS 
mean: 7.1) compared with patients  in the placebo group ( LS mean: 13.1). Mean PASI at entry 
was 14.9. A higher proportion of patients  achieved a 75% improvement in PASI in the orismilast 
group (44.4%) v ersus placebo (5.6%; P  =.019). In addition, treatment success (defined as clear 
or almost clear) according to Physician’s Global Assessment of disease severity at Week [ADDRESS_87501] group (7 of 18 patients , 38.9%) than in the placebo group (1 of 18 
patients , 5.6%). The estimated itch score was numerically lower at Week  [ADDRESS_87502] 
group ( LS mean: 3.4) compared with the placebo group ( LS mean:  5.7). 
Approximately half of the patients  in both treatment groups were withdrawn from the 
LP0058-[ADDRESS_87503] on the estimated efficacy, it was not considered to disqualify the clear difference observed 
between the 2 treatments.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  
Extent of Exposure 
As of [ADDRESS_87504] (up to 16 weeks). Only 1 study examined the new modified- release formulation in 63 healthy subjects (see Section 
4.3). 
Safety Profile  
Orismilast administered as capsules was safe and well tolerated in single doses up to [ADDRESS_87505] was moderately well tolerated in multiple doses up to 50 mg BID, after 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87506] tablets (30 mg BID) were poorly tolerated in patients with moderate  to severe plaque-type psoriasis. AEs leading to withdrawal from the trial 
were reported for 50% of the patients in the orismilast group compared with 16.7% in the placebo group. In the orismilast group, the majority of withdrawals were due to GI disorders. 
A total of 5 serious A Es (SAEs) were reported across all trials; [ADDRESS_87507] group 
had 1 SAE each (ureterolithiasis, considered not related to the treatment, and erysipelas on the arm, considered possibly related to the treatment), and 1 patient in the placebo group had 1 SAE (“condition aggravated”, relating to pre- existing  Scheuermann's disease and considered not 
related to the treatment). In the LP0058-1324 trial, 1 patient-reported SAEs (abdominal pain and abdominal cramps, considered possibly related to the treatment). 
The reported AEs  were consistent with reports from o ther PDE4 inhibitors with nausea, diarrhea 
and headache being the most frequently side effects reported . Most  nonserious AEs were of mild 
intensity and considered possibly or probably related to orismilast. Generally, the incidence, 
frequency, and severity of AEs increased with increasing doses of orismilast. The most 
frequently reported orismilast- related AEs were GI disorders (particularly nausea and diarrhea), 
nervous system disorders (particularly headache and dizziness), and musculoskeletal and connect ive tissue disorders (particularly back pain). The GI  tolerance appears to be improved 
with titration and low -fat meals.  
Data from 2
nd generation modified release tablet from the unblinded phase 2 trial UNI50001-203 
(under reporting) in psoriasis indicate that the side effect profile of orismilast, with diarrhoea, nausea and headache, is similar to the two marketed oral PDE4 -inhibitors (apremilast, 
roflumilast). The majority of these adverse events had an onset during the initial [ADDRESS_87508] 40 mg 
group had self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent at week 16. No deaths or serious 
infections were reported in UNI50001-203.

 Common PDE -4inhibition related side effects  
Data from 2nd generation modified release tablet from the unblinded phase 2 trial UNI50001-
203 (under reporting) in psoriasis indicate that the side effect profile of orismilast, with diarrhoea, nausea and headache, is similar to the two marketed oral PDE4 -inhibitors (apremilast, 
roflumilast). The majority of these adverse events had an onset during the initial [ADDRESS_87510] ( Tello ED ).  
Occurrence and severity of GI disorders will be identified by [CONTACT_80190], abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. Depending on their severity, these adverse events may qualify as an AE of 
special interest ( AESI ). On the basis of the occurrence of GI or other AEs considered  to have a 
causal relationship with study treatment, the Investigator might consider decreasing the daily dosing regimen or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80138] a few days, until recovery (see Section 8.3.1). 
 Monitoring of Cardiovascular, P sychiatric, H epatic, and M etabolic R isks 
In the unblinded phase 2 trial UNI50001-203 (under reporting) in psoriasis, s even cases of 
elevated ALT were observed , and one patient in the orismilast 40 mg group had self-injurious 
behavior without suicidal intent at week 16. No deaths or serious infections were reported in UNI50001-203. Hepatic laboratory parameter s will be monitored. A ll patients  will be monitored 
for any cardiovascular manifestations using vital signs and 12- lead ECG at scheduled visits. 
Drug class potential effects , such as weight loss and major depression, will be monitored during 
the study. Patients  with major depression, presenting major psychiatric disorders or at risk for 
suicide will be excluded from enrollment, and suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms will be assessed in the course of the study by [CONTACT_48649]- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) and 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS), res pectively.  Patients will be informed of the 
potential increased risk of depression or suicidal thoughts of this class of drugs, and 
recommended to promptly contact [CONTACT_80191]. 
 Tape S trippi[INVESTIGATOR_80139], theoretically, include the rare possibility of an allergic 
reaction to the tape or a skin infection. The risk of skin infection is extremely low because only superficial skin layers are removed. A bandage could  be applied to the area of tape strip pi[INVESTIGATOR_80140]. 
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] C urrent T reatment  
Risks associated with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80141]-prohibited medications/procedures may include worsening of the condition being treated and will be reported as such. In an effort to 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87511] difficulty tolerating 
periods without medication/procedure will be excluded from participating in the study, per 
exclusion criteria  (see Section  7.2). If patients  need to manage areas with dry skin and/or 
pruritus, they are allowed to continue using their current emollient. However, emollients that contain pharmacologically active ingredients such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, alpha-hydroxy acids, or fruit acids are not allowed from the Screening visit. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of orismilast may be found in the recent version of the investigator’s brochure.  
4.[ADDRESS_87512] demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis and/or AD, with 2 drugs having reached 
the market: apremilast, a n oral agent for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis, and crisaborole, a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_80142]. Orismilast is a novel PDE4 inhibitor being developed for 
the oral treatment of  moderate to  severe AD that requires a systemic therapeutic approach . 
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 different dose levels (20 mg, 
30 mg, or 40 mg) of orismilast versus placebo  administered orally BID over a period of 16 weeks 
in patients with moderate to  severe AD . Efficacy and  patient  outcome will be assessed through a 
set of validated measures for AD. In addition, safety, PK , and PD evaluations will be conducted. 
The results of the study will inform the design and the dose level(s) of the subsequent Phase 3 program. 
 Dose Rationale 
The modified- release formulation was studied in 1 clinical trial (LP0058 -1442) and administered 
in a total of 36 healthy volunteers: 18 in part 1, 9 in part 2, and 9 in part 3. Twenty-seven (27) healthy volunteers received a single administration of [ADDRESS_87513] declined  in a generally biphasic manner for both formulations with 
geometric mean terminal half -life (t 1/2) values of 6.48 and 6.67 hours for the modified- release 
tablet and immediate -release capsule, respectively. With a geometric mean value of 507 ng.h/mL 
for AU C0-∞, systemic exposure to orismilast following administration of the modified -release 
tablet was comparable to the one of the immediate -release capsules (506 ng.h/mL). Statistical 
analyses comparing key PK parameters of orismilast for both formulations did not show any 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87514], and there were no deaths or SAEs during any part of 
the trial. A total of 113 AEs were reported: [ADDRESS_87515] or above. Nausea was reported in 5 subjects receiving LEO [ZIP_CODE], with the majority of events occurring at the 60 mg dose level. Only 2 participants experienced nausea at a dose equal or lower to 40 mg, and these side effects lasted approximately 1 day before spontaneously 
disappearing, despi[INVESTIGATOR_80143]- titration being maintained. 
It was thus concluded that 40 mg BID was the maximal tolerated dose with 30 mg BID being the 
target dose for further development.

be further evaluated in a Phase 3 program.

[LOCATION_002] . 
After a Screening visit up to 28 days before Baseline, approximately 210 patients  will be 
assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_87520] doses (20 mg, 30 mg, or 40 mg) or placebo BID for 16 weeks, with a 4- week follow- up visit. Administration will begin at 
Baseline with a dose titration period  of up to 2 weeks ’ duration depending on the dose level. The 
maximum duration of study participation for each patient  is approximately 24 weeks. 
Patients will be seen at the site at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 ( EOT  
visit), and 20 (Follow-up visit, 4 weeks after treatment completion or discontinuation). The v isit 
at Week 1 can be conducted via a telemedicine procedure at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Patients  who have been diagnosed with moderate to  severe AD for a minimum of 1 year (before 
the Screening visit) using the Hanifin and Rajka criteria with affected BSA of at least 10%, EASI score of at least  16, and IGA -AD grade of at least [ADDRESS_87521] 4 weeks  (at least 2 weeks for high potency 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]), or as labeled , or for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_80145]. 
At Baseline and at each visit from Week 2 onwards, E ASI, affected BSA, and IGA -AD will be 
assessed. BSA is defined as all areas with eczematous lesional skin and does not include xerosis 
(dryness), ichthyosis, keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785], urticaria, infection (unless there is underlying eczema), or 
post inflammatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]. If patients need to manage areas with dry skin and/or pruritus, they are allowed to continue using their current emollient. However, emollients that contain pharmacologically active ingredients such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, alpha-hydroxy acids, or fruit acids are not allowed from the Screening visit. The severity of itch will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_80176]. D isease 
symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_80192] 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 
visits . Quality of life related to the disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_80193] 8, 16, and 20 visits. Pulmonary disease status will be assessed in patients with asthma by 
[CONTACT_80194] 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 visits. The severity of 
disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_80195] 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 
and 20 visits. In addition, the sleep disturbance NRS and skin pain NRS will be administered  at 
Baseline and at  the Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 visits.

SSRS).  
Before administration of the study drug at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 16, blood will be collected for orismilast and the major human metabolite LEO [ZIP_CODE] for PK concentration determination. In addition, noninvasive superficial skin sampling using tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_80146] a target lesion (lesional and  nonlesional skin sample) at Baseline and Week 16  
(only lesional skin sample) in all patients for proteomic analysis. See Figure [ADDRESS_87523] outcome data for comparisons between placebo and  treatment doses . 

UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87524] was shown to improve the GI tolerance and overall acceptability of 
the drug ( Zerilli, 2015). Sim ilarly, a slow increase in orismilast dose was associated with fewer 
GI side effects when compared with a rapid increase. Consistent with this approach, this study 
will titrate the study treatment dose over a period  of maximum 2 weeks. If tolerability issues 
arise during the treatment or titration period, a short dose reduction is allowed . For a detailed 
titration schedule, refer to Section 8.3.1. 
AD is a chronic condition requiring long-term therapy. Primary efficacy assessments of AD 
clinical trials are usually performed at 12 or 16 weeks after initiation of study treatment. Because 
of the initial titration period of up to 3 weeks’ duration, a treatment duration of 16 weeks, with the primary endpoint being evaluated at this time point, is therefore considered the optimal strategy for this study. A 16- week t reatment period was also dee med acceptable for the placebo 
arm because AD is not a life  threatening disease warranting immediate treatment.  A follow-up 
period is established after the end of the treatment period to assess efficacy and safety , including 
risk of rebound AD (see Section 6.3). 
In addition to the AD assessments of the E ASI, IGA -AD, BSA, peak  pruritus  NRS , PGIS, PGIC, 
sleep disturbance NRS,  and skin pain NRS, the effects of study treatment on  the pulmonary 
status  and course of the disease in patient s with a sthma will be explored. A number of patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) will be administered to explore the patient ’s perception of his or her 
condition and the related quality of life, as recommended by [CONTACT_17513]. This 
comprehensive evaluation of the AD condition of patients will contribute to the selection of the 
most suitable dose for the Phase [ADDRESS_87525].  
6.3 Follow- up Period  
A follow-up period is established after the end of the treatment period to assess efficacy, safety , 
and the risk of rebound ( ie, flaring with worse severity than before treatment). During the follow-
up period, no other treatments are permitted, except topi [INVESTIGATOR_39669]  (between  the EOT  and the 
follow- up visit). If the investigator determines that additional treatment must be initiated during 
the follow-up period, the patient will end participation in the trial and the last  follow-up visit 
should be performed  before adding new treatment and withdrawing the patient from the trial. 
If the patient is withdrawn because of  initiation o f a nonallowed treatment, as described above, 
the patient will be considered a study completer if the full 16- week  treatment period is 
completed , including the follow-up visit upon initiation of the nonallowed treatment .

Page  41 of 108  7.3 Rescreening  
Individuals who sign the ICF to participate in the study but who do not subsequently meet all the 
requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and therefore do not enroll (screen failures) may be rescreened. Such individuals may be allowed to rescreen up to one timet 
the investigator’s discretion (period from screen failure  to re screen ing to be determined by [CONTACT_1275]). If re screening  is performed, the individual must sign a new ICF and will be 
assigned a new identification number. Additionally, all screening procedures must be conducted 
at rescreen ing to ensure all eligibility criteria are met . 
7.4 Treatment  Discontinuation and Withdrawal 
An additional 22 patients will be randomized to account for a n estimated  early dropout rate of 
approximately 10%. 
If a patient  discontinues study treatment prematurely  or is withdrawn from the study for any 
reason, the study site must immediately notify the M edical Monitor. The date and the reason for 
treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal must be recorded on the electronic case report 
form (e CRF ). Patients  who discontinue treatment  prematurely  will be asked  to complete the 
assessments corresponding to W eek [ADDRESS_87537] the assessments corresponding to the Week 20 
assessments done  (Table 4). If possible and deemed safe by [CONTACT_093], the patient should 
thereafter be offered to stay in the trial with no treatment and complete study visits as planned. If a patient withdraws from the study, attempts  should be made to  have him or her return to the 
study site within [ADDRESS_87538] adminis tration of study drug to complete follow-up visit 
assessments.  
In the event that a patient  discontinues treatment  prematurely because of  a TEAE or serious 
TEAE ,this  will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or 
stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_80196]. The 
patient will also be asked to return to the study site for the follow-up visit within [ADDRESS_87539] the assessments corresponding to the Week 20 assessments done  (Table 4). 
Once withdrawn from the study, the patient  cannot re -enter the study. 
A patient  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following circumstances : 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE 
• patient  withdrawal of consent: at any time, a patient’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request or on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgment.  The 
reason for patient  withdrawal will be noted on the e CRF  
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87540]  Version  3.0

Page  42 of 108  • intercurrent illness: a con dition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the patient ’s termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes in the patients’  condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• patient  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements ( eg, drug noncompliance, failure to 
return for defined number of visits) 
• lost to follow-up: the patient  stopped coming for visits, and study personnel were unable 
to contact [CONTACT_102]

8.1 Details of Study Treatments  and Dosage Schedule  
The s tudy treatment is formulated as modified -release tablets  (10 mg and 30 mg) or placebo 
tablets for oral administration . Tablets should be taken in the morning and in the evening, 
approximately every [ADDRESS_87542] dose of the study drug should be taken in the evening of Day 1 (Baseline visit) . 
PK studies have shown no difference in PK properties whether the product is taken under fasted 
condition or with a low -fat meal. Intake with a high- fat meal leads to a higher incidence of GI 
side effects and should therefore be avoided. Refer to Table [ADDRESS_87543]  Placebo

8.2 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  and Blinding  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At the investigational site, each screened patient will be assigned a patient identifier number 
during Screening that will be used on all patient documentation. The patient identifier number 
will contain the site number and the patient number and will be assigned in numerical order at the Screening visit on the basis of chronological order of Screening dates ( eg, 01-010 for the 
10th patient screened at Site No. 01). 
Randomization will occur before the first study treatment administration, at the Baseline visit. 
Patients  will be assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_87546] dose groups (20 mg, 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87547]  Version  3.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  44 of 108  30 mg, or 40 mg) or placebo. All patients will be assigned to randomized study treatment using 
an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).  Further guidance and information can be obtained 
in the study manual. 
 Blinding  
To facilitate the double  blind ing, the tablets will be packaged in the same type of blister , and the 
active and placebo tablets will have the same appearance (in terms of size, form, weight, and color). One dose consists of 2 identical tablets (a 10-mg or 30- mg orismilast tablet or a matching 
placebo  tablet ). 
Before the study is initiated, each site will be provided with an email address and/or telephone number as well as call -in directions for the log-in information and IWRS directions. 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of patient safety. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining whether unblinding of a patient ’s 
treatment assignment is warranted. Patient  safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_80198] a 
patient ’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient . If a 
patient ’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Investigator should promptly inform the Medical 
Monitor and  the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_87548] be fully documented in the 
source document and eCRF. The primary reason for discontinuation (the event or condition that 
led to the unblinding) will be recorded, as applicable.  Also, documentation of breaking the blind 
should be recorded using the IWRS with the date/time and reason why the blind was broken and the names of the personnel involved. 
The patient for whom the blind has been broken will be discontinued from the study and undergo 
the procedures  for pre mature treatment discontinuation. 
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4). Returned study drug should not be redispensed to the patients . 
The Sponsor ’s safety staff may unblind the study drug assignment for any patie nt with an SAE. 
If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to 1 or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report identifying the patient ’s study drug assignment may be sent to investigators 
in accordance with local regulations and/or Sponsor policy. 
8.3 Planned Dosing S chedule and A djustments  
If GI or other AEs considered probably or definitely related to the study drug are reported with a 
sev
erity not compatible with maintaining the treatment as per -protocol, the Investigator might 
consider temporarily decreasing the dosage regimen, as described in S ection 8.3.2 and 
Section  8.3.3.

maintained and reconciled with study drug and compliance records. Study drug administration

8.[ADDRESS_87552] be recorded, along with:  
• Reason for use 
• Dates of administration , including start and end dates 
• Dosage information, including dose and frequency 
Patients may take any medication that is not restricted by [CONTACT_80200]. Chronic medication should be dosed on a stable regimen . 
 Emmolients  
Emollients can be used at patient discretion for managing dry skin on noneczematous areas or for 
reducing pruritus on eczematous areas. The use of emollients is to be recorded as concomitant 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87553] already used  (and that they tolerated well) and refrain from initiating treatment with a 
new emollient.  Emollients that contain pharmacologically active ingredients such as lactic acid, 
salicylic acid, urea, alpha -hydroxy acids, or fruit acids are not allowed from the Screening visit. 
 Supportive T reatment for S ide E ffects  
Over the course of this trial, additional medications may be required to manage adverse events 
from trial treatment. At the discretion of the Investigator antiemetic or anti- diarrheic 
medications, or mild analgesics  for headaches, may be administered. This  approach is well 
established for other PDE4-inhibitors, and described by [CONTACT_80201]. 2021 In brief : 
The common PDE 4-inhibition related side effect of secretory  diarrhea is due to stimulation of the 
CFTR, a fluid transporter in the intestine. Usually, the diarrhea  transforms to lo ose stools instead 
of diarrhea  within a couple of weeks, but initial medical treatment with anti- diarrheic 
medications, e.g. loperamide, may support the patient during treatment initiation.     
The common PDE4- inhibition related side effect of nausea is related to  delayed  gastric 
emptying, thus also related to  large meals and energy dense meals. The patients should be 
advised to adjust their meals to be smaller and less fatty and less sugary and drink more water. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_80150], temporary use of antiemetic medications, e.g. metoclopramide, may support 
the patient during treatment initiation.  
The advice to use mild analgesics (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid /aspi[INVESTIGATOR_80151]/acetaminophen  
and NSAIDs ) for the common PDE4-inhibition related side effect of hea dache may support the 
patient during treatment initiation .  
 Restricted  Medications  
Restricted prior therapi [INVESTIGATOR_80152] 3. In addition, patients with any prior treatment 
with orismilast or failure of treatment for AD  with apremilast or any other systemic PDE4 
inhibitor are ineligible.

The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_80202].  
 
 Drug -Drug Interactions  
From clinical studies, orismilast can be considered a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and 
concomitant use of orismilast with CYP3A4 substrates may increase the systemic exposure to 
these medicinal products . Patients receiving orismilast concurrently with these medicinal 
products should be monitored for related AEs, especially if they have a narrow therapeutic 
window. Refer to the following link for examples of clinical inhibitors for P450- mediated 
metabolis ms: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug- interactions -labeling/drug-development- and-drug-
interactions -table -substrates-inhibitors- and-inducers#table3-2. 
In vitro orismilast is a competitive direct inhibitor of CYP2D6. Concomitant use of orismilast with other drugs mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_80203]2D6 has not been studied clinically. 
Because of a potential increase of systemic exposure to medicinal products metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]2D6 when concomitantly administered with orismilast, patients should be monitored f or 
AEs related to these medicinal products. Coadministration of drugs with a narrow therapeutic 
index, such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine) or type 1C antiarrhythmics (propafenone, flecainide , and encainide) is prohibited 
(see Table 3).

Page  54 of 108  10 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
Assessors must be trained and certified by [CONTACT_80204]’s assessments. The same assessor should perform all evaluations for the same 
patient at Baseline and Week  16. 
10.1 Investigator Assessments 
 Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is an investigator-assessed instrument measuring the severity of clinical signs and the 
percentage of affected BSA in patients with AD. The EASI is a composite scoring system used 
by [CONTACT_80205], induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions, with adjustment for the percentage of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body ( Hanif in JM, 2001). 
EASI  scores  range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. E rythema, 
induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification are scored on a scale of 0 ( absent ) to 
3 (severe) for each  body region: head and neck, upper limbs (including the external axillae and 
hands), trunk (including the internal  axillae and  groin), and lower limbs (including the buttocks 
and feet ). The extent of affected skin in each body region is scored on a scale of 0 (no 
involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The EASI assessment will exclude  the scalp, 
palms, and soles from scoring. 
 The Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis  
The IGA -AD is a measure used by [CONTACT_80206] a patient ’s overall severity of disease. 
The static version is used in this trial for measurement at a single point in time , as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 4). The Inve stigator will rate the severity of the patient ’s AD 
on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) ( Simpson E, 2020).  
 Body Surface Area  
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin affected by [CONTACT_80207] a 
percentage of total BSA . BSA will be determined by [CONTACT_80208] ’s hand ( palm + fingers)  = 1% BSA rule.

This document is confidential.  
Page  55 of 108  10.2 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
 Peak  Pruritus  Numerical Rating Scale 
The severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD will be assessed using a horizontal 11-point NRS. 
Patients  will be asked to assess their “worst itching due to AD over the past 24 hours” on an 
NRS anchored by [CONTACT_80209] “no itching” (0) and “worst possible itching” (10). 
The item will be completed  at each visit  via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device from baseline through Week 20. 
 Skin Pain Numerical Rating Scale 
The skin pain NRS is a patient-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, 
with 0 representing "no pain" and 10 representing "wor st pain imaginable." Overall severity of a 
participant's skin pain is indicated by [CONTACT_80210] 24 hours. 
The item will be completed  at each visit  via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device from baseline through Week 20. 
 Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale  
The sleep disturbance NRS is a scale used by [CONTACT_80211]. Patients will be a sked the following question in their local language: how would 
you rate your sleep last night? On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no sleep loss related to 
signs/symptoms of AD” and 10 being “I cannot sleep at all because of  the signs/symptoms of 
AD”. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. 
The item will be completed  at each visit  via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device from baseline through Week 20. 
 Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The POEM is a [ADDRESS_87565] week. All answers carry 
equal weight, with a total possible score ranging from 0 to 28. A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life . 
The item will be completed  at each visit  via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
at the patient’s own electronic device from baseline through Week [ADDRESS_87566] 24 hours. The 5 categories of responses are (0) “no symptoms", (1) “very mild", (2) “mild", (3) “moderate", and (4) “severe."

Page  56 of 108  The item will be completed  at each visit  via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device from baseline through Week 20 except Week 1. 
 Patient Global Impression of Change Scale 
The PGIC scale measures change in clinical status  of AD . The PGIC is based on a 7-point scale, 
and the patient will rate the change from the start of treatment as  1 “very much improved,” 2 
“much improved,” 3 “ minimally improved, ” 4 “no change,” 5 “ minimally worse, ” 6 “much 
worse, ” and 7 “very much worse.” 
The item will be completed  at each visit via an application on an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patien t’s own electronic device from baseline through Week [ADDRESS_87568] of skin disease on the patient ’s quality of life during the previous week. The 10 questions 
cover the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: symptoms; embarrassment ; interference with shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80155], cloth ing choices , social and leisure activities , sport s participation , work or study, close 
relationsh ips, and sex ; and treatment. Each question is scored from 0 to 3 (“not at all,” “a little,” 
“a lot,” and “very much,” respectively), giving a total score ranging from 0 to 30. A high score is 
indicative of a poor quality of life . 
The item will be completed  at each visit via an application on  an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device at  baseline and  Weeks 8, 16, and 20. 
 Pulmonary Status Numerical Rating Scale in Patients with Asthma  
Pulmonary disease status will be assessed in patients with asthma using a horizontal NRS. 
Patients  will be asked to assess their “symptoms due to asthma  over the past 7  days” on an NRS 
anchored by [CONTACT_80209] (0) “no symptoms ” and (10) “very bad symptoms”.  
The item will be completed at each visit via an application on  an electronic device in the clinic or 
the patient’s own electronic device at  baseline and  Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

Page  57 of 108  11 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments ( medical history, vital signs  and body weight, physical examinations, ECGs , 
clinical laboratory results [routine hematology, urinalysis and biochemistry], HADS, C -SSRS, 
and AEs ) are to be performed at protocol-specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 4).  
11.1 Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening. Investigators should document the occurrence, 
signs, and symptoms of the patie nt’s pre -existing conditions, including any psychiatric treatment 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], covering all prior significant illnesses  up to and including [ADDRESS_87570] dosing (Visit 1) , are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history 
will include medications, alcohol consumption and smoking history, if applicable. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study, and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study, are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 11.8.1. 
All changes not present  at Baseline or described in the past medical history (last 6 months) and 
identified as clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all patients and include date of birth or age 
according to applicable regulations, sex, ethnicity, etc. 
11.2 Vital Signs  and Body Weight 
Vital signs (body temperature [measured in the ear] , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 4 ). All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been resting in a 
sitting position for at le ast 5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same 
arm for the duration of the study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital signs are recorded; height (without shoes) will be recorded at Baseline only. A weight red uction 
of least 5% from baseline should be reported as a TEAE. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out- of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], or heart rate measurements will be repeated 
at the Investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements 
must be recorded as AEs on the eCRF.  
11.3 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (a check of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lu ngs; 
abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and musculoskeletal systems) will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and Week 16. A limited physical examination will be conducted at Day 1 and Week s 4, 8, 12, and 20 to verify continued patient eligibility and 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87571]  Version  3.0

Page  58 of 108  to follow-up regarding any change in medical history. Physical examinations will be performed 
by a physician at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). 
11.4 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be conducted at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4).  
At Screening, the I nvestigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that 
could exclude the patient from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal results will be recorded; if the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the e CRF , 
and the ECG will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  
11.5 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table 5) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the

Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory facility. Urine samples will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_80212] , and a microscopic analysis will be performed if the results of 
dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated. All la boratory reports must be 
reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_093]. A legible copy of all reports must be filed with both the patients’  eCRF and medical record (source document) for that visit. Any laboratory test 
result considered by [CONTACT_80213] (clinically significant AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant 
abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to 
normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
11.6 The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80156] a PRO, comprises 7 questions for anxiety and 7 questions for depression, with each answer being graded from 0 to 3 with a higher score indicating a worse condition. For each 
group of questions, scores of 7 or less  indicate cases without anxiety  or depression, whereas  
scores of  8 to 10, 11 to 14, and 15 to 21 indicate mild, mo derate, and severe cases, respectively. 
The HADS is one of the tools recommended by [CONTACT_80214]. 
Any patient with a score for de
 pressive symptoms ≥  [ADDRESS_87573] (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) for further evaluation.  After a 
mental health specialist evaluation, the final decision on restarting or permanently discontinuing 
study treatment will be at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the mental health 
specialist. These cases should be reported as an AESI. Refer to Section  11.8.2.  
11.7 The
 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS, Investigator-administered version, was designed to provide a prospective, 
standardized measure of suicidality. The scale allows clinicians and researchers alike to assess 
the severity and lethality of suicidal behaviors and ideations and can be used to monitor 
treatment outcomes and establish suicide risk in a variety of research and clinical settings. Requiring approximately 5 minutes  for completion, the C- SSRS is administered in the form of a 
clinical interview.

This document is confidential.  
Page  60 of 108  This C -SSRS is available in 2 versions: [ADDRESS_87575] of the study referring to the time since the prior visit. 
If at screening or b aseline there are “yes” answers on item 4 or 5, the patient will not be included 
in the study.  Any patient  with a positive response at subsequent visits (answers “yes” to questions 1-5) should 
be referred to a mental health specialist (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) for further 
evaluation, and the study medication should be paused. After a mental health specialist 
evaluation, the final decision on restarting or permanently discontinuing study treatment will be 
at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the mental health specialist. These cases should be reported as an AESI. Refer to Section  11.8.2. 
11.8 Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected throughout the study as shown in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4).  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspec ted cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at screening will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the patient  enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical 
condition should be reported in the patient ’s medical history. 
Any AEs that occur before dosing at  Baseline will be categorized as pretreatment events. TEAEs 
will be defined as those AEs that occur or worsen in severity after initial dosing and up to [ADDRESS_87576] dose of study drug. 
Patients will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached. 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient  gives informed consent until the follow-up visit. Follow-up of the AE, even after 
the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the in vestigator.

This document is confidential.  
Page  61 of 108  When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
All AE s must be graded by [CONTACT_80215] ( CTCAE ) grading system version 5.0 ( CTCAE - Version 5.0) with reference 
to the unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE in the guidance document. Please see 
Table 6 for se lected  u nique clinical  descriptions of severity of AEs . Only if an AE is not 
uniquely described in the CTCAE grading system, the general guidance for classification is to be 
used. Please see Table 7 for the general guideline for classification .  
If a patient experiences a TEAE assessed as Grade 3 or higher using the unique clinical 
descriptions of severity (Grade 2 or higher for the SOC of cardiac disorders) according to 
CTCAE version 5, the patient should be permanently discontinued from the study drug and not 
receive additional doses.   
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_80216] g iven i n Table 6 and  Table 7 and 
relationship to study drug are given in Table 8.

Page  63 of 108  Table 8. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_80217]:  This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY:  This categor y applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test drug but for 
which no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or 
when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a r easonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY:  This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_13935]’  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
PROBABLY:  This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels with a high degree of certainty 
are related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_80218]’  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the 
drug, yet drug- relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow  depression, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
DEFINITELY:  This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to 
test drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_80219]’  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with re -exposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a  known 
pattern of response to the test drug.

 Adverse E vents of Special Interest  (AESI)  
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical concern, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_10549]. AESIs must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or when the Investi gator becomes aware 
of the event, following SAE reporting procedures ( Section 11.8.4).  Such an event might require 
further investigation to  characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, 
rapid communication by [CONTACT_13659] (eg, regulators) might also be warranted.  
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87588]  Version  3.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  64 of 108  In this trial, the following AEs are to be considered AESI: 
• any AE of occurrence of suicidal ideation or behavior, including a positive response to 
question 1 to 5 of C- SSRS, 
• a depression assessed as moderate or worse by [CONTACT_1720] a score ≥ 15 in the 
HADS score , 
• any grade 3 or higher psychiatric condition, and/or  
• any of the following GI TEAEs: vomiting, diarrhea with an increase of at least 4 stools per day over baseline (Grade 2 CTCAE) for at least 3 days . 
• any signal that may arise from Sponsors ongoing safety  review  during t he trial  that may 
need closer monitoring. 
 Serious Adverse Events  
An S AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life  threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , and/or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life  threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the patient  and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SA Es are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the I nvestigator believes that an event is ser ious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study, or within 
[ADDRESS_87589] be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or when the I nvestigator becomes aware of the event. Notification can be made using the 
dedicated fax line or email  for the Syneos Health  Safety and Pharmacovigilance group:

UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87590] report all additional follow -up 
evaluations to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the additional information or as soon as is  practicable. All SAEs will be 
followed up until the Investigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved. Any SAE that is not resolved by [CONTACT_80221] ’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study drug or procedures. 
 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
• serious 
• unexpected (ie , the event is not consistent with the safety information in the investigator’s 
brochure) 
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study treatment 
The Investigator will assess whether an event  is causally related to study treatment. Syneos 
Health will consider the Investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event meets the 
criteria for being reportable as a [ADDRESS_87591] be reported to the regulatory authorities and the independent ethics committee

required to be reported in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within 
specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within 
the applicable timeframes.  
 Pregnancy  
WOCBP  must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and are required to use 1 of the 
highly effective contraception methods ( listed in Inclusion Criterion 8). Women on hormone 
replacement therapy, and whose menopausal status is in doubt, will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods. Highly effective contraception is defined as having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label.  
Women of nonreproductive potential are defined as those with surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]) and those in a postmenopausal status, defined as cessation of menses for at least [ADDRESS_87594] 24  consecutive months without an alternative medical cause. 
After administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female pa tients will be 
reported until the patient completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to Syneos Health Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_87595] possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify Syneos 
Health  Safety  and Pharmacovigilance of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up 
pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous or therapeutic abortion 
(any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_29658]/ema iling a 
completed pregnancy report form to Syneos Health and Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_87596] to discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.

plasma levels , patients  will be offered optional participation in  specific blood sampling for 
calculat ion of PK profile s. This additional procedure is voluntary for patients  and a separate 
informed consent will be obt ained  before collection of the blood samples. For PK profiling, 4 or 
5 additional blood samples will be collected  during each visit at W4 and W16. The patient will 
be instructed to take the next dose  of the study drug in the clinic  and blood samples will be taken  
at the following timepoints: 45 min, 2.5 hours (estimated C max), 4 hours and 6 hours after intake 
of the study drug, as shown in the figure below. An additional optional 8-hour blood sample will 
be collected if the patient agrees. The actual date and time of  the study drug administration in the

This sample size is based on assumptions that there is a difference of 25.0% in the percent 
change from baseline in EASI scores between each orismilast dose  group with placebo, 
respectively, and  that the common standard deviation in the percent change from baseline in 
EASI score is 43%. Using  a 2-sided 2- sample t -test, 47 patients in each treatment group (188 in 
total) will achieve a power of 80% at the significance level of 5%.  To account for an  early 
dropout rate of approximately  10%, an additional 22 patients will be randomized.  
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent -to-Treat Population 
The intent- to-treat (ITT)  population will include all randomized patients  who receive at least [ADDRESS_87602] 1  dose of study 
drug. The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by [CONTACT_80222].  This population will be used for the analysis of safety. 
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87603] square means and the 95% CI  of the difference between each active treatment and 
placebo will be calculated. The primary analysis set w ill be the ITT population with a multiple 
imputation approach to handle missing values. The same analyses will be repeated backward at earlier visits.  
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints ( peak  pruritus N RS, BSA, PGIS, PGIC, sleep 
disturbance NRS, skin pain NRS, DLQI , and POEM exami nation), a mixed model for repeated 
measures will be performed similar to  the supportive MMRM for the primary endpoint. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints and other binary secondary efficacy endpoints (IGA- AD 
success, EASI50, EASI75, E ASI90 , and 4-point improvement in the peak pruritus NRS ) will be 
analyzed using the Mantel- Haenszel (MH) test, comparing each active treatment group with 
placebo in the ITT population. 
For categorical endpoints, the MH procedure, with ridit scores, will be used; this test is the same 
as the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and enhances the analysis when the parameter is not normally distributed. Graphics will be added to facilitate interpretation. IGA-AD scores/full 
scale will be analyzed using the MH test and the row mean score statistics with the ridit 
transformation.

Eczema Area Severity Index  
The Eczema A rea and Severity Index scoring system uses a defined process (Steps 1 to 5 below) 
to grade the severity of the signs of eczema and the extent  of body surface area affected.  The 
EASI assessment will exclude the scalp, palms, and soles from scoring. 
1.Select a body regio n:
Four individual body regions are assessed:
•Head/neck
•Trunk (includes the internal axillae and groin)
•Upper limbs (includes th e external axillae and han ds)
•Lower limbs (includes the buttocks and feet).
2.Assess the extent of eczema in that body region:
Area of Involvement: Each body region has potentially 100% involvement. Using the 
table below, give each respective body region a score of between 0 and 6 on the basis of 
the percentage involvement.  Precise measurements are not required.
Percent 
involvement  0 1–9 10–29 30–49 50–69 70–89 90–100 
Region score  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
3.Assess the severity of each of the 4 signs in that body region:
Erythema

Page  86 of 108  Appendix  4: Body Surface Area  
The BSA  assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to  AD and 
is expressed as a percentage of total BSA . 
BSA is defined as all areas with eczematous lesional skin and does not include xerosis (dryness), 
ichthyosis, keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785], urticaria, infection (unless there is underlying eczema), or 
postinflammatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]. 
Determine BSA using the patient ’s hand ( palm + fingers)  = 1% BSA rule.  
The patient ’s palm is measured from the wrist to the proximal interphalangeal and thumb. 
Estimate the number of palms it takes to cover the  area affected by [CONTACT_22802]. Add up the number of 
palms to give a total estimate of the area covered in AD.  
Additional rules: 
1. When many s mall lesions are present, try to put several together to make [ADDRESS_87633] cleared.
3. Double check to see if the area derived matches  the “eyeball method ” of estimation .

Page  102 of 108  Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result 
of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not 
have to be 100%. If there is any  intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it 
can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth,  but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from  the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is 
clearly not an accident so no other intent,  but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to 
head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself? Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?

When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is  
somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed,  and

Page  105 of 108  Appendix  15: Protocol Amendment Summary  
Protocol version 1.0 dated 09 Dec 2021 was amended to create Protocol Amendment 1 (Protocol 
version 2.0) dated 05- May-2022; the amended version of the protocol supersedes version 1.0. 
The purpose of this amendment was to update the protocol per FDA recommendations related to subject inclusion/exclusion criteria, AESIs, and the Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis scale . Additional updates were made to the statistical analyses  per the Sponsor’s 
statistician . 
• The definition of t herapy -resistant AD  was revised  in exclusion criteria #1  with the 
following updates: 
o Specification of  ≥2 treatment  failures was added. 
o “Systemic AD  therapy ” was changed to “biologic therapy”.  
o (including phototherapy) was changed to “ JAK inhibitor treatment or 
phototherapy”.  
• Clarification on the durations for documented history of topi[INVESTIGATOR_80173] #7 – “(at least 2 weeks for high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]), or as 
labeled”. 
• Additional information regarding prohibited emollients was included - “(however, 
emollients that contain pharmacologically active ingredients such as lactic acid, salicylic 
acid, urea, alpha-hydroxy acids, or fruit acids are not allowed from the Screening visit )”. 
• The following changes were made to the Schedule of Assessments table due to an 
administrative error in the original protocol. These have been changed to fit the packages 
for the study treatment.  
o A ±3 -day window was changed to a ±1 -day window (at certain visits) . 
o “Optional: blood samples for drug PK profile” w as removed from Week 8 and 
added at Week 16. 
o The requirement that patients should be in a fasted condition before sample 
collection at Baseline and Week 16 was removed.  
• The following sentence was added to Vital signs and Body Weight to align with the 
updates made to the AESI definitions– “A weight reduction of least 5% from baseline should be reported as a TEAE.”  
• Additional specific s on psychiatric conditions were added to exclusion criterion #8 - “ (eg, 
current major depression with a score for depressive symptoms ≥15 of HADS at baseline, schizophrenia, suicidal behavior, psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80120] )”.  
• Additional wording was added to Medical History to emphasize the focus on psychiatric 
conditions “including any psychiatric treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], covering”. 
• The definitions of AESIs were updated as follows: 
o any AE of occurrence of suicidal ideation or behavior, including a positive response to question 1 to 5 of C- SSRS,  
o a depression assessed as moderate or worse by [CONTACT_1720] a score ≥ 15 in the HADS score,

Page  106 of 108  o any grade 3 or higher psychiatric condition, and/or  
o any of the following GI TEAEs: vomiting, diarrhea with an increase of at least 4 
stools per day over baseline (Grade 2 CTCAE) for at least 3 days . 
• Additional wording was added to clarify that AESIs should be reported in the same manner as SAEs.  
• Dose modification language was revised to clarify that patients will be permanently discontinued from the study drug in the event that a TEAE meets the discontinuation criteria.  
• A typographical error was corrected in the Pregnancy section. The reference to  “Inclusion 
Criterion 9” was changed to “Inclusion Criterion 8”.  
• Collection of PK samples were updated to collect and generate PK -profiles in patient 
within the psoriasis indication  as follows: 
o PK samples were revised from “trough” to “plasma”.  
o The number of optional PK blood samples was increased from “4” to “4 or 5”. 
o The date of collection for optional PK samples was revised from Week 8 to  Week 
16.  
o PK timepoints were revised  from “1.5 hours” to “45 minutes” and “4.5 hours” to 
“4 hours” after intake of the study drug. 
o An additional optional 8-hour blood sample was added. 
• Statistical methods and planned analyses were revised as follows: 
o The ITT population was revised to include “all randomized patients who rece ive 
at least 1 dose of study drug” as the decision to withdraw patients cannot be 
biased by [CONTACT_80244]. 
o Efficacy analysis was revised to remove the condition “using observed cases 
only” for consistency with the ITT and PP analyses. The only difference in the 
efficacy analysis should be the number of patients included. 
o The supportive analysis was clarified in the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The sentence “The mixed model for repeated measures may be used as a supportive analysis.” was changed to “As a supportive analysis, a mixed model for repeated measures will be performed with treatment group, visit and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as factors and baseline EASI score by- visit 
interaction as a covariates”.  
o The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints was revised for consistency and to 
allow for comparison of ITT analysis results between the primary endpoint and 
continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. The sentence “For the continuous 
secondary efficacy endpoints (peak pruritus NRS, BSA, PGIS, PGIC, sleep disturbance NRS, skin pain NRS, DLQI, and POEM examination), an analysis of covariance, with treatment and disease severity as factors and Baseline value as covariate, will be applied. The mixed mode l for repeated measures may be used 
as a supportive analysis if appropriate.” was changed to “ For the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (peak pruritus NRS, BSA, PGIS, PGIC, sleep disturbance NRS, skin pain NRS, DLQI, and POEM examination), a mixed model

Page  107 of 108  for repeated measures will be performed similar to  the s upportive MMRM for the 
primary endpoint. 
o PK analysis was revised from “trough” to “ plasma”. 
• Appendix 3 was modified as follows: 
o The definition for Status of “Almost clear” / Score=1 was revised f rom “Trace 
faint pi[INVESTIGATOR_80169], with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no 
oozing/crusting” to “Trace faint pi[INVESTIGATOR_80169], no induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting”. 
o As a result of the above change to the wording of the scale, the word “Va lidated” 
was removed from the title of the scale throughout. 
 
Protocol version 2.0 dated 05 May 2022 was amended to create Protocol Amendment 2 (Protocol 
version 3.0) dated 14 April 2023; the amended version of the protocol supersedes version 2.0. 
The purpose of this amendment was to update the protocol per notification letter  dated 09- FEB-
[ADDRESS_87657] in  patients with  
moderate to severe psoriasis.  
• General safety information  regarding the use of orismilast is updated with the overall 
results from the UNI50001- 203 trial in psoriasis patients , according to the updated 
Investigators Brochure version 15. 
• The clinical risks and b enefits of orismilast has been updated  according to the recent 
learnings for the UNI50001- 203 trial in patients with psoriasis  and update of the 
Investigators B rochure version  15. 
• The exclusion criteria no. 14 on absolute neutrophil count and absolute lymphocyte count are by [CONTACT_80245] 09. February 2023, as follows :  
o Absolute neutrophil count of less than 3.0x109 /L (less than 3000/mm3) was corrected to the lower normal range of the Central Laboratory (LNR) i.e. 1.7 x 109 /L (1700/mm3). 
o Absolute lymphocyte count of less than 1.0 x 109 /L (less than 1000/mm3) was corrected to  the lower normal range of the Central Laboratory (LNR) i.e. 0,9 x 
109 /L (900/mm3). 
• The section regarding treatment discontinuation has been updated to more clearly stat e 
the requirement that if a patient experiences a TEAE assessed as Grade 3 or higher using the unique clinical descriptions of severity (Grade 2 or higher for the SOC of cardiac disorders) according to CTCAE version 5, the patient should be permanently discontinued from the study drug and not receive additional doses. 
• Planned dosing schedule and adjustments has been described in more detail. This to help guide the Investigator in case of temporarily decreasing the dosage regimen if  GI or other 
AEs considered probably or definitely related to the study drug are reported with a severity not compatible with maintaining the treatment as per -protocol. 
o A section for planned dosing schedule – Titration over a maximum of 2 weeks has been created.  
UNION therapeutics A/S   UNI50001- [ADDRESS_87658]  Version  3.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  108 of 108  o A section describing the s hort dose reduction during the titration period has been 
updated. 
o A section describing dose reductions and temporary treatment discontinuations 
after the titration period  has been created . 
• A section describing the e xamples  of supportive treatment for side effects  and medical 
treatment  for tole rability issues that may arise during the treatment (e.g. metoclopramide 
for nausea/vomiting, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen/paracetamol and NASID 
for headache)  have been added.  
• Safety blood samples for week [ADDRESS_87659] been added in Table 4. Schedule of Assessments , 
to allow for closer monitoring of all  safety laboratory assessments (hematology, serum 
chemistry, urinalysis) between weeks 8 and 16. 
• The adverse events section has been updated with details to emphasize that  all AEs must 
be graded by [CONTACT_80246] 5.0, with reference to the unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE in the guidance document.  
• Table 6 has been added for selected unique clinical descriptions of severity of AEs. Only 
if an AE is not uniquely described in the CTCAE grading system, the general guidance 
for classification is to be used. 
• The adverse events of special interest section  (AESI)  have been updated with an 
additional general criterion  to allow sponsor to follow any signal that may arise from 
Sponsors ongoing safety review during the trial that may need closer monitoring. 
• The Screening version of the Columbia Suicide Rating Scale in Annex [ADDRESS_87660] long version for Screening has been  
inserted .

STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS The primary endpoint will be the  objective response rate (parti al or 
complete response). A Simon (1989) , optimal two-s tage design 
will be employed. A 5% response rate precludes further study 
whereas a 20% response rate w ould indicate that further 
investigation of the treatment  is warranted (i.e., P0=0.05 and 
P1=0.20 in the Simon terminology).  Using α and β errors of 0.[ADDRESS_274339] stage 
and if no responses are observed, t he trial will be terminated.  
Otherwise, an additional 27 patients will be enrolled in the se cond 
stage and if ≤ 3 responses are  observed among the 39 patients, the 
agent will not be considered wor thy of further testing; whereas , if 4 
or more responses are observed the drug will be considered sufficiently active to justif y further study. This design has 9 0% 
power under the alternative hypothesis and provides a 54% probabilit
y of earl y stoppin g if the true response rate is onl y 5%.

 ≤ [ADDRESS_274345] prevalent 
malignancies. [1] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_227752], the  clinical outcomes 
for this malignancy remains poor , with a 5-year survival rate o f only about 20 percent (all stages).  The 
primary curative option in this clinical scenario is surgical e xcision.  Unfortunately , most patients are 
diagnosed with advanced disease, making surgical resection eith er not feasible or available with purely 
palliative intent.  While earlier  diagnosis would help to impro ve outcomes for patients with gastric 
cancers, a significant unmet medical need exists because no eff ective therapy has yet been identified.  
The current standard chemothera py regimens appear to have a mar ginal survival benefit. Hence newer 
agents and combinations are desperately needed.  Chemotherapy likely provides some benefit for patients with adv anced gastric/gastroesophageal junction 
(GEJ) cancers. In a recent meta- analysis, it was concluded that  chemotherapy produces superior survival 
as compared with best supportiv e care. [2] It was also conclude d that combination chemotherapy 
(usually using a fluoropyrimidine, a taxane, an anthracycline, and a platinum agent) improves survival 
as compared with single-agent chemotherapy, but with additional  toxicity. [3] Nonetheless, the 
prognosis for patients with advan ced gastric cancer is dismal, with median survival typi[INVESTIGATOR_227753] 10 months. [4] 
 Treatment of Gastric Cancer 
A number of validated doublet and triplet chemotherapy combinat ions are available as first line therapy, 
although there is no consensus as to the best regimen for initi al chemotherapy of advanced 
esophagogastric cancer. In genera l, combination chemotherapy re gimens provide highe r response rates 
than do single agents, but this translates into only modestly l onger durations of di sease control and 
survival that are measured in w eeks to a few months. In randomi zed trials, the ECF (epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], 
cisplatin, infusional 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) and DCF ([TCF] doc etaxel, cisplatin, infusional 5-FU) 
combinations have emerged as sta ndard regimens for first-line t reatment, unfortunately however adding 
increased toxicity and possible worsening patients’ quality of life (QOL).  Hence better-tolerated 
chemotherapy alternatives that can  provide higher efficacy and better tolerability are urgently needed. 
 Platinum–taxane combinations like DCF are an established regime n for treatment in advanced gastric / 
GEJ adenocarcinoma. Docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-FU (the DCF or TCF regimen), was compared with 
cisplatin and 5-FU alone in a mu lti-national TAX-325 trial that  enrolled 457 patients with 
chemotherapy-naïve advanced gastr ic cancer. Patients received e ither 21-day cycles  of cisplatin (75 
mg/m
2 on day 1) plus infusional 5-FU (750 mg/m2 daily, days 1 to 5) and docetaxel (75 mg/m2 on day 
1), or 28-day cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) plus infusional 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 per day days 1 
to 5). The group receiving docetax el did significantly better i n terms of response rates (37 versus 25 
percent), time to progression (TTP, 5.6 versus 3.7 months), and  two-year survival (18 versus 9 percent). 
Although the incidence of grade 3  or 4 diarrhea (20 versus 8 pe rcent) and neutropenia (30 versus 14 
percent) was higher with triple therapy, rates of any grade 3 o r 4 toxicity during th erapy were high in 
both groups (81 and 75 percent, respectively). [5]  The support of oxaliplatin as an anchor drug in advanced gastri c cancer comes from extensive data that 
suggest that oxaliplatin is at l east as effective as cisplatin in combination regimens for patients with 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-015  
15FEB2021 Confidential Page 9 of 45 advanced gastric and esophagogastric cancer. A meta-analysis of  the Randomised ECF for Advanced 
and Locally Advanced Esophagogastric Cancer-2 (REAL-2) study in  conjunction with two other 
randomized phase II trials showed that oxaliplatin was associat ed with significant improvements in PFS 
(HR 0.88, 95% I 0.80-0.98) and overall survival (HR for death 0 .88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99), and fewer 
neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, a nd thromboembolic events, but m ore neurotoxicity and diarrhea. [6] [7] 
[8] Although oxaliplatin has been  used in the backbone chemothe rapy in a number of trials in 
combination with other cytotoxic agents in advanced gastric/eso phagogastric tumors, overall there was 
not a significant improvement in efficacy.  The poor prognosis for patients diagnosed with metastatic gastr ic/esophagogastric cancer suggests the 
need for 1) a more effective ag ent to improve and expand treatm ent options and 2) to create a better-
tolerated alternative to those standard regimens currently used  as first line regimens. 
 Role of Nab-Paclitaxel 
Paclitaxel is a hydrophobic molecule and is dissolved in a solv ent, cremophor EL (CrEL), which has 
been associated with significant risk of hypersensitivity react ions and neuropathy. Moreover, CrEL is 
also known to impair free drug delivery to the tumor, limiting clinical effectiveness of paclitaxel [9]. 
Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®, Celge ne, Summit, NJ) was developed a s a solvent-free, albumin-bound 
colloidal formulation of paclitax el for intravenous (IV) use al lowing for shorter infusion time without 
pre-medications or specialized i nfusion sets. Comparative intra -tumoral and anti-tumoral activity of nab-
paclitaxel has been demonstrated to be greater than CrEL-paclit axel in multiple tumor types using 
preclinical models [10, 11]. In nude mice bearing human xenogra ft breast tumors, nab-paclitaxel treated 
mice showed more complete regre ssions, longer time to recurrenc e, longer doubling time and prolonged 
survival compared to paclitaxel  [12]. Moreover, pharmacokinetic  modeling has shown that nab-
paclitaxel has lower risk for ne utropenia when compared to equi valent dosing of paclitaxel due to 
shorter time of free paclitaxel  concentration in serum [13, 14] . In a Phase III clinical trial in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer, nab-p aclitaxel demonstrated higher re sponse rates, better safety and side-effect 
profile compared to conventional paclitaxel, and improved survi val in patients receiving it as second line 
therapy [15].  In pancreatic cancer, Von Hoff et  al. published pre-clinical in  vivo data showing that the aggregate 
tumor regression response in in dividual xenografts were 22/90 ( 24%), 34/95 (36%), and 53/96 (55%) for 
gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxe l, respectively [16]. The combination of 
nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine w as studied in a Phase I/II tri al in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer and showed promising clinical activity with improvement in median OS to 12.2 months [16] 
from 5.65 months with single agen t gemcitabine [17]. The maximu m-tolerated dose (MTD) for the 
combination was defined as gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV and nab-pa clitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 
15 every 28 days [16]. This led to the MPACT International Mult i-Center Phase III Trial conducted in 
[ADDRESS_274346] line 
treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Results sign ificantly favored the nab-paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine arm of the trial with a median OS of 8.5 months (95 % CI=7.89, 9.53) versus 6.7 months 
(95% CI=6.01, 7.23) in the gemcitabine arm. The HR of nab-pacli taxel plus gemcitabine/gemcitabine 
(HRA+G/G) was 0.72 (95% CI=0.617 , 0.835) indicating a 28% overa ll reduction in the risk of death for 
patients receiving the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcit abine, p<0.0001, stratified log rank test 
[18]. The updated results from this trial were presented at the  2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers 
Symposium. The gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel combination resulted in a statistically significant 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-015  
15FEB2021 Confidential Page 10 of 45 improvement in OS (8.7 versus 6. 6 months; HR, 0.72; p<0.0001) c ompared to gemcitabine alone in 
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [9]. Nab-paclitaxel ha s also shown anti-tumor activity in other 
advanced cancer types, including breast [15], lung [20], and me lanoma [21] and has received FDA 
approval for use in breast, non- small cell lung and pancreatic cancers. 
 Rationale for the Current Study and Dose Selection 
Given the high toxicity associated  with current standard platin um-taxane combination regimen (like 
DCF) and poor tolerab ility, alternative regimens of taxane-plat inum combinations are urgently needed. 
Hence our rationale to explore our combination of FOLFOX and na b-paclitaxel (FOLFOX-A) in 
advanced gastric /GEJ adenocar cinoma. We hypothesize that this combination (FOLFOX-A) will have a 
higher efficacy, a better tolera bility, and enhanced patient re ported outcomes. Hence, our proposed 
phase II single arm trial of FOLF OX + nab-paclitaxel in chemoth erapy –naïve unresectable, advanced 
gastric /GEJ adenocarcinoma.   Safran et al (ASCO 2014) reported the results of a phase I stud y of FOLFOX + Nab-paclitaxel in 
advanced pancreatic cancer that has established the MTD of the combination. The MTD for Nab-
paclitaxel was 150 mg /m2 IV Q 2 weeks when combined with FOLFO X regimen. In this phase I study, 
89% who received >10 cycles of the combination developed grade 2 neuropathy, 22% developed grade 
3 neuropathy. The study recomm ended oxaliplatin dose reduction to 65 mg/m2 if patients developed 
grade 2 neuropathy. Hence our ra tionale for this dosage of nab- paclitaxel when combined with 
FOLFOX as proposed in our study.

diagnosed with histologically-conf irmed advanced gastric/GEJ ad enocarcinoma.   
 
All patients will receive FOLFOX-A on days 1 and 15 of each cyc le (1 cycle = 28 days). Nab-paclitaxel 
will be given at a dose of 150 mg/m
2 IV over 30 minutes, followed by [CONTACT_227780] 85 mg/m2 and 
leucovorin IV 400 mg/m2 over 2 hours, and 5-FU as a continuous IV infusion over Day 1 a nd Day 2 (for 
a total dose of 2400mg/m2 over 46-48 hours.). Radiographi c assessment will be performed at baseline 
and every other cycle (starting with Cycle 3) to evaluate respo nse to treatment by [CONTACT_150114] 1.1 
guidelines.  Patients may conti nue to receive treatment until d isease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.  The primary endpoint w ill be objective response rate  (partial or compl ete response). A 
maximum of 39 patients will be enrolled. 
 Pre-medication and Hydration 
Patients may receive premedicat ion with diphenhydramine (25-50 mg IV) 30 minutes prior to nab-
paclitaxel or per institutional standards.   
 Dose Calculations 
Body Surface Area (BSA) 
BSA calculations will be used for dosing of all drugs.  BSA sho uld be calculated on Cycle [ADDRESS_274351]’s current h eight and actual body weight us ing the DuBois formula. BSA will be 
recalculated per the site’s st andard of care, or if Day 1 body weight changes by [CONTACT_726] 10%.  Actual

abdominal pain, blood or mucus i n stool, with or without fever)  and of bowel perforation (such as 
peritoneal signs and ileus).   
 All subjects who experience dia rrhea/colitis shou ld be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear 
fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid  intake is not feasible, fluid  and electrolytes should be substituted 
via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI c onsultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis. 
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists > 1 week, treat  with intravenous steroids followed 
by [CONTACT_78018].   
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1  or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks. 
 
6. TOXICITIES AND DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 will be used to grade adverse 
events.   Subjects enrolled in this study w ill be evaluated clinically an d with standard laboratory tests before and 
at regular intervals during thei r participation in this study a s specified in Study Calendar & Evaluations. 
 Subjects will be evaluated for a dverse events (all grades), ser ious adverse events, and adverse events 
requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation as specifi ed in Study Calendar & Evaluations.   
 Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
A new cycle of FOLFOX-nab-paclitaxel may not  be administered to the participant until the following 
criteria are met: 
 the ANC has recovered according to Table 3; 
 the platelet count has recove red according to Table 3; 
 stomatitis or diarrhea have r ecovered to grade 1 or less; 
 fatigue has recovered to grade 2 or less.  
 All other study drug-related, c linically significant, non-hemat ological toxicity must have 
resolved to grade [ADDRESS_274358] institutional practice 
guidelines for dose modification within the FOLFOX chemotherapy  regimen. Dose adjustments of each 
agent may be made independently based on the specific types of toxicities observed. There will be no 
dose reduction of leucovorin. 
 
The following adjustments in the t able below should be made to the appropriate drug (depending on the 
attribution of toxicity) based on the dose reduction guidelines . In addition, please note: 
 If more than one toxicity requiri ng dose reduction occurs, use lowest dose level required. 
 If multiple toxicities are seen, the dose administered in subse quent cycle should be based on the 
most severe toxicity experienced in the current cycle. 
 Patients not experiencing resolu tion of their neutropenia withi n 28 days (ANC ≥ 1.0 x 103 
cells/L), despi[INVESTIGATOR_14134] G ranulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) treatment, will 
be discontinued from all study treatment.

 Neuropathy 
The goal of the following dose m odifications are to prevent pat ients from developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] 3/[ADDRESS_274359] etion of FOLFOX-A. Fluorouracil  and leucovorin will not be reduced 
for neuropathy. 
 For patients experiencing grade 2 neuropathy: 
 Hold Oxaliplatin  
 To reinstitute oxaliplatin in patients with a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_227756] [ADDRESS_274360] improved to Grade < 1, however, nab-paclitaxel, 5-FU and l eucovorin may be 
administered. Oxaliplatin should be permanently reduced to dose  level - 1 (65mg/m2). Nab-
paclitaxel, 5-FU and leucovorin w ill not be reduced for grade 2  neuropathy.  
 To reinstitute oxaliplatin in patients with a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_227756] [ADDRESS_274361] improved to Grade < 1, however, nab-paclitaxel, 5-FU and leucovorin may be 
administered. Oxaliplatin should be permanently reduced dose le vel - 2 (50mg/m2). Nab-
paclitaxel, 5-FU and leucovorin w ill not be reduced for grade 2  neuropathy.  
 Oxaliplatin should be permanently  discontinued for patients dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_227756] 
2 neuropathy. However, nab-paclit axel, 5-FU and leucovorin may be continued. 
 At the investigator’s discretion , FOLFOX-A may be held for up t o six weeks secondary to 
patient’s experiencing grade 2 neuropathy. The reason for hold (grade 2 neuropathy) must be 
documented in the eCRF. 
 For patients experiencing grade 3 neuropathy: 
 Hold FOLFOX-A until neuropathy improves to < grade 1.  
 When treatment is resumed after the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , oxaliplatin and nab-paclitaxel should be 
permanently decreased to 65mg/m2 and 120mg/m2 respectively (dose level -1). 5-FU and 
Leucovorin will not be reduced for grade 3 neuropathy. 
 When treatment is resumed after the second epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865],  oxaliplatin and nab-paclitaxel should be 
permanently decreased to 50mg/m2 and 95mg/m2 respectively (dose level -2).  
 Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_227756] [ADDRESS_274362] be docum ented as secondary to grade 3

 Grade 4 neuropathy: 
 For patients experiencing grade [ADDRESS_274363] com e off study treatment. 
 Interstitial Pneumonitis  
Interstitial pneumonitis has b een observed in < 1% during nab-paclitaxel monotherapy and in < 1% 
during combinati on treatment with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin. Howev er, the risk has been higher f or 
the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine. Pneumonitis has been reported at a  rate of 4% with 
the use of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine. Monitor patients cl osely for signs and 
symptoms of pneumonitis. After r uling out infectious etiology a nd upon making a diagnosis of 
pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with nab-paclitaxel and promptly initiate appropriate 
treatment and s upportive measures. 
 Prevention, Surveillance and Management of Interstitial Pneumon itis: 
 Before starting treatment with nab-paclitaxel candidates should be evaluated for familial, 
environmental or occupational ex posure to opportunistic pathoge ns: do not enroll patients with a 
history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, o r pulmonary conditions such as 
sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopath ic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersen sitivity pneumonitis or multiple 
allergies. 
 During treatment with nab-paclitaxel epi[INVESTIGATOR_227757] f ever should be paid attention  to. Radiographic evaluation with 
chest X-rays and computed tomogra phy (CT) scans (normal or high  resolution) may be indicated 
to look for infiltrates ground-gla ss opacities or honeycombing patterns. Pulse oximetry and 
pulmonary function tests can show r espi[INVESTIGATOR_227758] c ompromise. 
 Infections should be ruled out w ith routine microbiological and /or immunologic methods. 
Transbronchial lung biopsy is not  recommended, given its limite d value and risk of 
pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be reserved for cases w ith unclear etiology. 
 Upon a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis nab-paclitaxel should be permanently discontinued. 
After ruling out an infectious e tiology, intravenous high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be 
instituted without delay, with a ppropriate premedication and se condary pathogen coverage. 
Patients with an added immunolog ical component may also require  immune modulation with 
azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Appropriate ventilation and o xygen support should be used 
when required. 
 Sepsis:  
Sepsis occurred in 5% in patient s with or without neutropenia r eceiving nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. 
Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were risk fac tors for severe or fatal sepsis. If a patient 
becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate trea tment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For 
febrile neutropenia, withhold nab-paclitaxel until fever resolv es and ANC ≥ 1500, then resume 
treatment and reduce all drugs by [CONTACT_30560]. 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-[ADDRESS_274364] will also be discontinued from 
protocol therapy and followed up per protocol under the followi ng circumstances: 
 Evidence of disease progression  
 The treating physician thinks a c hange of therapy would be in t he best interest of the subject 
 The subject requests to disconti nue protocol therapy, whether d ue to unacceptable toxicity or for 
other reasons o In case a subject decides to prematurely discontinue protocol t herapy (“refuses treatment”), 
the subject should be asked if sh e or he may still be contact[CONTACT_227784]. The outcome of that discussion should be documente d in both the medical 
records and in the eCRF. 
 A female subject becomes pregnant  
 If protocol therapy is interrupted for ≥ 6 weeks.  
 
Subjects will be removed from pr otocol therapy and the site inv estigator notified when any of the 
criteria listed above apply.  T he reason for discontinuation of  protocol therapy wi ll be documented on 
the electronic case report form (eCRF).   
 Study Withdrawal 
If a subject decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just f rom protocol therapy) all efforts should be 
made to complete and report st udy assessments as thoroughly as possible. The treating investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_28246] a  responsible relative by [CONTACT_227785] a personal visit to establish 
as completely as possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of 
the subject’s study withdrawal should be made with an explanati on of why the subject is withdrawing 
from the study. If the reason for removal of a subject from the  study is an adverse event, it will be 
recorded on the eCRF.

8. BIOSPECIMEN STUDIES 
 Correlative studies 
Baseline tissue and blood will be collected for future biomarke r studies and next generation sequence 
analysis.  
 Samples for future studies 
Subject consent will be obtained for additional samples collect ed for future Big Ten Cancer Research 
Consortium studies. Hoosier Cancer Research Network, as Adminis trative Headquarter s for the Big Ten 
CRC, will manage the banked samples. Samples will be banked ind efinitely in the Hoosier Cancer 
Research Network Biorepository.   
This includes: 
 Whole blood: Whole blood will be collected prior to treatment o n Cycle 1 Day 1.  
 Pre- and Post-treatment plasma: Whole blood for pl asma will be collected prior to treatment on Cycle 
1 Day 1 and at the 30-day Safety Follow-up visit.  
 Pre- and Post-treatment serum: Whole blood for serum will be co llected prior to treatment on Cycle 1 
Day 1 and at the 30-day Safety Follow-up visit. 
 Unstained slides: Unstained slides will be obtained from the su bject’s archived formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded tumor sample.  
 Please refer to the Correlative Laboratory Manual (CLM) for all  sample collection, processing, labeling, 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
 Confidentiality of Biospecimens 
Samples will be identified by a subject’s study number assigned  at the time of registration to the trial. 
Any material issued to collaborating researchers will be anonym ized and only identified by [CONTACT_423]’s 
study number.

recorded) as >[ADDRESS_274371] x-r ay, as >[ADDRESS_274372] scan, or >10 mm with calipers by [CONTACT_119382].  All tumor measurements mus t be recorded in millimeters ( or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 Malignant Lymph Nodes 
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node must be >[ADDRESS_274373] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended t o be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured  and followed. 
 Non-measurable Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm s hort axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed  by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as 
non-measurable.  Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the c riteria for radiographically de fined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions ( neither measurable nor non-mea surable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], 
simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic meta stases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the defin ition of measurability described  above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same subject, the se are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a m aximum of 2 lesions per organ a nd 5 lesions in total, representative of 
all involved organs, should be id entified as target lesions and  recorded and measured at baseline.  Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative 
of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that le nd themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the cas e that, on occasion, the larges t lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement in which  circumstance the next largest  lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A  sum of the di ameters (longe st for non-nodal lesions, short axis for 
nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and re ported as the baseline sum diameters.  If 
lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. 
 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurabl e lesions over and above the 5 target 
lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should a lso be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
of these lesions are not require d, but the presence, absence, o r in rare cases unequivocal progression of 
each should be noted throughout follow-up.

 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
NOTE:  In addition to the information be low, also see section 4.3.2 i n the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Co mmittee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 
45;2009:228-247) for special notes o n the assessme nt of target lesions.  
 
Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all target les ions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-ta rget) must have reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, takin
g as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  I n 
addition to the relative increas e of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase  of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the  
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered pro
gressions).
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m 
diameters while on stud
y
 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor m arker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must nor malize for a subject to be 
considered in complete  clinical response. 
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one  or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marke r level above the normal 
limits
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesi on status.  It must be 
representative of overall d isease status change, not a 
sin
gle lesion increase.
 Although a clear progression of “no n-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_227762] s uch circumstances, and the prog ression status should be confirmed at a 
later time by [CONTACT_16170].

Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of  treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should b e classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the ob jective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  In some circumstances, it may be  difficult to d istinguish resid ual disease from normal tissue.  When the 
evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine need le aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm  the complete response status. 
 
10. DRUG INFORMATION 
 Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane®) 
Please see the current package insert for complete product info rmation. 
 Classification 
Antimicrotubular, Cytotoxic 
 Mode of Action 
Nab-paclitaxel is a microtubule i nhibitor that promotes the ass embly of microtubules from tubulin 
dimers and stabilizes microtubul es by [CONTACT_227787]. This stability results in the 
inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtub ule network that is essential for vital 
interphase and mitotic cellula r functions. Paclitaxel induces a bnormal arrays or “bundles” of 
microtubules throughout the cell cy cle and multiple asters of m icrotubules during mitosis. 
 Supplier/How Supplied 
Celgene will supply nab-paclitaxel at no charge to subjects par ticipating in this clinical trial.  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-[ADDRESS_274375] ug and, as with other potential ly toxic paclitaxel compounds, caution 
should be exercised in handling nab-paclitaxel. The use of glov es is recommended. If nab-paclitaxel 
(lyophilized cake or reconstituted suspension) contacts the ski n, wash the skin immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. Following topi[INVESTIGATOR_227763] p aclitaxel, events may include tingling, 
burning and redness. If nab-paclit axel contacts mucous membrane s, the membranes should be flushed 
thoroughly with water.   Reconstitution of Nab-Paclitaxel  
o Aseptically, reconstitute each v ial of nab-paclitaxel by [CONTACT_227788] 20 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP or equivalent into each vial.  
o Slowly inject the 20 ml of 0.9% Sodium C hloride Injection, USP, over a  minimum of [ADDRESS_274376] the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Inject ion, USP directly onto the lyoph ilized cake 
as this will result in foaming.  
o Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure 
proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.  
o Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of any 
cake/powder occurs. Avoid generation of foam.  
o Each ml of reconstituted product will contain [ADDRESS_274377] the calculated dosing vol ume of reconstituted nab-paclit axel into an empty sterile, IV bag.  
3. The use of in-line filte rs is not recommended.

 Preparation  
The calculated dose of oxaliplati n should be diluted for infusi on with [ADDRESS_274382] be dispensed only from official study sites an d to eligible subjects under the 
supervision of the site investigator. Oxaliplatin should be sto red in a secure area according to local 
regulations. It is the responsibility of the site investigator to ensure that study drug is only dispensed to 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-015  
15FEB2021 Confidential Page 31 of 45 subjects. Oxaliplatin  is injected into a vein [intravenous (I.V.) infusion] over 2 h ours (±15 min) . 
Oxaliplatin is incompatible in solution with alkaline medicatio ns or media (such as basic solutions of 5-
fluorouracil) and must not be mixe d with these or administered simultaneously through the same 
infusion line. The infusion line should be flushed with 5% Dext rose Injection, USP prior to 
administration of any concomitant medication. 
 Adverse Events 
The most commonly observed oxalip latin toxicities include neuro toxicity, GI toxicity, and 
myelosuppression .  
 
Three neurotoxicity syndromes have been seen: acute sensory neu ropathy develops within hours to [ADDRESS_274383] also been noted. Acute sensory  neuropathy symptoms may be 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_227789]. Sy mptoms are reversible, usually 
resolving within 14 days and comm only recurring with further do sing. This syndrome has been 
observed in about 56% of patients  receiving oxaliplatin with 5- FU and leucovorin.  
 Acute pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia  is reported to occur in 1-2 % of patients. This syndrome is 
characterized  by a subjective sensation of dif ficulty breathing or swallowin g without laryngospasm or 
bronchospasm or objective evidence of hypoxia. Avoidance of col d drinks, food and air is suggested in 
order to minimize pharyngolaryng eal dysesthesia. Antianxiety ag ents (e.g., lorazepam) may be used to 
treat pharyngolaryngeal dysesth esias once oxygen saturation has  been documented to be normal.  
 Peripheral neuropathy persisting > 14 days is characterized by [CONTACT_227790], dysesthesias, and 
hypoesthesia. Abnormalities in proprioception may also be seen.  Symptoms of persistent neuropathy 
may improve upon discontinuation of oxaliplatin.  
 
Gastrointestinal toxicities in clude nausea, vomiting (oxaliplat in is considered to be moderately 
emetogenic) and diarrhea.  
 
Neutropenia is reported in 73%  of patients receiving oxaliplati n with 5-FU and leucovorin (44% grade 
3 or 4). Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia is reported to occur in 4% of patients receiving the 
combination.  
 
Allergic reactions, similar to those seen with other platinum c ompounds, have also been observed in 
patients treated with oxaliplatin. Reactions range from rash to  anaphylaxis.  
 
Rarely, oxaliplatin has been asso ciated with pulmonary fibrosis , which may be fatal. Oxaliplatin should 
be discontinued in the presence of unexplained pulmonary sympto ms (e.g. nonproductive cough, 
dysphagia) or pulmonary infiltrates until interstitial lung dis ease or pulmonary fibrosis have been ruled 
out. 
 
Recent reports of oxaliplatin extravasation suggest that tissue  necrosis may result and that oxaliplatin  
should be considered a vesicant. N o standard treatment exists f or oxaliplatin extravasation although 
heat and sodium thiosulfate have both been suggested.

The descriptions and grading sc ales found in the NCI CTCAE v4 w ill be utilized for AE assessment. A 
copy of the CTCAE v4 can be downl oaded from the CTEP website at  http://ctep.cancer.gov. All forms 
for AE/SAE recording and reporting  can be found in OnCore (Docu ments and Information Tab). 
 Definitions 
 Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not conside red related to the study drug that 
appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. The following are examples of AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associated  with participation in the proto col 
 An intercurrent illness or injur y that impairs the well-being o f the subject 
 Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigationa l product 
 An overdose (defined as 10% over the protocol-specified dose), accidental or intentional, 
whether or not it is associate d with an AE, should be recorded.  Any sequela of an accidental or 
intentional overdose of an inve stigational product should be re corded as an AE. If the sequela of 
an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and as an AE. 
The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the c ause of the event on the SAE 
report form and eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE itsel f. 
 Abnormal laboratory values or di agnostic test results constitut e AEs only if it: 
 results in discontinuation from the study 
 requires treatment, modification/  interruption of study drug(s) , or any other therapeutic 
intervention  
 or is judged to be of significan t clinical importance, e.g., on e that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worseni ng of an existing condition  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227764] (e.g., 
surgical insertion of central lin e) should not be recorded as a n AE.  
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable to the study regimen by 
[CONTACT_6962].

 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is any adverse event that: 
 Results in death. NOTE: Death due  to disease progression should  not be reported as a SAE, 
unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_227792](s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might  have caused death if it were more 
severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >24 hours or prolongatio n of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
NOTE:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227765], central line insertion, metastasis interventio nal therapy, resection of primary 
tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adve rse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical  event (defined as a  medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopard ize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, 
surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above. Examples of 
such events include, but are not l imited to, intensive treatmen t in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 A standard procedure for protoc ol therapy administration. Howev er, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complicati on of therapy administration wi ll be reported as an SAE. 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not a ssociated with any deterioration in 
condition. 
 The administration of blood or p latelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied Indication.  
However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227766] a com plication of such transfusion 
remains a reportable SAE. 
 A procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (e.g., surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complicati on of such procedures remains a  reportable SAE. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227767] l, practical, or social reasons, in 
absence of an AE. 
 A procedure that is planned (i .e., planned prior to starting of  treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source documen t and the CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227768] a complication remains a reportable SAE. 
 An elective treatment of or an el ective procedure for a pre-exi sting condition unrelated to the 
studied indication. 
 Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not res ult in admission, unless fulfilling 
other seriousne ss criteria above. 
 Unexpected Adverse Event 
For this study, an AE is consid ered unexpected when it varies i n nature, intensity or frequency from 
information provided in the current IB, package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-015  
15FEB2021 Confidential Page 34 of 45 document as a potential risk. Unexpected also refers to AEs tha t are mentioned in the IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or are anticipated from the pharmacologic al properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug un der investigation.   
 Causality  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they a re related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categorized using the following term s:  
Not suspected : Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP admini stration is unlikely or 
unrelated, or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions p rovide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event. 
Unrelated The Adverse Event is clearly not related  to the drug(s)  
Unlikely The Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the drug(s)  
 
Suspected : Means there is a reasonable po ssibility (possible, probable, definite) that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the adverse event. 
Possible The Adverse Event may be related  to the drug(s)  
Probable The Adverse Event is  likely related  to the drug(s)  
Definite The Adverse Event is clearly related  to the drug(s)  
 Reporting 
 Adverse Events 
 AEs will be recorded from time o f signed informed consent until  30 days after discontinuation of 
study drug(s).  
 AEs will be recorded regardless of whether or not they are cons idered related to the study

 Reporting Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pre gnancy test, regardless of age or disease 
state) of a female subject occu rring while the subject is on IP , or within [ADDRESS_274387]’s last dose 
of IP, are considered immediat ely reportable events.  IP is to be discontinued immediately and the 
pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must  be reported immediately. The female 
subject should be referred to an  obstetrician-gynecologist expe rienced in reproductive toxicity for 
further evaluation and counseling.  Male Subjects If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational pr oduct becomes pregnant, the male subject 
taking IP should notify the Site I nvestigator, and the pregnant  female partner should be advised to call 
their healthcare provider immediately.  Male patients treated with nab-p aclitaxel are advised not to 
father a child during and up to [ADDRESS_274388] notify 
Big Ten CRC AHQ immediately about  the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal 
outcome).   If the outcome of the pregnancy me ets any of the serious criter ia (including spontaneous or therapeutic 
abortion, fetal and neonatal deat h or congenital anomaly), it m ust be reported as an SAE. Any death of 
an infant which occurs in connection with in utero  exposure to the Study Drug within [ADDRESS_274389] be reported as SAEs. In a ddition, any infant death after 2 8 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero  exposure to the IP should also be reported immediately. The In vestigator will also 
document any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus.   Send reports to Big Ten CRC AHQ by [CONTACT_227794]@hoosie rcancer.org within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  Big Ten CRC AHQ Requirements for  Reporting Pregnancies to Celge ne Corporation

 IND Safety Reports Unrelated to this Trial 
Celgene will provide IND safety re ports from external studies t hat involve the study drug(s) per their 
guidelines to Big Ten CRC AHQ. B ig Ten CRC AHQ will forward saf ety reports to the sponsor-
investigator who will review these reports and determine if rev isions are needed to the protocol or 
consent. Big Ten CRC AHQ will forward these reports to particip ating sites within 1 business day  of 
receiving sponsor-investigator’s  review.  Based on sponsor-inve stigator’s review, applicable changes 
will be made to protocol and informed consent document (if requ ired).  All IND safety  reports will also 
be made available to sites via the EDC system. 
 Upon receipt from Big Ten CRC AHQ , site investigators (or desig nees) are responsible for submitting 
these safety reports to their respective IRBs, as per their IRB  policies. 
 IND safety reports determined by [CONTACT_456]-investigator to be  serious, unexpected, and possibly 
related (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) will also be submitted to the Northwestern DMC  for review 
([EMAIL_3934] ). 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS 
 Endpoints 
Endpoints are described in Section 2.2 and include the primary endpoint which is the objective response 
rate (partial or complete res ponse). All subjects with measurab le disease who have received at least one 
cycle of treatment and have their disease re-evaluated will be evaluable for assessment of objective 
response.  Secondary endpoints in clude overall survival, progre ssion-free survival, time to progression 
and disease control rate.  Safet y endpoints include toxicities.

15FEB2021 Confidential Page 38 of 45 
 Sample Size and Accrual  
A Simon [1989] optimal two-stage design [16] will be employed. A 5% response rate precludes further 
study whereas a 20% response rate  would indicate that further i nvestigation of the treatment is 
warranted (i.e., P0=0.05 and P1=0 .20 in the Simon terminology).  Using α and β errors of 0.[ADDRESS_274391] stage a nd if no responses are observed, the trial will 
be terminated. Otherwise, an additional 27 patients will be enr olled in the second stage and if ≤ 3 
responses are observed among the 39 patients, the agent will no t be considered worthy of further testing; 
whereas, if 4 or more responses are observed the drug will be c onsidered sufficiently active to justify 
further study. This design has 90% power under the alternative hypothesis and provides a 54% 
probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_227769]  5%. The baseline of ORR probability is 
based on existing data from a couple of platinum -5-FU combinat ions phase II, TTT trials with a 
minimum ORR of 16% [6-8, 24-31].  A maximum of 39 patients will be enrolled to attain 37 eligible /evaluable patients (total target sample 
size has been inflated by 5% to allow for patient ineligibility /inevaluability). Patients will be followed 
until the minimum of the time to progression, time to death bef ore the patient’s data will be included in 
the decision rule. 
 Analysis Datasets 
 
Population Definition 
Enrolled This will comprise all subjects who meet the eligibili ty 
criteria and are registered onto the study.  
Evaluable This will comprise all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of trial drug and either undergo at least one post-baseline assessment or die  before any evaluation.   
Intention-to-treat (ITT) This will comprise all subjects who meet the eligibility 
criteria and are registered onto the study irrespective of 
their compliance to the planned course of treatment. (See IIT principle below*). 
Per Protocol Set (Valid 
Cases, Efficacy Sample, Evaluable Subjects Sample) This will comprise all subjects who complied with the 
protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model.  Compliance covers such 
considerations as exposure to  treatment, availability of 
measurements and absence of major protocol violations. This population should be sp ecifically defined in the 
protocol. 
Safety This will comprise all subjects that contribute data to the 
safety analysis.  This populat ion should be specifically 
defined in the protocol.  
Treated This will comprise all subjects who have been exposed t o 
the planned course of treatment to any extent.

*IIT Principle - The principle t hat asserts that the effect of a treatment policy can be best assessed by 
[CONTACT_41445] a subject wit h the planned treatment regimen rather than 
on the basis of the act ual treatment given.  
 
 Assessment of Safety 
Any subject who receive at least one dose of treatment will be evaluable for toxicity. Safety will be 
evaluated using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 4.    In addition to continuous monitori ng of adverse events through expedited reporting and routine 
tabulations of toxicities being reported through case report fo rms, the trial will include two formal 
evaluations of toxicity before the completion of accrual. It is  expected that the true proportion of any 
grade 3 or higher treat ment-related adverse event (exclusive of  hematologic toxicity, nausea/vomiting, 
fatigue, alopecia and liver function abnormalities) will be no higher than 30% in this patient population 
(most events would be expected t o have true rates quite lower t han 30%). True proportions higher than 
30% would be reason to evaluate th e regimen for possible modifi cation. Given these assumptions, the 
following plan will be followed.   After [ADDRESS_274392] 2 cycles, all treatment-relat ed adverse event 
information will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_227770]. I f any observed grade 3 or higher 
treatment-related adverse event proportion (exclusive of hemato logic toxicity, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, 
alopecia and liver function abnormalities) is higher than 40% ( 4 or more out of 10 patients), a detailed 
review of all treatment-related adverse events will be conducte d and the study team may decide that 
treatment modification is necessa ry. If the true proportion of any adverse event is 50% (or higher) there 
is at least 87% probability of exceeding the observed adverse e vent boundary whereas if the true 
proportion is 30% there is only 11% probability of crossing the  toxicity boundary. The above decision 
boundary (40% or more observed even ts) will be followed for gra de [ADDRESS_274393] (hematologic toxi city, nausea/vomiting, fatigue,  alopecia and liver function abnormalities) 
in order to evaluate those events that might be expected to hav e relatively high event rates at grade 3, but 
not at grade 4. 
 Data Analysis Plan.  
Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug after the first 
and second stage of the study. Response rate and disease contro l rate and their 95% confidence intervals 
will be estimated using exact binomial methods.  Safety data su mmaries will describe the incidence of 
adverse events (including severity and relationship to drug or treatment), serious adv erse events, adverse 
events leading to early withdrawal or death, and Grade 3 or 4 t oxicities.  Median duration of response and 
its 95% confidence interval will be calculated.  Kaplan-Meier c urves will be used to summarize the time-
to-event endpoints of PFS and OS.  All event times will be calc ulated relative to the start of FOLFOX-A 
combination.  Distributions of PFS, TTP and OS will be estimate d using the method of Kaplan-Meier [17] 
and univariate testing will be done via the log rank test [18].  Descriptive statistics will be performed for 
all on-study and clinical-demograp hic data. Chi-square or Fishe r’s exact tests will be  used as appropriate 
for categorical associations and Wilcoxon rank tests or t-tests  for continuous measures. All event times 
will be calculated relative to the start date of the study drug  combination. ORR and DCR will be 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-[ADDRESS_274394] [19] for comparison between groups. Correlation of change in CA 19-[ADDRESS_274395] logistic regression and time-to-event  models (which will be largely 
exploratory) will be done using the Cox proportional hazards mo del. The safety data summaries will 
describe the incidence of adverse events (including severity an d relationship to drug or treatment), serious 
adverse events and those leading to early withdrawal or death, as well as grade 3 or 4 toxicities. These 
analyses will be largely descriptive. Efficacy and safety analy ses will be completed by [CONTACT_118067]. 
Statistical analyses will be completed using SAS®. 
 
13. TRIAL MANAGEMENT 
 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) of the Robert H. Lurie Comp rehensive Cancer Center will 
provide study oversight activities for this study. They will re view and monitor study progress, toxicity, 
safety, and other data from this trial.  Questions about subjec t safety or protocol performance will be 
addressed with the sponsor-inve stigator, statis tician, and stud y team members. Should any major 
concerns arise; the DMC will offer recommendations regarding wh ether or not to suspend the trial.   
Big Ten CRC AHQ must submit all SAEs to the Quality Assurance M anagers (QAMs) in real time, as 
defined below. 
 Big Ten CRC AHQ will compi[INVESTIGATOR_227771] l and submit these reports 
monthly to the sponsor-investigator.   
 Big Ten CRC AHQ will report all SAEs to the DMC Quality Assuran ce (QA) office within 
one business day of receipt and formally present them at each D MC meeting. 
 Submit data summary reports to the lead institution DMC and att end DMC reviews:

 Data Quality Oversight Activities 
Remote validation of OnCore data  will be completed on a continu al basis throughout the  life cycle of the 
study.  A summary report (QC Repor t) of these checks together w ith any queries resulting from manual 
review of the eCRFs will be generated for each site and transmi tted to the site and the site monitor. 
Corrections will be made by [CONTACT_3991].  If at any time, Big Ten CRC AHQ or the sponsor-investigator det ermines a site is not compliant with 
recording and reporting of data, a “for-cause” audit will be in itiated. 
 Monitoring visits to the trial sites may be made periodically d uring the trial to ensure key aspects of the 
protocol are followed. For-cause visits may occur as necessary.  During an onsite visit, source documents 
will be reviewed for verification of agreement with data entere d into OnCore.  It is important for the site 
investigator and their relevant p ersonnel to be available for a  sufficient amount o f time during the 
monitoring visits or audit, if a pplicable. The site investigato r and institution guarantee access to source 
documents by [CONTACT_227796].  The trial site may also be subje ct to quality assurance audit b y Celgene or its designee as well as 
inspection by [CONTACT_106827]. 
 Amendments 
If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended and/or the informed consent revised, the 
amendment or a new version of the  study protocol (amended proto col) and/or the revised informed 
consent will be generated by [CONTACT_227797] g Ten CRC AHQ and must be approv ed by [CONTACT_456]-investigator,

STUDY  SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber: SHP634 -402 Drug: rhPTH(1 -84)
Title of the study: A Phase 4, Open -Label, Single- Center Clinical Study of Extended use of rhPTH(1- 84) in 
Hypoparathyroidism
Number of subjects (total and for each treatm ent arm) :
The subject population anticipated in this study is up to 50 subjects. All subjects are exclusively from the core study 
(HEXT: The Hypoparathyroidism Studies, EXTended: The Effect of PTH on the Skeleton in Hypoparathyroidism) 
Protocol AAAE0544 at Columbi a University Medical Center, and w ill all receive active rhPTH(1 -84) treatment .
Investigator(s):
Single site located at:
Columbia University
New  York, NY [ZIP_CODE]
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Columbia University
New  York, NY [ZIP_CODE]
Study period (planned): 24 mon ths Clinical phase: 4
Objectives:
Prim ary:
To evaluate albumin -corrected serum calcium while on rhPTH(1 -84) treatment
Secondary:
To evaluate urinary calcium excretion and serum phosphate while on rhPTH(1 -84) treatment
To evaluate calcium and active vitam in D supplement doses while on rhPTH(1 -84) treatment
To evaluate disease- related symptoms, perception of cognitive function, and health -related quality -of-life 
associated with long -term rhPTH(1 -84) treatment
To evaluate the skeletal actions of rhPTH(1 -84):bone turnover (markers), architecture, and histology 
(biopsy)
Rationale:
Chronic hypoparathyroidism (HPT) is a life -long and irreversible disease for which the chronic administration of 
rhPTH(1 -84) is a potential treatment option. Thus, long -term safety and efficacy data are important in evaluating the 
proper use of this treatment option in clinical practice.
Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration:
rhPTH(1 -84); 25, 50, 75, and 100 µg for once daily subcutaneous injection to the thigh v ia a multidose pen injector 
device. The dose w ill be individualized to achieve a serum calcium level in the lower half of the normal range.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
Hypoparathy roidism (HPT) is a rare disorder characterized by  [CONTACT_10170] y low or undetectable l evels of circulating parathy roid hormone (PTH) 
(Avioli 1974; Haussler and Cordy  1982, Shoback 2008) The most frequent cause of 
hypoparathy roidism is resection of, or damage to, parathy roid glands during neck surgery  
(eg,thyroidectom y), although multiple other genetic, metabolic and congenital etiologies exist. 
Hypoparathy roidism occurs in about 0.9% to 6.6
% of thy roidectomies, with higher rates 
associated with more complicated interventions ( Shoback 2008; Thomusch et al. 2003 ; 
Zarnegar et al. 2003; Page andStrunski 2007 ). In 1 y ear spanning 2007 -2008 
(Powers etal.2013) the incidence of chronic hy poparathy roidism ( ≥6 months) was said to be 
approximately  60,000 subjects in the [LOCATION_002] (US), which rises to approximately  117,000 if 
the transient h ypoparathyroid population is included ( ≤6 months). The same authors sug gest that, 
of those 117,000 transient hy poparathy roid subjects, about 5% will become chronic.
Parathy roid hormone is an [ADDRESS_597048] the sy nthesis and secretion of PTH accordingl y. 
Acute s ymptoms of hy poparathy roidism, linked mainly  to the hy pocalcemia, are generall y 
reversible. The key  symptoms associated with hy pocalcemia involve mainly  the neuromuscular 
system: numbness, paresthesias, twi tching, and tetany . More serious and potentially  life 
threatening effects of h ypocalcemia such as seizures, cardiac arrh ythmias, cardiom yopath y and 
laryngeal spasm are also recognized in hy poparathy roidism ( Behaghel and Donal 2011 ). 
Hypoparathy roidism has also been linked to effects on mood and ideation ( Arlt et al. 2002 ;
Velasco et al. 1999 ).
The kidney s are especially  vulnerable in subjects with hy poparathy roidism. Circulating PTH 
promotes renal calcium reabsorption, especially  at the level of the distal convoluted tubule 
(Blaine et al. 2015 ). In the absence of PTH, calcium can be over -excreted through the kidney s 
(Shoback 2008
), leading to hy percalciuria which, together with a high- calcium -phosphate 
product, can potentiall y lead to nephrocalcinosis and kidney  stones and, ultimately , to renal 
impairment ( Blaine et al. 2015 ).
For further details see the recombinant human PTH (rhPTH[1-84]) investigator brochure.
1.[ADDRESS_597049], pharmacological supplementation with acti ve forms of vitamin D 
(eg,1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D 3[1,25(OH) 2D3], calcitriol, 1,25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol or α-
calcidol [1(OH)D 3]) is also required. Since PTH also functions in the kidney  to stimulate the 
conversion of 25(OH)D 3, the major circulating form of vitamin D, to the active vitamin D 
hormone (1,25[OH] 2D3), the relative lack of circulating PTH results 
in a reduction of the 
production of active vitamin D. Thus, exogenous active vitamin D overcomes the sy nthetic block 
in endogenous production of the active vitamin D hormone in hy poparathy roidism. Together, 
supplemental oral calcium and active vitamin D ha ve formed the mainstay  of current treatment 
of subjects with hy poparathy roidism. The additional calcium load that results from 
supplementation with exogenous calcium and active vitamin D contributes to the hy percalciuria 
and renal risks often noted in pati ents with hy poparathy roidism.
In an effort to limit the extent and effect of h ypercalciuria, thiazide diuretics can be helpful since 
they promote renal calcium reabsorption. However, thiazides are associated with their own 
adverse events (AEs) including h ypokalemia and, more importantly , have no proven long -term 
effect to reduce h ypercalciuria or kidney damage or improve the safety profile in this patient 
population ( Shoback 2008). Although an accepted adjunct to the use of calcium and active 
vitamin D in hy poparathyroidism, thiazides are prescribed to onl y a minority  of hypoparath yroid 
patients.
The investigational product (rhPTH[1- 84]) is a recombinant human PTH that is identical in 
structure to endogenous human PTH, a single -chain poly peptide consisting of 84 amino acid 
residues and is manufactured using a strain of Escherichia coli modified b y recombinant DNA 
technology . rhPTH(1- 84) was approved for marketing in the US on 23 January  2015 under the 
brand name [CONTACT_465634]®as a once -daily  injectable dose as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to 
control hy pocalcemia in patients with hy poparathy roidism.
1.[ADDRESS_597050] evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacody namic s and toxicology  of rhPTH(1- 84) at 
doses ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 μg/kg given as single doses or as dail y doses for up to [ADDRESS_597051] majority  of studies, rhPTH(1 -84) was administered by  [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection, 
the intended route of adminis tration of rhPTH(1-84) in humans. A total of [ADDRESS_597052] been performed.
In male and female rats, the administration of PTH was associated with an increase in the 
incidence of osteosarcoma. These data were interprete d as an increased risk for osteosarcoma in 
the clinic. Therefore, administration of rhPTH(1-84) should be avoided in subjects who are 
considered to be at increased risk for osteosarcoma (including those with Paget’s disease of bone 
or unexplained elevation s of alkaline phosphatase, subjects with hereditary disorders 
predisposing to osteosarcoma or subjects with a history of prior external beam or implant 
radiation therap y involving the skeleton).
Shire 
SHP634-[ADDRESS_597053] that 
rhPTH(1 -84) is not associated with significant fetal or neonatal toxicity ; however, the safet y of 
rhPTH(1 -84) in pregnant or nursing women is not established.
For full details see the rhPTH(1- 84) investigator brochure.
1.2.2 Clinical Info rmation
Study  CL1 -11-040 (REPLACE) was a double -blind, placebo controlled study  of once daily  
(QD) SC administration of 50 μg to 100 μg of rhPTH(1 -84). The 3 -tiered primary  endpoint 
included 
≥ 50% reduction from baseline in oral calcium supplementation, ≥ 50% reduction from 
baseline in active Vitamin D, and albumin- corrected total serum calcium (ACSC) concentration 
maintained or normalized compared to baseline (not exceeding upper limit of normal). The 
3-tiered endpoint was met in 54.8% of rhPTH(1- 84) subj ects compared to 2.5% of placebo 
subjects (p<0.001). Long -term, open
-label studies have supported these findings with subjects 
maintaining the ph ysiologic benefit derived from rhPTH(1- 84) treatment. One extension study , 
PAR -C10-008 (RACE), is ongoing with some subjects receiving treatment for more than 3 years.
In clinical trials, rhPTH(1- 84) significantl y reduced the serum calcium -phosphate product. In 
these studies, hy percalciuria was defined as an excretion of calcium in the urine greater than 
300mg per [ADDRESS_597054] Study  and the long -term open label study , RACE, 
show that rhPTH(1- 84) has a calcium -sparing effect, consistent with the reduction of urinary  
calcium excretion seen in a previous pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic study  (C09-002 ) of 
single dose administration of rhPTH(1 -84) in subjects with hy poparathy roidism in comparison 
with calcitriol administration.
The Phase [ADDRESS_597055], randomized, placebo controlled clinical 
study  conducted in hy poparathy roidism population and was the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10143](1 -
84) is effective in maintaining serum calcium levels and enabling significant decreases 
in active vitamin D and oral calcium doses. REPLACE also established the rhPTH(1 -84) dose 
and dose titration and evaluated the ph ysiologic effects of PTH replacement on serum calcium, 
serum phosphate, urinary calcium excretion and bone turnover markers. Eight y-four subjects 
were evaluated in the active treatment group and 40 subjects received placebo. S ubjects received 
at a flexible dose range of 50 to 100 μg SC in the thigh once dail y for 6 months. The study met 
the primary  efficacy  triple endpoint, with a statistically  higher responder rate (54.8%) versus 
placebo (2.5%). To meet the primary  endpoint a subject had to fulfill all 3 conditions as follows: 
a 50% or greater reduction in oral calcium requirement, a 50% or greater reduction in active 
vitamin D therap y and an ACSC concentration that was maintained within a range of 7.5 to 10.6 
mg/dL.
A review o f safety data across the hy poparathy roidism program indicated that rhPTH(1 -84) 
administered in the dose range of 25 to 100 μg SC QD is safe for use for the treatment of 
hypoparathy roidism. Very common adverse reactions (ie, reported in at least 1 in every  10 
subjects) included h ypocalcemia, h ypercalcemia, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, and 
hypercalciuria. Common adverse reactions (ie, reported in at least 1 in every  100 subjects, but 
less than 1 in every  10 subjects) included hy pomagnesemia, anxiety  symptom s, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
flushing, coughing and associated s ymptoms, neck pain, pollakiuri a, chest pain, thirst, blood 
25-hydroxy cholecalciferol decreased, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased.

There was no suggestion that rhPTH(1- 84) causes drug -induced liver injury in humans. There 
were no renal -related AEs or abnormalities in renal function tests or urinalysis tests in clinical 
studies apart from changes expected from the mechanism of action of rhPTH(1 -84). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_465623] m levels and improved calcium homeostasis, treatment 
with rhPTH(1- 84) did not result in worsening of hy percalciuria. 
Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, rhPTH(1 -84) is recommended only  for subjects 
who cannot be well controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone.
Additional risks include extensions of the pharmacologic effects of PTH including 
hypercalcemia. Post -treatment hy pocalcemia following the abrupt withdrawal of rhPTH(1 -84) 
can be particularl y problematic. Followi ng sustained withdrawal of rhPTH(1- 84), serum calcium 
levels must be carefull y monitored with reinstatement of appropriate dosages of oral calcium and 
active vitamin D. No on -treatment events of h ypocalcemia occurred following incidental missed 
doses of rhPTH(1- 84) during any  of the clinical studies, however subjects should be advised to 
take their rhPTH(1 -84) dose as soon possible following a missed dose and to take oral calcium.
Alway s refer to the latest version of the rhPTH(1 -84) investigator’s brochure for the overall 
risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy  and safety  of rhPTH(1 -84).
Shire 
SHP634-[ADDRESS_597056] to calcium and 
vitamin D to control hy pocalcemia in h ypoparathyroidism subjects who cannot be well 
controlled with calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone. Although the development of a 
novel therapeutic agent fo r the treatment of h ypoparath yroidism is encouraging, it is important to 
gain knowledge about the efficacy  and safet y of long -term use of rhPTH(1 -84) due to the chronic 
nature of the condition. 
The AAAE0544 cohort has the longest known duration of rhPTH(1- 84) therapy  for the treatment 
of hy poparathy roidism to date. This protocol is designed to extend this experience and to provide 
additional data on the long -term safety  and efficacy  of rhPTH(1 -84).
2.2 Study Objectives 
2.2.1 Primary Objectives 
To evaluate albumin- corrected serum calcium while on rhPTH(1 -84) treatment
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart
Protocol SHP634 -402 is a single -center, open -label, single arm, Phase 4 study  of rhPTH(1- 84) 
treatment in adult subjects (up to 50 subjects) diagnosed with hy poparathy roidism. 
Pre-study  treatment, laborat ory data, and medical history  information for enrolled subjects will 
be verified. 
Subjects will be treated with rhPTH(1- 84) for a two -year treatment period with study  visits 
scheduled every  6(±1) months. 
A schematic representation of the study  design is provided in Figure 3-1.

SHP634-[ADDRESS_597057]'s maximum duration of pa rticipation in the study is approximately  [ADDRESS_597058] 30 day s following 
the EOT( Month 24) visit. 
3.3 Sites and Regions
This is a single -center study  that will be conducted at Columbia University  Medical Center, New 
York, NY.
3.4 Discussion of Study Design
This protocol is only  intended for those subjects who participated and were treated in the 
AAAE0544 study . Limiting enrollment to subjects from the core study  (AAAE0544) will allow 
this study  to provide long- term safety  and efficacy  data. 
Administration via injection to the thigh has been shown to be a safe and effective delivery  
method of rhPTH(1- 84). Dosing is based upon previous exposure and the recommended dosing 
in the rhPTH(1- 84) package insert. The selected dose should reduce calcitriol and oral calcium 
(carbonate or citrate) supplementation to as low as safel y possible while maintain ing total serum 
calcium levels. All subjects will have their total serum calcium checked by  a local laboratory  as 
outlined in the Schedule of Study  Assessments ( Table 1 -1). Subjects may  have their 
rhPTH(1 -84) dose increased in increments of 25 µg to a maxi mum of 100 µg SC QD b y the 
investigator no more frequently  than 4 week intervals during the stud y, with the goal of 
achieving or maintaining total serum calcium levels in the range of 8.0 to 9.0 mg/dL if clinicall y 
appropriate. The rhPTH(1 -84) dose may  be adjusted downward at an y time as needed to 
maintain appropriate serum calcium levels (approximately  8.0 to 9.0 mg/dL) or due to an y safety 
concerns.
Adjustment of supplemental calcium and calcitriol regimens will be based on serum calcium 
levels, with the goal to be a reduction or removal of cal citriol treatment to the maximum degree 
clinically  possible and to decrease the prescribed oral calcium supplementation to ≤[ADDRESS_597059] blood draws to assess total serum calcium levels (which may  be 
performed locall y) 3to 5 day s after ANY dose adjustment of rhPTH(1
-84), after any  significant 
change in doses of calcium and/or and calcitriol supplements, or at an y other time at the 
discretion of the investigator. Results of local total serum calcium levels will be entered o n the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). 
During the week following the last visit (End of Treatment or earl y termination visit), subjects 
who are discontinuing rhPTH(1 -84) treatment (ie, those who are NOT continuing on commercial 
Natpara) will have oral calcium and/or active vitamin D adjusted to compensate for the cessation 
of rhPTH(1-84). Their total serum calcium levels will be checked locall y [ADDRESS_597060] serum calcium and phosphate checked.

6.2.1 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment 
This is an open -label, single -center study  where all subjects will rec eive rhPTH(1 -84).
6.2.2 Dosing
The dose of rhPTH(1-84) will be individualized based on SCAC and 24- hour calcium urinary  
excretion. The recommended rhPTH(1 -84) dose will be the minimum dose required to prevent 
both hy pocalcemia and hypocalciuria. This dose will g enerall y be the dose that maintains SCAC 
within the lower half of the normal range (ie, between 8 and 9 mg/dL) without the need for 
active forms of vitamin D and with calcium supplementation sufficient and individualized to 
meet the patient’s dail y require ments. 
The doses of rhPTH(1-84), active vitamin D, and calcium supplements will be prescribed on an 
individual basis. Dosing guidelines found in the US package insert will be used but may  be 
individualized at the discretion of the investigator. 
Doses of active forms of vitamin D and calcium supplements will be adjusted when using 
rhPTH(1 -84).
6.2.[ADDRESS_597075] will receive 2 pens for use during the study  period and sufficient cartridges to 
provide daily  doses for the duration of the study . Drug cartridges will be provided in kits
containing 8 cartridges each and each kit will be sufficient for up to 16 weeks of treatment. Each 
cartridge will contain study  drug for 14 doses. Drug cartridges will be provided at each clinic 
visit in sufficient quantity and at appropriate dose levels to ensure uninterrupted administration 
until the next study  visit. Ancillary  supplies including single use needles (31- gauge) and alcohol 
wipes will be provided by  [CONTACT_465630].
6.3.[ADDRESS_597076] to the clinical trial will be appended as 
regionally  requ ired. For example, in the US the following statement will be appended “For 
clinical trial use only ”, and/or “CAUTION: New Drug -Limited by  [CONTACT_4496] (or US) Law to 
Investigational Use” and the statement “Keep out of the reach of children”.

requirements, and must not:
Contradict the clinical study  label
Obscure the clinical study label
Identify  the study  subject by  [CONTACT_10178]’s prior full agreement.
Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging prior to dosing may  not occur without full agreement in 
advance b y the sponsor.
6.3.3 Storage
The dual -chamber medication cartridge should be stored between 2 –8 °C. The reconstituted 
medication can be stored for up to 14 days at these conditions. The mixing device and empty  
delivery  pen (ie, unloaded) can be stored at room temperature.
The investigator ha s overall responsibility  for ensuring that investigational product is stored in a 
secure, limited -access location. L imited responsibility  may  be delegated to the pharmacy  or 
member of the stud y team, but this delegation must be documented.
Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational 
product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsib le 
for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that 
records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously  by [CONTACT_465631], a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or b y manual 
means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period 
can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified min/max thermometer) 
would require manual resetting upon each rec ording. The sponsor must be notified immediately  
upon discovery  of any  excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require 
site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of 
excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentation as 
necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact 
has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor.
The s ponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the 
investigational product that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a 
storage room.
6.3.4 Special Handling
Do not freeze or shake. Do not use rhPTH (1-84) if it has been frozen or shaken.
Shire 
SHP634-[ADDRESS_597077] dispensed, used, returned, and/or 
destroy ed must be maintained as detailed further in this section.
The investigator has ov erall responsibility  for administering/dispensing investigational product. 
Where permissible, tasks may  be delegated to a qualified designee (ie, a pharmacist) who is 
adequatel y trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the inve stigator. 
This delegation must be documented in the applicable study  delegation of authority  form.
The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by  [CONTACT_49121] y form) will dispense the investigation al product only  to subjects included 
in this study  following the procedures set out in the study  protocol. Each subject will be given 
only the investigational product carry ing his/her treatment assignment. All dispensed study  drug 
will be documented on the eCRFs and/or other investigational product record. The investigator is 
responsible for assuring the retrieval of all stud y supplies from subjects. 
No investigational product stock or returned inventory  from a Shire -sponsored study  may  be 
removed from the site where originall y shipped without prior knowledge and consent b y the 
sponsor. If such transfer is authorized by  [CONTACT_456], all applicable local, state, and national 
laws must be adhered to for the transfer.
At the end of the stud y, or as instructed by  [CONTACT_456], all unused stock, subject returned 
investigational product, and empty /used investigational product packaging are to be sent to a 
nominated contractor on behalf of the sponsor. Investigational products being returned to the 
sponsor’s designated contractors must be counted and verified b y clinical site personnel and the 
sponsor (or designated contract research organization [CRO]). For unused supplies where the 
original supplied tamper -evident feature is verified as intact, the tamper -evident f eature must not 
be broken and the labeled amount is to be documented in lieu of counting. Shipment return 
forms, when used, must be signed prior to shipment from the site. Returned investigational 
products must be packed in a tamper -evident manner to ensur e product integrit y. Contact [CONTACT_409492] y investigational product prior to shipment. Shipment of all 
returned investigational products must comply  with local, state, and national laws.
Based on entries in the site drug accoun tability  forms, it must be possible to reconcile 
investigational products delivered with those used and returned. All investigational products 
must be accounted for and all discrepancies investigated and documented to the sponsor’s 
satisfaction.

Pre-study  rhPTH(1- 84) treatment will be recorded on the eCRF for each subject.
Pre-study  laboratory  data will be recorded on the eCRF for each subject.
7.2.2 Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Biochemical Evaluations
Biochemical evaluation including s erum calcium, PTH, albumin, phosphate, alkaline 
phosphatase, urine calcium, 25- hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D will be 
collected at the time points specified in Table 1-1 to assess efficacy  and bone turnover.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypoparathyroidism Multisymptom Q uestionnaire 
The Hy poparathy roidism Sy mptom Diary  is a 15- item tool describing the subject’s experience 
related to h ypoparath yroidism during the past 24 hours ( Appendix 1 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cognition Tool
The FACT- Cog assessment is a 37 -item tool ( Cella 1997 ). It includes 4 subscales: perceived 
cognitive impairments, impact of perceived cognitive impairments on quality  of life, comments 
from others and perc eived cognitive ability .
[IP_ADDRESS] FACIT Fatigue Scale
FACIT fatigue questionnaire contains 13 fatigue -related questions ( Cella 1997 ). The responses to 
the 13 items on the FACIT fatigue questionnaire are each measured on a 4 -point L ikert scale. 
Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue.
[IP_ADDRESS] HADS Assessment 
The HADS is a 14- item scale that generates ordinal data ( Zigmond and Snaith 1983). Seven of 
the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The scale is designed to avoid reliance 
on aspects of conditions that are also common somatic sy mptoms of illness. Each item on the
questionnaire is scored from 0- 3, therefore, a person can score between 0 and 21 for either 
anxiety  or depression. Data returned from the HADS is ordinal.
[IP_ADDRESS] Short Form Health Survey-36
The SF -36 is a validated questionnaire that questions subjects about per ceived phy sical and 
mental health and function. The SF-36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums 
of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly  transformed into a 0- 100 scale on the 
assumption that each question carries equal w eight; the lower the score the more disability . The 
higher the score the less disability  ie, a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability  and a 
score of 100 is equivalent to no disability . The eight sections included in the SF -36 assessment 
are vita lity, phy sical functioning, bodily  pain, general health perceptions, phy sical role 
functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health 
(Ware andSherbourne 1992
).

treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH 
Guidance E2A 1995). 
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up 
period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_597086] be followed to closure (the subjec t’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in 
the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented.
8.1.[ADDRESS_597087] be 
recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to 
dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first 
dose of investigational product has been admini stered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the 
appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF).
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild : A ty pe of AE that is usually  transient and may  requir e only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of daily  
living.
Moderate : A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual ac tivities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe : A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensi ve therapeutic intervention.

8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must assess the relationship to investigational product for each AE. The 
investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may  have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If there is no 
valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. 
Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, fo r suspecting a 
possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of 
the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source document.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product, and the ev ent cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical 
condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausi ble temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.

Unknown
8.1.[ADDRESS_597089] ed progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy  
data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_597090] to the start of study  treatment, 
further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or 
until a plausible explanation (ie, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values.
The inve stigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  or vital signs parameter is clinically  significant 
and therefore represents an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_597091] be reported within 24 hours to the 
Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and any  applicable follow -
up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire Medical Monito r using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The pregnant female study  participant 
must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condit ion of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30 calendar day s postpartum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriag e or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_10191]. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if t he investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and Non-
serious AEs Required b y the Protocol Form as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed 
Products Pregnancy  Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -HCG (beta -
human chorionic gonadotropin) test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy onset date.
8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these resu
lt in an SAE.

Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a non-
medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may  be 
detrimental to the individual and/or societ y
Misuse – Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any  dose 
(Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the 
dose prescribed b y the protocol)
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of an investigational product exceeding 
a pre -specified total dail y dose of [ADDRESS_597092].
Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an 
investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as 
defined below.
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable 
as medication errors.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.
The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_465626] a 
reportable medication error.
Acute accidental overdosage of rhPTH(1
-84) can result in transient hy percalcemia and 
hypercalciuria. Treatment of suspected overdose should include temporary  discontinuation of 
rhPTH(1 -84), monitoring of serum cal cium, and implementation of appropriate, supportive 
measures such as h ydration. Due to the relativel y short duration of the pharmacological activit y 
of rhPTH(1- 84), further measures should not be necessary .

8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an y untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre -
existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs. For ex ample, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect
Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
AllSAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.3, and must be reported 
to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Depart ment and the Shire Medical 
Monitor within [ADDRESS_597095] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any
 SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be re ported to the Shire Global 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within [ADDRESS_597096]’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did n ot contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product acti on was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
8.2.[ADDRESS_597097], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
The sponsor and/or CRO is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory  authorities/US 
central Institutional Review Boards (I RBs) of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition, the sponsor and/or CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, 
unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP6 34-402 program. 
The investigator is responsible for notify ing the local IRB, local Ethics Committee (EC), or the 
relevant local regulatory  authority  of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

9.1 Data Collec tion
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by  [CONTACT_59751]. A stud y monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures w ill be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. It is expected that site personnel will complete the eCRF 
entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_597098]’s visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the study  data management plan. 
Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissio ns, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical databas e, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations

9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Albumin -corrected serum calcium over time
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is defined as the albumin -corrected serum calcium concentration 
over time at each stud y visit (ie, every  6 months). The Basel ine serum calcium concentration is 
the final measurement taken prior to initiating treatment.
The change and percentage changes from baseline will be summarized at each visit. No formal 
statistical test will be conducted. 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be provided as appropriate.
9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary  endpoints are defined as follows:
Urinary  calcium and serum phosphate over time
Calcium and active vitamin D supplement doses over time
HPT Disease -related s ymptoms (Multisy mptom quest ionnaire), FACT -Cog assessment, 
FACIT (Fatigue Scale [Version 4]), and HADS
Health-related quality-of- life measured with SF -36 survey  over time
Bone turnover (markers), architecture, and histology  (biops y) over time
For continuous variables, the change and percent changes from baseline will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, 
maximum, and minimum. The same anal ysis using core study  (AAAE0544) baseline will be 
performed. CIs of 95% will b e provided as appropriate. For categorical variables, statistical 
summaries will include number of subjects and percentages.

approval for the study  to proceed. The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the records 
and data will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, re gulations, and 
guidelines to maintain the confidentialit y of subjects’ identities.
Subjects are assigned a unique identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may  
also be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify  the accuracy  of the data (ie, to confirm 
that laboratory  results have been assigned to the correct subject). 
The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical 
records, and possibly  initials and dates of birth –will be recorded. The y may be transferred to, 
and used in, other countries which may  not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study  is conducted. The purpose of an y such transfer would include: to 
support regulatory  submissions, to c onduct new data anal yses to publish or present the study

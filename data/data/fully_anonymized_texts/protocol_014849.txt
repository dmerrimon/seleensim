STUDY  TITLE:  Train  Your  Brain:  Improving  Memory  and Decision  Making  to Improve  Outcomes 
among Youth  
 
1. STUDY  AIM,  BACKGROUND,  AND  DESIGN  ABSTRACT  
Youth exposed to early childhood adversity are at increased risk for engaging in 
problematic substance use, leading to myriad negative health outcomes, including HIV 
exposure,  injury,  and impaired  driving.  Adolescents  from low resource  communities’  evidence 
elevated rates of exposure to adverse childhood experiences yet have limited access to 
evidence -based preventative interventions. Thus, there is a critical need for services that can 
feasibly target specific mechanisms linking early adversity to t he onset and escalation of 
substance use in traditionally underserved communities.  
One such target is delay discounting (DD), the tendency to select small, immediately 
available rewards at the expense of larger, delayed rewards. DD has been linked to early 
substance use initiation and more frequent and severe use across adolescence. More over, 
youth  exposed  to early  childhood  adversity  evidence  more  problematic  levels  of DD, indicating 
that DD may be a pathway by [CONTACT_377810].  
Research  from our team  suggests  that computer -based  interventions  targeting  proximal 
cognitive skills, specifically executive functions, can improve rates of DD. Moreover, 
computerized interventions are highly transportable and scalable, making them ideal for 
dissemination in low -resource communities. The current project proposes to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a computer 
based working memory training program to improve DD and prevent substance use among at 
risk adolescents in traditionally underserved areas (Detroit and Flint, M I). 
Our first goal or phase of the project (Aim 1) is to conduct a small case series with up to 50 
youth participants and 50 parent/guardian participants (n=100) to evaluate the preliminary 
feasibility of delivering a computer -based intervention in a community  setting serving low 
income adolescents. This case series will be used to determine if the intervention can be 
delivered  feasibly,  acceptability,  and at sufficient  dosage.  This includes conducting a subgroup 
cohort (n = 60) of 1-[ADDRESS_472885]  POPULATION  AND  ELIGIBILITY  
Please note that youth will be recruited to participate in either the intervention group or the focus 
group. No youth will be purposefully recruited from the intervention group to take part in the 
focus group; however, youth who have taken part in the inte rvention group and opt to take part in 
the focus group will be allowed to do so.

3. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Procedures for Intervention Group:  
Eligible youth (up to n=50 and their parents/guardians, up to n=50) will be recruited for 
participation  in the intervention portion of the study . Fliers will be posted and distributed at 
each facility and announce information during regular facility programming. Interested youth 
and their parents/guardians will be given a  study  phone  number,  email  and/or  QR code  to 
contact  [CONTACT_261178].  Research  staff (including  research assistants IRB approved community 
liaisons under the supervision of the PI (Felton) will conduct screening instruments over the 
phone or in -person (in a private, on -site room) and baseline assessments will be scheduled for 
eligible participants. We conservatively estimate enrolling participants at a rate of 4 -5 youth 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: [ADDRESS_472890]. After 
reviewing the consent information with the p articipant and answering  any questions,  research  
staff will do one of the following:  1) For participants  that are screened over the phone, research 
staff will send a link to the consent form via text or email, using DocuSign and/or REDCap’s e -
consent framework, for the participant to review and electronically  sign prior to starting  any 
study  procedures.  A PDF of the completed  consent  form will be available to the participant for 
download after they provide their consent. 2) For participants that are screened in person, 
research staff will pull up the e -consent form in REDCap for the participant to complete on a 
study computer or paper consent. If consent is collected on paper, participants will be provided 
with a copy of the signed consent.  
 
Following informed consent and assent procedures, eligible participants and their parents will 
be scheduled to complete a baseline assessment protocol, including measures of youths’ 
exposure  to early  life adversity,  working  memory  (WM),  delay  discounting  (DD),  and substance 
use (SU) risk indicators. Baseline and post intervention assessments (surveys and key 
informant interviews) will be collected electronically (e.g., REDCap, Millisecond, Pearson, etc.) 
by [CONTACT_2319], phone, or in -person. Individuals who complet e their surveys via texting have 
consented to receive text messages: The following text messages will be sent:  
 
Parent:  Hi Parent!  Please  complete  your surveys  for the Train  Your  Brain  project  by [CONTACT_377815]: <Twilio via REDCap link>  
 
Adolescent:  Hi there!  Please  complete  your surveys  for the Train  Your  Brain  project  by 
[CONTACT_377816]: <Twilio via REDCap link>  
 
All participants  in the first phase  of the project  will receive  the active  condition.  Each  participant 
will be assigned  a unique  login  for the self-guided  training  sessions  and participation  (including 
attendance and performance) will be electronically monitored. Research staff including IRB 
approved community liaisons (individuals who take part in programming at the YMCA, FFSC, 
or DBG and hired to work as part of this project) will be station ed at each data collection site 
during the activity period to help se t up training sessions and remind participants to complete 
the intervention activities when applicable.  
 
Aim 1 (Intervention  Development):  To engage  stakeholders  (adolescents,  parents,  staff and 
leadership  from youth -serving  organizations)  in the development  of a WM training  program  for 
reducing  DD by [CONTACT_14664]  a small open -label series  . Results will  inform  an adaptation  of the 
intervention with respect to: (1) feasibility (measured using enrollment, attendance, and 
retention data); (2) acceptability and appropriateness of  the intervention (measured using 
surveys, and key informant interviews); and (3) necessary intervention  dosage  to produce  
change  in DD. All participants  in the phase  of the project  will receive the active training and 
compensation (detailed below).  
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: [ADDRESS_472891] of approximately 15 computer sessions during 
which participants will complete eight WM training programs. This initial number of sessions is 
based on previous research but will be a specific focus. Programs are consistent wit h those 
used  in previous trials. Active training  sessions include:  Sequenced  Recall  of Digits  – Auditory, 
Sequenced Reverse Recall of Digits – Auditory, Sequenced Recall of Digits – Visual, 
Sequenced Reverse Recall of Digits – Visual, Sequen ced Recall of Words – Auditory, 
Sequenced Recall of Words – Visual, Sequenced Reverse Recall of Words – Auditory, 
Sequenced  Reverse  Recall  of Words  – Visual.  Additional  validated  visual  and working  memory 
capacity measures may be added as determined by [CONTACT_377817]. For 
example, this includes but is not limited to the Corsi Block Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292713]. Each session will 
take approximately 20 -30 minutes to complete. In line with preliminary  studies, youth will also 
receive a small incentive ((a “t icket” that can be turned in for prizes at the end of the program) 
for each computer training program they complete, as well as tickets for each module of the 
training that they improve on from their previous scores. We will also gather specific feedback 
regarding this approach.  
 
Study  Assessments  and Duration:  Adolescents: Adolescent participants will be asked to complete 
10-15 computer sessions at a rate of 2 -3 computer sessions per week. Each computer session will take 
about 20 to 30 minutes  to complete.  Adolescents  will also be asked  to participate  in two assessment  
sessions which will take about 45 -60 minutes to complete. One before the computer sessions and one 
immediately after they complete their computer sessions (between 5 -7 weeks). Finally, they will be 
asked to participate in a brief 30 -minute interview 2 week s after completing the computer sessions about 
their experience in the study. With parent and child permission, the interview will be audio recorded. In 
total, adolescents will participate in 13 -18 study session visits over the course of 9 weeks.  
 
Parents: Will be asked to participate in a baseline assessment (before their child’s computer 
sessions  begin),  a post intervention  assessment  when  child’s  computer  sessions  are complete 
(5-[ADDRESS_472892] baseline) and a key informant interview approximately two weeks after 
completing sessions (9 weeks). The interview will be audio recorded, with their permission.  
 
Interview: A qualitive interview will be conducted with key stakeholders a couple of weeks 
after completing  the intervention  to better  understand  the intervention  and how participants 
found it. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Youth /young adults  will be excluded  based  on the following  exclusion  criteria:  
(1) Self-disclosure of psychosis  
(2) Self-disclosure of current  suicidal  or evidence  active  suicidal  ideation  
(3) Self-disclosure of  a substance  use disorder  
 
Focus Group Enrollment and/or Screening .  
Participants will be recruited from the Michigan  community . The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_377801]. Parents  of interested  adolescents  will be contact[CONTACT_377818], 
phone, or in -person by [CONTACT_377819].  Additionally, study 
staff will hand out recruitment fly er(s) to community stakeholders and agencies that work with 
children as well as word of mouth approach es to recruit participants. If interested, s creening  will 
take place  in person  or via phone. All interested adolescents will be screened by [CONTACT_377820].  
Focus Group Recruitment  
Focus group participants will be recruited separately from the intervention condition; 
however, youth that participated in the intervention condition will also be allowed to participate . 
Parents or guardians of eligible  youth will provide consent  for their child’s participation. 
Contact [CONTACT_377821], email, or text  to parents/guardians . Interested youth and their 
parents/guardians or young adults will be given a  study  phone  number  and email  to contact  [CONTACT_377822].  Research  staff will conduct scr eening instruments over the phone or in -person (in a 
private, on -site room ) to ensure eligibility. Following the initial screener to assess for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, eligible youth  and their parents/guardians (or youth between 18 
and 21 years old who are able to consent for themselves) will complete the consent/ assent 
process.  
Focus Group Consent  
Following screening, research staff will review the verbal consent information with 
eligible and interested parents and guardians  of participating youth and/or youth ages [ADDRESS_472894].  After reviewing the consent and assent 
information with the parent and adolescent , research  staff will document verbal consent 
collection and assent in REDCap.  Up to 60 youth  (ages 1 2 to 21)  will be enrolled .  
Focus Group Procedures  
Following informed consent and assent procedures, eligible participants will be 
scheduled to participate in a focus group session. Each focus group will last approximately  60-
[ADDRESS_472895] over the course of 
approximately 1 -2 months depending on participant an d study staff availability.  
All participants  will be asked to review the study procedures for their insights, feedback, 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: 9 Page  8 of 26  and suggestions for improvement. This includes but is not limited to their review of the 
assessment battery and computer -based active training program . Each focus group session 
will be recorded and transcribed for analysis. Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_472896] for each focus group session they attend  (up to 3).  
Focus Group Compensation  
Adolescents and young adults will be compensated $25 for each focus group session 
they attend, up to 3 sessions in total and $75 in total compensation.  
 
Summary of Enrollment Numbers.  
The following chart summarizes the total possible enrollment by [CONTACT_301899] (intervention vs. 
focus group) for youth participants under 18, youth participants over 18, and parents/guardians 
of youth participants under 18.  Please note, all numbers are enrollees “up to” the number 
indicated in the box.

TOTAL POSSIBLE ENROLLEES PER 
COMPONENT (Clinical Trial vs. Focus Group)  [ADDRESS_472897] important among these is the need to 
extensively  train and supervise  research  staff in accurately  administering  all assessments  and 
entering data. For self -report questionnaires, we will use computer -assisted data collection 
approaches (i.e., REDCap, Millisecond, etc.) that will allow participants to directly input their  
own data.  Study procedures that take place over video conferencing streams will utilize secure, 
encrypted video conferencing channels to conduct study related tasks. Audio  recordings  will be 
stored  on a secure  folder  on the HFHS  drive.  Files  will be transcribed and identifiable 
information will be redacted. Behavioral measures of delay discounting wi ll also be completed 
entirely on the computer.  
 
All other assessments will be double -entered and cleaned by [CONTACT_3647]. Data files will be 
backed up weekly and stored on a password -protected computer. Staff will attempt to collect 
all missing assessments immediately post collection but no later than  [ADDRESS_472898] (i.e., DD and WM) 
in preparation for a subsequent, fully -powered trial. Therefore, we present information 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: [ADDRESS_472899] 
to confidentiality, we will take steps to ensure participant data remains secure. All research 
staff, including community liaisons, will be trained in the protection of human subjects and will 
be instructed in maintaining confidentiality. In order to de -identify data, we will assign each 
participant a random number. Only these numbers will be associated with the assessment 
materials and training performance. One master document that links participant names to 
these numbers will be retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a lock ed file cabinet, behind locked office doors in 
the HFHS laboratory space. In the community setting, YMCA/FFSC/DBG staff will not be 
informed who has been screened and enrolled and participants will be assured that the 
decision to take part in the study wil l not affect their status at the YMCA/FFSC/DBG nor their  
access to YMCA/DBG programming. Community liaisons will not have access to any 
assessment materials, nor will they be able to track computer -based training progress. While 
participation in the progra m involves completing training in computer rooms at community  
based recruitment sites (thus making it possible for other youth to observe participants  being  
administered  the intervention),  we will attempt  to conceal  participation  status in a number of 
ways. Community liaisons and research staff will be trained to take reasonable precautions to 
prevent revealing adolescent participation in the program, including closing the door to the 
computer room and not referring to participants ’ status in the program ou tside of the computer 
room. Participants will also be given the opportunity to complete assessment measures either 
over a web -based survey collection tool (REDCap) or in a secure and private location at the 
YMCA/FFSC/DBG. All parents/guardians will be prov ided with a list of free and low -cost 
mental and behavioral health resources in the Detroit and Flint areas. Upon request, 
parents/guardians  will also be provided  deidentified,  aggregated  data on adolescent  substance 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: [ADDRESS_472900] any discomfort adult or adolescent participants may feel while completing 
assessment  questionnaires  (i.e. frustration,  boredom,  and fatigue)  to be short -lived.  However, 
in the event that  participants are either disturbed or concerned about reactions to the 
questionnaires, we will encourage them to discuss these concerns with the research staff.  
They will be put in touch with the PI (Felton) if concerns are not satisfactorily addressed. 
Because alcohol and drug use is illegal for all adolescent participants, there is a risk of legal 
repercussions  related  to the disclosure  of confidential  data.  We will discuss  with all participants 
and their guardians the nature of the Certificate of Confidentiality during the assent and 
consent procedures. If participants still report feeling uncomfortable answering certain 
questions, they will be reminded that the y are allowed to skip items and still be compensated 
for participation. Based on previous experiences collecting substance use data from 
adolescents (i.e. R01 DA018647), we anticipate very low levels of non -response.  
Once enrolled in the study, any evidence of participant’s suicidal ideation, 
current/ongoing  trauma  exposure,  and/or  urgent  physical  and mental  health  concerns  will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_377823] -up assessment sessions.  
Although  it is unlikely  that a participant  will spontaneously  disclose  suicidality  or homicidality , 
any incidents in which this happens will be immediately addressed in a number of ways.  
Research staff will contact [CONTACT_3038]’ parents/legal guardians and provide a free crisis 
line number.  Research  staff will also contact  [CONTACT_978] (a clinical  psychologist)  immediately  who 
will attempt follow -up directly with the participant and their parents within 24 hours to gain 
additional context and support in connecting the family with requested mental health 
resources.  
Research staff will bring any adolescents who report engaging in dangerous levels of 
risky behaviors,  as indexed  by [CONTACT_377824][INVESTIGATOR_377802], to the attention 
of the investigator  team  during  regular  meetings.  Based  on information  from study  evaluations, 
Drs. Felton (PI) and Johnson (Co -I located in Flint, proximal to the Flint Freedom Schools, and 
both licensed clinical psychologists) will determine the appropriate course of action. These 
actions will follow protocols and regulations stipulated by [CONTACT_377825] (eith er 
YMCA/FFSC/ or DBG), HFHS IRB, NIH and the State of Michigan. In extreme circumstances, 
this may involve contact[CONTACT_321671]. Participants will be allowed to remain in the study, but  
their data will not be used and a replacement participant will be re cruited. Incidents of 
suicidality or abuse not deemed to involve imminent danger will be considered an adverse 
event (AE) and incidents where imminent danger is evident will be considered a serious 
adverse  event  (SAE).  Both AEs and SAEs  will be promptly  reported  to appropriate  institutional 
contacts.  
 
5. ANTICIPATED  BENEFITS  
For youth  participating the current study, the potential benefit of taking part in the clinical trial 
is the possible improvement  in working  memory,  related  executive  function  skills,  and delay  
discounting,  as well as subsequent improvement in health -related behaviors.  
More broadly,  for all youth participants,  knowledge gained from this study will inform future 
substance use prevention efforts and will also help in refining dissemination procedures in 
low-resource communities. Thus, the primary benefit of the proposed research to the 
community is to inform futu re interventions  that may reduce  rates  of adolescent  substance  use 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: 9 Page  11 of 26  and improve  public  health  in this traditionally underserved area.  
 
6. RENUMERATION/COMPENSATION  
Youth Intervention Group:  Compensation  will be skewed  such  that rates  of compensation  will 
increase  across  the course of the intervention.  
Child:  
1. Baseline  assessment  = $[ADDRESS_472901]-intervention  assessment  = $15 
3. Key informant  interview  = $20 
4. Training  session  = 1 ticket  (that can be turned  in at regular  intervals  for prizes)  
5. Improvement  = 1 ticket/improved training  module  
6. Certificate  of completion  
 
Parent:  
1. Baseline  assessment  = $[ADDRESS_472902]-intervention  assessment  = $25 
3. Key informant  interview  = $25 
Tickets issued for improved training modules are based upon the completion of computer 
training  modules  (AKA  challenge  tasks).  Tickets  can be turned  in for prizes  under  $[ADDRESS_472903] and deemed commensur ate with other interventions 
currently being conducted in Detroit and Flint and not coercive to potential participants.  
 
Youth Focus Group:  Compensation will be $25/focus group provided by [CONTACT_377826].  
 
7. COSTS  
Participation  in the study is  at no cost to the participants.  
 
8. ALTERNATIVES  
There  are no other  alternatives  to participation.  
 
9. CONSENT  PROCESS  AND  DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent and assent will be obtained at the initial screening assessment. As part of 
this process, participants, and guardians will be given a detailed description of the purpose 
and procedures of the study, emphasizing our policy regarding privacy  and confidentiality. 
Only individuals  giving  informed  and voluntary  consent/assent  will be enrolled.  All consent  and 
assent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_377827].  
 
10. WITHDRAWAL  OF SUBJECTS  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time with no penalty themselves or 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: 9 Page  12 of 26  their healthcare  or insurance  plans/benefits.  In the event  of safety  concerns  and/or  due to the 
participant having exceptional difficulties with completing the questionnaires, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_377803].  
 
11. PRIVACY  AND  CONFIDENTIALITY  
For this study, we will ensure the separation of de -identified participant data from protected 
health information (PHI) by [CONTACT_377828]. De -identified data will be stored 
using secure, password -protected software hosted on HFHS servers. All participant 
information  will be referenced  using  participant  identification  numbers.  De-identified  participant 
responses to study measures will be collected and stored using REDCap, a software toolset 
and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of data. Only the 
investigators/authorized staff will have access to the REDCap database. We will only keep a 
record of number of screenings completed and reasons for ineligibility.  
 
We will need to collect names and demographic information for participants who complete 
consent.  Once  collected,  data will be de-identified.  The file containing  the information  that links 
participant names to their IDs will again be stored in password -protected files on the HIPAA 
compliant, secure REDCap file. Only investigators will have access to this file. The key linking 
identifiable information to the participant ID will be destr oyed five years after publication of 
study results.  
 
Once  data are collected,  all data will be de-identified,  i.e. names  will be removed  and 
participants will be assigned ID numbers.  
 
As part of the informed  consent  process,  participants  will be advised  that they may decline  to 
answer any questions. This will provide participants with the assurance of confidentiality 
around sensitive personal information relating to substance use and mental health. All 
personnel working on the project will be educated about the importance of r especting 
participants’ rights to confidentiality. Investigators will all complete and maintain ethical and 
CITI training.  All study  personnel  will be appropriately  trained  in the ethical  conduct  of human 
subjects’ research.  
 
Study  files will be maintained  until five years  after the publication  of study  results  in line with 
the guidelines of the American Psychological Association.

12. DATA  AND  SAFETY  MONITORING  PLAN  
All research staff (including community liaisons) will complete relevant training in the 
protection of human subjects. Being proximally located to the data collection site, [CONTACT_321683] 
will ensure that all participants meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and are appropriate for  
inclusion  in the study.  Data  will be monitored  on an ongoing  basis  and reviewed  with the PIs at 
regular intervals. As data will be entered electronically, we do not foresee any concerns with 
inconsistent responses; however, should this problem arise, rese arch staff will review all 
entries and determine a resolution.  
All participant data and records will be maintained in a secure location accessible only 
to project staff. All data files will be stored under a randomly -assigned subject number and no 
identifiable  information  will be included  in participant  files. Consent  forms  and other  documents 
with identifiable information will be kept in a separate, secured location. Any computers 
containing electronic data files will be password -protected and accessible only by [CONTACT_25617]. Only the PIs and the database administr ator will have access to the data. Analyses 
will be conducted only after all data is collected, deidentified, and cleaned, thus limiting the 
possibility of deidentification. Any findings shared with community stakeholders will be done in 
aggregate  and reflecting  mean -level trends.  We will also utilize  the Certificate  of Confidentiality  
provided  by [CONTACT_377829],  within 
the bounds of the law.  
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as defined by [CONTACT_377830], will be monitored by [CONTACT_377831]. AEs will be 
recorded  by [CONTACT_377832]. The PIs will then prepare a written report for submission to the HFHS IRB and the 
appropriate NIH program officer. The report will include information regarding whether these 
events were expected or unexpected, the severity of the event , a bri ef narrative of the event, 
and a determination regarding any causal connection between the event and the ongoing 
research study. Any such events will also be included in the annual progress report send to 
NIH. In the unlikely event an SAE were to occur, re search staff will alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].  
Subsequent reports to the HFHS IRB and NIH will be completed within 24 hours. The 
Version  Date:  5/16 / 2 0 2 4  
Version  #: 9 Page  14 of 26  expedited  notice  will be followed  by a detailed  report  regarding  the event  as soon  as possible.  
All reports regarding events listed above will include study details (e.g. the title and 
grant  number  of the study  and PI [CONTACT_2300]),  details  of the event  (date  of occurrence,  date that the 
MPIs became aware of these concerns), a detailed description of the event (including its 
impact on the participant), a detailed description of any steps taken to address the event, an 
attestation  (including  dates)  that all required  individuals/boards  (including  the HFHS  IRB) have 
been notified, and any changes to the protocol or procedures that are proposed or 
implemented to prevent future occurrence of similar events.  
This plan will also be reviewed  by [CONTACT_377833],  which  will provide 
additional feedback to ensure the study team is addressing community -specific concerns 
regarding data and safety monitoring.  
 
13. QUALIFICATIONS  OF THE INVESTIGATOR(S)  
[CONTACT_321683]  is an Associate  Scientist  at the Center  for Healthy  Policy  & Health  Services  
Research in Henry Ford Health Systems. She earned her PhD in child clinical psychology 
from Vanderbilt  University  with a minor  specialization  in quantitative  methods.  Her program  of 
research centers on identifying risk factors for the onset of substance use in children and 
adolescents (e.g. Felton et al., 2015) as well as examining the role of early environmental  
and parenting factors associated with the trajectory of drug and alcohol use over time (e.g.  
Felton et al., 2020). She has specific expertise in assessment, research design, and data 
modeling  techniques,  having  served  as the PI, Co-I, or statistical  consultant  on a number  of 
NIH-funded grants and published over 65 manuscripts and book chapters on the 
development of vulnerabilities to mental and behavioral health problems and targeted 
preventative interventions to reduce these risk factors.

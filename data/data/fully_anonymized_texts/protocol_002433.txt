OVERALL RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 04:
This amendment incorporates clarifications concerning the analysis populations used for the blood 
tumor mutational burden (bTMB) and tissue tumor mu tational burden (tTMB) cohorts and the type 
of analysis (interim or fin al primary) bei ng performed. E nrollment into the bTMB high population 
was closed in Dec-2019, as the required number of participants needed for final analysis was met.
Enrollment into the tTMB high population rema ined ongoing to complete enrollment for this 
participant population. Because of the varying enrollment rates, the bTMB final analysis will 
coincide with the tTMB interim efficacy analysis, leading to the need for clarifi cation of the 
primary analysis populations for both analyses. Both of these analyses will take place after study-wide randomization has completed.
•The final analysis population for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR] based on 
blinded independent central review [BICR] assessments) for the bTMB high population will be all participants in the salvage setting randomized before the study closed enrollment to this 
cohort in Dec-2019; the database cutoff (last patient last visit [LPLV]) for the analysis will be 
at least [ADDRESS_602565] treatment and after completion of study-widerandomization.
•The primary analysis population for the tTMB interim analysis (ORR based on BICR 
assessments) is limited to tTMB high participants in the salvage setting randomized at least 12 months prior to the LPLV for the analysis to allow sufficient time to demonstrate durability of response. Study-wide randomization will comple te prior to the LPLV for the analysis.
•The final analysis of the primary e ndpoint (ORR based on BICR assessments) for the tTMB 
high population in the salvage setting will be performed at least [ADDRESS_602566] been randomized.
Protocol Amendment 04 incorporates changes per previous Administrative Letters 04, 05, 06, and 
07, and updates to align with current [COMPANY_016] Company (BMS) guidelines for 
nivolumab studies (including current nivolu mab Investigator Brochure [IB] version 19, addendum 
version 1) and s
evere acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) guidance.

1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 2 Study of Nivolumab in Combination 
with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470230] (TMB-H)
(CheckMate 848: CHECKpoint pathway and nivoluMAb clinical Trial Evaluation 848)
Study Phase: 2
Rationale: Blockade of the PD-[ADDRESS_602572] anti-tumor 
immune responses. Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 bloc king antibody, has demonstrated overall survival 
benefit in multiple tumors including non-squamous cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, 
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and head and neck cancer. Recent data across multiple tumor types 
support the hypothesis that patients with tumors harboring increased somatic mutations due to 
DNA mismatch-repair deficiencies are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and 
anti-CTLA-4 blockade. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) refers to the total number of somatic mutations th at exist within a tumor’s genome. A subset of these mutations may result in expressed 
proteins that are not recognized by [CONTACT_40689]’s immune system as self, and therefore has the potential 
to be immunogenic and more susceptible to an immune-mediated anti-tumor response. The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the clin ical activity of nivolumab in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470231].
Tumors with a high mutational burden may have a higher number of neo-antigens which, in 
principle, would be expected to be more immunogenic than tumors with comparatively low 
mutational burden.1Therefore, high TMB has been hypothesized to correlate with improved 
efficacy in patients treated wi th immune-oncology (IO) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This hypothesis has been 
supported by [CONTACT_470359][INVESTIGATOR_014], tumor types, and lines of treatment.
The available data suggest that, in addition to PD-L1, TMB is also an important predictive 
biomarker of the clin ical efficacy of IO therapy. Therefore, patients of TMB-H across multiple 
solid tumors will be selected for participation in this clinical study
Study Population:
For entry into the study, the following criteria MUST be met.
Key Inclusion Criteria (See protocol Section 6.[ADDRESS_602573] of criteria)

Overall Design:
The study will enroll participants diagnosed with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors with 
either tissue (tTMB) or blood TMB (bTMB) ≥ 10 mut/Mb (TMB-H). Both tissue and blood TMB 
will be assessed prior to randomization. 
Participants without a prior known tTMB-H status available via F1CDx assay, or a prior known 
bTMB-validated CLIA result available from Foundati on Medicine, wi ll provide consent for pre-
screening and TMB status determination, but cons ent for further screening procedures and study 
treatment should be deferred until TMB-H status is  established. Screening process can continue 
when the participant’s status is TMB-H. 
Participants with a prior known result of tTMB-H via F1CDx assay or bTMB-H from 
Foundation Medicine may proceed immediately with  full screening procedures. Both tissue and 
blood TMB will be assessed prior to randomization. Prior results of tTMB or bTMB obtained from 
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602576] of three phases: screening, treatment, 
and follow-up. 
Efficacy will be evaluated using tumor specific response criteria, ie, RECIST 1.1 for solid tumors2
and RANO criteria3for primary CNS tumors. 
The primary analysis of BICR-assessed ORR in participants with either bTMB-H or tTMB-H will 
be conducted after a minimum of 12 months following LPFT. This study will end when analysis of the primary endpoint is comp lete. Additional survival analysis may be conducted for up to 
5 years beyond the primary endpoint analysis.
Details regarding the assessments to be pe rformed during these phases are outlined in Section 2
Schedule of Activities.

participation. Participants will be closely mo nitored for AEs throughout the study. Blood samples 
will be collected for safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker analysis. 
Participants with progressive disease while on treatment with nivolumab monotherapy may be 
allowed to be treated beyond progression with ni volumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Arm B rollover – see 
Section 7.4.3 ).
Number of Participants: 
The number of randomized participants will ra nge from approximately 183 to  342 based on 1) the 
actually observed concordance between tTMB-H and bTMB-H, and 2) the new bTMB cutoff 
determined by [CONTACT_470360]. The per tumor type cap is approximately 15% of the total sample size.
A total of 76 TMB-evaluable subjects in the salvage setting treated with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470237]. The sample size determination was not 
based on power consideration, but to provide precision on the estimation of ORR and DOR for TMB-high participants treated with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The following table summarizes the exact 95% CIs for a sample size of 76 in the nivol umab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470238] 25%-50%.

Data Monitoring Committee: Yes
To provide independent oversight of safety, efficacy, and study conduct, a data monitoring 
committee (DMC) will be instituted. The DMC will meet regularly to ensure that participant safety 
is carefully monitored. The DMC will convene additional ad hoc meetings if necessary. Following each meeting, the DMC will recommend continu ation, modification, or discontinuation of the 
study based on observed toxicities. The DMC will review the interim analysis results and determine whether the cut-off value for bTMB should be adjusted for the first interim analysis and whether criteria for superiority are met at th at time for the tTMB interim analysis; the DMC will 
also review the bTMB final analysis results. A separate DMC charter w ill describe the activities 
of this committee in more detail.

Table 2-1: Screening Procedural Outline (CA209848)
Procedure Screening Visit Notes
Pre-screening for TMB-H Participants must have TMB-H status (tissue and/or blood) confirmed via F1CDx assay (tissue) or bTMB-validated 
CLIA assay from Foundation Medicine (blood) prior to signing consent for other eligibility procedures (see details in
Section 6.1 ).
Prior TMB-H results ≥ 10 mut/Mb obtained from F1CDx assay (tissue) or bTMB-validated CLIA assay from 
Foundation Medicine (blood) are acceptable for eligibility purposes. 
Participants who do not have TMB-H status (tissue or blood) with the assays described above must sign a pre-
screening informed consent form and have tissue and / or blood samples provided for central testing. See 
details below for Biomarkers Collection.
Both tissue and blood results obtained with these assays are required prior to randomization, and both can be done 
under the pre-screening, if not previously available ; as long as at least one of the results is ≥ 10 mut/Mb (tTMB ≥ 
10 mut/Mb or the new cutoff value of bTMB determined by [CONTACT_941] 1stinterim analysis), the participant may sign 
the study Informed Consent Form and proceed to additional screening procedures.

Foundation One or any other assays are not acceptable.
For patients without prior tTMB results from F1CDx: A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
tumor tissue (FFPET) block (preferred) or 25 unstained slides of tumor tissue (archival tissue or 
fresh biopsy) is required. 10 slides are required for TMB eligibility evaluation and 15 slides are 
required for PD-L1 and other tumor-based biomarker evaluations.
For patients with prior tTMB results from F1CDx: A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor 
tissue (FFPET) block (preferred) or 15 unstained slides of tumor tissue (archival tissue or fresh 
biopsy) is required from all participants for PD-L1 and other tumor-based biomarker evaluations. 
Fresh biopsies are preferred; however, archival samples are acceptable if obtained within 
9 months of signing the initial consent form ([pre-screening] and no additional intervening 
therapy (excluding palliative therapy) in between).
If a fresh biopsy is warranted, the participant must have a lesion that can be biopsied at an 
acceptable clinical risk as judged by [CONTACT_470361].

Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602602] anti-tumor immune 
responses. Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 blocking an tibody, has demonstrated overall survival benefit 
in multiple tumors including non-squamous cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, 
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and head and neck cancer. Recent data across multiple tumor types support the hypothesis that patients with tumors harboring increased somatic mutations due to 
DNA mis match-repair deficiencies are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-
4 blockade. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) refers to the total number of somatic mutations that 
exist within a tumor’s genome. A subset of these mutations may result in expressed proteins that 
are not recognized by [CONTACT_40689]’s immune system as  self, and therefore has the potential to be 
immunogenic and more susceptible to immune-mediated anti-tumor response. The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinical activity of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470231].

principle, would be expected to be more immunogenic than tumors with comparatively low 
mutational burden.

efficacy in patients treated wi th immune-oncology (IO) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This hypothesis has been 
supported by [CONTACT_470359][INVESTIGATOR_014], tumor types, and lines of treatment. The 
first published study of TMB as a biomarker of clinical ou tcomes was reported by [CONTACT_102432], 
where high TMB (TMB-H) was found to be associated with efficacy in metastatic melanoma 
patients treated with anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_602604] of TMB on efficacy of a PD-1/L1 inhibitor.
3This analysis demonstrated that in patients 
with TMB-H, the ORR was numerically higher in the nivolumab arm versus the chemotherapy 
arm (47% vs 28%) and the median PFS was longer in the nivolumab arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (9.7 vs 5.8 mo., HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). OS was notable, though similar (18.3 vs 18.8 mo. and 1 year OS rates of 64% vs 60%, respectively), between the arms in patients 
with TMB-H, although of note, 68% of patients in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent 
nivolumab.

including ORR 45.3% vs 26.9%, DOR ≥1 yr 68% vs 25%, PFS rate at 1 yr 43% vs 13%, and mPFS 
of 7.2 vs 5.4 months. Preliminary analysis on OS wa s also encouraging, and the clinical benefits 
are independent of PD-L1 expression. These findings further support TMB as an important, 
predictive and independent biomarker for clinical efficacy.
Recently, Yarchoan M, et al suggested a s ignificant positive linear c orrelation between higher 
TMB and increased ORR after analyzing 27 tumor types/subtypes treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
monotherapy, which highlights the potential st rong relationship between TMB and the clinical 
activity of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_470243].6

Taken together, the available data suggest that,  in addition to PD-L1, TMB is also an important 
predictive biomarker of the clin ical eff icacy of IO therapy. Therefore, patients of TMB-H across 
multiple solid tumors will be selected for participation in this clinical study.

3.1.4 Rationale for Key Endpoints
Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by a blinded independent central review committee is the 
primary e ndpoint of this study. ORR is a v alidated clinical endpoint in many tumors, and in patients 
in whom a durable tumor response is achieved can be expected to derive a survival benefit from 
therapy.10
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Independent Central Review 
The primary endpoint of ORR will be based on centrally-assessed radiologic tumor measurements 
(and additional clinical indicators, where applicable) using standard disease-specific response 
criteria. A centrally -assessed ORR will provide standardized assessment of progression and 
response using disease-specific response criteria. For this purpose, radiologic imaging from this study will be trans mitted to an imaging core lab for analysis by a Blinded Independent Central 
Review (BICR) committee. Please see Section 9.1 and CA209848 Imaging Manual for additional 
information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Investigator Assessed Response
Investigator-assessed radiologic tumor measuremen ts (and additional clinical indicators, where 
applicable) using standard disease-specific response criteria will closely reflect observed clinical 
practice responses, and w ill allow for real-time tr eatment decisions based on the most 
comprehensive, available, clinical information for the individual participant.
3.1.5 Rationale for Exploratory Biomarker Assessments 
An effective anti-tumor immune response relies on a number of interactions, beginning with the 
immune system recognizing the tumor cell as fo reign. One important means of recognition is the 
expression of unique tumor-specific peptides (i.e ., neoantigens) that are processed, presented via 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and subsequently recognized by T cells as 
immunologic targets. This triggers an immune response driven by T-cell activation, cytokine 
production, peripheral expansion, and infiltration of effector cells that ultimately k ill the tumor 
cell.
A number of factors can suppress an effective anti-tumor response, including a lack of str ong 
tumor neoantigens recognized by T cells, downregulation of the MHC on cancer cells, minimal 
activation or inactivation of  T cells, poor infiltration of effector cells into tumors, and the actions 
of immune checkpoint proteins (e.g., programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], programmed death 
ligand 1 [PD-L1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]) and tumor 
microenvironment modulators (e.g., regulatory T c ells [TRegs] and myelo id-derived suppressor 
cells [MDSCs]), which limit the strength and duration of immune responses.

As described by [CONTACT_470366].,11requirements for T-cell-mediated tumor control (and targets for 
potential biomarker selection for immuno-oncology therapy) include: tumor foreignness, general 
immune status, immune cell infiltration, absence of checkpoints, absence of soluble inhibitors, absence of inhibitory tumor metabolism, and tumor sensitivity to immune effectors. 
Tumor PD-L1 is already an established clinically validated biomarker with available 
complementary/companion dia gnostic tests for anti-PD-1/L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_470245]. The 
utility of tumor PD-L1 as the sole predictive biomarker is limited by [CONTACT_470367]-off value for PD-L1 expression that reliably selects all patients likely to benefit from immuno-
oncology therapy. For example, in SCCHN study CA209141, while improved efficacy was 
observed with increasing PD-L1 expression, durable responses were also observed in patients with 
PD-L1 non-expressing tumors.
Due to the complexity of the immune system and its response to immuno-oncology therapy, 
additional biomarkers beyond PD-L1 are being i nvestigated to help clinicians to select therapy for 
patients most likely to benefit (e.g., those ‘immune-primed’ patients with one or more 
tumor/immune characteristics that indicate a positive response to immuno-oncology therapy) or to 
suggest alternative combinations beyond immuno-oncology therapy alone. Exploratory biomarkers that may be assessed in this study include but are not limited to: tumor gene expression 
profiling, PD-L2, CD8, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

3.2 Background
OPDIVO
®(nivolumab), is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)12blocking antibody 
approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, previously tr eated metastatic squamous non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma 
in the [LOCATION_002] and in Japan for unresectable melanoma, kidney cancer, and NSCLC, and is 
in clinical development for the treatment of other malignancies. Nivolumab has also demonstrated 
clinical activity as combination therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195176], NSCLC, RCC, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The majority of responses were durable and exceeded 6 months. 
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 224,573 participants treated to date. Overall, 
the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is manageable and generally consistent across 
completed and ongoing clinical trials with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached at any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs to 
nivolumab dose level. Most AEs were low grade (Grade 1 - 2) with relatively few related high grade (Grade 3 - 4) AEs. 
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602611] that ar e potentially associated with the use of 
nivolumab, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) has identified select AEs based on the following 
principles: AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_470246]-modulating; AEs that may requi re immunosuppression  (e.g. corticosteroids) as 
part of their management; AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe 
toxicity; AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby [CONTACT_368473]. 
Based on these principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across studies 
of nivolumab monotherapy, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, rash, endocrinopathies, and hypersensitivi ty/infusion reaction events are currently considered to be 
select AEs. The majority of these AEs have been managed successfully with supportive care and, 
in more severe cases, a combination of dose delay, permanent discontinuation, and/or initiation of systemic corticosteroids. 
This protocol will generate efficacy and safety data on nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470247], metastatic and unresectable select tumor types 
of TMB-H (excluding melanoma, RCC, NSCLC a nd hematologic malignancies), some of which 
have not been previously examined in clinical trials.
3.2.1 Mechanism of Action of Nivolumab 
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors  can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by [CONTACT_20397]. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an  adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses. 
13,14,15. 
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to br eak the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_470368]. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negative co-s timulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by [CONTACT_941] T- cell r eceptor (TCR).16Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family of T-cell co-s timulatory receptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA 4, ICOS, and BTLA.17PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL-10, IL- 13, interferon- γ (IFN-γ) and Bcl-xL. PD-[ADDRESS_602612] genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.

Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for both single-
agent OPDIVO and OPDIVO with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
OPDIVO as a single agent: The PK of single-agent nivolumab was studied in patients over a dose 
range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a singl e dose or as multiple doses of OPDIVO as a 60-
minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3 w eeks. Nivolumab clearance (CL) decreases over time, 
with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline values of 24.5% 
(47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean stead y-state clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%) 
in patients with metastatic tumors; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically r elevant. 
Nivolumab clearance does not decrease over time in pa tients with completely resected melanoma, 
as the geometric mean population clearance is 24% lower in this patient population compared with patients with metastatic melanoma at steady state. The geometric mean volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss) (CV%) is  6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 25 
days (77.5%). Steady-state concentr ations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when 
administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was 3.7-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The predicted exposure (Cavg and Cmax) of nivolumab after a 30-minute infusion is 
comparable to that observed with a 60-minute infusion.
OPDIVO with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: When OPDIVO 1 mg/kg was administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 29%, and the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470262]. When OPDIVO 3 mg/kg was administered 
in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, the CL of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470263].
When OPDIVO was administerd in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the presence of anti-nivolumab

antibodies increased the CL of nivolumab by 20% and the CL of ip ilimumab was unchanged in 
presence of anti-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470236].
Specific Populations: The population PK analysi s suggested that the following factors had no 
clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), weight (35 to 160 
kg), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1 expression, solid tumor type, tumor size, renal 
impairment, and mild hepatic impairment. 
Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was evaluated 
by a population PK analysis in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate 
(eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients 
with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function .
Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was 
evaluated by [CONTACT_470370] (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the ULN and AST greater than 
ULN or TB greater than [ADDRESS_602623]) and in HCC patients with moderate hepatic impairment (TB greater than 1.[ADDRESS_602624]). No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients with mild/moderate hepaticimpairment.

Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy as well as in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470264] 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. Th ere was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
A pattern of immune-r elated adverse events has been defined, for which management al gorithms 
have been developed; these are provided in  Appendix [ADDRESS_602625] high-grade events were manageable 
with the use of corticosteroids or hormone re placement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed

are also available in the nivolumab IB.

therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], thus eliciting improved efficacy in patients treated with IO therapi[INVESTIGATOR_470265]. Of the tumor types included in this trial, despi[INVESTIGATOR_470266].: 04

profile of nivolumab and the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470268]. 
3.3.2 Adolescent Patients
The PK characteristics (e.g., steady-state peak and trough concentrations and terminal half-life) of 
many antibody-based therapeutic proteins are e ssentially comparable between pediatrics and 
adults once the effect of body size on PK is taken into consideration.27,28Research on
immunotherapy for chil dhood tumors is still preliminary, but av ailable data suggested similar PK 
profile of nivolumab to adult patients, and did not reveal significant safety concerns that are 
different from adult population (see Section 5.5.3 ). A report of the ongoing COG trial
ADVL1412 (See Section 3.2.4 ) indicated good tolerability among the [ADDRESS_602628] been -studiedand found to be well-tolerated. The potential benefit is that some or all of the TMB-H tumor
types in this study will be sensitive to nivolumab alone and/or in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
thus yielding clinical benefit in these adolescent patients.
The benefit-risk information regarding adolescen t participants is not applicable for sites in 
Belgium or the Netherlands as adolescents will not be included in these countries.

5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The aim of this basket trial is to evalu ate the efficacy of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470269]-H advanced or metastatic solid tumors excluding melanoma, NSCLC and RCC. The 
clinical benefit of nivolumab and nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470270] n with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470271], 
particularly in tumors with TMB-H which are hypothesized to be more sensitive to immune checkpoint targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. CA209848 study w ill explore the clinical response and safety in 
participants with TMB-H. 
5.4.1 TMB Cutoff and Stratification
High level of TMB is an emerging predictive biomarker for favorable clinical benefit in response 
to IO therapy, however a universal definition of “TMB high” has not been established. Most 
melanomas have a mutational load greater than 10 mutants/megabase (mut/Mb), and a large body 
of evidence demonstrated higher clinical efficacy in melanoma treated with IO therapy compared to many other tumor types which have less than 10 mut/Mb. In melanoma, nivolumab in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470272]. In CA209568, in response to the treatment of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470273], the ORR increased with higher TMB, and peaked at 10 mut/Mb (9% at <5 mut/Mb, 15% at ≥5-<10 mut/Mb, 44% at ≥ 10-<15 mut/Mb, and 39% at ≥15 mut/Mb). These 
findings suggest that TMB at 10 mut/Mb is an optimal cutoff for first line NSCLC patients.Recently, in CA209227, a phase [ADDRESS_602632] lin e NSCLC patients, nivolumab combined with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470274]-H at a cutoff of ≥10 mut/Mb. Goodman A et al showed that with a TMB cut off of ≥20 mut/Mb, 
diverse tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC and some rare tumors, responded well to anti-
PD-1/anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_602633] chosen the TMB-H cut off for enrollment as ≥ 10 mut/Mb to maximize the probability of 
inclusion of potential responders. Participants at enrollment will also be stratified by [CONTACT_470373] 16 
mut/Mb to ensure even distribution of participants  with relatively low TMB and relatively high 
TMB between the [ADDRESS_602634] line vs second line and beyond between the 2 arms. This is to minimize 
potential imbalance of differential response underlined by [CONTACT_470374], and allow possible TMB–response analysis based on stratification of prior line of therapy.

5.4.3 Exclusion of Melanoma, NSCLC and RCC
Currently, multiple anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and/or anti-CTLA4 have been approved for Melanoma and 
NSCLC as first or second line tr eatment. D ata from CA209227 highlighted superior clinical 
benefit of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470275], which may provide additional effective treatment option for this population. The 
probability of identifying IO naïve participants with  these two tumor types is considerably low. 
RCCs are characterized by [CONTACT_470375], and have relatively low overall TMB.32,33Several 
analyses suggest that clinical response to IO therapy in RCC patients is independent of TMB, thus 
RCC is excluded from this study.34,35
5.4.4 Rationale for Treatment with Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470276]. To maximize the potential clinical bene fit for the patient, upon confirmed disease 
progression, patients who are initially randomized to the nivolumab monotherapy (arm B) have the option to receive nivolumab in combination ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at the discretion of the investigator 
and upon discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor.
5.4.[ADDRESS_602635] of the responses occur early, with a median time to response of 2-4 months, and emerging data suggests that benefit can be maintained in the absence of continued 
treatment. A recent analysis in a melanoma study s uggests the majority of patients who discontinue 
nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470277].
36Furthermore, a limited duration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], includi ng only [ADDRESS_602636] that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be sufficient 
for long term benefit. CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expansion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivo lumab in patients with previously  treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 participants with NSCLC ), specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years.
Among 16 participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discontinued nivolumab 
after completing 2 years of treatment, 12 par ticipants were alive >5 years and remained 
progression-free without any subsequent ther apy. In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the overall 
survival (OS) curve begins to plateau after 2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 
3 years.38These survival outcomes are similar to phase 3 studies in previously treated NSCLC, in 
which nivolumab treatment was con tinued until progressi on or unacceptable tox icity (2 year OS

rates of 23% and 29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16% -18% for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC 
respectively).[ADDRESS_602637], a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously tr eated patients with NSCLC, s uggesting that treatment beyond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed1 year of nivolumab therapy were randomized to either continue or stop treatment, with the option 
of retreatment upon progression. Am ong 163 patients  still on tr eatment at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant improvement in 
progression-free survival (PFS) compared to thos e who were randomized to  stop treatment, with 
median PFS (post-ra ndomization) not reached  vs 10.3 months, respectively; HR=0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.[ADDRESS_602638]-randomization, there also was a trend for patients on continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.20]). Of note, 
the PFS curves in both groups plateau approximately 1 year after randomization (i .e., 2 years after 
treatment initiation), suggesting that there may be minimal benefit in extending treatment beyond 
a total of [ADDRESS_602639] that there is minimal if any benefit derived from continuing IO 
treatment beyond two years in advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for additional toxicity with l onger term tr eatment. There fore, in 
this study, treatment will be given for a maximum of 2 years from the start of study treatment.
5.5 Justification for Dose
5.5.1 Rationale for Nivolumab Monotherapy Dose Selection
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including 
melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), head and 
neck (H&N) and urothel ial carcinoma (UC), using body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg), and 
has been safely administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of various tumors, including melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and UC, 
using a regimen of either nivolumab 240 mg Q2W or nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.
The nivolumab 480 mg Q4W dose was selected for this study based on clinical data and modeling 
and simulation approaches using population pharmacokinetics (PPK) and exposure response (ER) analyses examining relationships between nivolumab exposures and efficacy (eg. OS, OR) and 
safety responses, using data from studies in multiple tumor types (melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC) 
with body weight-normalized dosing (mg/kg).
41The PPK analyses have shown that exposure to 
nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered 
Q2W, and no clinically meaningful differences in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of dist ribution were found to increase as body weight 
increases but less than proportionally with increasing weight, ind icating that milligram-per-
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602640] of body weight on nivolumab PK. 
Using the PPK and ER models, nivolumab exposures and probabilities of efficacy responses and risks of AEs were predicted following nivolumab  480 mg Q4W and compared to those following 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, the initially approved dose. The overall distributions of average nivolumab steady-state exposures (Cavgss) are comparable following administration with either 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or nivolumab 480 mg Q4W. Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is predicted to result in approximately 43% greater steady-stat e peak concentrations (Cmaxss) compared to 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W; however, these exposures are predicted to be lower than the exposure ranges observed at doses up to nivolumab 10 mg/ kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program. 
Although the Cmaxss of nivolumab is expected to be greater following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W compared to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, the predicted Cmaxss following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W 
is well below the median Cmaxss achieved following administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, a safe and tolerable dose level ( Figure 5.5.1-1 ).
Figure 5.5.1-1: Predicted  Nivolumab Cmax (with 90% PI) versus Time by [CONTACT_470376]-safety analysis demonstrated that the exposure margins for safety are maintained following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, and the predicted  risks of AE-DC/D, AE Grade 3+, and AE-
IM Grade 2+, are predicted to be similar following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W relative to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W across tumor types. Safety analyses using available data following nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W and 10 mg/kg Q2W administration i ndicated there were no differences in AE 
profiles across body weight  groups. Fin ally, initial evidence demonstr ates that following

[IP_ADDRESS] Population Pharmacokinetics of Nivolumab
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolu mab has been assessed in completed and ongoing 
Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in adult subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, 
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in addi tion to other tumor types.47
The PK of nivolumab as monotherapy was characterized by [CONTACT_470377]. Nivolumab clearance 
increased with bas eline body weight, es timated glomerular f iltration (eGFR), and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status > 0. The PPK analysis was performed 
using data from 1908 subjects who received nivol umab from the following studies: nivolumab 
monotherapy data from studies MDX- 1106-01, ONO-4538-01, ONO-4538- 02, MDX- 1106-03, 
CA209010, CA209063, and CA209037. Studies CA209004, CA209069, CA209066, and CA209067 provided PK data of nivolumab monotherapy as w ell as in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470279] (advanced melanoma) who received the proposed dosing 
regimens. The data from these studies also allowed for an evaluation of potential drug interactions between nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470280]. Thus, for 
this analysis, the covariates assessed included ADA status, baseline ECOG status, baseline eGFR, baseline body weight (BW), gender and co-administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
Co-administration with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg resulted in a modest increase in nivolumab CL of 
35% whereas co-administration with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg did not appear to have an effect on nivolumab CL. Presence of anti-nivolumab anti bodies increased nivolu mab CL by 25%, consistent 
with prior findings. In subjects with an ECOG performance status of > 0, nivolumab CL was 22% 
higher (based on median values). Male subjects had a median of 12% higher volume of distribution 
of central compartment (VC) than females. Ba seline body weight was identified as a signif icant 
covariate for both CL and VC and the magnitude of the effect of baseline eGFR on CL was not 
considered clinically relevant. Th e geometric mean CL, Vss, and terminal half-life of nivolumab 
were 9.83 mL/h, 7.62 L, and 24.1 days, respectively. When administered in combination, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 35%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].

The co-administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) with nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg and nivolumab 
3.0 mg/kg resulted in minimal changes in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470285] (- 7.5% and 11%, respectiv ely); however, 
sample sizes at these doses were small. The CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90904]-administered with 1 mg/kg nivolumab was estimated to be 1% higher (95% CI: 97.8 - 106) relative to the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470286], demonstrating that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470287]-administration of 1 mg/kg nivolumab.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Nivolumab as a single agent: The PK of single-agent nivolumab was studied in participants over 
a dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab 
as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3 weeks. Nivolumab clearance (CL) decreases 
over time, with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline 
values of 24.5% (47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%) in patients with metastatic tumors; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. Nivolumab CL does not decrease over time in patients with completely 
resected melanoma, as the geometric mean population clearance is 24% lower in this patient 
population compared with patients with metastatic me lanoma at steady state. The geometric 
mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) (CV%) is 6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 25 days (77.5%). Steady-state concentrations of nivolumab were 
reached by 12 weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation 
was 3.7-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The predicted exposure (Cavg and Cmax) of nivolumab after a 30-minute infusion is compar able to that observed with a 60-minute infusion.
Nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: When nivolumab 1 mg/kg was administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 29%, and the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470294]. When nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, the CL of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470295]. When nivolumab was administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the 
presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies increased the CL of nivolumab by 20%, and the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470296]-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470236].
Specific Populations: The population PK analysis suggested that the following factors had no 
clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), weight (35 to 160 
kg), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1 expressi on, solid tumor type, tumor size, renal
impairment, and mild hepatic impairment. 
Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was evaluated 
by a population PK analysis in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m
2), moderate 
(eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients 
with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function.
Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was 
evaluated by [CONTACT_470381] (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the ULN and AST greater than ULN or TB greater than [ADDRESS_602644]) and in patients with HCC with 
moderate hepatic impairment (TB greater than 1.[ADDRESS_602645]). No clinically 
important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients with mild/moderate hepatic impairment.

and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470297] 30 minutes’ duration 
will dimin ish the burden, provided that there is no change in the safety profile. Previous clinical 
studies of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470298] a 60-minute infusion duration for nivolumab and a 90-minute infusion 
duration for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 - 3 mg/kg dosing for bot h). However, both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_448138] 10 mg/kg with  the same infusion duration (ie, 60 minutes).
Establishing that nivolumab can be safely administered using a shorter infusion time (30 minutes) 
is under investigation. Previous clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy have used a 60-minute 
infusion duration wherein, nivolumab has been safely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long 
treatment periods. Infusion r eactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been 
uncommon across nivolumab clinical program. In CA209010, a dose association was observed for 
infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 m g/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 
18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1-2 and were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to 
present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration. The safety of nivolumab  3 mg/kg administered as a 30-min infusion 
was assessed in CA209153 in patients (n = 322) with previously  treated advanced NSCLC. 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful  differences in the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infus ion-related r eactions (of any cause or tr eatment-related) in patients 
administered nivolumab over a 30-minute infusion compared with that re ported for patients with 
the 60-minute infusion. Thus, it was shown that nivolumab can be safely infused over 30 minutes. 
Similarly, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In participants 
with advanced Stage II or Stage IV melanoma (CA184022 Study), where ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470299] a dose of 10 mg /kg, on-study drug related hypersen sitivity events (Grade 1/2) 
were reported in 1 participant (1.4%) in the 0.3 mg/kg and in 2 participan ts (2.8%) in the 10 mg/kg 
group. There were no drug-r elated hypersensitivity events re ported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across 
the 3 treatment groups, no Grade 3/4 drug-related hypersen sitivity events were reported and there 
were no reports of infusion reactions. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely 
administered as a 90-minute infusion in a la rge Phase 3 study in prostate cancer (CA184043) and 
as adjuvant therapy for Stage III melan oma (CA184029), with  infusion reactions occ urring in 
participants. Administering 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470300]-third of the 
10 mg/kg dose.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon 
across clinical studies of nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470301]. Overall, a change in safety profile is not anticipated with 30-minute i nfusions of nivolumab,

been treated). If re-enrolled, the part icipant must be re-consented.
The most current result prior to Randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2-1 , Screening Procedural 
Outline may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well-qu alified participan ts. Consultation 
with the Medical Monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular 
parameter is clinically relevant.
7 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigatio nal treatment(s), marketed  product(s), placebo or 
medical device intended to be administered to a st udy participant acc ording to the st udy 
randomizatio n or treatment allocation
Study treatment includes both Investigatio nal [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and can consist of the following:
An IP, also known as investigational med icinal product in some regions, is defined a 
pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing authori zation but used or assembled 
(formulated or package d) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized 
indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non-
IP.
IPs used in this trial are provided in Table 7-1. There are no non-IPs in this study.

•If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862], the participant should remain on the trial and continue to receive monitoring according to the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 .
A radiographic assessment/scan should be performed within 6 weeks of init ial investigator-

PD. The assessment of clinical benefit should be ba lanced by [CONTACT_470384][INVESTIGATOR_120992].
For the participants who continue nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470321], further progression is defined as following: 
1) For solid tumors, an additional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute 
increase from time of initial PD, this includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target 
lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable les ions compared to the time of initial PD.  
2) For CNS tumors, an additional approximately 12.5 % increase in tumor burden with a minimum 
5 mm absolute increase of either diameter from time of initial PD; this includes an increase in 
the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters (SPD) and the sum of one diameter with 
larger increase of all target lesions and/or new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. 
New lesions are considered  measureable at th e time of init ial progression if th e longest diameter
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

The following medications are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to treat a drug-related 
adverse event). Medications taken within [ADDRESS_602678] be recorded on the CRF.
•Immunosuppressive agents 
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 7.7.2 )
•Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-p alliative rad iation therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment 
of cancer)
•Any complementary medications (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) 
intended to treat the disease under study or provi de supportive care. Use of marijuana and its 
derivatives for treatment of symptoms relate d to cancer or cancer treatment are permitted if 
obtained by [CONTACT_102437] (even without a medical prescription) has been 
legalized locally.
•Any live / attenuated vaccine (eg varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)) during treatment and until [ADDRESS_602679] dose.
•Use of any additional noninvasive medical dev ice treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (eg,

7.7.2 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalation 
corticosteroids (with minimal system absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, for contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, 
delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction cau sed by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted. Prior p alliative 
radiotherapy must have been completed at least [ADDRESS_602681] dose of IP.

therapy.
The potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_470325]; 
however, anecdotal data suggests that it is tolerable. As concurrent radiotherapy and nivolumab 
have not been formally evaluated, in cases where p alliative radiotherapy is required for a tumor 
lesion, then nivolumab should be withheld for at least 1 week before, during, and 1 week after 
radiation. Participants should be closely monitored for any potential toxicity during and after 
receiving radiotherapy, and AEs should resolve to Grade ≤1 prior to resuming nivolumab.
7.7.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunos uppressive medications within 14 days of treatment 
assignment are excluded. Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_470326], and adrenal replacement steroid doses 
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
7.7.5 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’ s responsibility to determine, based on participant attributes (eg, 
allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging mod ality and contrast 
regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in 
this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency s hould be assessed as to whether or not they 
should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency (i e, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this participant population. In a ddition, participants are excluded from MRI if they 
have tattoos, met allic imp lants, pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an 
individual participant in this study rests with th e site radiologist, the investigator and the standard 
set by [CONTACT_61857].

7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to demons trate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS-supplied study treatment for the maximum tr eatment duration specified 
in protocol Section 7.1 . Study treatment will be provided via an extension of the study, a rollover
study requiring approval by [CONTACT_470387].

8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470327] 7.4.1. Discontinue nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143802], laboratory 
abnormality, or intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial 
clinical risk to the participant with continued nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45770].
Participants MUST discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of the investigator) for any of the 
following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact [CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously authorized by [CONTACT_104135]

Refer to the Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation 
and follow-up and for any further evaluations that can be completed.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator mu st immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/design ee of this event. In most cases, the study 
treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (e.g. dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Refer to Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_602687]-treatment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in th e participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment 
made for discontinuation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation 
criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met fo r ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470328], treatment with

reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be u tilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (e.g. suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be mo nitored during the follow-up phase via on-si te/local 
labs until all study drug-related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
Evaluate participant immediately to rule out cardiac or pulmonary toxicity if participant shows 
cardiac- or pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, abnor mal heart rate, or changes from baseline) or 
symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, palpi [INVESTIGATOR_814]).
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by [CONTACT_20468].

using RANO 2010 criteria53supplemented by [CONTACT_470389], as well as additional considerations as applicable e.g. adverse events or steroid
requirement. (See  Appendix 8 ).
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study 
Images will be submitted to an imaging core lab and may undergo blinded independent central 
review (BICR) at any time during the study. Prior to scanning the first participant sites should be 
qualified as well as understand the image acquisition guidelines and submission process as ou tlined 
in the CA209848 Imaging Manual provided by [CONTACT_186752]. For CNS participants, sites 
need to follow qualification procedures within the imaging manual to demonstrate the ability to 
perform required MRI sequences for this study.
Screening and on study tumor assessment will take place in accordance with the Section 2
Schedule of Activities, according to appropriate response criteria (Appendix 7 and Appendix 8). 
Any additional imaging that ma y demonstrate tumor response or progression (including scans 
performed at unscheduled timepoints and/or at an outside institution) should be co llected for 
RECIST 1.1 tumor assessment and submitted to the BICR.Scans should be performed until BICR confirmation of p rogression or treatment discontinuation 
(including treatment beyond progression), whichever occurs later.

9.1.2 Methods of Measurement
[IP_ADDRESS] Solid tumors Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all other known and/or suspected sites 
of disease should be performed for tumor asse ssments. Images should be acquired with slice 
thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap (contiguous). Ever y attempt should be made to 
image each participant using an identical acquisition protocol on the same scanner for all imaging 
timepoints. Tumor measurements should be made by [CONTACT_470390]. Change in tu mor measurements and tumor response to guide 
ongoing study treatment decisions will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_104145] 1.[ADDRESS_602694]-enhanced MRI of the, a bdomen, pelvis, and other known/suspected sites of 
disease should be obtained.
Should a participan t have contraindication for both MRI and CT intravenous contrasts, a non-
contrast CT of the chest and a non-contrast MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease should be obtained. 
Should a participant have contraindication for MRI (e.g., incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, a non -contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and 
other known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.Use of CT component of a PET-CT scanner : Combined modality scanning such as with PET-CT 
is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; 
therefore, the recommendations outlined here may ch ange rather quickly with time. At present, 
low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET- CT are of limited use in 
anatomically-based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested th at they should not be 
substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scans for anatomically-based 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_602695] (with IV and oral contrast) then the 
CT portion of the PET-CT can be used fo r RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_602696] 1.1 response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole mod ality used to assess cer tain 
non-target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone 
scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.
Bone scans may be collected per local standards, as clinically indicated.MRI of brain should be acquired as outlined in  Section 2 (Schedule of Activities). CT of the Brain 
(without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is contraindicated.

response possible is stable disease.
SDRequires all of the following: does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression;
stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs 
without confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging 
shows that this increase in corticosteroids was re quired because of disease progre ssion, the last scan 
considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent 
to the baseline dose.

9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_40198] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally au thorized repre sentative). 
The investigator and any designees are re sponsible for detecting, doc umenting, a nd reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3.Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (e.g. infection or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which were exacerbated by [CONTACT_104155] . Information supporting the assessment w ill be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of non-serious AE information (with  the exception of non-serious AEs related to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection) should begin at initiation of study treatment and for a minimum of 100 
days following discontinuation of study treatment and at the timepoints specified in the Schedule 
of Activities ( Section 2 ).
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to study drug, must be collected, in cluding those thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs and all AEs (SAEs and non-serious AE s) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS-
CoV-[ADDRESS_602700] be collected from the time of  signing the consent, including those thought 
to be associated with protocol -specified procedures and until 100 days following discontinuation 
of dosing.

Note: for participants who signed a pre-screening consent with submission of an archived 
tumor sample for eligibility assessment, SAE collection will start at the time of signature [CONTACT_470410]. For participants wh o signed a pre-screening consent to agree to 
collection of a fresh biopsy, SAE collection will start at the time of signature [CONTACT_470411]-screening informed consent.
For participants ra ndomized and never tr eated with study drug, SAEs should be co llected for [ADDRESS_602701] report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure, (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.
•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. 
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hoursof updated information being available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a d eath, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the invest igator must promptly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by [CONTACT_470392], when appropriate for the program or protocol.
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) should be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_602702] to whether it is considered
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediated, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution  or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatmen t as appropriate.

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by [CONTACT_104153] a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor w ill file it along with 
the Investigator Brochure and w ill notify the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate acc ording to  local 
requirements.
Sponsor or designee w ill be reporting adverse events to regu latory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA 
Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and investigators following local  and global guidelines and requirements.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_602704] 
dose of study treatment. For participants randomized/assigned to treatment and never treated with study drug, SAEs should be collected for [ADDRESS_602705] immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3.
If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment, or re-initiation of study treatment, a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has ended,

It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
9.2.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-rel ated laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see  Section 9.2 and Appendix 3  for reporting 
details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
•AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND•Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_602707], without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline

For non-US Sites
Additional research is optional for all study participants, except where retention and/or collection 
is prohibited by [CONTACT_44896], ethics committees, or institutional requirements. 
This collection for additional research is intended to expand the translational R&D capability at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and w ill support as yet undefi ned research aims that w ill advance our 
understanding of disease and options for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority requests for analysis, and advancement of pharmacodiagnostic development to better target drugs 
to the right patients. This may also include genetic/genomic exploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathways, progression and response to treatment etc. 
Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to samples or data for a dditional research will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study sponsor’s senior leaders in Research and Development (or designee) to 
ensure the research supports appropriate and well-defined scientific research activities.
•Residual tumor biopsy, residual whole blood and plasma from biomarker collection and PK

exome sequencing [WES], Next-Generation Sequencing [NGS], etc). Panels of specific genes will be performed to determine mutational burden and specific mutations that might affect response to nivolumab. Whole blood and plasma collection w ill follow the same timepoints as biomarker 
collection in Table 9.8-1 and Table 9.8-2 : Biomarker Tissue and Blood Samples: Arm B 
Nivolumab Monotherapy . Please see CA209848 Laboratory Manual for additional information.

9.10 Patient-Reported Outcomes
Participants, ≥18 years of age at baseline, will be asked to complete the 30-item European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Can cer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-
C30) and 3-level version of the EuroQol Group’s EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) after randomization but 
prior to first dose, at on-study clinic visits planned to occur every 4 weeks (nivolumab arm) or 6 
weeks (nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]) while on treatment, and at follow-up visits [ADDRESS_602715] commonly used quality of life instrument in oncol ogy 
trials. The instrument’s 30 items are divided among five functional scales (physical, role, 
cognitive, emotional, and social ), nine symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, 
insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global 
health/quality of life s cale. With the exception of two items included in the global health/quality 
of life scale, for which responses range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range 
from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very muc h). Raw scores for the QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0- 100 
metric such that higher values indicate better functioning or quality of life or a higher level of 
symptoms. The questionnaire uses a 1-week recall period.
The EQ-5D-3L56will be used to assess treatment effects on perceived health status and to generate 
utility data for health econo mic evalu ations. The EQ-5D-3L is a generic multi- attribute h ealth-
state classification system by [CONTACT_470397] 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is evaluated using 3 levels: no 
problems, some problems, and seve re problems . Responses to these 5 d imensions are converted 
into 1 of 243 unique EQ-5D health state descri ptions, which range between no problems on all 5 
dimensions ([ZIP_CODE]) to severe/extreme problems on all 5 d imensions ([ZIP_CODE]). Using appropriate 
country-specific value weighting algorithms, a res pondent’s self-described health state can be 
converted into a utility representing the societal desirability of his/her own health. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) allowi ng a respondent to rate his/her health on a

The questionnaires will be provided in the participant’s preferred la nguage, if available, and the 
EQ-5D-3L may be administered by [CONTACT_470398]- up. There exists a 
standardized guide that can be used to facilitate telephone administration of the EQ-5D-3L. If 
exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of measures using planned modalities, then alternate administration methods ma y be required after consultation with the 
Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. Table 2-2 through Table 2-5 provide i nformation 
regarding the timing of patient-reported outcomes assessments. 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
Sample size calculation is based on BICR-assessed ORR and DOR.
The two primary objectives are to estimate ORR in tissue TMB (tTMB) high participants in the
salvage setting and blood TMB (bTMB) high participants in the salvage setting enrolled in the
nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]. A key secondary objective is DOR in the nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772].
In CA209227 study, an ORR rate of 45.3% was obse rved for nivolumab in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470340] ≥10 mut/Mb population. In CA 209032, an ORR of 46% was 
observed for nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470341] 21% was 
observed for nivolumab.
57,58The target ORR chosen in the study is 40% for TMB-high 
participants treated with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
A total of 76 TMB-evaluable subjects in the salvage setting treated with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470237]. The sample size determination was not 
based on power consideration, but to provide precision on the estimation of ORR and DOR for
TMB-high participants treated with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The following table summarizes the exact 95% CIs for a sample size of 76 in the nivol umab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470238] 25% to50%.

76 36 0.47 (0.36, 0.59)
76 38 0.50 (0.38, 0.62)
In addition, with ORR of 40% for a sample size of 76 treated participants, the mean percentage of 
responders with DOR ≥ 6 months is 70%, and the corresponding 95% lower bound for the 
responders with DOR ≥ 6 months is 50%, based on [ZIP_CODE] simulations. The calculations assume 
the median DOR for nivolumab + ip ilimumab is 11.5 mont hs based on CA20903258and 
CA20901259studies. Note for an ORR rate of 10%, typ ical for standard of care in this refractory 
population, and a median DOR of 5.5 months, the proportion of responders with DOR ≥6 months 
is 47%.
Seventy-six (76) participants in the salvage setting are required for each of tTMB and bTMB for 
nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]. Based on the currently observed approximate
40% concordance between tTMB-H and bTMB-H in this study, the total sample size for nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470342] 122. Nivolumab monotherapy arm is a non-comparative arm to evaluate the contri bution of components. Approximately 183 to 342
participants will be ra ndomized into nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (n=122) and 
nivolumab monotherapy (n=61) in a 2:1 randomization ratio. Moreover, if concordance rate between tTMB-H and bTMB-H is x%, sample size for nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470342] 76[PHONE_9845]*x% and total sample size will be approximately 1.5*(76[PHONE_9845]*x%). For example, if  x=30% the total sample size will be 194 and if x is close to 0% the total 
sample size will be 228. Note the sample sizes(s) for the primary endpoint of ORR in each oftTMB-H and bTMB-H in nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470343] [ADDRESS_602717] 
interim analysis (see Section 10.3.6 ).
Should the tTMB-H population reach approximately [ADDRESS_602718] the overall pooled final eff icacy analysis, a cap of approximately 15% of participants per 
tumor type will be enforced.
The final analysis of the primary endpoint ORR based on BICR assessments for tTMB high 
population w ill be performed at least 12 months after all tTMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb participants in the 
salvage setting have been randomized and study rando mization is comp leted. Final analysis of the 
primary endpoint ORR based on BICR assessments for bTMB high population will be performed 
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602719] 12 months after approximately 76 participants with bTMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb (or higher bTMB 
cutoff determined by [CONTACT_316299]; see Section 10.3.6 ) in the salvage setting are randomized in 
the nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470344].
Enrollment into the bTMB high population was closed in Dec-2019; enrollment into the tTMB
high population r emained ongoing. Given the approximate 40% concordance between tTMB high
and bTMB high, a fraction of the tTMB high partici pants subsequently randomized into the study
are also bTMB high. These participants will not be  included in the primary bTMB efficacy analysis 
population (see Table 10.2-1 ).
There are two planned interim analyses. The firs t interim analysis will be used to determine the 
cut-off value for bTMB. The sec ond interim analysis will be used to assess efficacy in the tTMB 
high population. These interim analyses are described in Section 10.3.6 . The positive efficacy 
decision is determined when one or both primary endpoints exceed(s) a clinically relevant response rate. A search of ORR with salvage therapy yielded a relative wide range of responses ranging from 
no response to more than 30% in various tumor types.
60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78
Caution should be taken in referencing these observed ORRs given the limitations on small sample 
size and/or local definition of salvage therapy in some studies. Desp ite lack of  a clearly defined 
clinical response rate across different tumor types, recent approvals by [CONTACT_470399] a refractory/rare tumor setting with ORRs ranging from 
12-14%, including small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.12,79,80
There is no formal comparison of ORR between treatment arms (and within tTMB and bTMB 
populations). However, a 95% confidence interval for the difference in ORR between the tr eatment 
arms will be computed for descriptive purposes for tTMB and bTMB populations separately.

10.3 Statistical Analyses
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be performed for all rando mized participants in the 
salvage setting by [CONTACT_470400].
Demographic and baseline laboratory results will be summarized using descriptive statistics for all 
randomized participants. Bas eline characteristics, including demographics (age, gender, 
geographic location, race/ethnicity) a nd clinical characteristics (date of  diagnosis, disease stage, 
liver function status, performance status, co-morbidity/prognostic indicators, location of 
metastases) w ill be collected at the time of treatment initiation for each arm. General descriptive 
statistics, includi ng mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, count and 
percentage for categorical variables will be used extensively to examine these variables.
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe 
the selection of participants to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for 
missing, unused, and spurious data. A summary of planned s tatist ical analyses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints is in Sections 10.3.2 and 10.3.3 .

Primary
ORR (based on BICR assessments) is defined as the 
number of participants with a best overall response of 
confirmed CR or PR divided by [CONTACT_470401]. Best overall response is 
defined as the best response designation, as determined 
by [CONTACT_19377], recorded between the date of randomization
and the date of objectively documented progression (per 
RECIST v1.1 or RANO criteria) or the date of 
subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. For 
participants without documented progression or 
subsequent therapy, all available response designations 
will contribute to the BOR determination. For 
participants who continue treatment beyond 
progression, the BOR will be determined based on 
response assessments up to the time of initial RECIST 
1.1 progression.BICR-assessed objective response rate (ORR) using

Immunogenicity: Serum samples collected will be analyzed  by a validated immunogenicity assay. 
Selected serum samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_470406]-nivolumab. Potential results generated from any ort hogonal method are intended as 
informational for technology exploration purposes and will not be reported.
In addition, ad hoc serum samples designated for pharmacokinetic or biomarker assessments may 
also be used for immunogenicity analysis if required (e.g., insufficient volume for complete 
immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity related AE).
Other exploratory analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.

pooled efficacy analysis , a cap of approximately 15% participants per tumor type of the sample 
size for this interim analysis will be enforced. The analysis will be performed after approximately 
the first 30 randomized participants in nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470345] ≥ 10 mut/Mb at 
baseline have been rando mized and followed for at least 6 months. 
BICR-assessed ORR will be estimated in the following groups 
•low group (10 ≤bTMB < cut-off )
•enriched group (bTMB ≥cut-off)
Decision rule: 
If the following 2 criteria are satisfied at the interim analysis,
1) estimated ORR in enriched group minus estimated ORR in low group ≥16.5% 
and 
2) estimated ORR in low group < 30%
then eligibility criteria will be  restricted to participants with either tTMB ≥10 mut/Mb or bTMB
≥new cut-off for the remainder of the trial until a total of approx imately 114 participants (76 in 
nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44771] 38 in nivolumab arm) with bTMB ≥ new cut-off are enrolled

and a total of approximately 114 participants with tTMB ≥10 mut/Mb are enrolled. The maximum 
number of participants for the study may be up to  [ADDRESS_602728] bTMB ≥new cut-off.  
Should the tTMB-H (tTMB ≥10 mut/Mb) population reach the targeted sample size 
(approximately 76 participants in nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470350] 38 in 
nivolumab arm), participants will continue to provide a tissue sample; however, eligibility will be 
based on a bTMB ≥ new cut-off only.
Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the operating characteristics, including the decision 
rule, and details are provided in Appendix 10 . The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will furt her 
describe the planned interim analyses.
Correlation between bTMB and tTMB will be assessed.
Efficacy for tTMB population
A formal interim analysis fo r BICR-assessed ORR will be c onducted on tTMB high participants
in the salvage setting after approximately the first 50 for nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44771] 25 for 
nivolumab monotherapy arm randomized participants in the salvage setting with tTMB ≥ 10 
mut/Mb at baseline have been rando mized a nd followed for at least 12 months (approximately 75 
total tTMB high participants), and study-wide randomization has completed. In order to achieve 
the necessary number of study participants in the tTMB high population for the tTMB primary 
endpoint final analysis, enrollment into this population continued after the date on which criteria 
were met for the tTMB interim analysis. The pr imary analysis population for the interim analysis 
will be the interim tTM B high population (limited to all tTMB high participants rando mized at 
least 12 months prior to the LPLV for the analysis). 
BICR-assessed DOR will be analyzed for tTMB high participants who achieve confirmed PR or 
CR using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method. Probability of achieving DOR ≥6 months 
will also be calculated.
Similar interim analysis may be conducted on bTMB high population.
All of the interim analyses and other unblinded efficacy/safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_470407] (See DMC charter for more detail).
The Statist ical Analysis Plan w ill further describe the planned interim analyses.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation par ticipant administered study treatment
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hemato logy, clinical ch emistry, or uri nalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical a nd scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-exis ting condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_093]), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure  (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, th en it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which  the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE below)
NOTE:
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•routine health assessment requiring admission fo r baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to reme dy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

5.0 Approved 930106993 5.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209848
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the particip ant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive tr eatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See  Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmission timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see  section 9.2.5  for reporting pregnancies).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed  products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to in clude in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_470356]-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criter ia used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up re ports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-[ADDRESS_602746] be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
−The required method for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
−The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for transmission of the eCRF to BMS (or designee).
♦In this case, the paper form is trans mitted via email or confi rmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission
♦When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site
•Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via email or 
confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personn el’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female−A postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_602747] a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
•Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb
•Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c
•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstin ence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in  Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES: 
aTypi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptiv e methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be sus ceptible to interaction with the st udy drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauteri ne hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when horm one exposures from intrauter ine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception*
•Male or female c ondom with or without spermicide.  Male and female c ondoms cannot be 
used simultaneously
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal Sponge with spermicide
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action

At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurab le or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_602749]/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), or ൒2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥[ADDRESS_602750]/MRI scan (scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesi ons must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥[ADDRESS_602751]/MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_102470] j udge if a node is 
involved by [CONTACT_70188]. Nodal size is normally re ported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almos t always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathol ogical nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measur able, including small les ions (longest diameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as w ell as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_102471].
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present  at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs s hould 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system. For example, a maximum of 
two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesion from each). A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the ba seline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to furt her characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be id entified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addition, it is possib le to record multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case rec ord form (eg, ‘multiple en larged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (t his includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suff icient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to m easure (due to missing or poor quality i mages), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_602752]  achieve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evalu ation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel com fortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to  measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13051], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too

BMS-936558 nivolumab
small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_602753] slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potenti ally non-re producible, therefore 
providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented  portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites will not be followed as targe t or non-target lesions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient has only non -measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable 
Protocol Amendment No.: 04
Date: 04-May-2021 163

Clinical Protocol CA209848
BMS-936558 nivolumab
disease burden. Because worsening in non-ta rget disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: 
if all lesions are truly non-measur able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to  a 20% increase di ameter in a meas urable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging mod ality or findings t hought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen on a post-baseline imaging exam, a commen t may be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessment of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline a nd while on st udy has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases ar e considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the init ial scan. While FDG-PET 
response assessments need additional study , it is sometimes reasonable to inc orporate the use of 
FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in  assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basi s of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:
1) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.

2) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD w ill be the d ate of the init ial abnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site  of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

confirmation and censoring rules regarding subseque nt therapy. The patient’s best overall res ponse

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as en dpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.[ADDRESS_602756] response determin ation of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3-[ADDRESS_602757] scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study).  If the subject is not on-study for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_102472] [ADDRESS_602758] met. Subsequent documentation of a CR may provide confirmation of a previously identified CR even with an intervening NE or PR (eg, CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may provide confirmation of a
previously identified PR even with an in tervening NE or SD (eg, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation.
Verification of Progression : Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 02:
This amendment incorporates feedback received from FDA on pursuing a tumor-agnostic 
indication with TMB for the study design of CA209-848.  The key changes include:
1) Revision of the statistical method to be base d on precision of the estimation of ORR. The 
efficacy decision is revised to be based on the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval to 
exceed a clinically relevant response rate. Previous ly, the primary endpoint is to be compared 
with a historical control with a type I error rate set to 0.05. 
2) Clarification on targeted population as in a salvage setting. The inclusion criteria is revised to 
stress participants being “refractory to standard local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or for which no standard 
treatment is available”. Previously, it was “received at least one prior line of therapy including standard of care, if available”.

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 01:
This protocol is listed a “Revised protocol 1” to remain Title 21 CFR Part 11 compliant (FDA 
regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures). The init ial protocol CA209848 was 
never activated as initially written. The study was fully revised and, therefore, there are no 
summary of changes to compare to the initial protocol.

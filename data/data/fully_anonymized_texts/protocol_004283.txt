1.0 Background  & Rationale  
 
Symptom burden is a challenge for patients receiving chemotherapy, with nausea/vomiting and 
anxiety being some of the most common symptoms causing distress. In particular, the burden 
experience by [CONTACT_461291] (HSCT ) may far exceed 
symptom burden experienced by [CONTACT_461292]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ), also call bone marrow transplant, 
is the process of infusing healthy stem cells into the human body to replace damaged cells 
caused by [CONTACT_461293]  (“Stem Cell Transplantation”, n.d.) . Prior to receiving a HSCT, 
patients must receive high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation in order to help decrease the 
amount of damaged or cancerous cells in the body leaving room for the new cells to reach the 
bone marrow and grow into cancer free b lood cells.  Due to high doses of treatment patients 
receive prior to HSCT, greater than 90% are likely to experience emesis despi[INVESTIGATOR_70061] -
emetics (Faiman, 2016).  
 
Chemo -induced nausea, vomiting, and retching (CINVR) is the most severe and interfering 
symptom experienced by [CONTACT_1962] (Stricker & Wesmiller, 2015) and affects treatment -related 
quality of life (Wood, Chapman, & Eilers, 2011).  High dose conditioning regi mens damage the 
gastrointestinal mucosa and activate brain receptors, causing impulses to increase heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and saliva to cause CINVR (Faiman, 2016).  CINVR may be more severe in the 
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 8/8/[ADDRESS_589900], defined as 24 hours after chemotherapy and lasting 
up to 7 or more days (Flank, 2017). Anxiety and depression are also common symptoms (Seo 
et al., 2019), due to prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (4 weeks or more) separating patients from the 
comfort of their home and social network. Additionally, HSCT may be anxiety provoking as a 
last-option treatment for some patients that have experienced several treatment failures and 
cancer relapse(s).  
 
Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_112707] a promising approach to decrease symptom burden post HSCT.  A 
systematic review evaluating effects of alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461285], fatigue, and pai n (Chakraborty, Savani, 
Litzow, Mohty, & Hashmi, 2015). Systematic and narrative reviews found  that use of  inhaled 
aromatherapy with essential oils decreased nausea/vomiting (F arahani et al., 2019; 
Keyhanmehr et al., 2018 ; Toniolo et al., 2021 ) and anxiety ( Boehm et al., 2012; Farahani et al., 
2019; Kayhanmehr et al., 2018)  in several studies in the general oncology population. 
Peppermint was a common essential oil used for nausea/vomiting  symptoms  (Farahani  et al. , 
2019; Keyhanmehr  et al. , 2018) and lavender was used most frequently for anxiety  symptoms  
(Farahani  et al. , 2019). Additionally, r andomized controlled trails have found statistically 
significant improvements in anxiety symptoms in participants that received inhaled essential oils 
compared to control  (Blackburn et al., 2017; Ozkaraman et al., 2018).  Only one aromatherapy 
study involving HSCT was identified, which was a randomized controlled trial that did not find 
aromatherapy benefit in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_461286] (Ndao et al., 
2012). Due to the lack of research, there is  limited understanding of aromatherapy efficacy in 
the HSCT population. Research is needed to expand translation of aromatherapy as an 
evidence -based practice to populations at high ris k for treatment -related complications, such as 
HSCT. Findings from this study will enhance understanding of the efficacy of aromatherapy on 
symptom burden in the HSCT population.  
 
2.0 Objective(s)  
 
2.[ADDRESS_589901] of inhaled aromatherap y on CINVR and anxiety 
symptoms compared to control  for 48 hours.    
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
 
• Evaluate patient satisfaction with aromatherapy  at completion of study.  
• Evaluate the antiemetic administration between  nausea/vomiting symptom  
intervention and control groups  during the 48 -hour intervention time span.   
• Evaluate the number and incidence of unit falls pre and post intervention .  
 
3.0 Outcome Measures  
 
3.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
 
Chemotherapy -Induced Nausea, Vomiting and Retching (CINVR)   
CINVR involves three distinct gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, retching) 
influenced by [CONTACT_461294]. Nausea is expressed as an unpleasant 
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 8/8/2023   Page 4 of 17 
 feeling in the throat/epi[INVESTIGATOR_461287], known 
as vomiting (Rhodes VA, 2001). Retching is the effort to expel stomach contents without 
success (Rhodes VA, 2001). A review of CINVR instruments identified the Rhodes Index 
of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching (INVR) was the only instrument that separately 
assesses all three symptoms (Wood et al., 2011). The INVR will be used to measure 
CINVR and includes 8 Likert -type items on a 5 -point scale, with evidence supporting 
reliability (Spearman correlation 0.87) and validity (Rhodes & McDaniel, 1999).   
Completion of the tool will occur at baseline, 24 hour, and 48 hours  of intervention.  
 
The primary endpoint for CINVR is the mean INVR score change from (1) baseline to 24 
hours and (2) baseline to 48 hours. We anticipate a 30% reduction in the INVR mean 
score for participants randomized to the intervention group  who indicated 
nausea/vomiting as primary symptom of concern . 
 
Anxiety   
Anxiety is excessive or persistent worry about aspects of life ("Understanding the Facts 
of Anxiety Disorders and Depression is the First Step," n.d.). Anxiety will be measured 
using a shortened version of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996]’s State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). The o riginal 
SAI contains 20 items to measure state anxiety and items are scored using a 4 -point 
Likert -type scale (almost never -almost always) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & 
Jacobs, 1983). The SAI instrument has good internal consistency (.86 -.95), te st-retest 
reliability (.65 -.75) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_57601]., 1983), and evidence supporting construct and 
concurrent validity (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_57601]., 1983). The shortened SAI retains 6 items (from 
the original 20) and has evidence supporting good internal reliability  consistency 
(Cronbach’s alpha .84) and strong construct validity (Abed, Hall, & Moser, 2011).  
Completion of the tool will occur at baseline, 24 hour s, and 48 hours of intervention.     
 
The primary endpoint for anxiety is the mean shortened SAI score change from (1) 
baseline to 24 hours and (2) baseline to 48 hours. We anticipate a 30% reduction in the 
SAI mean score for participants randomized to the intervention group who indicated 
anxiety as their primary symptom of concern.   
 
3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
 
Patient Satisfaction with Aromatherapy   
A brief semi -structured questionnaire will also be administered to evaluate patient 
satisfaction with the intervention  at the 48 -hour completion time . 
 
Evaluate the antiemetic administration between  nausea/vomiting symptom  
intervention and control groups  
Data will also be collected from the electronic medical record related to antiemetic 
medications administered (dose, route, frequency)  during the [ADDRESS_589902] intervention  
Fall rates will also be evaluated using the total number of falls reported to the National 
Database of Nurse Quality Indicators during the baseline and intervention timeframes. 
Demographic data will be collected including age, gender, and race/ethnicity.

5.0 Study Design  
 
This study will be a randomized controlled trial . Prior to randomization, participants will be asked 
which symptom, nausea/vomiting or anxiety , is most burdensome for them.  Participants will be 
stratified based on their identified symptom of burden  (nausea/ vomiting or anxiety)  and will then 
be randomized to either the intervention or control group , with a target of 50 participants  in the 
nausea/vomiting symptom group (25 intervention and 25 control) and 50 participants in the 
anxiety symptom group (25 intervention and 25 control) . Intervention and control group s will 
receive Wyndmere Naturals , Inc.  aromatherapy patches and a symptom journal . Participants  in 
the intervention group  indicati ng that nausea/vomiting is the primary symptom of concern will 
receive peppermint inhaled aromatherapy patches (or mandarin if peppermint intolerance 
indicted) . Participants in the intervention group indicating that anxiety is the primary symptoms 
of concern with receive lavender inhaled aromatherapy patches. The control group will receive 
non-scented aromatherapy patches (i.e., blank hydrogel adhesive patches without essential oil 
infusion), so it will not be feasible to  blind partic ipants to group assignment. The control group 
will have the same interactions with the study team as the intervention group and will complete 
patch changes and a symptom journal  to serve as an atte ntion control.

to observe for delayed CINV R and allow for flexibility in the study schedule  to account for 
patient or study team member unavailability. The study team will provide a summary of the 
study  and will review informed consent and HIPAA authorization  documents . Patients that agree 
to participate in the study will sign a consent and HIPAA authorization . Consented participants  
will then be randomly assigned using a random number table generated in Microsoft Excel to 
allocate patients to the intervention or control group.    
 
7.0 Study Procedures  
 
Materials  
 
Participants will receive  Wyndmere Naturals, Inc. aromatherapy patches. The hydrogel adhesive 
patches are infused with essential oil for inhaled aromatherapy treatment. Wyndmere Naturals 
aromatherapy patches were chosen for the study because  the produce (1) is not absorbed into 
the skin and (2) can be applied and changed by [CONTACT_8333]. The aromatherapy patches  provide an 
occlusive barrier that is hypoallergenic, allowing essential oils to be inhaled without coming in 
direct contact [CONTACT_8124].  Additionally, p atches are easy to apply and change for users and 
the product has been used in a  randomized control trial in which participants completed patch 
changes and documented in a symptom journal  (Lillehei et al., 2015) , similar to our protocol 
procedures.  The patch manufacturer (Bioesse Technologies, LLC, Minnetonka, MN) 
recommends patch changes every [ADDRESS_589907] for 
up to 8 hours.  
 
Procedures  
 
After consenting to study participation, patients will complete a brief demographic questionnaire 
(see Appendix A). Additional patient data  (cancer type,  chemotherapy  regimen, transplant type, 
unit of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  will be collected from the electronic medical record by a study team 
member. Patients will be asked what symptom they find most concerning (nausea/vomiting or 
anxiety) and will then be randomly assigned  to the intervention or control group  using a random 
number table based on symptom of concern . After random assignment, the patient will be 
educate d on how to use  a symptom journal  (Appendix B)  by a study team member and will be 
asked to complete the baseline symptom measures in the journal. Patients will be instructed to 
complete the same symptom measures on the following day independently (24 hour  follow up ). 
Patients assigned to the intervention group will receive 48 hours (6 patches) worth of essential 
oil infused (lavender, peppermint, or mandarin) patches. Aromatherapy patches will be applied 
to the patient’s skin  containing peppermint, mandarin, or lavender essential oils. Patient 
indicating that nausea/vomiting is their symptom of concern will receive peppermint as the 
default oil or mandarin oil if they have a known intolerance to peppermint. Patients indicating 
that anxiet y is their symptom of concern will receive lavender oil.  Patients assigned to the 
control group will receive 48 hours (6 patches) worth of  non-scented  patches (i.e., blank 
hydrogel adhesive patches without essential oil infusion ). Patients  in both groups  will be 
instructed to change the aromatherapy patch  (essential oil infused [intervention group] or non -
scented [control group])  every 8 hours , as recommended by [CONTACT_4657],  and document the  
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 8/8/[ADDRESS_589908] the study team with and signs/symptoms of sensitivity to 
the patch adhesive  or essential oi l. The study team will post a n “aromatherapy in use”  sign 
inside the patient room to notify clinicians that the patient is on study, with instructions to 
remove the aromatherapy patch before a MRI test . 
 
The study team initial visit will be at 0 hours ( visit 1)  and follow -up visits will be completed at 24 
hours ( visit 2 ) and  48 hours ( visit 3 ). During visit 2  (Monday -Friday only),  the study team will 
remind participating patients to complete their symptom journal , will answer any study -related 
questions, and will inquire about any aromatherapy side effects.  During visit 3,  a study team 
member will instruct the patient to complete the 48 -hour symptom measures in the journal and 
will complete a brief intervention satisfaction questionnaire  (Appendix C)  with the patient 
(intervention group only). Patients will be provided a $[ADDRESS_589909] during 
the 48 -hour intervention t ime frame. Antiemetic administration will be captured  on an Excel 
spreadsheet on a secure Microsoft Team  for intervention and control participants in the 
nausea/vomiting sypmtom group . Included medications are scopolamine, lorazepam, 
promethazine, prochlorperazine, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dexamethasone, Marinol, and ondansetron  
indicated for nausea/vomiting. Medication type, dose, order type (scheduled vs. PRN), and 
number of doses will be documented for antiemetics administered during the study timeframe.  
Concomitant  medications (e.g., antiemetic medications, steroids , benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ) will not be 
controlled as part of the study as the intent is not to alter standard practice for symptom 
treatment, but rather to provide an adjuvant  to help reduce symptom burden . However, it is 
reasonable to expect that the need for PRN (available as needed) medications prescribed for 
nausea/vomiting or anxiety may be less in the treatment group compared to control during the 
48 hours of inhaled aromatherapy.  Because antiemetic and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_461288] (Seppala et al., 2018; Wildes et al., 2018) , we also plan to 
observe fall events during the study timeframe. Unit fall total numbers and incidence data will 
additionally be obtained from data reported to the National Database for Nurse Quality 
Indicators (NDNQI) for 12 months prior to implementation and 12 months during study 
implementation.

not as indicated ( e.g. oil applied directly to the skin, oil ingested), the risk of adverse event 
occurrence may increase.  
 
Adverse Event:   Defined as any problematic medical occurrence in a study participant who 
has received the intervention including  inhaled lavender, peppermint, or mandarin essential oil , 
regardless of possibility of a causal relationship. Adverse events will be documented after the 
participant begins receiving the intervention.  
 
The occurrence and nature of each participant’s medical condition will be documented by [CONTACT_461295]. Study personnel will document any changes in medical condition 
and/or the occurrence and description of any adverse event during the study.  Events that occur 
from inhaled essential oil administration up to 72 hours after will be recorded (allows for 24 
hours of monitoring after intervention ends). Events will be reviewed during data safety 
monitoring to determine causality.  
 
Significant Adverse Event:   Defined as a life -threatening condition (i.e. immediate risk of 
dying); severe/perm anent disability; a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or 
precaution as deemed by [CONTACT_461296] . 
Investigators will determine causality based on the participant’s clinical course, medical history, 
and administered medications.  
 
Adverse and Significant Adverse Events will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days from 
discovery if they are determined to be (1) unexpected; (2) related or possibly  related  to 
participation in the study; (3) finding suggests that the research procedures involve a greater

occur on a weekly basis  to provide monitoring updates and discuss safety/quality concerns . If 
an adverse event  occurs in which  causality cannot be determined by [CONTACT_5051], t he 
study investigator will consult with the patient’s medical team  to clarify/confirm event causality.  
Based on findings from the weekly review , considerations for protocol adjustment will be made 
in the event that opportunities are identified to improve participant safety and /or data quality .  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the IU Simon Cancer Center Institutional DSMP 
for Low Risk Trials .  
 
Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and subject safety. Quarterly review 
meetings for low risk trials are required and will include the principal investigator, clinical 
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 8/8/[ADDRESS_589912] and/or research nurse (other members per principal investigator’s 
discretion). Quarterly meeting summaries should include review of data, the number of 
subjects, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, and responses observe d. Study 
teams should maintain meeting minutes and attendance for submission to the DSMC upon 
request.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee   
 
The IUSCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for oversight of 
subject safety, regulatory compliance, and data integrity for this trial. The DSMC will review this 
study annually to review overall trial progress, toxicity, compliance,  data integrity, and accrual 
per the Institutional DSMP.  
 
Furthermore, the DSMC conducts an administrative review of serious adverse events (SAEs), 
deviations, reportable events, and any other outstanding business. Major issues may require 
further DSMC review or action.  
 
At any time during the conduct of the trial, if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85263] 
(or benefits) to the subject warrant early closure of the study, the DSMC Chair and Compliance 
Officer must be notified within [ADDRESS_589913] to auditing and/or monitoring per the Institutional 
DSMP. Reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_197582].  
 
Data Management/ Oncore Reporting Requirements   
 
The DSMC reviews data and study progress directly from Oncore; therefore, timely data entry 
and status updates are vital. Study data must be entered within Oncore promptly, no later than 
one week from study visit occurrence. Subject status in Oncore will b e updated in real time, as 
this may affect overall trial enrollment status. Global SAEs and deviations will be reviewed on a 
monthly basis by [CONTACT_85279].  
 
Study Accrual Oversight   
 
Accrual data will be entered into the IU Simon Cancer Center OnCore system. The Protocol 
Progress Committee (PPC) reviews study accrual twice per year, while the PPC coordinator 
reviews accrual quarterly.  
 
Oncore Safety Reporting   
 
In addition to protocol - and regulatory -required safety reporting, all serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be captured in the Oncore system within 1 business day of notification. Initial SAE 
reporting will include as much detail as available, with follow -up to provide complete 
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 8/8/2023   Page 11 of 17 
 information. Attributions will be assessed to study drugs, procedures, study disease, and other 
alternate etiology.  
 
Protocol Deviation Reporting   
 
Protocol deviations will be entered into OnCore within 5 days of discovery and reviewed by [CONTACT_461297] a monthly basis. Findings will be reported to the full DSMC at the time of study 
review. For serious or repetitive protocol deviations, additional action may be required by [CONTACT_90398].  
 
11.0  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Participants may withdrawal anytime by [CONTACT_461298] (Monica Bates) or 
any other member of the study team. Choosing not to participate or withdrawal from the study 
will not influence relationships or patient status at IU Health.  
 
 
12.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
SAS and/or R statistical packages  will be used to analyze primary outcomes, secondary 
outcomes, and demographic  sample data.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
 
Comparisons between the intervention and control groups for differences in the CINVR and 
anxiety tools will be analyzed using mixed -model ANOVA, with time (baseline, 24 hours, 48 
hours) repeated within subject. Chi -square tests will be used to compare the groups for 
differences in the proportions of patients prescribed medications for nausea/vomiting or 
anxiety. Separate analyses will be performed for the two symptom groups. A two -sided 5% 
significance level will be used for all tests.  
 
Sample size justific ation:  With sample sizes of 50 patients within each symptom group, 25 
intervention/[ADDRESS_589914] 80% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_589915] calculation and a two -sided 5% significance level.  The recruitment target will 
be 112 participants (56 per symptom group) to account for a 10% drop out rate.  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze frequencies and percentages of the patient 
satisfaction questionnaire  responses , documented antiemetic administration, and number of 
unit falls. The number of (1) total antiemetic medication doses  and (2) doses  for each individual 
medication  (i.e., Ativan, promethazine)  will be compared between the control and intervention 
groups for the nausea/vomiting sypmtom group.  The percentage change for number of falls will 
be calculated  by [CONTACT_461299] 12 months prior to intervention  implementation to 
12 months during implementation . 
 
IRB#:  [ZIP_CODE]

will be disseminated, and raw data will be destroyed after data analysis is complete . 
 
14.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
All data will be stored on a secure REDCap database . All computers used for data storage and 
analysis will be password protected and only trained study personnel will have access to data. A 
unique blinded identifier will be assigned to each participan t record prior to analysis. The results 
of the study will be analyzed and reported as aggregate data and no participant or individual 
responses will be identified.

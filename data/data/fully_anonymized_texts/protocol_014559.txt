1.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1.1 Background: Disease and current understanding of disease   
Our lab has st udied anesthetics for almost fifteen  years. We , as well as other labs, 
found that anesthetics inhibit neurotransmitter release  (Crowder  et al. ; van Swinderen  et 
al., 1999; Winegar & MacIver, 2006; Herring  et al. , 2009; Herring  et al. , 2011; Saifee  et 
al.).  We thought that if we could reverse this action that we would be able to reverse 
aspects of anesthesia. In our preliminary s tudies, s everal drugs were studied  that normally 
facilitate neurotransmitter release. If inhibiting neurotransmitter release is part of the 
mechanism leading to anesthesia  (Crowder  et al. ; van Swinderen  et al. , 1999; Winegar & 
MacIver, 2006; Herring  et al. , 2009; Herring  et al. , 2011; Saifee  et al. ) then drugs that 
facilitate neurotransmitter release may aid in reversing anesthesia. Elevating intracellular 
cAMP, with drugs like forskolin  or caffeine , is well known to facilitate neurotransmitter 
release  (By[CONTACT_7943] & Kandel, 1996; Trudeau  et al. , 1996; Fujita -Yoshigaki, 1998; Fujita -
Yoshigaki  et al. , 1998; Lonart  et al. , 1998; T rudeau  et al. , 1998; Takahashi  et al. , 1999; 
Trudeau  et al. , 1999; Kuromi & Kidokoro, 2000; Hilfiker  et al. , 2001; Machado  et al. , 
2001; Sakaba & Neher, 2001; Burgoyne & Morgan, 2003; Kuromi & Kidokoro, 2003; 
Lonart  et al. , 2003; Sakaba & Neher, 2003; Sein o & Shibasaki, 2005; Kasai  et al. ). We 
found that drugs that elevate intracellular cAMP levels reversed the inhibition of 
neurotransmitter release caused by [CONTACT_744185]. In addition, the cAMP 
elevating drugs caused rats to wake up very  quickly from anesthesia.  
Normally recovery from anesthesia is passive. Anesthetic is terminated and people 
wake up. Some do so slowly. Age, genetics, gender and other factors come into play with 
regards to waking time  (Solt  et al. , 2011) . But currently there is nothing that a clinician 
can do to hurry the process. Additionally, there are cognitive impairments that last for 
hours following anesthesia  (Nathanson  et al. , 1995; Larsen  et al. , 2000; Chen  et al. , 
2001) . Reaction times and memory are impaired following anesthesia  (Nathanson  et al. , 
1995; Larsen  et al. , 2000; Chen  et al., 2001) . People (outpatients) are being released from 
surgery/ anesthesia on an ever shortening time scale to save money. It would be 
significant if clinicians could wake the patients safely, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_744148].   
Anesthesia  is thought to work similarly in humans and rodents. In our preliminary 
studies we found that drugs that elevate intracellular cAMP, like caffeine , dramatically 
accelerated recovery from anesthesia in rats.  The question that we hope to address is the 
following:  Do drugs that elevate cAMP lev els work the same way in humans?  Do these 
drugs accelerate emergence from anesthesia?  Preliminary data from a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744149].

  1.1.3 Preclinical  data  
Previously my lab has shown that clinically relevant concentrations of anes thetics inhibit 
neurotransmitter release from both secretory cells and neurons. We tested isoflurane, 
propofol, etomidate and ketamine. All four anesthetics efficiently inhibited 
neurotransmitter release  (Herring BE, Xie Z, Marks J and Fox AP (2009) ; Herri ng BE, 
McMillan, K., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], C. Marks, J, Fox AP., Xie Z (2011) ; Xie Z, McMillan, K., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], 
CM., Cahill, AL., Herring BE., Wang, Q., & Fox AP., (2013) ). 
 
We hypothesized that inhibition of neurotransmitter release plays a key role in how 
anesthetics produce anesthesia in animals and humans.  Furthermore we hypothesized  
that drugs that reverse the inhibitory effects of anesthetics on the release machinery 
may help accelerate recovery from anesthesia.   Historically, cAMP signaling has been 
shown to play a key r ole in synaptic function and plasticity. Elevating cAMP facilitates 
neurotransmitter release  (By[CONTACT_7943] & Kandel, 1996; Trudeau  et al. , 1996; Fujita -Yoshigaki, 
1998; Fujita -Yoshigaki  et al. , 1998; Lonart  et al. , 1998; Trudeau  et al. , 1998; Takahashi  
et al. , 1999; Trudeau  et al. , 1999; Kuromi & Kidokoro, 2000; Hilfiker  et al. , 2001; 
Machado  et al. , 2001; Sakaba & Neher, 2001; Burgoyne & Morgan, 2003; Kuromi & 
Kidokoro, 2003; Lonart  et al. , 2003; Sakaba & Neher, 2003; Seino & Shibasaki, 2005; 
Kasai  et al. ). We posited that elevating  intracellular cAMP might alter anesthetic action 
by [CONTACT_744186]. Drugs that elevate [cAMP] i levels, were tested; 
these drugs were found to completely reverse the inhibitory effects of anesthetics on 
neurotransmitter release in in vi tro studies. When tested, these same cAMP elevating 
drugs dramatically accelerated recovery from anesthesia in rats.  So far we have tested 
three cAMP elevating drugs (forskolin, theophylline and caffeine)  in rats . All accelerate 
recovery from anesthesia  in rats .  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744150] s that 
caffeine appears to accelerate emergence from anesthesia in humans.  
There are  two studies that bear directly on the cAMP  accelerating emergence from 
anesthesia hypothesis. In the 1970’s Cohn et  al showed that direct inject of cAMP into 
the brain reduced the duration of narcosis for a series of sedative, hypnotic, tranquilizer 
and anesthetic drug tested  {Cohn, 1975 #152} . They tested 8 different drugs. It appears 
that cAMP effectively reduced the  waking times for all 8 drugs.  More recently, the Solt 
lab has shown that activation of D 1 dopamine receptors accelerates emergence from 
anesthesia {Taylor, 2013 #68} . D 1 receptors are always coupled to the cAMP machinery 
i.e. activation of this class of r eceptor always produces an elevation of cAMP in cells that 
express the receptor.

Isoflurane Blocks Neurotransmitter Release in PC12 Cells: Forskolin, Theophylline 
and Caffeine Reverse this Block  
Anesthet ics modulate the activity of various channels and receptors, thereby [CONTACT_744187]. For this experiment, PC12 cells were permeabilized with 
digitonin, and then cells were stimulated by [CONTACT_744188]2+. Permeabilization 
disrupts th e cell’s resting p otential and equilibrates the intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ 
levels. Under these conditions, modulation of channels or receptors should have no effect 
on neurotransmitter release. In earlier studies, PC12 cells were also dialyzed wi th known 
Ca2+ concentrations, via a patch pi[INVESTIGATOR_744151] a constant holding potential of -65 mV; 
these studies validated the digitonin methodology. Exocytosis was elicited in the presence 
and absence of isoflurane (0.5 mM). Basal (Ca2+-independent) neurotran smitter release is 
virtually non -existent in digitonin permeabilized PC12 cells in Ca2+-free conditions, but 
robust release is observed upon 
exposing cells to Ca2+-containing 
solutions. Physiologically, release is 
evoked by [CONTACT_941] a ctivation of voltage -
gated Ca2+ channels. The proximity 
of Ca2+ channels to synaptic release 
sites suggests that [Ca2+]i may rise 
to levels above 100 M at the 
vesicle.  To mimic these levels in 
our exper iments, evoked 
neurotransmitter release was elicited 
by [CONTACT_744189] -

inhibited neurotransmitter release 
by ~36% (p < .05) in this study.  
Three drugs that elevate intracellular cAMP were then tested for  their ability to reverse 
the inhibition produced by [CONTACT_653028]. Fig. 1 shows that all three drugs, forskolin (5  M) 
or theophylline (50 M) or caffeine (50 M), reversed the isofl urane-mediated inhibition 
of neurotransmitter release.  Fig. 1 – Forskolin, theophylline and caffeine reversed the inhibition of 
neurotransmitter release produced by [CONTACT_653028]. PC12 cells were 
permeabilized with digitonin (20 M) and then stimulated by [CONTACT_744190] a solution containing 100 M Ca2+. Neurotransmitter release was 
monitored with an amperometric electrode which gently touched the cell. 
Under these conditions, isoflurane (0.5 mM) significantly inhibited 
neurotr ansmitter release by ~36% (p < 0.05, relative to control and all other 
conditions). The number of events recorded from control PC12 cells were 
about the same as those from PC12 cells exposed to isoflurane + forskolin 
(5 M) or isoflurane and theophylline ( 50 M) or isoflurane and caffeine

The results  in Fig. [ADDRESS_1017778] that 
elevating intracellular cAMP 
reverses t he inhibition of 
neurotransmitter release 
produced by [CONTACT_744191] . 
Does elevating cAMP alter 
recovery from anesthesia in 
animals?  To address this 
question, we examined 
emergence from anesthesia in 
rats.  First, we assessed  waking 
from anesthesia in the absence 
of any other drug to assess 
population variability . Rats, 
weighing 420 -510 gm, were 
placed in an anesthetizing 
apparatus consisting of a gas-
tight box where they were 
exposed to 3% isoflurane  (in 3 
L/min  O2) for 8 minutes.  
Isoflurane levels were then 
decreased  to 2% (in 2L/ min O 2) 
for an additional [ADDRESS_1017779] as it is such a 
widely us ed and largely 
innocuous drug. Fig. 2 A shows 
a graph of  recovery times  from 
isoflurane anesthesia for  control 
rats (■) or for  animals injected 
with caffeine ( ●), 25 mg/kg , 5 minutes prior to discontinuing the isoflurane . Caffeine 
dramatically sped recovery  from anesthesia. Fig. 2 B shows  the average recovery time at

Methods:  Adult rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane for 8 minutes and were then 
exposed to 2% isoflurane for 45 minutes. During the anesthesia an I -V was inserted into a 
tail vein, while anes thesia was maintained with a nose cone. Five minutes prior to 
discontinuing the anesthetic the animals received an I -V injec tion of either saline 
(control, ■) or saline with drug ( ●). The anesthetic was then terminated and the animals 
were allowed to wake up breathing room air.  The rats were placed on their backs on a 
table. Waking time was defined as the time between terminating the anesthetic and the 
rats were standing with 4 paws on the table.

1.1.4 Clini cal Data to Date  
Work Done By [CONTACT_730716]:   
There are two clinical trials that have 
tested caffeine in anesthetized patients. Both 
trials were carefully vetted. In a recent 
clinical trial in anesthetized children, 
caffeine was found to be safe (the trial was 
to determine whether caffeine could reduce 
the number of children who experience 
adverse post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] 
(Khal il et al. , 2008)  – caffeine helped 
significantly). Note that the concentration of 
caffeine used in this study was quite high.  
Caffeine has been shown safe to use in anesthetized adults. In a clinical trial, to 
determine whether caffeine ameliorated post a nesthesia nausea and vomiting, patients 
were given 500 mg caffeine during anesthesia. This combination, anesthesia and caffeine, 
was found to be safe (Stein brook  et al. ). Note that 500 mg in that trial is similar to the low 
end of the range that  we propose for our trial.  
 
 
 
 
Preliminary Data from  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]:

forgot to change the oxygen flow rate after turning off the isoflurane at the end of the 
hour.  Normally dur ing the anesthesia itself  2 liters  per minute  of O 2 were used .  At the 
end of the hour of anesthesia the isoflurane is turned off and the O2 flow rate is turned to 
8 L/ min. If you leave the anesthesia machine at 2 L/ min of O [ADDRESS_1017789]. So the 
isoflurane goes down much more slowly. When  the isoflurane is stopped the  2L/ min of 
O2 should be stopped as well.  Instead 8 L/ min of O 2 needs to  be given.   On visit 1 of 
subjec t #2, this was not done . When the time course of isoflurane ’s drop in  concentration 
in the lungs, after turning off the isoflurane, in anesthesia session #1 was compared with 
that on anesthesia session 2  (which had a correct procedure ) they were very diffe rent. But 
they should have been similar. The difference is that for session #2 we used a flow rate of 
8 L/ minute of O 2 while for session #1 we used 2 L/ minute of O 2, at least at first. So no 
good comparison between sessions is possible. Below is  plotted the waking times for 
subject #[ADDRESS_1017790] 2 – In Visit 1 he gagged in 14 minutes 18 seconds  (with 
caffeine) . In visit 2 he gagged at 14 minutes and 10 seconds  (with placebo). The two 
waking times were very similar. But the O 2 flow rate of 2 L/ min O [ADDRESS_1017791] ly in visit 1. No adjustment is needed for visit 2.  This is simply an estimate.

Subject [ADDRESS_1017795] visit the O 2 levels were left at 2 L/ min 
for several minutes after the isoflurane was shut off. This means that the time course was 
distorted for visit 1.  Below is plotted the end tidal isoflurane concentration as a function 
of time. The second visit is plotte d in black squares and the first visit is not plotted. We 
fit the data  with a double exponential. We are  somewhat skeptical of the fit since there 
was not a lot of data to fit, since he woke quickly. We are  pretty sure that the fit here is 
not accurate. Bu t this is the best we  could do. Using the fit we can obtain an estimate of 
the isoflurane concentration during visit 2. In visit [ADDRESS_1017796] 2 woke (gagged) in 14 
minutes, 10 seconds (850 sec). From the fit this corresponds to waking at 0.22% 
isoflurane . Thus the isoflurane concentration that subject [ADDRESS_1017797] 1. Although we don’t know the exact isoflurane concentration at waking for 
visit 1, it was ~0.3% (reading directly from EPIC). Again not so different than subject 1.  
 
 
 
Note that the black squares  corresponds to the visit with the placebo  injection. 
Data from the caffeine injection is not plotted.

This Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744156]. In rats when we used an 
intermediate concentration of caffeine, the rats that emerged rapi[INVESTIGATOR_744157], but the largest effect was observed with animals that 
emerged slowly from  anesthesia. In t his human trial, subject [ADDRESS_1017802] difference  
is what we saw in rats that emerged quickly from anesthesia, without any help from 
caffeine.  
The isoflurane concentration where waking occurred was ~0.3% when caffeine was 
injected and ~0.2% when the subjects received a saline injection. This is already a large 
difference. The rat data suggests that as the caffeine concentration is increased, it w orks 
to antagonize the isoflurane more effectively. Thus increasing the caffeine from 10 mg/ 
kg of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744158] 15 mg/ kg requested in this study, we should see an even 
larger effect. That is the human subjects  should wake from the isoflurane more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_744159] . 
Although we do not have a time course for the memory test, anesthetics clearly impair 
memory. In fa ct, Subject [ADDRESS_1017803].  
Similarly when we asked the subjects how they felt, they clearly felt much better after 
caffeine. They came back to normal 30 – 60 minutes faster in every negative category 
(such as “I Feel Lightheaded” or “I feel Confused” or “I Feel Dreamy”).  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1017804] spent considerable time 
studying the inhibition of neurotransmitter release pr oduced by [CONTACT_744192]  (Herring  et 
al., 2009; Herring  et al. , 2011; Xie  et al. , 2012; Xie  et al. , 2013) .  We thought that if we 
could reverse this action th at we would be able to reverse aspects of anesthesia. Several 
drugs were studied; these drugs normally facilitate neurotransmitter release. If inhibiting 
neurotransmitter release causes anesthesia then drugs that facilitate neurotransmitter 
release should aid in reversing anesthesia. Elevating intracellular cAMP, with drugs like 
caffeine, is well known to facilitate neurotransmitter release. We found that drugs that 
elevate intracellular cAMP levels caused rats to wake up very quickly from anesthesia.  
A va riety of drugs are  used during general anesthesia  that are reversed 
pharmacologically afterwards. For example opi[INVESTIGATOR_2631], frequently used to suppress 
pain, can be reversed pharmacologically following surgery.  Other drugs like 
anticoagulants and muscle r elaxants are used in a similar manner. General anesthetics 
induce a coma -like state; unfortunately recovery from anesthesia induced loss of 
consciousness cannot be reversed (Solt  et al. , 2011) . Recovery is passive and is due to the

upon a variety of genetic, age, physical condition and gender related factors that are 
beyond the clinician's control (Solt  et al. , 2011; Chemali  et al. , 2012; Taylor  et al. ). 
Cognitive impairments persist for hours following anesthesia. Outpatients are released 
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744160]/ surgery after an ever diminishing recovery period in order 
to constrai n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]. This is a recipe for increasing anesthesia -induced accidents. It 
would be extremely beneficial to be able to time recovery from anesthesia in a 
reproducible manner and to have that recovery be complete. Anesthesia in rodents is 
thought to  be very similar to that in humans  (Thurman  et al. , 2008) . We have tested a 
variety of drugs in rats and we have identified four different drugs that appear to wake 
animals rapi[INVESTIGATOR_744161]. We have cho sen one of the 
four drugs and would like to test it in humans. These studies have the potential to impact 
medicine in an important way and in a relatively short time frame.   
 
1.1.6 Dose  Rationale and Risks/B enefits   
The drug that will be used in this stud y is caffeine which is commonly consumed by 
[CONTACT_744193]. It is the most popular drug used worldwide found in more than 
60 plants. It is classified by [CONTACT_4760] "Generally Recognized as Safe". This was a 
critical consideration for our study. T o be able to find a drug that would be considered 
safe. An IV formulation of caffeine is in clinical use, for treating apnea of prematurity in 
neonates. The dosages of caffeine in this study are within the range used fo r the above 
clinical conditions. For example, the recommended loading dosage for premature infants 
being treated for apnea of prematurity is 20 mg/ kg, a 33%  higher  dosage that we propose 
in adult male volunteers. The dosage that we have chosen is not associated with serious 
side effects  (“caffeine has few unwanted side effects and is safe even in very large 
doses”. This quote is from (Rang  et al. , 2001)  the most widely used pharmacology 
textbook in medical schools . We hypothesize that injection of caffeine at the end of  
anesthesia at clinically relevant dosages will facilitate the emergence of a subject from 
general anesthesia. Additionally, caffeine may improve cognitive function recovery after 
general anesthesia.  
 
 
1.2.  OBJECTIVES  
a) Hypothesis  
Anesthesia is thought to work similarly in humans and animals (Thurman  et al. , 2008) . In 
our preliminary studies we found that drugs that elevate intracellular cAMP, like 
forskolin  or caffeine , dramatically accelerated recovery from anesthesia in rats . Caffeine 
appeared to have a similar effect in two human test subjects. W e hypothesize that drugs 
that elevate intracellular cAMP  will d ramatically accelerate recovery from anesthesia in 
humans.  
 
Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To determine whether drugs that elevate cA MP levels accelerate recovery from  
anesthesia.

2.  STUDY DESIGN   
2.1 Type  of Study   
This is a Randomiz ed, Double -Blinded, Placebo Controlled  Study.  
 
2.2 Duration  of Study   
Screening:  1 week  
Intervention: 6 weeks total  
Follow -up: 2 weeks  
 
Part 1:  We will enroll up to [ADDRESS_1017805] subjects in a full scale trial. The estimated duration of 
this trial will be appro ximately 16 weeks  followed by a 2 week follow up period . 
 
Week 1 : Explanation of the trial and signature [CONTACT_744231] . Detailed 
medical exam and physical exam. Toxicology screen and acceptance into trial. Training 
with psychomotor tests.  
 
Week 2: Volunteers will be exposed to isoflurane anesthesia as described below and then 
receiv e and injection of either a saline  solution  or caffeine citrate (both investigators and 
subjects will be blind to composition of injection).  Psychomotor tests will be  carried out.  
There will be a toxicology screen.  Later that day and then the day after the session, there 
will be a telephone follow -up with the subject.  
 
Week 3 : There will be a telephone follow -up with both volunteers.  
 
Week 4 -6: Volunteers will be expo sed to isoflurane anesthesia as described below and 
then receive and injection of either a saline  solution or Caffeine  (both investigators and 
subjects will be blind to composition of injection). Psychomotor tests will be carried out. 
There will be a toxic ology screen.  Later that day and then t he day after the session, there 
will be a telephone follow -up with the subject.  
 
Weeks 6 : There will be telephone follow -ups with both volunteers.  
 
 
Week 7 : There will be a  final series of  telephone follow -up with bot h volunteers. If there 
are no issues identified, this will be the last contact [CONTACT_744194].  
 
We are suggesting t hat the trial take place over 16  weeks due to scheduling conflicts i.e. 
the possibility that subjects are not available . We hope to anes thetize 2 subjects per single 
lab day.

a randomized manner.  For each subject, each session involvi ng anesthesia will be at least  
2 weeks apa rt. Detailed study procedure will be described in section 5 below.  
Please Note:  We will try to process two subjects on a single anesthesia day. One at 7:00 
AM and another at 1:[ADDRESS_1017807] per day. The 
subjects arrived at  UC at 7:00 AM and the entire anesthesia procedure including recovery 
was finished by 11:00 AM. That was wasteful, in terms of time. Normally 
anesthesiologists put multiple people to sleep per day. They don't finish their days at 
11:[ADDRESS_1017808] in the afternoon.

The total time of each study session, including the pre -anesthesia preparation, testing and 
recovery from anesthesia, will b e ~4 hours.   
 
2.5 Method  for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The University of Chicago Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will prepare the injectable 
solutions for our trial. They will provide us with either saline  or with caffeine  citrate , 15 
mg/ k g. They will not inform the research team of their preparations.  There is no way to 
identify whether caffeine is present in a solution by [CONTACT_744195]  (caffeine 
citrate is colorless and odorless) . The entire experiment will be done blind by [CONTACT_744196]. The only requirement will be that at the end of the t est the

Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems fo r hours 
after anesthesia is terminated  (references are provided below) . Our goal  is to determine 
whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues.   After waking,  each subject will 
be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests (described below), that will assess his 
reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Details of 
the test are provided below.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1017812]’s  vital signs will be monitored and there  
will be two experienced anesthesiologists present throughout the anesthesia session.  Both 
anesthesiologists will be present for the first hour of the recovery time following the 
anesthesia. Once the test subject is awake, oriented with regards to time and  space, and 
showing stable vital signs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_744162], one of 
the anesthesiologists may leave the room. There will be one anesthesiologist present at all

criteria used in our post anesthesia care unit in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In general, the subject 
should be awake and alert with the stable vital signs. He should be able to drink clear 
liquid, v oid and ambulate before discharge home.  We will call a car service for him 
without cost to the subject. The subject will be expected to live within 30 miles of The

A.  Drug S tudy:  
4.1A Formulation  of Study Drug 
 
Caffeine citrate  (caffeine) , is availabl e commercially.  It is m anufactured by [CONTACT_744201] .   
 
Placebo  control will be a sterile saline  solution .  
 
4.2A  Treatment  Regimen  
The study drug ( caffeine  citrate ) or the placebo (a saline  solution ) will be given 
intravenously 10  min before the end of 1 hour isoflurane anesthesia . Caffeine  will be 
administered at a do se of 1 5 mg/ kg . There will be a single injection of either caffeine  or 
a saline  placebo control solution  in the anesthetized test subjects . The drug will be 
injected slowly across a 10-minut e interval, in order to prevent concentration spi[INVESTIGATOR_744163]. A pump infuser will be used to introduce the drug.  The subjects will be told 
not to eat or drink for 8 hours prior to anesthesia (see below for a more detailed 
description).  
 
An example  of the method of administration may be illustrative. The drug, caffeine 
citrate and comes in a single dosage of 20  mg caffeine per ml of solution. Let’s say a 
volunteer weighs 65 kg. The dose  we propose for this trial is 15  mg/ kg. Therefore the 
volunteer  will get a 48.75  ml injection of caffeine citrate . This amount of solution (48.75  
ml) can be injected as a bolus via an IV line in under a minute. This rapid infusion of 
drug is what we call a bolus injection. We plan on introducing the 48.[ADDRESS_1017826]  will get 975  mg of caffeine c itrate that is equivalent to 487. 5 mg of pure 
caffeine.

interactions of these drugs to our study drug. However, propofol and muscle relaxants are 
available at the bedside in case they a re needed for the management of unexpected airway 
situations, such as laryngeal spasm.  If an unexpected airway emergency occurs, the ASA 
difficult airway algorithm will be applied for airway management. The subject will be 
allowed to breathe spontaneously  unless the tidal volume is less than 3 ml/kg. We will 
optimize the tidal volume at around 5 ml/kg to make sure each subject receives similar 
amount of isoflurane for an hour. Pressure support mode may be applied to optimize the 
tidal volume if necessary.  The study drug ( caffeine citrate ) or the placebo control  will be 
given intravenously [ADDRESS_1017828] will be given a dose of antiemetic medication,

baseline, we will first give IV fluid to replete the fluid deficit due to the restriction of 
fluid intake prior to the study.  If that is not sufficient to raise the BP, we will reduce t he 
concentrations of isoflurane by 0.1% at a time until we can maintain the BP close to the 
normal range. Vasoactive medications will be given only if absolutely necessary  but they 
will be available. Volunteer safety is our first priority.

Mask Airway (LMA), a rubber airway device, will be inserted via the mouth into the 
larynx . This device will help to optimize the patency of the airway while the subject is 
completely anesth etized. This allows the subject to breathe easier without the help of a 
ventilator.   This is the induction phase of anesthesia.  After induction, the subje ct will be 
given isoflurane (1.0  MAC, as adjusted by [CONTACT_744207] ) for

L/min during the maintenance phase. Ten minutes before terminating the isoflurane, 
volunteers will be infused  with a solution containing saline  (control ) or with caffeine  
(test).   After the termination of isoflurane, the subject will be allowed to wake up.   This 
phase is called the emergence phase of anesthesia.  During the emergence phase, Oxygen 
flow will go up to 8 L/min to avoid rebreathing.  We will test whether the caffeine

be measured every [ADDRESS_1017835] is discharged. This data is stored automatically for each patient  in our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s

Propofol is the preferred agent for the induction phase because it does not caus e airway 
irritation. Additionally, propofol is normally used for anesthesia induction in human 
patients.   There are several advantages to use isoflurane as the main anesthetic agent. 
Most importantly, it is an extremely safe anesthetic that has been used for decades. All 
our preliminary animal data was generated with isoflurane.  Because it takes slightly 
longer to "wake up" from isoflurane anesthesia, compared to other volatile anesthetics 
like sevoflurane, it will allow us to better differentiate the act ions of the caffeine.  During 
this study, we do not plan to use other anesthetic agents, such as midazolam, fentanyl, 
and muscle relaxants to minimize the interactions of these drugs to our study drug. 
However, propofol and muscle relaxants are available a t the bedside in case they are

6.1 Sample  Size Determination

Author(s)                                                                                                               IRB approved Version#:  Members of the IRB  should understand that the sample size described above is an 
estimate, since we could not find good data on human “waking” times from isoflurane 
anesthesia in the literature. Thus we used our own animal studies to estimate sample size. 
There are at least three reasons why our sample size might be in error. First, rats are not 
people. They may get rid of isoflurane differently than do humans due to their higher 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_119068]. In addition, rats are genetically more similar to each other  than are 
humans. That would tend to increase human variance relative to that of the rat. On the 
other hand, the equipment used to anesthetize rats is less sophisticated than that in 
humans. In humans, the expi[INVESTIGATOR_744166], ther eby [CONTACT_744209], in the lungs. This is not possible in rats and so the 
anesthetic dose applied is less precise. This will tend to lower human variance. This is a 
long-winded way to say that our sample size estimate may be wrong.  In these studies rats 
were used 4 times (twice with a saline injection twice with an injection of saline 
containing caffeine), a strategy that reduced variance.  
 
Additional caveats: The 15 mg caffeine citrate that we propose is equivalent to 7.5 mg/  
kg of pure caffeine.  We have never tested 7.5 mg/ kg caffeine in rats, nor have we ever 
studied isoflurane at a concentration of 1 MAC.  
 
We use the following  stringent criteria to determine sample size: Power will be set to 
95% and p ≤ 0.01.  
 
Rats waking  from isoflurane anesthesia with 5 mg/ kg caffeine  (isoflurane ~ 1.5 MAC) : 
(Control - saline injection)     - Mean = 540  sec, SD = 159.04  
(Test - 5 mg/ kg caffeine in saline injection)   - Mean = 269.67  sec, SD = 103.69  
At this concentration of caffeine we  would need n=12 measurements for control and 
n=[ADDRESS_1017843] 8  total volunteers will satisfy our study. This is

produce a larger respons e than the 5 mg/ kg shown above, and we will employ a lower

parts. The first part, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744168].  
 
Part 1:  In order to demonstrate feasibility and safety, we carried out a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_1017845] s in recovering 
from isoflurane anesthesia. Recovery time s were  measured in three  ways: as the time 
between the time when anesthetic is terminated until the subject  starts to gag, can open 
his eyes, and the subject  is able to respond to simple commands (like squeeze the 
clinician’s hand) . Each of the three  endpoints was monitored and plotted separately.  In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_744169]  (caffeine) was used at  10 mg/kg . By [CONTACT_744210] s 
that wake from anesthesia who are injected with a saline  solution  to subject s that are 
injected with caffeine  we were able to show that caffeine is  as efficient in humans a s in 
rodents .  Now that we have demonstrate d safety and feasibility,  if the IRB gives us 
permission, we will continue to Part 2 of our study.  Time from the end of anesthesia to 
eye opening will be analyzed,  as will be the time from the end of anesthesia to  response 
to a simple command . Each parameter ( gagging, eye opening and response to command)  
will be analyzed and plotted separately.  
 
There are cognitive impairments that last for hours following anesthesia  (Nathanson  et 
al., 1995; Larsen  et al. , 2000; Chen  et al. , 2001) . Reaction times and memory are 
impaired following anesthesia  (Nathanson  et al. , 1995; Larsen  et al., 2000; Chen  et al. , 
2001) . Outpatients  are being released from surgery/ anesthesia on an ever shortening time 
scale to save money. It would be significant if clinicians could wake the patients safely,

to assess whether caffeine  helps ameliorate the cognitive problems associated with 
anesthesia.  Subjects will be required to carry out a series of simple psychomotor tests 
thirty minutes after anesthesia and then again t wo hours later. By [CONTACT_744211], 
memory and reaction times we will determine whether Caffeine  helps ameliorate 
cognitive problems, relative to the saline  treated controls.  Data from each test will be 
analyzed and plotted separately.

The data from all subjects will be analyzed without knowledge of  whether the data comes 
from a control or test condition. After br eaking the code, data will be grouped 
accordingly. All data will be analyzed in two different ways. Using a paired t -test data 
from subjects that have completed the two anesthesia  sessions of the study will be 
analyzed  and plotted . Separately, using an unp aired t -test all data will be grouped 
together including that from subjects who did not finish the trial.  In this way the data will 
be compared.   Only data from subjects that failed the toxicology screen will be excluded.

7.1 Risks  and Likelihood of Occurrence  
 
Anesthesia risks:  
Overall, anesthesia is extremely safe.  Our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744171].  However, there are 
potential risks for genera l anesthesia.  The likely risks in patients of the general 
population include, but are not limited to, post anesthesia nausea and vomiting  (up to 
30%) , mild to moderate sore throat, transient hypoxia (low oxygen level), transient blood 
pressure and heart r ate changes (sinus arrthymia). Most people do not experience any of 
these events. They are reversible and have no long term consequence.  
The more severe risks, but less likely, are awareness, under anesthesia, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_315340] ( up to 0.03% - that is t he reason that you are told not to eat and drink for 8 
hours prior to the anesthesia so that your stomach can be as empty as possible), severe 
hypoxia due to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_744172], severe hyper or hypotension, sustained 
arrthymia, dental damage, v ocal cord damage and reactions to drugs we administrate. 
There events do not commonly occur in the healthy population. With the screening tests 
in this study, these events are  very unlikely to occur. If they occur, they will be very 
unlikely to cause long term consequences with proper treatments.  
 
The most severe risks are unexpected difficult airway, including difficult mask 
ventilation and difficult intubation, and malignant hyperthermia (MH), a genetic 
associated reaction to anesthesia  (0.002 -0.005%) . These are considered rarely events in 
Anesthesia although severe consequences, such as organ damage or even death may 
occur.  We will carefully screen the subjects  based on our exclusion criteria to minimize 
these risks. Therefore, these risks will be furthe r reduced in the population of our study 
because of careful screening carried out prior to the administration of anesthesia.  In 
addition, our anesthesia location and anesthesiologists are well -equipped to handle these 
situations so that the damage will be  as minimal as possible.  
 
Assessing risks for this trial are somewhat complicated. We will be recruiting healthy 
volunteers for this trial, while most of the available data comes from the pool of people 
receiving anesthesia f or surgery. Most of these surg ical patients  are quite sick and are 
therefore susceptible in ways that healthy people are not.  
 
As an example: A  common number used in anesthesia related deaths in ~1 per hundred 
thousand (see Fig. 1 in ref  (Haller  et al. , 2011) ). Different recent studies have different 
numbers. Some studies have higher numbers of deaths (~2 per hundred thousand 
(Kawashima  et al. , 2003) ) while others have lower number of deaths (~4 per million , 
(Aitkenhead, 2005) ). The problem with these numbers is that they include all anesthesia’s  
including those in sick patients.  Sick patients have most of the adverse reactions. I have 
only found a single study that examined  ASA -1 patients by [CONTACT_744212] (ASA -1 patients 
are healthy and are similar to those we hope to enroll ). This study, which covered a span 
of 14 year s found zero anesthesia related deaths in this 14 year interval in ASA -1 patients 
(Khan & Khan, 2011) . This is why anesthe sia studies in healthy human volunteers have 
been allowed in the past.  There were ~22,000 ASA -1 patients tracked.

Definition of ASA categories:  
 
ASA -1:  No organic, phy siologic, or psychiatric disturbance; excludes the very young 
and very old; healthy with good exercise tolerance  
 
ASA -2: No functional limitations; has a well -controlled disease of one body system; 
controlled hypertension or diabetes without systemic effec ts, cigarette smoking without 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); mild obesity, pregnancy  
 
ASA -3: Some functional limitation; has a controlled disease of more than one body 
system or one major system; no immediate danger of death; controlled cong estive heart 
failure (CHF), stable angina, old heart attack, poorly controlled hypertension, morbid 
obesity, chronic renal failure; bronchospastic disease with intermittent symptoms  
 
ASA -4: Has at least one severe disease that is poorly controlled or at en d stage; possible 
risk of death; unstable angina, symptomatic COPD, symptomatic CHF, hepatorenal 
failure  
 
ASA -5:  Not expected to survive > 24 hours without surgery; imminent risk of death; 
multiorgan failure, sepsis syndrome with hemodynamic instability, hypothermia, poorly

Risks of Caffeine:  
 Caffeine is very safe and  commonly used in the household  and also used clinically in 
certain conditions, such as post -dural puncture headache in post -partum women and sleep 
apnea in premature  infants.  T he doses used in this study are lower than  those used in 
infants for sleep apnea.  The FDA categorizes caffeine as "Generally Recognized as 
Safe".  However, caffeine can have side effects, such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], seizure, sleepless or 
nervousness.   Seizures are exceptionally rare and occur at much higher concentrations 
than will be used in the current study.  We don't expect caffeine's effects to be any 
different with or without anesthesia.  Two clinical trials, one in adults and another in 
childre n, showed that it was safe to administer caffeine to anesthetized patients (Khalil  et 
al., 2008; Steinbrook  et al. ). Both these trials used caffeine and sodium benzoate.  
 
In this protocol we describe a procedure  where anesthetized healthy hu man volunteers 
would be given 15  mg/ kg caffeine citrate , 10 minutes before t erminating anesthesia. The 
caffeine is to be administered slowly across a 10-minute time window so as to prevent a 
large spi[INVESTIGATOR_744173].  We propose using healthy, low body mass male 
volunteers exclusively in this trial. In these low body mass, low weight volunteers 15  mg/ 
kg caffeine and citrate will translate to 750-1200 mg caffeine citrate  in total. Normalizing 
for the weight of the volunteers represents a more rigorous pharmacological approach 
than simply giving everyone the same a mount of caffeine citrate . Note that 15  mg/ kg 
caffeine citrate is equivalent to ~7.5  mg/ kg of caffeine base.  Thus 750 -1200  mg caf feine 
citrate corresponds to 375 -600 mg of pure caffeine.

The New Scientist website states that caffeine is the most commonl y used psychoactive 
drug and in the [LOCATION_002] more than 90% of adults use it daily. Caffeine has been 
used by [CONTACT_744213]. Hundreds of 
millions of Americans drink caffeinated beverages every day. Worl dwide the number is 
in the billions. In some cases the drinks contain large amounts of caffeine. For instance, a 
large cup (20 oz) of Starbuck’s coffee contains over [ADDRESS_1017847] been given IV injections of caffeine 
citrate to treat apnea of prematurity (Reference 1 - (Parikka  et al. , 2015) ). Caffeine is a 
neonatal success stor y. It is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in neonatal 
medicine. And it has been used successfully for about 40 years. See below for a more 
complete description.  
 
In our trial we propose us ing caffeine in anesthetized patients. We found two studie s 
where caffeine has  been tested in anesthetized patients  (Kha lil et al. , 2008; Steinbrook  et 
al., 2013) . In the Khalil et al study, 20 mg/ kg caffeine was given to anesthetized children 
(Khalil  et al. , 2008) . This dosage is 33% higher than what we propose in our trial. The 
duration of the caffeine application is difficult to determine from the study. But it is 
important to note that no adverse effects were reported in the 36 children that  received an 
injection of 20 mg/ kg caffeine with sodium benzoate.  
 
The study that is most relevant to our proposed trial is that of Steinbrook et al. 
(Steinbrook  et al. , 2013) . In this study, anesthetized adult patients were given a bolus of 
caffeine (500 mg), [ADDRESS_1017848] -dural puncture headaches for 
decades. In the Sechzer and Abel study (Sechzer & Abel, 1978) , dozens of women were

Caffeine and sodium benzoate has been used in psychiatric studies. In one such study, 
caffeine and sodium benzoate was used in psychiatric patients at concentrations much 
higher than we plan to give to our volunteers. In this study 8 patients receive d IV caffeine 
sodium benzoate in the range of 500 – 2000 mg. The patients received the drug on 
multiple occasions at multiple concentrations (between 500 – 2000 mg). The drug was 
always applied as a single bolus. No adverse effects of the caffeine sodium b enzoate were 
reported (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_626107]. , 1987) . In this study, the methodology, a bolus application and the 
concentration (up to 2000 mg), are more extreme than a re proposed in our IRB protocol .  
 
In a different psychiatric study, McCall (McCall, 1992)  gave 10 patients caffeine sodium 
benzoate (500 mg) IV during amobarbital interviews to keep them from falling asleep. 
The caffeine was administered as a single bolus. This combination of caffeine 
concentration and bolus administration wer e similar to what we propose.   
 
Thousands and thousands of preterm infants have been given IV injections of caffeine to 
treat apnea of prematurity (Parikka  et al. , 2015) . Caffeine is a neonatal success story. It is 
one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in neonatal medicine. And it has been used 
successf ully for about 40 years. A brief excerpt from (Kreutzer & Bassler, 2014)  - 
Kreutzer & Bassler, where they discuss caffeine in neonates: “Until 2006, it had only a 
few relatively small and short -term studies supporting its use. It is thanks to the efforts of 
Barbara Schmidt and the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) Trial Group that we 
now have high -quality and reliable data not only on short -term but also lon g-term 
outcomes of caffeine use for apnea of prematurity. CAP was an international, 
multicenter, placebo -controlled randomized trial designed to determine whether survival 
without neurodevelopmental disability at a corrected age of 18 months is improved if  
apnea of prematurity is managed without methylxanthines in infants at a high risk of 
apneic attacks. CAP was kept simple and pragmatic in order to allow for maximum 
generalizability and applicability……… However, recent data suggest that the 
administration  of prophylactic methylxanthine by [CONTACT_744214]”.  
 
Caffeine citrate is functionally identical to caffeine and sodium benzoate. It has been used 
for decades as an injectable drug, with great success.  
 
It is true that in none of th e studies listed above have any subjects been given caffeine 
with a 10-minute  injection, in a manner similar to what we propose. We would like to do 
this to prevent spi[INVESTIGATOR_744174]. In several of the studies 
listed above ca ffeine was admini stered as a single bolus.  Our preference, though, is a 10-
minute  infusion of caffeine applied via a pump.  That is how we administered the caffeine 
in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

than what we propose (see references 2 and 6 for examples). In all cases the drug was 
applied as an IV injection. No adverse responses were observed.  
Finally, if there is a problem, t he anesthesiologists are well trained to manage any 
unexpected events associated with anesthesia and the study drug.  The area of the study 
will be well equipped to handle any unexpected events as well.  For the most common 
side effects, such as nausea/vomiting, we will hydrate the subjects and administer 
antiemetic medications.  There are rarely any long-term effects with post anesthesia 
nausea and vomiting.  Mild or moderate sore throat usually goes away in a day or two.  If 
any severe complic ations, such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], arrhyt hmia , persistent hypoxia, occur, the 
patient will be excused from the study.  The anesthesiologists will manage the situation 
until the subject's conditions return to no rmal.  Anesthesiologists are  experts dealing with 
these situations in the operating rooms.  The area of the study is adj acent to the operating 
rooms where airway management equipment, code cart (defibrillator, pacemaker and 
emergency drugs) and malignant hyperthermia cart are immediately available.  
 
Risk of Data Loss:  
There is also a risk that confidentia lity will be lost.  However, subject  identity and data 
will be locked up in the PI's office . Only the investigators in this project have access to 
the data. The identity will not be included in the publication. The subject's identities will 
be destroyed once the analysis is completed for publication.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1017850]  
Although the risks involved are more than minimal, the benefits to the general medical 
community are significant. Why is recovery from anesthesia important? Isn’t recovery 
pretty fast nor mally? Recovery is rapid in most patients, but not in all. Small subsets of 
patients “wake ” slowly. Even after “waking” from anesthesia patients can still exhibit 
cognitive impairment that can last for hours.  This is especially true in the elderly. If 
drugs like caffeine were able to accelerate cognitive recovery in addition to accelerating 
“waking” times that would be extremely useful. Also, a large percentage of children 
(>20%) develop emergence agitation, a form of delirium, following anesthesia. Rather  
than re -anesthetize the child, the current practice, or use a variety of pre -medications, a 
safe and effective way to reverse the anesthesia, like caffeine, would be useful. If caffeine 
reverses anesthesia and calms the children, that would be extremely u seful. Although we 
will not test any children, if the drug works in adults there will be a strong chance it will 
work in children.  
Seniors are especially vulnerable to anesthesia. As more elderly undergo surgeries, it is 
apparent that recovery can take a long time (days). Memory especially appears to be 
labile. It would be very beneficial to have a drug that could reverse the effects of 
anesthesia in this population.  
What is the goal of this trial? Our goal is to determine whether caffeine helps patients 
emerge from anesthesia quickly and reproducibly and to find out whether caffeine helps 
with the cognitive deficits that persist following anesthesia. Normally, recovery from 
anesthesia is somewhat random, dependent upon a variety of factors, like genetics o r age

recovery from anesthesia in a reproducible manner and to have that recovery be 
complete.  Even though patients “wake” from anesthesia, there are still cognit ive 
problems that persist for hours. Patient’s reaction rates are slowed and memory can be 
impaired. Accidents may occur due to cognitive problems following anesthesia, which  
include problems with balance and with walking. And then there are outliers; pati ents that 
wake very slowly after anesthesia.  None of this would be a problem, if there were a 
reliable drug that could speed recovery from anesthesia. Ideally you would design the 
drug to be almost completely innocuous and very inexpensive. If one had a r eally safe 
drug and one that was almost free, it might be possible to give it to everyone. Caffeine 
may be such a drug. It is the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world, used 
by [CONTACT_744215]. If caffeine were to reverse cognitive deficits associated with 
anesthesia that would be valuable.  
An additional benefit of c affeine is that it may reduce pain.  Caffeine and  sodium 
benzoate is used to reduce pain in post dural puncture headaches. Caffeine also magnifies 
the pain killing power of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27969] n, ibuprophen and narcotics . That is why caffeine is an 
active ingredient in Excedrin Extra Strength or prescription drugs like Darvon 
Compound -65 or Triaminicin with Codeine .   There may be several different 
mechanisms  that enable caffeine to relieve pain  of different kinds and differing 
intensities;  intense pain may be directly sensitive to caffeine . It is possible that caffeine 
will be beneficial in reducing post -operative pain.  
In a recent clinical trial in anesthetized children, caffeine was found to b e safe (the trial 
was to determine whether caffeine could reduce the number of children who experience 
adverse post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] – caffeine helped significantly).  
Caffeine has been shown safe to use in anesthetized adults. In a clinical tr ial, to determine 
whether caffeine ameliorated post anesthesia nausea and vomiting, patients were given 
[ADDRESS_1017851], they will obtain a 
physical exam free of charge. Many people do not avail themselves of regular medical 
attention or don't have access. Identification of health -related issues may be important to 
the subject . Although the subjects will not be enro lled in the study, they will be informed 
of any issues identified by [CONTACT_47656]. Second, is that many people have anesthesia 
during their lifetimes. Any beneficial changes to clinical standards will help them, but at 
an unidentified time in the future.

8.2 Adverse  Events  
Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  
Any problematic or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including 
any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical e xam or laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s involvement in the research, 
whether or not considered related to participation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
• Any adverse event that:  
• Results in deat h 
• Is life threatening, or places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event  as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Causes can cer 
• Is an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, 
but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, 
and may require intervention to prevent one of the other s erious outcomes noted

reported to the IRB at the time of IRB Continuing Review.  
 
8.4.2 Serious  Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs will be reported according to FDA guidelines for receipt of Adverse Event 
reporting:  
• Unexpected fatal or life threatening experiences associated with the use of 
the drug (21 CFR 312[.32[c] [ii] [2]) - must be reported to the FDA by 
[CONTACT_744216]’s initial receipt of the 
information if the intervention is under an Investigative New Drug (IND) 
application.  
If an adverse drug experience was not initially determined to be reportable 
but the resu lts of an investigation show that the experience is reportable 
under the above paragraph, the experience should be submitted to the FDA 
in a written safety report as soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 
calendar days after the determination is m ade. 
• Other adverse experiences associated with the use of the drug that are both 
serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar 
days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
• If the drug is marketed and not under an IND  (21 CFR 314.80[(c) (1) (i)], 
a serious and unexpected adverse drug experience must be reported to the 
FDA within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information by [CONTACT_744217].  
 
8.4.3 Unanticipated Problems (UP)  Reporting  
All Unanticipated Proble ms that meet the stated criteria (section 8.2) will be 
reported within 10 days using the Unanticipated Problem Report Form  to the

Classifications often include the following:  
 Mild : Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
•  Moderate : Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
subject and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
[CONTACT_744218]; moderate experiences may cause some 
interference with functioning.  
  Severe:  Events interrupt the subject’s normal daily a ctivities and generally 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
2. Expectedness  
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur o r unexpected, 
meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, informed 
consent form, investigator brochure, product insert, or label. Categories are:  
•  Unexpected - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with informat ion 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, 
product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
•  Expected  - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.  
 
3.  Relationship to the Study Drug  
The potential event relationship to the study intervention and/or participation must be 
assessed by [CONTACT_6962]. A comprehensive scale in common use to categorize 
an event is:  
•  Definitely Related : The adverse event is clearly related to the inv estigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_744177]’s clinical state.  
•  Possibly Related : An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administrat ion of the study intervention and follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily 
have been produced by a number of other factors.  
•  Not Related : The adverse event is clearly not related to the investiga tional 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a 
clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event 
and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically 
impla usible.

8.7 Data  Safety Monitoring Plan  
A final analysis will be done a t the end of the study. However, data will be reviewed after 
each session  with a volunteer (excluding the screening sessions) . Particularly, any safety 
issues, such as unexpected vitals signs change or adverse events, will be recogni zed 
immediately. Theref ore, correction s can be made quickly.  
Any serious/unexpected adverse events will be immediately reported to the IRB. An 
investigation will be carried out immediately.  If the adverse events are observed, then the 
caffeine dosage will be reduced.  If simil ar adverse events keep being caused by [CONTACT_50464], we will stop the study unless we can find a solution to avoid these events.   
We will review each session every day so that we can deal with any adverse events in a 
timely manner.    We will have follo w up phone call s to the subject  to make sure that no 
adverse effects occur away from UC . 
The team that evaluates subject  safety will include three anesthesiologists (Apfelbaum, 
Wong and Xie) all of whom are faculty at UC and all are experienced anesthesiol ogists. 
Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_744219], the PI.  
Our protocol is designed to be conservative in order to prevent any unexpected or adverse 
effects. The concentrations anesthetics and caffeine used in this study are  safe based on 
the data in the literature. Even so, unexpected events can occur.  For example, seizure or 
arrhythmia will be reported immediately to the IRB. Similarly a fall in BP that triggers a 
response (see above), but which does not respond quickly to  treatment will be reported. If 
any of these events , seizure  or arrhythmia or prolonged depression of BP, occurs in more

Data from the trial will be published as soon as the trial is complete regardless of whether 
the result s confirm our working hypothesis.  All subject identifiers will be removed as 
they are not required for publication. In addition to the primary endpoints (eye, opening 
and response to command) and secondary endpoints (psychomotor results), we will also 
publish vital sign information in the presence and absence of caffeine.

 Page 7 of 91 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma  
Metastatic RCC accounts for 14,000 deaths each year in the U.S. (1). It is a heterogeneous 
disease divided generally into two major groups: clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) (80%) and non- clear 
cell RCC (nccRCC). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_432339], the median survival remained only 22 months in 2009(2).   The introduction of molecul arly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432340]. 
Since the first approval of sorafenib in December 2005, seven different drugs have been shown to provide clinical benefit for patients with RCC (2 -4).  Agents targeting the VEGF pathway 
have emerged as the most robust therapeutic option, and are therefore the initial treatment choice for metastatic RCC. Sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib (VEGF receptors tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)) and bevacizumab (monoclonal antibody against VEGF ligand) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved in advanced RCC. Another class of targeted agents used in 
metastatic RCC are allosteric inhibito rs of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1).  Everolimus and 
temsirolimus, both sirolimus analogs (rapalogs), are also FDA-approved for use in the treatment of metastatic RCC based on large randomized phase III trials (3, 4) . However, the clinical benefit 
from mTOR inhibitors is generally modest, with few partial responses (PRs) and very rare complete responses (CRs).   
2.2 TAK -228 
Millennium has developed TAK-228, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable 
adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). TAK -228 (formerly INK128) targets [ADDRESS_547535] 
mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.  TAK-228 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC
50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/[ADDRESS_547536] known as a key regulator of protein translation through 
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (the eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 4E-binding Protein 1) and ribosomal protein S6 (known as S6) kinase. mTORC2 is best known for its ability to fully activate protein kinase B (AKT) by [CONTACT_432363] S473 site, which regulates proliferation and survival pathways.  The mTORC is an important therapeutic target that is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR inh ibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including 
solid tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsi rolimus and 
everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547537] by [CONTACT_432364]1 and mTORC2.  TAK-228 is being developed for both oncology and non-oncology indications. In oncology, TAK-228 is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, other molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or antihormonal agents. Non-oncology indications being investigated include fibrotic and inflammatory diseases.  
 
2.2.1 Pharmacology 
TAK-228 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (the concentration inhibiting 50% of 
enzyme activity [IC
50] is 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular 
proliferation. 
 TAK-228 inhibited phosphorylation of downstream modulators of mT ORC1and mTORC2  in 
human U87 glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in mice and showed strong tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at tolerable oral (PO) doses in all 8 xenograft models tested (see IB Ed8 for details) . 
 TAK-[ADDRESS_547538] the human ether -à-go- go related gene (hERG)  potassium 
ion channel and did not affect cardiovascular (CV) parameters in vivo in telemeterized monkeys.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_547539] showed the superiority of TAK-228 over rapamycin and 
rapalog s in inhibiting tumor growth in several cancers, such as: breast and pancreatic cancer, 
glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B -cell ALL).  
 TAK-228 reduces p- 4EBP1  (phosphorylated- eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding 
protein 1) and p- S6K1 (phosphorylated-ribosomal S6 kinase 1), reflecting  mTORC1  inhibition, 
as well as p -AKT  (also known as protein kinase B) and p-NDRG1 (phosphorylated N- myc 
downstream- regulated gene 1) reflecting  mTORC2 inhibition (5 -7). In contrast, rapalogs only 
decrease phosphorylation of p- S6K1 with variable effects on p -4EBP1 , and increases 
phosporylation of Akt (5, 7, 8). Akt phosphorylation due to rapalog treatment is due to feedback activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) /Akt pathway, and may contribute to the limited clinical benefit of rapalog mTORC1 inhibitors. Consistent with this model, TAK -228 
was found to be effective in cancer cells where the PI3K/Akt pathway has been upregulated, such as HER2  (human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] 2)- positive breast cancer cell lines resistant to 
HER2 inhibition (transtuzumab and lapatinib) (9). TAK-[ADDRESS_547540] cancer cell lines harboring PIK3CA (phosphoinositide-3-kinase- catalytic -alpha) , PTEN  
(phosphatase and tensin homolog) , KRAS  (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), and/or

It has also been shown to decrease the invasiveness of prostate cancer cell lines through the inhibition of translation of the genes that play a role in the invasion and metastasis potential, such as: YB1  (Y-box binding 
protein 1) , MTA1  (metastatic associated 1) , vimentin and CD44 (cluster of differentiation 44) 
(5). It also inhibits the VEGF -induced lung metastasis in xenografts models of breast cancer (6). 
In pancreatic cancer cell lines, TAK -228 also enhanced their radiosensitivity through the 
inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair (10).  In a study directly comparing catalytic inhibitors to allosteric inhibitors of mTOR, TAK-[ADDRESS_547542] cell lines compared to rapamycin  (11).  Furthermore, its growth inhibitory 
effect was  greater in cell lines and in vivo  models that have either intrinsic or acquired resistance 
to rapamycin, highlighting its efficacy in resistant settings compared to  rapamycin (11).  
 TAK-228 (MLN0128) has also been shown to have a synergistic effect with several drugs, including: dasatinib in Philadelphia Chromosome-positive B –cell ALL cell lines, lapatinib in HER2 -positive breast cancer cell lines , melphalan,  doxorubicin, and dexamethasone in multiple 
myeloma cell lines (7 -9). 
 In RCC, a pre- clinical trial using patient -derived tissue slice graft (TSG) model s derived from 
fresh primary RCC specimens  was used to compare the effect of TAK-228 versus temsirolimus. 
TAK-228 consistently  suppressed primary RCC growth up to two months whereas temsirolimus 
only transiently inhibited the growth of TSGs before resistance developed.  In addition, TAK-
228 was the only drug to reduce liver metastases lending strong support for the use of dual mTOR C1/2 inhibitors in RCC (12). 
 
2.2.3 Clinical Studies

phase I studies of TAK-228 as a single agent in patients with advanced solid malignancies (INK 128-001), or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstorm’s macroglobulinemia (WM) (INK 128 -002). They are also being evaluated in a phase I study of TAK-228 in combination 
with paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 Page 10 of 91 Table 1: Phase I clinical trials of TAK-228 
 
 
There are several ongoing phase I and II clinical trials of TAK-228 (13).  TAK-228 is currently investigated in nine phase I clinical trials (one of which is completed), as a single agent and in combination with other drugs (paclitaxel, transtuzumab, MLN1117 (PI3K inhibitor), MLN2480 (A, B and C Raf inhibitor), bevacizumab, Ziv- Aflibercept) in patients with 
advanced solid tumours, recurrent glioblastoma as well as refractory  MM or WM . A phase I 
study is currently evaluating the effect of a 40 mg single dose of TAK- 228 on the 
electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval in participant s with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, 
there are 3 phase 1b/2 clinical trials, including one that is assessing the efficacy and the safety of 
TAK-228 with exemestane or fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive ( ER+)/Her2 - metastatic breast cancer in patients who progressed on everolimus with 
exemestane or fulvestrant. The efficacy of TAK-228 is being investigated in 3 phase II clinical trials in patients with metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer, metastatic castration -resistant prostate 
cancer as  well as advanced squamous lung cancer harboring NFE2L2 (Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 
2-like 2) and KEAP1 (Kelch -Like ECH -Associated Protein 1) mutations.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_432341]-

plasma concentration [C
max] of 0.48 µ M [free C max of 0.14 µ M] at 30 mg once weekly [QW]).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamics 
In INK128-001, t he pharmacodynamic effect of TAK-228 was measured in surrogate tissue 
(skin) to explore the downstream effectors of mTOR complex -1 inhibition (pS6 and p4EBP1) 
and mTOR complex-2 inhibition (pAKT (S473), pNDRG1 , and pPRAS40 (proline-rich Akt 
substrate of 40 kDa) ). Preliminary data demonstrate reduction of the levels of pS6, p4EBP1, 
pNDRG1, and pPRAS40 in skin at TAK-228 doses of ≥4 mg. pAKT (S473) had  high vari ability 
in the staining rendering  the results inconclusive.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Updated Manufacturing Process  
A new TAK -228 (MLN0128) capsule containing milled  active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) 
is available for new clinical studies in 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg strengths. In this study, the 5 mg 
capsules will be provided. 
 
The milled API, may result in faster absorption profile with possibly higher maximum concent ration (Cmax), which could result in a different safety profile compared to the previous 
unmilled API [INVESTIGATOR_259722]. Therefore, ongoing studies (C31001, C31002 and , TAK-228 
(MLN0128)-1004 –A Phase I, open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of TAK -228 (MLN0128) as a single agent and in combination with 
paclitaxel in adult patie nts with advanced non-hematological malignancies -), with the new 
milled API [INVESTIGATOR_432344] 2 dose (RP2D) for single agent TAK -228

 Page 12 of 91 (MLN0128) (QD and QW ) and  QD×3days per week  in combination with paclitaxel,  as well as 
the effect of high -fat meal on the PK of milled API . 
 
The selected dose of 30 mg TAK-228 QW is based on the findings from 2 studies: Study 
INK128 -[ADDRESS_547549]- in-human study of 
TAK-228. This was an open-label study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to identify dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) for oral administration of single -agent 
unmilled TAK -228, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of TAK -
228 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In this study, 116 patients with advanced solid tumors received TAK -228 (2 – 40 mg via 4 dosing schedules: QD [once a day] (31 patients), 
QDx 3 QW [3 days per week] (33 patients), QDx5 QW [5 days per week] (22 patients), and 
QW [once a week] (30 patients).) in the dose escalation phase. Doses of 40 mg QW, 30 mg QW and 5 mg QD were further evaluated in an additional 82 patients in the expansion phase.  
 
Improved tolerability, including a reduced frequency of TEAEs leading to dose interruptions and modifications, respectively (30 mg QW: 24% and 41%, versus 40 mg QW: 19% and 77%) and longer duration of clinical benefit favored 30 mg QW dosing as a RP2D and schedule for further development.  
 
Scale-up manufacturing of TAK-228 capsules required the introduction of a physical milling step during the granulation process to control for particle size distribution of TAK-228 drug substance. In order to obse rve whether this milling step altered the safety and PK profile of 
TAK-228, the recommended dose of 30 mg milled TAK- 228 QW was further evaluated and 
confirmed in Study MLN0128-1004 in which a total of 14 patients were enrolled and assigned, sequentially, to 2 QW dosing cohorts: 20 mg QW and 30 mg QW milled TAK-228 (see Table 2 below).  Table 2: Dose- Limiting Toxicity Observed w ith milled TAK-228 QW in Study

  1.3 Rationale The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in most cancer development, including RCC.  The mTOR pathway  plays a major role in cell growth, survival and migration. mTOR is the central 
component of 2 multi-protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2.  
 
mTORC1 is a heterotrimeric protein kinase that consists of the mTOR catalytic subunit and two 
associated proteins, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 ( mammalian 
lethal with SEC13 protein 8, a lso known as GβL  (G-protein beta-subunit like)) (14).  Activation 
of mTORC1 leads to the phosphorylation of S6K1, 4E-BP1, and numerous other protein targets (14) (Fig. 1). S6K1 phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and is a key regulator in cell growth. 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 13 of 91 Furthe rmore, S6K1 represses the PI3K–Akt pathway by [CONTACT_432365]1 (insulin receptor 
substrate 1) and IRS2 expression (14) (Fig. 1). Therefore , mTORC1 inhibition leads to feedback 
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway implicated in cell growth (15). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 
inhibits its binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which enables the cap-dependent translation of complex mRNAs such as Bcl-2 (B -cell lymphoma 2) and VEGF, thereby 
[CONTACT_432366], survival and angiogenesis (14).   mTORC2 consists of mTOR and mLST8 , as well as rictor (rapamycin -insensitive companion of 
mTOR) and mSin1 ( mammalian stress -activated protein kinase [SAPK] -interacting protein
, also 
known as mitogen- activated -protein-kinase-associated protein 1), that are not part of mTORC1  
(14). Activated  mTORC2 phosphorylat es Akt at  Serine (Ser)  473, as well as several other protein 
targets, leading to enhanced cell survival, proliferation, and cell migration (14) (Fig. 1). Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) inhibit mTORC1 by [CONTACT_432367] -binding 
protein FKB P12, which then binds to mTORC1 (14).  R apamycin has different degrees of 
inhibition for different substrates of mTORC1 .  It potently inhibits S6K1 phosphorylation, but 
has more variable effects on 4EBP1 phosphorylation and cap-dependent translation. In addition, rapalogs lead to feedback activation of Akt - as a result of inhibition of the S6K/IRS-[ADDRESS_547550] as an anticancer drug  (11, 15). In PTEN -deficient 
gliobla stoma patients treated with rapamycin, Akt hyperactivation was associated with a shorter 
time to progression (TTP) (15). Therefore, targeting Akt activation as with mTORC2 inhibition may provide superior clinical benefit. 
 
Rapalogs, such as everolimus and temsirolimus are currently used in the management of mRCC. However, their clinical benefit is limited with very rare CRs and few PRs. Therefore, it is essential to inv estigate drugs that have a potential increased clinical effect. Novel drugs have 
been developed to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2. TAK-228 (or INK128) is an ATP-competitive dual mTORC1/[ADDRESS_547551] to the competitive inhibitors of the mTOR catalytic site , rapamycin and rapalogs (temsirolimus and everol imus) are allosteric inhibitors of 
mTOR and result in a partial inhibition of the mTOR pathway through the inhibition of mTORC1 complex solely.  Furthermore, competitive dual mTORC1/[ADDRESS_547552] as well as in anti -tumor activity as it has 
the advantage of i nhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. Several pre- clinical studies have 
demonstrated the superiority of TAK-228 over rapamycin and its analogs, particularly in RCC and in settings of rapamycin resistance (11, 12). Therefore, the evidence suggests that TAK-[ADDRESS_547553] progressed on rapalogs.

Figure 1. TSC Protein Complex, mTOR Complex 1, and Downstream Effects. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, which include TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7, are negatively regulated by [CONTACT_18094] (+P) by [CONTACT_432368], ERK, and RSK, which are all core kinases that are activated during growth signaling. This complex is activated under hypoxia and on phosphorylation by [CONTACT_432369] a GTPase- activating 
protein to negatively regulate RHE B, a Ras family member GTPase. RHEB -GTP activates 
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), which is also regulated by [CONTACT_432370]. In some cases, the mechanism of regulation is not completely understood (as indicated by a dashed line). In aggregate, these transcription factors, translation factors, and enzymes lead to biosynthesis of ribosomes and other components that are needed f or

1.4 Correlative Studies Background  
As described above, TAK -228 is a dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2 signaling, thus it inhibits 
phosphorylation of their downstream modulators. TAK-228 has been shown to downregulate p-
4EBP1 ,p-S6k, HIF1α  (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α) and MTA1 downstream of m TORC1  as 
well as AKT , c-Myc  and NDRG1 downstream of mTORC2 (5 -7, 12, 14).  
 
Acquired secondary mutations in MTOR are one mechanism of resistance to rapalogs, as was 
demonstrated in a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer (17). Whole exome sequencing was performed on a tumor sample from a patient who progressed after an impressive 18 months response. A missense mutation in MTOR (F2108L (G>T)) was found only in the biopsy performed at the time of resistance, and not in the pre- treatment tumor. In v itro studies showed 
that this mutation conferred resistance of mTORC1 to rapalog treatment, but not to mTOR kinase inhibitors, specifically a tool compound Torin1 (11). 
 
Furthermore, i t has also been suggested that eIF4E amplification may also be a mechanism of 
resistance to  mTOR inhibitors . eIF4E is an essential component of the eIF4F complex that 
recruits the mRNA to the ribosome to initiate translation  thereby [CONTACT_432371], survival 
and angiogenesis. 4E- BPs (4E-binding proteins) are a family of small translational repressors 
which sequester eIF4E, thereby [CONTACT_432372]4F complex.
 4E-BP1 is 
phosphorylated by [CONTACT_218525]1 activation, inhibiting its binding to eIF4E. Alain et al. have shown that a higher eIF4E/4E- BP ratio is predictive of resistance to catalytic mTOR inhibitors (18). 
Similarly,  in a study by [CONTACT_432373]., amplification of eIF4E has been shown to confer resistance 
to AZD8005 - a catalytic mTOR inhibitor - with  ribonucleic acid interference ( RNAi )-mediated 
knockdown of eIF4E reversing the acquired resistance (19).   Several genes have been found to be significantly mutated in clear cell RCC including HIF1α, HIF1β, PBRM1 and SETD2. Additionally, the cancer genome atlas research network have identified and validated 19 significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in ccRCC with VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, PTEN, BAP1, MTOR and TP53 being the most significant(20) . In 
chromophobe RCC, the SMGs included TP53, PTEN, mTOR, NRAS, TSC1 and TSC2 (21). 22% 
(15/66) of the somatic alterations occurred in the genetic components affecting the mTOR pathway, indicating its role in chromphobe RCC.

• Monitor home glucometer test results.  
• Check HbA1c levels every 3 months during therapy.

physical activity).  
• Most epi[INVESTIGATOR_13368] 1 and 2 hyperglycemia respond quickly to oral metformin.  
• Early initiation of therapy is recommended to prevent higher grade hyperglycemia.  
• Fasting blood glucose levels ≥  150 mg/dL by [CONTACT_298322].  
Abbreviations:  dL = deciliters; mg = milligrams; ULN = upper limit of normal.  
 
On the basis of the clinical experience in TAK -[ADDRESS_547581] s who develop Grade 1 hyperglycemia (fasting glucose >ULN ≤160 mg/dL) or, 
alternatively, consider initiating treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent, such as metformin. All subject s with ≥Gra de 2 hyperglycemia (fasting glucose >160 mg/dL) must be treated 
aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as clinically indicated. The site investigator should consult an endocrinologist, if needed, to aid in optimizing the subject ’s 
hyperglycemia treatment plan.  
 It is recommended that subject s be initially treated with a fast acting insulin sensitizer such as 
metformin at 500 mg orally QD, and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg orally BID as needed. Concurrent addition to metformin of DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin or vildagliptin) and/or insulin should also be considered. Oral sulfonylureas (eg, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) should be used with caution, due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in subject s. The dose of oral 
hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subject s with renal insufficiency. In addition, subject s 
should be encouraged to follow a low carbohydrate diet once hyperglycemia is first observed. If any fasting serum glucose reading performed at the site indicates hypergl ycemia (>ULN or 
≥110 mg/dL), the study staff should first confirm that the subject  was fasting at the time of blood 
specimen collection (ie, nothing by [CONTACT_24314] 8 hours before collection).  In-Home Daily Fasting Glucose Monitoring 
In addition to obtaining fasting glucose levels at the clinic visits as outlined in the Schedule of Events, all subject s receiving TAK-[ADDRESS_547582] a daily FBG level every morning (predose on dosing days), starting on Cycle [ADDRESS_547583] s will be instructed to bring 
the glucometer with them to each study visit so that the data collected can be reviewed and recorded in the source documents. Site investigators will be responsible for reviewing the home glucose monitoring logs for hyperglycemia.

observed during home glucose monitoring should be confirmed in the clinic.  If no irregularities 
in the fasting blood glucose level are observed during a minimum of 2 consecutive months, then 
the frequency of in-home fasting blood glucose testing can be reduced to a minimum frequency 
of once weekly, depending on the site  investigator’s judgment and approval. Subject s will 
continue to notify the site  investigator of fasting blood glucose levels that exceed 150 mg/dL 
and, if blood glucose levels are not well controlled, or if the subject  requires either oral 
hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control blood glucose levels, then the frequency of in-home testing of FBG levels will be reinstated to daily.

8. CORRELATIVE TISSUE  AND BLOOD ANALYS ES  
 8.1 TISSUE ANALYSES  
A DFCI mutation screen analysis of 300 cancer genes (Oncopanel ), including all those involved 
in regulation of mTOR will be performed on pre- treatment biopsies in all subjects to correlate 
with response to TAK-228(22). Data will be analyzed using standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_432352], as well as tools to identify regions of significant copy number variation across the genome.  
 Immunoblotting and IHC will performed on pre and post- treatment biopsies to analy ze the 
downstream targets of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and correlate with the clinical response to TAK-228. The downstream targets are the following: S6, p-S6, S6K1, p-S6K1, 4EBP1, p-4EBP1, Akt-S473 and p- AKT -S473. 
 In responding subject s who subsequently progress, the post-treatment biopsy will be used for 
genetic studies to determine the mechanism of resistance. A DFCI mutation screen (Oncopanel) as well as whole exome sequencing will be performed on pre and post- treatment biopsies to 
understand the mechanism of resistance.

be obtained prior to study treatment if available.  This t issue will be used to assess response to 
TAK-228, and evaluate mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy. Mutation profiling will be 
performed using massively parallel sequencing technology (Oncopanel) and/or whole exome sequencing.  In addition, nucleic acid purification will be performed on the specime ns.

the whole tumor (i.e. containing predominant and highest Fuhrman grade areas). Formalin -fixed 
paraffin -embedded tumor tissue blocks are preferred and should contain tumor areas that 
measure at least 1 cm square in aggregate. Alternatively, a minimum of 20 unstained 4- micron -
thick sections (on charged slides) can be provided. The unstained slides should be coated with paraffin. Surgical specimens are preferr ed with order of preference being 1) nephrectomy 
specimens and 2) metastatectomy specimens. If surgical specimens are not available, core- needle 
biopsy specimens are acceptable. Fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], brushings, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy are not acceptable.   
8.1.2 Fresh Tissue Correlative Studies

If subjects do not have archival tissue from within the previous [ADDRESS_547601] occur within 28-days prior to initiation of study therapy.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression  
In subjects who experience an objective response as defined by [CONTACT_44993] 1.[ADDRESS_547602]. During the core needle biopsy procedure, four core samples will be collected: one will be placed in formalin for routine histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies and the remaining three will be frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two of the cores will be utilized for genomic analysis and the remaining core will be used for IHC and immunoblot analysis.  In addition, nucleic acid purification will be performed on the specimens . 
 Biopsies will be obtained in a manner that minimizes risk and will be taken only if there  is no 
intervening condition (e.g., thrombocytopenia or neutropenia) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_91382], increases the likelihood of procedural complications to an unacceptable level.  
 
Biopsies should be performed per institutional standards and/or operator preference. Blood samples will be drawn within 2 weeks of the biopsy to document an acceptable coagulation profile (INR ≤ 1.5, PTT ≤ 60, platelets > 50,000). Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], and NSAIDS should be discontinued 5 days prior to the biopsy.  
 
Preferred biopsy sites include: lymph nodes, peripheral based liver lesions, exophytic soft tissue components associated with bone lesions, subcutaneous nodules, pleural-based lesions, and kidney lesions. An 18 gauge needle or larger is preferred when possible. For each tissue

9. CRITERIA FOR  DISEASE EVALUATION  
For the purposes of this study, subject s should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) (23). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
9.[ADDRESS_547604] their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Subjects who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Subjects who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547605] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_547606] x- ray or ≥[ADDRESS_547607] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 NOTE:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.   Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_547608] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascit es, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered non- measurable.  
 NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographic ally defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection  as target lesions.  
 Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions  should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 52 of 91 9.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a 
digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_432379] n unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diamet er as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e. g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as wi th CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters fo r all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
9.4 Response  Criteria  
 
9.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547609] 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as refer ence the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
9.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis ). 
 
NOTE:   If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
subject  to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_432353], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or sponsor investigator ). 
 
9.4.3 Evaluation of New Lesions 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning 
technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is 
confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_547610] response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The subject 's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  For Subject s with Measurable Disease ( i.e., Target Disease)

Note :  Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

9.4.5 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive

Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547612] disease evaluation ). 
 
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured  from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is 
objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Subject s without events reported are 
censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

 Overall , PK data from Studies INK128- 001, INK128-002, and INK128 -[ADDRESS_547615] oral absorption (time to reach the maximal concentration ( Cmax ) [tmax 
],generally between 1-4 hours after dosing); has dose- linear PK, with a mean plasma half -life of 
approximately 8 hours; and does not accumulate meaningfully in plasma when dosed as frequently as once daily  and under any of 4 tested dosing regimens (1.once daily, 2. once daily 
for 3 consecutive days followed by a 4-day dosing holiday every week, 3.once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 2-day dosing holiday every week, 4.once weekly). The PK of TAK-228 was generally consistent, with no appreciable differences across the clinical studies that measured PK. Neither paclitaxel nor TAK -228 appeared to alter the PK of the other agent  
when co -administered.  
Clinical Drug -Drug Interaction (DDIs) studies have not been conducted with TAK-228. At this 
time, there are no known drug interactions. In vitro data, including CYP induction/inhibition and transporter inhibition studies conducted fo r TAK -228, suggest a low risk for TAK-228 to  
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a drug -drug interaction. Although potential DDIs with TAK-228 cannot be ruled out 
based on the known metabolism characteristics of TAK-228, the potential risk is considered low.

[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event  
For this study, an AE is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current IB, prescribing information or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected  also refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or are anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

TAK-228. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of TAK-228 treatment or after the designated  follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be 
related to any study drug must be reported to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported, regardless of causality to study regimen, for a minimum of two  years after the last dose of the 
investigational product, starting from the first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be reported to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigil ance (or designee).
 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432356] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness (es). 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bradley McGregor  also 
referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) 
to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB.    
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs must also be reported in English to [COMPANY_005] 
Pharmacovigilance or designee:  
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
All other serious (non -fatal/non life threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
The Sponsor will send all SAE reports to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance (or designee) within [ADDRESS_547630] include at minimum:  
• Event term(s)  
• Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s determination.

12. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 12.1 Study Design  
This is an open- label, single -arm phase II study of TAK-228 (the ATP-competitive inhibitor of 
the serine/threonine kinase mTOR) at recommended phase II dosing of [ADDRESS_547631] (8  week) imaging assessment to determine their  response status. The second stage 
will assess the overall response after all patients are enrolled.  
 
12.2 Endpoints  
12.2.1 Definition  of Primary Endpoint 
Objective Response (OR) : Confirmed CR or PR as best overall response ac cording to RECIST 
version 1.[ADDRESS_547632]. For subjects without documented progression or cessation of trial therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the objective response determination.  
12.2.2 Definition of Secondary Endpoint s 
• Safety and tolerability according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 
• Progression- free survival (PFS) :  time from registration to the earlier of (radiographic) 
progression based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_547633] disease evaluation .  
• Overall survival (OS):  time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at 
date last known alive.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_547634] s with metastatic RCC will be enrolled for a goal of 38 evaluable subjects (assuming 5% 
not evaluable). ,The two-stage single arm phase II study is designed to detect an  improvement in 
response rate from 5% to 20%. Assum ing a type I error of 0.05 and targeting 90% statistical 
power, 20 patients will be  accrued (for 19 evaluable ) in the first stage . The first interim analysis 
will occur w hen the first 8 week imaging assessment for response data is available  for all 20

Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 65 of 91 patients . If 1 or more responses are observed, the accrual will continue to the second stage. 
Twenty (for 19 evaluable) additional patients will be accrued in the second stage. TAK-228 w ill 
be declared ineffective in this study if <5 responses are observed. It will be considered worth y of 
further stu dy if more than 4 ( ≥5) responses are observed.

Section 12.2.1.  ORR and its 90% exact confidence interval (CI) using the method of Atkinson 
and Brown (1985) will be provided based on the evaluable population. Best overall response (BOR) will also be summarized. In addition, tumor burden data will be summarized by [CONTACT_432382][INVESTIGATOR_432357].  
12.4.2 Analysis Plans for Secondary Objectives  
Safety and Tolerability: All adverse events record ed during the trial will be summarized for the 
safety population. The incidence of events that are new or worsening from the time of first dose 
of treatment will be summarized according to system organ class and/or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE version 4.0 grade), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment. Deaths reportable as SAEs and non -fatal serious adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_432383], and type of adverse event.  PFS and OS: PFS an d OS will each be summarized using the product- limit method of Kaplan -
Meier. Median times for each endpoint will be presented with two-sided 90% confidence intervals estimated using log( -log(survival)) methodology. Kaplan- Meier estimates of PFS at 6 
or 12 months after treatment initiation may also be presented with two -sided 90% confidence 
intervals.  
 
12.4.3 Analysis Plans for Exploratory Objectives  
It’s expected that 80% of the trial samples will have adequate specimens for the correlative study 
and the evaluable samples for the correlative analyses will be 32 (80% of [ADDRESS_547637] s). 
 A DFCI mutation screen analysis of 300 cancer genes (Oncopanel), including all those involved in regulation of mTOR, will be performed on pre- treatment biopsies in all subjects .  
 The mutation profiling will be performed using next generation sequencing via Oncopanel in all cases and whole exome sequemcing in a subset of s ubjects.  
 The sample size/power justification is focused on the primary objective of assessing the association between ORR and mTOR pathway mutation status (defined as mutation(s) observed in 1 gene or several genes belonging to mTOR pathways). To examine the response (or ORR) by [CONTACT_432384] (mutated or non-mutated), the evaluable samples will be divided retrospectively according to objective response or non-response. Pre- treatment mutation status 
will be summarized descriptively for the response/non-response groups.   The trial’s targeted ORR rate was 0.2. Based on our experience (submitted for publication) the mutation rate for a cohort of mRCC subject s treated with  mTOR inhibitors was 20% (16/79), we 
assumed a mTOR pathway gene mutations rate of 0.25
 for the power estimation, as it is 
suggested that “23- 38% of subject s likely have alteration in the mTOR pathway. 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 67 of 91 With an evaluable correlative sample size of 32, the study has 80% power to detect a 48% 
increase (one -sided alpha=0.05) in response probability of 56% in subject s with mutations as 
compared to that of 8% in subject s without mutations.  
The proportion of subject s with objective response according to pre- treatment (baseline) nutation 
status will also be summarized with two -sided 90% exact binomial CI. Kaplan- Meier estimates 
will be used to assess the distribution of PFS according to mutation status. Medians of time to 
PFS will be shown with two -sided 90% CIs.

Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547647] s and Their Caregivers 
and Non- Study Healthcare Team  
 
TAK-228 interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter 
remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.   Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet .   
 These are the things that you and they need to know:  
• TAK-228 interacts with certain specific enzymes  in your liver.  
• The enzymes  in question are CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and TAK-228 is broken 
down by [CONTACT_432392].  
• TAK-[ADDRESS_547648] be used very carefully with other medicines that need thes e liver enzymes 
to be effective or to be cleared from your system.   
• Other medicines may also affect the activity of the enzyme.   
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity (“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the chance of harmful side effects.  
o  TAK-228 is considered a weak  “inhibitor” of the enzyme, meaning that it can 
affect the levels of other drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_174820].  This can lead to harmful side effects and/or reduce the effectiveness of those medications.    
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP2C9, CYP2C 19 and CYP3A4. 
• Your prescribers should look at this web site 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx
 or consult a medical reference to see 
if any medicine they want to prescrib e is on a list of drugs to avoid.   
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye.  They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an adverse interaction.   
• Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age.  Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold.

o If you drink gra pefruit juice or eat grapefruit:  Avoid these until the study is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while 
you are taking TAK -228.  
 Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.  
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over-the- counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.    
                                   
INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent TAK -
228.  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_6812].   TAK -228 interacts 
with drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very 
important to:  
 Tell your doctors if you stop taking regular medicine or if you start 
taking a new medicine.  
 Tell all of  your prescribers (doctor, physicians’ assistant, nurse 
practitioner, and pharmacist) that you are taking part in a clinical 
trial.  
 Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use 
an over- the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
  
 TAK-[ADDRESS_547649] with this enzyme.  
 Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 .” 
 Before prescribing new medicines, your regular prescribers should go to h ttp://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for conducting a DF/HCC Multi- Center research 
protocol. The DF/HCC DSMP should serve as a reference for any sites external to DF/HCC that 
will be participating in the research protocol.  
 
1.1 Purpose  
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center 
protocol will comply with Federal Regulations, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HI PAA) requirements and applicable DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedures  
 1.2 Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  Definitions  
DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol :  A research protocol in which one or more outside institutions 
are collaborating with Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where a DF/HCC investigator is the 
sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana- Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) Network Clinical Trial 
Affiliate s.  
 Lead Institution:  One of the  Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members (Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724] (CHB), Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH)) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of a protocol as well as it s subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and applicable regulatory guidelines 
(Food and Drug Administration (FDA)).  The Lead Institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_143000]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead Institution also typi[INVESTIGATOR_143001]/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.    DF/HCC Sponsor:  The  person sponsoring the submitted Multi-Center protocol.  Within 
DF/HCC, this person is the Overall Principal Investigator (sponsor-investigator) who takes responsibility for initiation, management and conduct of the protocol at all research locations. In applicable protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with any regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA). The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol and is responsible for the conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all Participating Institutions. In most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor is the same person  as the DF/HCC Principal Investigator; however, 
both roles can be filled by [CONTACT_57945].  
 Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC consortium that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC Investigator. The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor as having the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.     Coordinating Center:  The entity (i.e. Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract Research 
Organization (CRO), etc) that provides administrative support to the DF/HCC Sponsor in order that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the protocol document and DSMP, and as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines (i.e. CTEP Multi-Center Guidelines). In general, the Lead Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.

 3.0 DF/HCC REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI -CENTER PROTOCOLS  
The following section will clarify DF/HCC Requirements and further detail the expectations for participating in a DF/HCC Multi-Center protocol.   3.1 Protocol Distribution  
The Coordinating Center, DFCI , will distribute the final DFCI IRB approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to all Participating Institutions.     3.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures  
The Participating Institutions will receive notification of protocol revisions and closures from the Coordinating Center.  It is the individual Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify its IRB of these revisions. 
 
• Non life -threatening revisions:  Participating Institutions will receive written notification 
of protocol revisions regarding non life-threatening events from the Coordinating Center. Non-life-threatening protocol revisions must be IRB approved and implemented within 
90 days from receipt of the notification. 
• Revisions for life -threatening causes:  Participating Institutions will receive immediate 
notification from the Coordinating Center concerning protocol revisions required to protect lives with follow -up by [CONTACT_6791], mail, e- mail, etc.  Life -threatening protocol revisions 
will be implemented immediately followed by [CONTACT_432395].  
• Protocol closures and temporary holds:  Participating Institutions will receive 
notification of protocol closures and temporary holds from the Coordinating Center. Closures and holds will be effective immediately.  In addition, the Coordinating Center, will update the Participating Institutions on an ongoing basis about protocol accrual data so that they will be aware of imminent protocol closures.  
 3.3 Informed Consent Requirements  
The DF/HCC  approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the informed 
consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form must follow the consent template as closely as possible and should adhere to specifications outlined in the DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for PI- Initiated Multi- Center 
Protocols.  This document will be provided separately to each Participating Institution. 
 
Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and HIPAA authorization, if a separate document, to the Coordinating Center for review and approval prior 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, [ADDRESS_547652] also be submitted to the 
Coordinating Center after approval by [CONTACT_1036]. 
 
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each Participating Institution will identify the physician members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for therapeutic protocols. Participating institutions must follow the DF/HCC requirement that only attending physicians obtain informed consent and re-consent to interventional trials (i.e. drug and/or device trials).    3.[ADDRESS_547653] be on file with the Coordinating Center: 
 
• Initial approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB.  
• Copy of the Informed Consent Form(s) approved by [CONTACT_57949]’s IRB.  
• Participating Institution’s IRB approval for all amendments.  
• Annual approval letters by [CONTACT_102861] g Institution's IRB. 
 
It is the Participating Institution's responsibility to notify its IRB of protocol amendments.  Participating Institutions will have [ADDRESS_547654] ( HIPAA). Any information, related to 
the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected Health Information (PHI). 
HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be used or disclosed.  
 In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course of a study, the study participant must sign an Authorization.  This Authorization may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  The Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB.  
 The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must be collected per NCI requirements. These are the primary reasons why DF/HCC has chosen to use Authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_89438], rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 86 of 91  
3.6.1 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confidentiality  
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating Center should be de-identified. It is recommended that the assigned protocol case number (as described below) be 
used for all participant specific documents. Participant initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification.   
 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Registration Policy 
 
• Informed  consent must be obtained from  subje cts before  they can be sc reened. A
 patie nt 
will be considered “in screening” when he/she has signed the IRB approved  Inform ed 
Consent Form. 
• Each patient screened must  be docume nted on the Potential Patient/Pre ‐Screening Log or 
equivalent site form/software.  The Potential Patient Log/Pre ‐Screening Log is to aid in 
fulfilling  the ICH requirement of maintain ing a confidential li st of patient names.  It 
should be stored in the site study files.  
• Eligibi lity Criteria  Worksheet  is provided as a tool for registration.  
• Once the investigator verifies  the patient is eligible,  the lead site (DFCI) will f ormally  
register  the patient  in the DF/HCC Clinical Trail Management System (CTMS)    and 
enter  the On Study Date.  The sequence number used at screening  will remain  the same  
for the remaind er of the study to identify  the enrolled  patient.  
• Subject s must  be registered  prior to starting  protocol therap y and begin therapy within  
five business days of the lead site (DFCI) entering the On Study Date into the DF/HCC 
Clinical Trail Management System (CTMS).    
 3.7.[ADDRESS_547655] b e registered by [CONTACT_302303] (DFCI) through the DF/HCC Clinical Trail 
Management System (CTMS)    in accordance with section [ADDRESS_547656] is 
considered registered when an “On Study” date is entered into OnCore. 
• To register a participant, the  following documents should be completed by [CONTACT_432396]’ records:  
o Signed informed consent document 
o HIPAA authorization form (if separate from the informed consent document)  
o Other appropriate forms  (See Section 4 of the Protocol)   
The Coordinating Center will review the submitted documents in order to verify eligibility and consent. To complete the registration process, the Coordinating Center 
will:  
• Register the participant on the study with the DF/HCC Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS).  
• Upon receiving confirmation of registration, the Coordinating Center will inform the Participating Institution and provide the study specific participant case number, and, if applicable, assigne d treatment and/or dose level  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 87 of 91 Treatment may not begin without confirmation from the Coordinating Center that the 
participant has been registered.  
 Registration  can only occur during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM 
to 5:[ADDRESS_547657] be registered with the DF/HCC CTMS before  the initiation of treatment or  
other protocol- specific interventions . Treatment  and other protocol-specific interventions may 
not be initiated until the Participating Institution receives confirmation of the participant’s 
registration from the Coordinating Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI IRB must be notified  
of any violations to this policy  
 3.7.3 Eligibility Exceptions  
 No exceptions to the eligibility requirements for a protocol without DFCI IRB approval will be permitted. All Participating Institutions are required to fully comply with this r equirement.  
 3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
At the time of registration, Coordinating Center requires the following identifiers for all subjects: initials, date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique sequence number.  Participating Institutions should  submit all de -identified subsequent communication and 
documents to the Coordinating Center, using this sequence number to identify the subject.    3.8.1  Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review and approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures s et forth in the IRB approved protocol to be 
reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB. 
 
For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to describe de partures  from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional policy for reporting to their local IRB.  3.8.2 Definitions  
Protocol Deviation : Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB -approved 
protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.  
 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.  enrollment 
of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
   
Protocol Violation : Any protocol de parture  that was not prospectively approved  by [CONTACT_89443].   
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-527 
Protocol Version Date:  December 20, 2019  
 
 Page 88 of 91  
3.8.3  Reporting Procedures  
DF/HCC Sponsor: is r esponsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol deviations occurring at their 
site. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI IRB. 
The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Center who will then sub mit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the deviation is 
submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per institutional policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_547658] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner. The Coordinating Center will provide training for the requirements for the reporting of violations. 
 
Coordinating Center: Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for review. Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. DF/HCC will forward all violation reports to CTEP via an internal DF /HCC process, as applicable.  
 3.9 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, rights and well -being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that occur during 
the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants.  
 
All participants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated treatment will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria specified in the protocol. Life -threatening toxicities must be reported to the DF/HCC 
Sponsor within 1 business days of becoming aware of the event.  
 
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring is outlined in the protocol.

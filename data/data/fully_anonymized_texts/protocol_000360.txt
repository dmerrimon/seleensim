72. BACKGROUND
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA) is the second most common primary liver 
cancer, with a rising incidence but without parallel advances in treatment or patient 
outcome.  Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for IHCCA and is 
associated with 5-year survival rates between 15% and 40%.  Up to two-thirds of patients 
are not resectable at presentation and of those who undergo curative-intent resection, 
two-thirds suffer postoperative disease recurrence, most commonly in the remnant liver, 
followed by [CONTACT_510823].  Risk factors for disease 
recurrence include vascular invasion, multiple tumors, lymph node metastases, increased 
tumor size, and periductal infiltrating tumor morphology.1,2  
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
The potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy in IHCCA are early treatment of 
micrometastases, downsizing of tumors to increase margin-negative resection rates, 
eradication of disease from regional lymph nodes, and improved selection of patients for 
complex liver resection.  To date, a prospective study on neoadjuvant therapy for 
resectable IHCCA has not been conducted.  
A retrospective study by [CONTACT_510824]. They enrolled 170 IHCCA including 74 
locally advanced and 96 resectable tumors. Out of 74 patients, 51 were treated with 
gemcitabine based regimens and 19 received 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. In 
their study, 39 (53%) out of 74 locally advanced IHCCA patients became resectable after 
receiving 6 months of systemic chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant 
difference in the median overall survival (OS) of locally advanced IHCCA patients’ who 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy as compared to patients who had surgery alone for 
resectable disease. These data suggested that the survival of patients with locally 
advanced disease treated with neoadjuvant therapy may be similar to those who received 
primary resection.3  
Stromal interactions in biliary cancers and the role of Nab-Paclitaxel
Tumor progression and growth has been previously linked to dynamic interactions 
between tumor cells and the surrounding stromal tissue. Cancers with a “reactive” stroma 
are associated with a high density of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive 
fibroblasts, hypovascularity, and activated stellate cells.4-7 The presence of α-SMA-
positive fibroblasts within the cholangiocarcinoma stroma has been associated with a 
poor prognosis.6-8
IHCCA is characterized by [CONTACT_510825].  In 
preclinical studies of pancreatic cancer, which incites a similarly dense desmoplastic 
reaction, nab-paclitaxel, an FDA-approved chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic 
pancreatic cancer, induced stromal collapse and increased intratumoral delivery of 
gemcitabine.9 In a study of potentially resectable pancreatic cancer patients treated with 
Nab-Paclitaxel and gemcitabine, surgical specimens of patients with a marked pathologic

a lower density of α-SMA-positive fibroblasts suggesting a role for this combination in 
other stromal-rich malignancies like biliary tracts cancers (BTC).[ADDRESS_660680] of care regimen for unresectable IHCCA is gemcitabine and 
cisplatin, which is associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8 months 
and overall survival (OS) of 11.7 months.11 
Safety of combining gemcitabine, cisplatin, and Nab-Paclitaxel
The safety of combining gemcitabine and cisplatin and gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel 
has been previously described in BTC and pancreatic cancers, respectively.11,12 A recent 
phase II study of 51 patients was completed at MD Anderson Cancer Center with 
unresectable BTC treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel (GAP). Patients 
treated initially with cisplatin 25mg/m2, nab-paclitaxel 125mg/m2 and gemcitabine 
1000mg/m2 experienced grade 3/4 hematological toxicity including neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia leading to treatment discontinuation in 6 out 
of 30 patients.  Nab-paclitaxel was reduced to 100mg/m2 and gemcitabine to 800mg/m2. 
After dose reduction, treatment was better tolerated and only 3 patients experienced grade 
4 hematological toxicity. Moreover, grade 3 non-hematological toxicities developed in 19 
patients including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, thromboembolic event, cardiovascular 
arrhythmia, hypokalemia, constipation, cystitis, and elevations of liver transaminases. 
The median PFS = 11.4 mos (95% CI: 6.1, 16.1) with median OS = 19.2 (95%CI: 13.6, 
NA) and 1-year survival rate 67.6%. The disease control rate was demonstrated in 84.3% 
of patients and [ADDRESS_660681]
NAB-PACLITAXEL for Injectable Suspension (also known as ABI-007, nab-paclitaxel, 
paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) is an albumin-bound form of 
paclitaxel with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers. Paclitaxel exists in 
the particles in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. NAB-PACLITAXEL is supplied as a 
white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion. Each single-use vial 
contains 100 mg of paclitaxel and approximately 900 mg of human albumin. Each 
milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel. NAB-
PACLITAXEL is free of solvents.   The active agent in NAB-PACLITAXEL is 
paclitaxel.

93.1.2 Indication
In the [LOCATION_002], NAB-PACLITAXEL for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-
bound particles for injectable suspension) is indicated for the treatment of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as first-line treatment, in combination with gemcitabine.
3.1.3 Introduction
NAB-PACLITAXEL is a biologically interactive albumin-bound paclitaxel combining a 
protein with a chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form. This composition provides a 
novel approach of increasing intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-
mediated transport process allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell. This 
albumin-specific receptor mediated process involves the binding of albumin to a specific 
receptor (gp60) on the intraluminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in activation of a 
protein (caveolin-1), which initiates an internalization process in the endothelial cell 
through the formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin-bound 
chemotherapeutic complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium.14  
Other postulated mechanisms of action for the combination of gemcitabine with nab-
paclitaxel include downregulation of cytidine deaminase by [CONTACT_510827]/sustained concentrations of gemcitabine, macropi[INVESTIGATOR_510772]-transformed cells which would allow for enhanced uptake of paclitaxel 
loaded albumin nanoparticles into pancreatic cancer tumor cells.15,16
3.1.4 Preclinical Studies with NAB-PACLITAXEL 
Preclinical studies comparing NAB-PACLITAXEL to Taxol® (paclitaxel Cremophor® 
EL solvent-based, BMS) demonstrated lower toxicities, with an MTD approximately 
50% higher for NAB-PACLITAXEL compared to Taxol.  At equal doses there was less 
myelosuppression and improved efficacy in a xenograft tumor model of human 
mammary adenocarcinoma.  At equitoxic doses of paclitaxel, NAB-PACLITAXEL 
treated groups showed more complete regressions, longer time to recurrence, longer 
doubling time, and prolonged survival. At equal dose, tumor paclitaxel area under the 
curve was 33% higher for NAB-PACLITAXEL versus solvent based paclitaxel, 
indicating more effective intratumoral accumulation of NAB-PACLITAXEL.[ADDRESS_660682]-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Key 
eligibility criteria were Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70, normal bilirubin level, 
transaminase levels ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ [ADDRESS_660683] 
for patients with liver metastasis, no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting 
or for metastatic disease, no ongoing active infection requiring systemic therapy, and no 
history of interstitial lung disease. Patients with rapid decline in KPS (≥10%) or serum 
albumin (≥20%) during the 14 day screening period prior to study randomization were 
ineligible.

10A total of 861 patients were randomized (1:1) to the NAB-PACLITAXEL/gemcitabine 
arm (N=431) or to the gemcitabine arm (N=430). Randomization was stratified by 
[CONTACT_1617] (Australia, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, or North America), KPS 
(70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and presence of liver metastasis (yes versus no). Patients 
randomized to NAB-PACLITAXEL/gemcitabine received NAB-PACLITAXEL 125 
mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes followed by [CONTACT_35421] 1000 
mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-
day cycle. Patients randomized to gemcitabine received 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous 
infusion over 30-[ADDRESS_660684] period in 
Cycle 1 then as 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle. 
Patients in both arms received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional 
outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), 
both assessed by [CONTACT_6222], central, blinded radiological review using RECIST 
(version 1.0).
In the intent to treat (all randomized) population, the median age was 63 years (range 27-
88 years) with 42% ≥ 65 years of age; 58% were men; 93% were White and KPS was 90-
100 in 60%. Disease characteristics included 46% of patients with 3 or more metastatic 
sites; 84% of patients had liver metastasis; and the location of the primary pancreatic 
lesion was in the head of pancreas (43%), body (31%), or tail (25%).
The median overall survival of the NAB-PACLITAXEL/gemcitabine group was 8.5 
months compared to 6.7 months in the gemcitabine alone group (HR 0.72, p<0.0001). 
PFS was similarly improved in the combination arm (5.5 vs. 3.7 months, HR 0.69, 
p<0.0001). Overall response rate by [CONTACT_510828] 23% with NAB-
PACLITAXEL/gemcitabine and 7% with gemcitabine alone (p<0.0001).

mild proteinuria and hematuria; Hemolytic Uremia Syndrome (HUS) reported rarely 
(0.25%), dyspnea (0.2%) and serious pulmonary toxicity (0.06%). Also reported include 
constipation and pruritus.
Myelosuppression with Gemcitabine
Myelosuppression manifested by [CONTACT_127867], thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with 
gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined 
with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-
agent gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in 
patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with another drug.
Pulmonary Toxicity and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_510776], including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary 
edema, and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, 
these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_510777]. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to [ADDRESS_660692] any evidence of pulmonary toxicity.
 
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome with Gemcitabine
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for 
dialysis, can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS was reported 
in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS Assess 
renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Consider 
the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic 
hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or 
evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) Permanently discontinue 
gemcitabine in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be 
reversible even with discontinuation of therapy.

16Hepatic Toxicity with Gemcitabine
Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients 
receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. 
Transient elevation in serum transaminases occurs in approximately 70% of patients. 
Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing 
medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the 
underlying hepatic insufficiency. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine 
and periodically during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine in patients that develop severe 
liver injury.
Embryo and Fetal Toxicity with Gemcitabine 
Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its 
mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice 
and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while 
taking gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_510778] (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients 
receiving Gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic 
agents. Immediate discontinuation of Gemcitabine should be done if CLS develops during 
therapy.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome with Gemcitabine
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients 
receiving Gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic

failure and chronic renal insufficiency), peripheral neuropathy (dose and duration 
dependent), nausea and vomiting (76% to 100%), myelosuppression (25% to 30%; nadir: 
day 18-23; recovery: by [CONTACT_4475] 39; mild with moderate doses, mild-to-moderate with high-
dose therapy), liver enzymes increased (especially SGOT and bilirubin), ototoxicity (10% 
to 30%; manifested as high frequency hearing loss; ototoxicity is especially pronounced in 
children), tissue irritation (extravasation).
Other toxicities (<1%) include alopecia (mild), anaphylactic reaction, arrhythmias, 
arterial vasospasm (acute), blurred vision, bradycardia, diarrhea, heart block, heart 
failure, hemolytic anemia (acute), hemolytic uremic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, 
hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, limb 
ischemia (acute), mesenteric ischemia (acute), myocardial infarction, myocardial

pancreatitis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], phlebitis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome 
(RPLS), SIADH, stroke, thrombophlebitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Nephrotoxicity with Cisplatin
Dose-related and cumulative renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, is the major 
dose limiting toxicity of cisplatin. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% of patients 
treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m. It is first noted during the second week after a dose 
and is manifested by [CONTACT_218665], serum uric acid and/or a decrease 
in creatinine clearance. Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and severe with repeated 
courses of the drug. Renal function must return to normal before another dose of cisplatin 
can be given. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity. Impairment of 
renal function has been associated with renal tubular damage. The administration of 
cisplatin using a 6- to 8-hour infusion with intravenous hydration, and mannitol has been 
used to reduce nephrotoxicity. However, renal toxicity still can occur after utilization of 
these procedures.
Ototoxicity with Cisplatin
Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose of 
cisplatin 50 mg/m, and is manifested by [CONTACT_30547]/or hearing loss in the high frequency 
range (4000 to 8000 Hz). Decreased ability to hear normal conversational tones may occur. 
Deafness after the initial dose of cisplatin has been reported. Hearing loss can be unilateral 
or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated cisplatin doses. It 
is unclear whether cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is reversible. Vestibular toxicity has also 
been reported. Ototoxic effects may be related to the peak plasma concentration of 
cisplatin. Ototoxicity can occur during treatment or be delayed. Audiometric monitoring 
should be performed prior to initiation of therapy, prior to each subsequent dose, and for 
several years post therapy. The risk of ototoxicity may be increased by [CONTACT_510829] 27, 2023
Page 18
18simultaneous cranial irradiation, and may be more severe in patients being treated with 
other ototoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides and vancomycin), and in patients with renal 
impairment. 
Hematological toxicity with Cisplatin
Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with cisplatin. The nadirs in 
circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) with 
most patients recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia 
are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m). Anemia (decrease of 2 g 
hemoglobin/100 mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same 
timing as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fever and infection have also been reported 
in patients with neutropenia. Potential fatalities due to infection (secondary to 
myelosuppression) have been reported. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to 
myelosuppression. In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs’ 
positive hemolytic anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic 
anemia, a further course of treatment may be accompanied by [CONTACT_510830]. The development of acute leukemia 
coincident with the use of cisplatin has been reported. In these reports, cisplatin was 
generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.
Gastrointestinal toxicity with Cisplatin
Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with cisplatin, and may be 
so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and vomiting may begin within [ADDRESS_660696] up to 24 hours. Various degrees of vomiting, nausea and/or 
anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment. Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins 
or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) has occurred in patients attaining 
complete emetic control on the day of cisplatin therapy. Diarrhea has also been reported.
Serum Electrolytes disturbance with Cisplatin
Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia 
have been reported to occur in patients treated with cisplatin and are probably related to 
renal tubular damage. Tetany has been reported in those patients with hypocalcemia and 
hypomagnesemia. Generally, normal serum electrolyte levels are restored by [CONTACT_510831]. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 
syndrome has also been reported.
Hyperuricemia with Cisplatin
Hyperuricemia has been reported to occur at approximately the same frequency as the 
increases in BUN and serum creatinine. It is more pronounced after doses greater than 50 
mg/m, and peak levels of uric acid generally occur between 3 to 5 days after the dose. 
Allopurinol therapy for hyperuricemia effectively reduces uric acid levels.

19Neurotoxicity with Cisplatin
Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by [CONTACT_160603], has been reported. The 
neuropathies usually occur after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, neurologic 
symptoms have been reported to occur after a single dose. Although symptoms and signs 
of cisplatin neuropathy usually develop during treatment, symptoms of neuropathy may 
begin [ADDRESS_660697] observed. The neuropathy, however, may progress further 
even after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. Preliminary evidence suggests peripheral neuropathy may 
be irreversible in some patients. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral 
neuropathy. Lhermitte’s sign, dorsal column myelopathy, and autonomic neuropathy have 
also been reported. Loss of taste, seizures, leukoencephalopathy, and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have also been reported. Muscle cramps, defined 
as localized, painful, involuntary skeletal muscle contractions of sudden onset and short 
duration, have been reported and were usually associated in patients receiving a relatively 
high cumulative dose of cisplatin and with a relatively advanced symptomatic stage of 
peripheral neuropathy. 
Ocular Toxicity with Cisplatin
Optic neuritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], and cerebral blindness have been reported in patients receiving 
standard recommended doses of cisplatin. Improvement and/or total recovery usually 
occurs after discontinuing cisplatin. Steroids with or without mannitol have been used; 
however, efficacy has not been established. Blurred vision and altered color perception 
have been reported after the use of regimens with higher doses of cisplatin or greater dose 
frequencies than recommended in the package insert. The altered color perception 
manifests as a loss of color discrimination, particularly in the blue-yellow axis. The only 
finding on funduscopic exam is irregular retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_218580]. 
Anaphylactic-Like Reactions with Cisplatin
Anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported in patients previously exposed to cisplatin. 
The reactions consist of facial edema, wheezing, tachycardia, and hypotension within a 
few minutes of drug administration. Reactions may be controlled by [CONTACT_510832][INVESTIGATOR_218581]/or antihistamines as indicated. Patients receiving 
cisplatin should be observed carefully for possible anaphylactic-like reactions and 
supportive equipment and medication should be available to treat such a complication. 
Hepatotoxicity with Cisplatin
Transient elevations of liver enzymes, especially AST, as well as bilirubin, have been 
reported to be associated with cisplatin administration at the recommended doses.

6. TREATMENT PLAN
This is a multi-institution, open label phase II study designed to investigate the feasibility 
of gemcitabine/cisplatin/nab-paclitaxel as a neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy for 
patients with reseactable oncologically high-risk IHCCA. This study will enroll up to [ADDRESS_660703] 30 evaluable patients.
This will be an open-label, single arm study with each cycle equal to 21 days. All three 
drugs will be administered intravenously on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle. Dosing will 
be calculated using body surface area (BSA) based on the actual weight of the patient at 
each visit. Nab-Paclitaxel will be given at 100 mg/m2, followed by [CONTACT_510833] 25 mg/m2 
and then gemcitabine at 800 mg/m2 for [ADDRESS_660704]. 
Patients will receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Restaging will be 
done after 4 cycles (+/- 1 week) by [CONTACT_38226]. If radiological scans 
demonstrate stable disease or partial or complete tumor response and the tumor remains 
resectable, surgery will be performed. For patients with radiological scans that document 
disease progression during the study, treatment will be discontinued off the protocol and 
will not be evaluable for other secondary endpoints. Resection will be performed per 
standard of care and will include a portal lymphadenectomy for all cases. Objective 
evidence of recurrent disease after resection will be recorded at the time of recurrence. 
Patients will be followed for overall survival endpoint as well.

Dosing and Administration
The study drugs will be stored according to package inserts. Local institutional guidelines 
and administration protocols for anti-emetics, pre-hydration, and supportive care will be 
utilized for administration of the chemotherapy medications. Suggested guidelines 
include the following specified pre-medications and hydration:
Pre-cisplatin hydration: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection 1000 mL with Mannitol 18.5 
grams and Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams IV infusion over 2 hours on days 1 and 8 
repeated every 21 days. 
Aloxi (palonosetron) 0.25 mg IV, Emend (fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) 150 mg IV and 
dexamethasone 12 mg IV within 30 minutes prior to treatment on days 1 and 8, repeated 
every 21 days. Patients will continue oral antiemetic prophylaxis at home with 
dexamethasone 4 mg bid for 2 days after chemotherapy. 
Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 in NS dilute to a total concentration of 5 mg/mL (DO NOT 
FILTER) over 30 minute IV infusion on days 1 and 8 repeated every 21 days, followed 
by: 
Cisplatin 25mg/m2 in 500 mL of NS over 60 minute IV infusion on days 1 and 8 
repeated every 21 days, followed by: 
Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 in 500ml over 30 minute IV infusion on days 1 and 8 repeated 
every 21 days 
Post-cisplatin hydration: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection [ADDRESS_660705] medical practice.
A cycle of therapy may be delayed up to 3 weeks to allow for weather events, patient’s 
personal emergencies, observation of holidays, or other unforeseen delays that the 
Investigator deems to be in the best interest of the patient. For any dose interruptions, re-
initiation of therapy may be delayed for a maximum of 21 days to allow recovery from 
any toxicity. In exceptional cases where subjects are responding, re-initiation of therapy 
after missing > 21 consecutive days of treatment may be done on a case-by-case basis 
after confirmation with the Primary Investigator. Day 8 of cycle can be delayed up to 2 
weeks or a treating physician’s discretion.
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 (which is available at: 
http://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). For any

24event which is apparent at baseline, the dose modification will apply according to the 
corresponding shift in toxicity grade if the investigator feels this is appropriate, (e.g. if a 
patient has grade 1 asthenia at baseline which increases to grade 2 during treatment, this 
will be considered as a shift of 1 grade and treated as a grade 1 toxicity for dose 
modification purposes).  
Dose modifications of gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel will be done based on the specific 
toxicity. Once a dose of any study drug has been reduced, it should not be increased at a 
later time.  Reasons for dose modifications or delays, the supportive measures taken, and 
the outcome will be documented in progress notes. Growth factors may be used to treat 
hematologic toxicity and will not constitute a dose reduction. A maximum of a 3-week 
treatment delay is permitted to allow recovery of toxicities.

cultures are positive, the antibiotic may or may not be changed, depending on the sensitivity 
profile of the isolated organism. Patients with persisting fever after 3 weeks, despi[INVESTIGATOR_14135], will discontinue study treatment. Patients can also receive 
G-CSF, in addition to antibiotic treatment, to hasten the resolution of their febrile neutropenia

Dose modification or delay may occur in the setting of lower Grade toxicity if the 
treating physician believes that it is in the interest of a subject’s safety.  Alopecia and 
nausea and/or vomiting that can be controlled by [CONTACT_510834].  No dose reduction or interruption will be required for 
anemia as it can be satisfactorily managed by [CONTACT_27752]. Dose reductions for non-
hematologic toxicity should be as below. Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine and specific 
exceptions are listed separately below Tables 6 and 7.

6.[ADDRESS_660709] dosage amount and schedule for G-CSF support will be left to the treating 
physician’s discretion.  A recommended approach would be to administer G-CSF 5 
mcg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest vial size per investigator’s standard of care) 24 hours 
after chemotherapy until recovery to the predetermined neutrophil count.
6.2 Sensory Neuropathy
Cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel treatment should be withheld in patients who experience ≥ 
Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Gemcitabine administration can continue during this 
period. Cisplatin may be resumed at the same dose and nab-paclitaxel treatment may be 
resumed at the next lower dose level in subsequent cycles after the peripheral neuropathy 
improves to ≤ Grade 2. Patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy that requires a delay 
in scheduled cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel dosing for ≥ 21 days will discontinue study 
treatment. The time to resolution to Grade ≤ 2 should be the adverse event duration used 
for adverse event reporting. In those patients who experience Grade 4 sensory neuropathy, 
both drugs should be withheld, and treatment resumed at a reduction of 2 dose levels (Dose 
Level -2) in subsequent cycles after the sensory neuropathy improves to  Grade 2.  Note: 
the investigator may elect to dose modify for Grade 2 sensory neuropathy.
6.3 Nephrotoxicity
Cisplatin (cisplatin injection) produces cumulative nephrotoxicity. The serum creatinine, 
BUN, creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels should 
be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each subsequent course. Cisplatin

clearance of  ≥ 45 mL/min.
6.[ADDRESS_660710] treatment discontinued.
6.5 Gastrointestinal Toxicity
If Grade 3 mucositis or diarrhea occurs, all 3 study drugs should be withheld until 
resolution to ≤ Grade 1, then reinstituted at the next lower dose level as per Table 3. Patients 
who develop Grade [ADDRESS_660711] treatment discontinued.
6.6 Pulmonary Embolism 
Asymptomatic or clinically mild pulmonary embolism can be treated with low-molecular 
weight heparin without interruption of therapy. Moderate to severe pulmonary embolism 
will require permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
6.7 Interstitial Pneumonitis
Pulmonary toxicity has been reported for both gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_510779]. A 
retrospective review of pooled clinical trial data of 4,448 patients with mixed cancer 
indications reported an incidence of dyspnea of 0.2% and serious pulmonary toxicity of 
0.06%. 
During study participation, patients should be carefully monitored for signs and 
symptoms of pneumonitis (i.e. epi[INVESTIGATOR_510780]) and, if observed, immediate clinical evaluation 
and timely institution of appropriate management (emphasizing the need for 
corticosteroids if an infectious process has been ruled out as well as appropriate 
ventilation and oxygen support when required). Administration of study drugs will be 
permanently discontinued upon making a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis.
Prevention, Surveillance and Management of Interstitial Pneumonitis
During study treatment, epi[INVESTIGATOR_510781]. Radiographic evaluation with 
chest X-rays and CT scans (normal or high resolution) may be indicated to look for 
infiltrates, ground-glass opacities or honeycombing patterns. Pulse oximetry and 
pulmonary function tests can show respi[INVESTIGATOR_510782].
Infections should be ruled out with routine immunological/ microbiological 
methods. Transbronchial lung biopsy is not recommended, given its limited value 
and risk of pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be reserved for cases with 
unclear etiology. 
Study drug administration should be interrupted upon diagnosis of interstitial 
pneumonitis and patients permanently discontinued from further study drug 
Protocol 
Version Final
July 27, 2023
Page 28
28treatment. After ruling out an infectious etiology, intravenous high-dose 
corticosteroid therapy and secondary pathogen coverage should be instituted 
without delay. Patients with an added immunological component may also require 
immune modulation with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Appropriate 
ventilation and oxygen support should be used when required. 
6.8 Sepsis
Sepsis has been reported in less than 1% during Nab-Paclitaxel monotherapy and 
fatalities attributed to these events have been rare. However, the risk was appreciably 
higher in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving Nab-Paclitaxel 
in combination with gemcitabine with a rate of 5% in patients in patients with or without 
neutropenia receiving Nab-Paclitaxel/gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying 
pancreatic cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were 
identified as significant contributing factors. The increased risk of sepsis in the setting of 
advanced or metastatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine could be managed with 
prophylactic antibiotic treatment in febrile patients (regardless of neutrophil count) and 
dose reduction, and with G-CSF treatment in neutropenic patients. If a patient becomes 
febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. 
For febrile neutropenia, withhold Nab-Paclitaxel and gemcitabine until fever resolves and 
ANC ≥ 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels.
Prophylaxis Against Sepsis
Due to the incidences of non-neutropenic sepsis, at the first occurrence of fever ≥ 38.5°C 
(regardless of neutrophil count), institution of ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally, twice daily) 
or amoxicillin/clavulanate (500 mg orally, 2-3 times daily) in patients with allergy to 
fluoroquinolones should be initiated. On their first visit, patients should be provided with 
enough ciprofloxacin (or the alternative antibiotic) for use at home, and they should be 
instructed to begin taking it when they first record a temperature of ≥ 38.5 °C (or if they 
feel they are developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fever and a thermometer is not available). They should also 
immediately contact [CONTACT_510835]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510783]. If 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029], this should be reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).
6.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions rarely occur.  If they do occur, minor symptoms such as 
flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia may require 
temporary interruption of the infusion.  However, severe reactions, such as hypotension 
requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized 
urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and aggressive 
symptomatic therapy.  Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to Nab-
Paclitaxel should not be re-challenged.  It is not recommended to administer Nab-Paclitaxel 
to patients with prior hypersensitivity to a taxane. If mild to moderate cisplatin 
hypersensitivity develops (per NCI CTCAE), the patient may be desensitized using the 
Protocol 
Version Final
July 27, [ADDRESS_660712] desensitization protocol of the institution. In the setting of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction, cisplatin should be discontinued.
Nab-Paclitaxel Premedication
Patients do not require premedication prior to Nab-Paclitaxel administration, as 
hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Although the solubilizing agents Cremophor® EL and 
Tween® [ADDRESS_660713] long been implicated in adverse events including hypersensitivity 
reactions due to their detergent-like nature and known ability to induce histamine release 
(Ten Tije et al, 2003), the administration of solvent-based taxanes (Taxol and 
Taxotere) requires premedication with corticosteroids and histamine receptor blocking 
agents to prevent the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. However, the 
hypersensitizing role of the taxane molecules themselves cannot be ruled out.  
In the unlikely event of a mild hypersensitivity reaction, premedication may be 
administered using the premedication regimen the institution typi[INVESTIGATOR_510784].  In the rare event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue Nab-
Paclitaxel.
Concomitant Medications
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti-emetic medications, may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator.  Erythropoietin and G-CSF may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines.

32fRadiological imaging will be performed during the screening window, approximately within 6 weeks before starting chemotherapy to identify patients’ 
eligibility for study enrollment, then within 2 weeks  (+/- 1 week) after administration and completion of  4 cycles of chemotherapy (12 weeks) to assess 
response to therapy according to RECIST criteria 1.1. If radiological scans demonstrates a stable, partial or complete tumor response and tumor still 
resectable, surgery will be performed. Surveillance imaging after surgery will be performed every [ADDRESS_660716] day of study treatment. All other baseline 
evaluations, except for height (which can be obtained at any time prior to enrollment), must be 
completed within [ADDRESS_660717] dose of study drug (except for imaging studies which are performed within 6 weeks prior).
3. For all other chemotherapy cycles except for Cycle 1, baseline physical and laboratory 
assessment must be done within 48 hours prior to start of day 1 and day 8.
4. Imaging should be obtained within 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) after completion of 4 cycles of 
chemotherapy.  If radiological scans demonstrates stable disease or partial or complete tumor 
response and the tumor remains resectable, surgery will be performed. Patients with 
radiologically documented disease progression at any point during the study treatment with study 
drugs under this protocol will be discontinue. Objective evidence of recurrent disease after 
resection will be recorded at the time of recurrence. Earlier radiological evaluations are allowed 
if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], this evaluation is in the patient’s best interest.   
5. Surgical resection will be performed per standard of care and will include a portal 
lymphadenectomy for all cases.
6. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast will be used. MRI may be used in cases where 
it is felt to be unsafe to perform CT secondary to patient's history of dye allergy, or if the tumor is 
not adequately seen on CT for the purposes of this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) 
scan may be done to exclude the presence of any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_510786].
7. Treatment-related adverse events occurring during study treatment or within 30 days (window of 
28-35 days allowed) after the last administration of study drug(s) will be followed until resolution

7.2 Long-term follow-up
All patients will be followed for survival and/or recurrence status. All study enrolled patients 
who will undergo tumor resection will be followed every 4 months (+/- 1 month) post-
surgery for up to [ADDRESS_660719] or by [CONTACT_65859].  If radiological scans 
demonstrated disease progression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy that prohibits surgery, 
treatment will be discontinued off the protocol but the patient will be still be followed for the 
secondary endpoint of overall survival. After a patient completes all intended therapy, 
including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, the patient will be followed for secondary 
endpoints of recurrence and overall survival.  If a patient recurs during postoperative 
surveillance, they will still be followed for overall survival. During long term follow-up, 
there is no specific requirement for labs or toxicity recording as the patient will not be 
receiving any therapy on protocol.
8. CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM THE STUDY 
      Subjects who meet the following criteria should be discontinued from the study: 
Disease progression
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
Unacceptable adverse event(s) as determined by [CONTACT_1963]
Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
9. RESPONSE EVALUATION
9.[ADDRESS_660720] criteria (version 1.1, 2009) proposed by [CONTACT_111700].[ADDRESS_660721] their disease re-
evaluated will be evaluable for response.  For the purposes of this study, patients should be 
reevaluated for response after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Note:  Lesions are either 
measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in 
reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or 
accuracy.
9.2 Definitions
All sites of disease should be followed as either target or non-target lesions, as categorized at 
baseline.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ or 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions, while all other lesions 
(either additional measurable lesions or non-measurable lesions) should be classified as non-
target lesions. In cases where a target lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. To ensure comparability, the 
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 35
35baseline radiology/scans and subsequent radiology/scans to assess response should be performed 
using identical techniques (eg, scans performed immediately following bolus contrast 
administration should be made with a standard volume of contrast, the identical contrast agent, 
and preferably the same scanner). The same method, radiological or physical, should be 
employed and assessed by [CONTACT_331053], when possible. 
9.[ADDRESS_660722] one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_660723] scan (with minimum slice 
thickness no greater than 5mm, or 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461], or 20mm by 
[CONTACT_13190] X-ray).  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).
Pathological lymph nodes may also be considered as target or non-target lesions.  To be 
considered pathologically enlarged and measurable (target lesion), a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_660724] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm). Lymph nodes with a short axis ≥ 10 mm but < [ADDRESS_660725] a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathologic 
and should not be recorded. The short axis measurement of any lymph node that is considered a 
target lesion should continue to be recorded regardless if the node progresses to below 10 mm. 
This may prevent the sum of lesions from being zero even if complete response criteria are met, 
since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  In rare circumstances, 
when a target lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned. 
9.4 Non-measurable disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]).  For bone and cystic lesions, please refer to the 
RECIST criteria (version 1.1, 2009).
9.5 Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per 
organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
[CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the diameters for all target lesions (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters (LD).  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_122988].
9.6 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum 
numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions. It is possible 
Version [ADDRESS_660726] 
form (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).   
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow-up. 
9.[ADDRESS_660727] of a treatment.
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x-ray.  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.  Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed to obtain images of [ADDRESS_660728] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
9.8 Response Criteria
9.8.1 Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions including 
normalization of elevated tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-
target) must have reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_660729] be non-
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). Complete response must be confirmed at a second tumor 
assessment not less than 4 weeks apart from the assessment at which CR was observed.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase (and an absolute increase of at least 5 
mm) in the sum of LD of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD 
recorded since the treatment started. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute PD. In 
exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions may be accepted as 
evidence of disease progression.
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 37
37Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
9.8.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level
Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_9154] (Maithel).
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have

sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in 
fact, the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR and the best response is PR.

10. STATISTICAL METHODS
This is a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Our primary objective is 
to assess the feasibility of therapeutic strategy that begins with neoadjuvant therapy with 
gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel for resectable oncologically high-risk IHCCA patients 
prior to complete surgical resection. Anticipating maximum 20% dropout rate due to screen 
failures or withdrawals, our planned sample size for this trial will be [ADDRESS_660735] 30 
evaluable patients. The primary endpoint will be completion of all preoperative and operative 
therapy.  Secondary endpoints will include radiological response according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), RFS, and OS.
The analysis will be performed for all patients registered to the trial who receive at least one dose 
of study drug. Patients who are registered to the study but do not receive study treatment will be 
summarized separately. The method of Thall, Simon and Estey will be used for futility and 
toxicity monitoring in this study. The design software Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1) 
developed by [CONTACT_185997] M D Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) was 
used to generate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_510787]. This is free software accessible through 
https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/softwaredownload/.
10.1 Power estimation
The primary endpoint is completion of all therapy. We hypothesize that the new treatment will 
improve this rate to 70%. A sample size of 30 evaluable patients will provide approximately 73% 
power for detecting an increase from 50% to 70% in this study at 1-sided type I error of 0.05. The 
Version [ADDRESS_660736]. To account for up to 20% dropout rate due 
to screen failures or withdrawals, the maximum study accrual will be [ADDRESS_660737] 30 
evaluable patients.
10.2 Futility monitoring 
We assume a target rate of 70% and a rate of 50% or lower will be considered not desirable. The 
study will be stopped early if the data suggest that: 
Pr(P E > P H + 0.20 | data)<0.025
where P E and P H are the  rates for  this combination and historical treatment, respectively. That is, 
if at any time during the study we determine that there is less than 2.5% chance that the rate 
improves over historical rate by [CONTACT_726] 20%, the trial will be stopped due to futility. P E and 
PH are assumed to follow a prior of Beta (1, 1) and Beta (50, 50), respectively. We will apply 
these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_510788] 5. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_510789] 11.

10.3 Toxicity monitoring
Unacceptable toxicities are defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicities by [CONTACT_510838] a 
treatment delay of >4weeks. Denote the probability of toxicity by P T. We assume as a priori, P T ~ 
beta (1, 1). Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_83724]: 
Pr(P T > 0.50 | data)>0.90.
That is, we will stop the trial for new patient enrollment if at any time during the study, we 
determine that there is more than 90% chance that the unacceptable toxicity rate is more than 
50%. This toxicity monitoring rule will be applied after the first [ADDRESS_660738] been enrolled 
and evaluated, and then in cohort size of 5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_510791] 12. The operating characteristics for futility and toxicity monitoring are

with the 95% credible interval. Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of adverse events 
(AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Summary of these events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_510839] (CTCAE) grade and by [CONTACT_510840]. Both AEs and SAEs will be tabulated using frequencies and 
percentages. For secondary endpoint of radiological response rate it will be defined as the 
percentage of patients who will have complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable 
disease (SD) after the neoadjuvant therapy. We will estimate the radiological response rate, along 
with the 95% confidence interval.
RFS (Recurrence-free survival) is defined as the time between the date of surgery and the date of 
disease recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. If a patient did not have an event (i.e. disease 
recurrence or death) by [CONTACT_510841], patient will be censored at the last disease 
evaluation time. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of neoadjuvant treatment 
start to the date of death from any cause or to the date of last follow-up if patients are alive. If a 
patient is alive by [CONTACT_510841], the patient will be censored at the last follow-up date. 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate RFS or OS. The two-sided log-rank tests will 
be used to assess the differences of RFS or OS between groups.

for all subjects enrolled on the trial. 
For details regarding the process for data collection among all participating centers involved in 
the study, please see Appendix 4.
13. SAFETY REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1 Adverse Event Reporting and Definitions 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related 
to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other 
means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate.  Adverse events will be 
collected from the signing of the informed consent until [ADDRESS_660742], or other assessments. 
As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:
The severity grade (mild, moderate, severe or grade 1-5)
Its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected)
Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)
Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 43
43Whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study 
drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89392], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.
Information about common side effects already known about drug can be found in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator 
Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be 
discussed with the patient during the study as needed.
13.2 Adverse event attribution
Attribution of the AE:
- Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
Adverse events for this protocol will be recorded using the Recommended Adverse Event 
Recording Guidelines for phase II protocols.  
Recommended Adverse Event Recording Guidelines 
Attribution Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5
Unrelated Phase II Phase II Phase II
Unlikely Phase II Phase II Phase II
Possible Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II
Probable Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II
Definitive Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II Phase II
The Investigator is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse 
events and assigning attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the trial.
13.3 Serious adverse event (SAE) reporting 
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose):
Results in death
Is life-threatening1
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 44
44Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event3
1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510792].  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment 
should be considered as medically important.  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting.  A 
copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_510843], must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The 
investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its 
seriousness.
Pregnancies
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_660743] 
(not necessarily one with reproductive toxicity experience) or another appropriate healthcare 
professional for further evaluation.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
IF THE OUTCOME OF THE PREGNANCY WAS ABNORMAL (E.G., SPONTANEOUS OR 
THERAPEUTIC ABORTION), THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD REPORT THE 
ABNORMAL OUTCOME AS AN AE.  IF THE ABNORMAL OUTCOME MEETS ANY OF 
THE SERIOUS CRITERIA, IT MUST BE REPORTED AS AN SAE TO CELGENE DRUG 
SAFETY IMMEDIATELY BY [CONTACT_510844], OR OTHERAPPROPRIATE METHOD, 
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 45
45WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE INVESTIGATOR’S KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVENT USING 
THE SAE REPORT FORM, OR APPROVED EQUIVALENT FORM.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_660744] to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their healthcare provider immediately. Male patients treated with nab-paclitaxel 
are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after treatment.
Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin dosing 
only.  
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified 
dose of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin assigned to a given patient, regardless of any 
associated adverse events or sequelae.
PO any amount over the protocol-specified dose
IV 10% over the protocol-specified dose 
SC 10% over the protocol-specified dose
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.  
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol-specified 
rate.  For nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may increase Cmax by 
[CONTACT_3450] 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in less than [ADDRESS_660745] Information:

Investigator Reporting Responsibilities
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
All adverse experience reports must include the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity of 
reaction (mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (probably related, unknown relationship, 
definitely not related), date and time of administration of test medications and all concomitant 
medications, and medical treatment provided.   The investigator is responsible for evaluating all 
adverse events to determine whether criteria for “serious” and as defined above are present.  The 
investigator is responsible for reporting adverse events to Celgene as described below.
Expedited reporting by [CONTACT_510845], Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events of being related to ABRAXANE® based on the Investigator Brochure.  In the United 
States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.  The investigator must inform Celgene in 
writing using a Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form of any SAE within [ADDRESS_660747].  
Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event 
or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A 
final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.  The Celgene tracking number (AX- 
CL-CHOL-PI-[ZIP_CODE]) and the institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports 
(or on the fax cover letter) sent to Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the 
SAE report to Celgene should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records. 
Participating study sites must report SAEs to Celgene as described and within [ADDRESS_660748]
The principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101400]/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a 
serious adverse event according to institutional policy.  
Investigator Reporting to the FDA
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly associated 
to the drug, and that have not previously been reported in the Investigators brochure, or 
reference safety information document should be reported promptly to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) by [CONTACT_56638].  Fatal or life threatening SAEs that meet the 
Version [ADDRESS_660749] be 
reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days after awareness of the event.  A clear description of 
the suspected reaction should be provided along with an assessment as to whether the event is 
drug or disease related.   
Adverse event updates/IND safety reports
Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information:
Any AE associated with the use of drug in this study or in other studies that is both 
serious and unexpected.
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and unexpected 
AE(s) or significant risks to subjects. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_56594], 
including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC, on file.

49Data and Safety Monitoring Language Guidelines for Investigator-Initiated Studies
A sensible data safety monitoring plan (DSMP) for a particular clinical trial must be 
based on the medical or health-related context of the particular study and in particular 
the degree of risk to which participants in the trial are exposed. (NCI Data and Safety 
Monitoring Guidelines, 2005)
I. Standard language for Investigator-Initiated studies under purview of 
Winship DSMC:
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the 
Winship Cancer Institute will provide oversight for the conduct of 
this study.  The DSMC functions independently within Winship 
Cancer Institute to conduct internal monitoring functions to ensure 
that research being conducted by [CONTACT_510846]-quality scientific data in a manner 
consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate 
regulations that govern clinical research.    Depending on the risk 
level of the protocol, the DSMC review may occur every [ADDRESS_660750] 5 subjects being reviewed.  Subsequent monitoring will occur 
in routine intervals per the Winship Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan (DSMP). 
The DSMC will review pertinent aspects of the study to assess 
subject safety, compliance with the protocol, data collection, and 
risk-benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer Institute Internal 
Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed consent, 
eligibility, data entry, accuracy and availability of source 
documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential regulatory documents.  
Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a 
preliminary report of monitoring findings to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_510795].  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_510796].  Prior to the completion of the final 
summary report, monitors will discuss the preliminary report

50responses with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163791] (when appropriate).  
A final monitoring summary report will then be prepared by [CONTACT_36102].  Final DSMC review will include the final monitoring 
summary report with corresponding PI [INVESTIGATOR_163792], submitted CAPA 
(when applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_228415], and available aggregate 
toxicity and safety data.  
The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the 
overall trial conduct.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_510797].  
Continuing Review submissions will include the DSMC 
recommendation letter.  Should any revisions be made to the 
protocol-specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC approval, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_163795].  The 
Committee reserves the right to conduct additional audits if 
necessary. 
The data safety monitoring plan will be implemented by [CONTACT_510847], the 
Principal Investigator (P.I.) of this study.  The plan is based on weekly-
monitoring by [CONTACT_510848], and monitoring via Winship Cancer 
Institute Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) as per Winship DSMP. [CONTACT_510873] and the investigators, the clinical research coordinator and the 
regulatory affairs coordinator will meet at least on a monthly basis to review and 
discuss study data to ensure subject safety. The research coordinators will 
maintain one spread sheet which will summarize all the patient data for patients 
actively being treated on the trial as well as a roadmap detailing pending 
tests/treatments for each individual patient. During weekly meetings of the GI 
Oncology Working Group, the group will review the eligibility criteria for each 
new patient. In addition, during these meeting the group will review all the 
toxicity (AE/SAE) logs, case report form completion and roadmap for each 
patient on the trial. Decisions to continue treating subjects and/or if the trial 
accrual should continue, along with the recruitment methods and the insurance 
of confidentiality are also discussed during these meetings. Documentation of 
the discussions during these meetings are completed and filed. The P.I. and the 
study investigators will discuss any required modifications to this study at the 
weekly meetings. No modifications to this study are implemented until they are 
submitted for review and approved by [CONTACT_510849]. The comments 
from the Winship Cancer Institute DSMC are forwarded to the IRB at the time of 
the annual renewal of this study or sooner if warranted and requested by [CONTACT_510850].

NAB-PACLITAXEL® DEMONSTRATES STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL SURVIVAL FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED 
PANCREATIC CANCER IN PHASE III STUDY 
BOUDRY, Switzerland – (November 9, 2012) – Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of 
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today announced that its phase III study of NAB-
PACLITAXEL® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) 
in combination with gemcitabine in treatment-naïve patients with advanced pancreatic cancer 
met its primary endpoint of overall survival. In the study, NAB-PACLITAXEL in combination 
with gemcitabine demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival 
compared to patients receiving gemcitabine alone.  
In the MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) study, a Celgene-
sponsored, open-label, randomized, international study 861 metastatic pancreatic cancer patients 
were randomized to receive either NAB-PACLITAXEL plus gemcitabine (125 mg/m2 followed 
by 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine for [ADDRESS_660751]) or gemcitabine alone (1000 
mg/m2 administered weekly for [ADDRESS_660752]). 
The primary endpoint for the study is improvement in overall survival. Secondary endpoints 
include evaluation of progression-free survival, objective tumor response and the safety and 
tolerability of this combination in this patient population.
The safety profile of NAB-PACLITAXEL in combination with gemcitabine observed in the 
study is comparable with other NAB-PACLITAXEL clinical trials in pancreatic cancer. A late-
breaker placeholder abstract for this study has been submitted to the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) [ADDRESS_660753] survival rates among all 
cancer types.  Across all patients with pancreatic cancer, relative 5-year survival is 5.5%.  There 
are two main types of pancreatic cancer - adenocarcinomas, which accounts for approximately 
95% of all pancreatic cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors.  Pancreatic cancer is relatively 
uncommon with new cases accounting for only 2.1% of all newly diagnosed cancers. However, 
pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] and 
throughout the world. 
About NAB-PACLITAXEL®   
NAB-PACLITAXEL is an albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that is manufactured using patented 
nab® technology.  NAB-PACLITAXEL is formulated with albumin, a human protein, and is free 
of solvents.
In the [LOCATION_002], NAB-PACLITAXEL was first approved in January [ADDRESS_660754]-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in 
combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation 
therapy.
For the full prescribing information for NAB-PACLITAXEL please visit http://www.Nab-
Paclitaxel.com. 
NAB-PACLITAXEL is currently in various stages of investigation for the treatment of the 
following cancers: pancreatic, metastatic melanoma, bladder, ovarian, and expanded applications 
for breast cancer.
NAB-PACLITAXEL® for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for 
injectable suspension) (albumin bound) is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer after 
failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within [ADDRESS_660755] cancer and pancreas adenocarcinoma.
Important Safety Information
WARNING - NEUTROPENIA
Do not administer NAB-PACLITAXEL therapy to patients who have baseline 
neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm3. In order to monitor the occurrence of 
bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in 
infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on 
all patients receiving NAB-PACLITAXEL
Note: An albumin form of paclitaxel may substantially affect a drug’s functional 
properties relative to those of drug in solution. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR OR 
WITH OTHER PACLITAXEL FORMULATIONS
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Neutrophil Counts
NAB-PACLITAXEL should not be used in patients who have baseline neutrophil counts of < 
1,500 cells/mm3 
Hypersensitivity
Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to NAB-PACLITAXEL should 
not be rechallenged with the drug
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Hematologic Effects
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting 
toxicity of NAB-PACLITAXEL
Monitor for myelotoxicity by [CONTACT_510851], including 
prior to dosing on Day [ADDRESS_660756] cancer (MBC) and Days 1, 8, and 15 for non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Do not administer NAB-PACLITAXEL to patients with baseline absolute neutrophil counts 
(ANC) of less than 1,500 cells/mm3
In the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
NAB-PACLITAXEL therapy, reduce the dose of NAB-PACLITAXEL in subsequent courses 
in patients with either MBC or NSCLC
In patients with MBC, resume treatment with every-3-week cycles of NAB-PACLITAXEL 
after ANC recovers to a level >1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3
In patients with NSCLC, resume treatment if recommended at permanently reduced doses for 
both weekly NAB-PACLITAXEL and every-3-week carboplatin after ANC recovers to at 
least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm3 on Day [ADDRESS_660757] 500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 50,000 cells/mm3 on Days 8 or 15 of 
the cycle
Nervous System
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 56
56Sensory neuropathy is dose- and schedule-dependent
The occurrence of Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose 
modification
If ≥ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until resolution to 
Grade 1 or 2 for MBC or until resolution to ≤ Grade1 for NSCLC followed by a dose 
reduction for all subsequent courses of NAB-PACLITAXEL
Hypersensitivity
Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have 
been reported
Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to NAB-PACLITAXEL should 
not be re-challenged with this drug
Hepatic Impairment
Because the exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic impairment, 
administration of NAB-PACLITAXEL in patients with hepatic impairment should be 
performed with caution
The starting dose should be reduced for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment
Albumin (Human)
NAB-PACLITAXEL contains albumin (human), a derivative of human blood
Use in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category D
NAB-PACLITAXEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman 
If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while 
receiving NAB-PACLITAXEL

58USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether paclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing 
infants, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking 
into account the importance of the drug to the mother
Pediatric
The safety and efficacy of NAB-PACLITAXEL in pediatric patients have not been evaluated
Geriatric
No toxicities occurred notably more frequently among patients ≥ 65 years of age who 
received NAB-PACLITAXEL for MBC

60Appendix 3 - Registration Process for Participating Sites
Centralized Registrations 
A centralized registration procedure will be used. Subjects who are considered candidates for the 
study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_3486]. There will be a 2-part 
registration procedure: 
1) Participating Institutions Registration 
Subjects at participating institutions should be registered with their institutional central 
registration following each institution’s established policies. 
2) Emory University Registration 
Participating institutions must register subjects with Emory University in accordance with project 
specific procedures. After each subject signs consent, the Central Subject Registration form is to 
be completed and sent to Winship within 24 hours of consent. This form, along with the valid, 
signed informed consent form/HIPAA authorization form, is to be faxed or emailed to Winship’s 
Central Subject Registrar per instructions on the form. Once a subject is registered, each 
participating site will be notified via e-mail. All participating institution subjects must be registered 
with Emory University before protocol treatment is initiated. Late registrations will not be 
accepted. 
Registrations will be completed by [CONTACT_510853] [ADDRESS_660761] ID Number 
At the time of registration, the participating institution’s subject will be assigned an Emory 
University subject number. This number is unique to the subject and must be used for 
registrations onto subsequent protocols and written on all data and correspondence for that 
subject prior to submission to Emory University. 
Emory University subjects will be registered using their Emory University subject number. 
Registration Verification Letter 
A Registration Verification Letter will be created by [CONTACT_510854]. 
Initiation of Therapy 
Subjects must be registered with Emory University before receiving study treatment. Treatment 
may not be initiated until the participating institutions receive the subject’s Registration 
Verification Letter from Emory University. 
Confidentiality 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the subject are strictly 
confidential. Any subject specific data or reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, 
Version 2

4.11 Missing and Deficient Memorandum
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission.  
Participating institutions are notified of their data submission delinquencies in accordance 
with the following policies and procedures:
Incomplete or Questionable Data
If data entered in the CRFs is incomplete, or if there is a conflict between data entered and 
source documents reviewed, queries will be generated. Responses to any queries generated 
are due within 14 days.  Source documents are also expected to be available within 14 days 
of occurrence.
Missing Source Documents
If source documents are not submitted or available for viewing on schedule, the participating 
institution will receive a “Missing and Deficient Report” from the coordinating center noting 
the missing source document (s). These reports are distributed on a monthly basis. If source 
documents are 30 or more days late, the site will be contact[CONTACT_510860]. If forms are > 60 days late, the Protocol PI (Maithel) will 
contact [CONTACT_30604]’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_510808].  
Missing Query Responses:
If replies to Queries are not received on schedule, the institution will receive a “Missing and 
Deficient Query Report” from the coordinating center noting the missing Query.  These 
reports are compi[INVESTIGATOR_510809] a monthly basis. If responses are 30 or more days 
late, the coordinating center will communicate with the participating institution’s Research 
staff for assistance in obtaining the forms.  If responses are 60 or more days late, the 
Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_510810].  All delinquencies will also be 
discussed in the monthly consortia meetings.
5. STUDY DRUG REQUISITION

756. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND TOXICITY MONITORING
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience at any dose that results in 
any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions in a 
participant who has never had seizure activity in the past that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
6.[ADDRESS_660773] be consistent with the data and 
safety monitoring guidelines delineated in the Emory University protocol.  The 
participating institution will ensure that all safety information related to their study site 
has been forwarded to the Coordinating Center.
6.2.2 Coordinating Center
All patients receiving study drugs will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters 
include all laboratory and hematologic abnormalities, CNS observations, physical 
examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the 
investigator by [CONTACT_1962].  All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated 
according to the NCI Clinical Toxicity Criteria Scale (0-5) using the NCI’s CTCAE 
Criteria Version 4.0 and recorded prior to each course of therapy.  A copy of the 
CTCAE Criteria can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html   
Life- threatening toxicities should be reported immediately to the Protocol PI, site PI, 
and the respective site IRB where the toxicity occurred.

reported within 5 working days from the time the research team becomes aware of the 
event.
SAEs that do not result in death and unrelated, are to be reported within 5 working 
days from the time the research team becomes aware of the event.
The Coordinating Center will notify the Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_510811]. 
The initial SAE report from the participating institution will be forwarded to the 
Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_510812]. 
The Emory University Multicenter Serious Adverse Event Report form will be used for 
the study by [CONTACT_430966], and the Coordinating Center will maintain 
documentation of all Adverse Event Reporting.
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_660774] returned to baseline, progression of the 
event has stabilized or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.
                
Follow up Information:
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_69167]:

7. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines define the terms “protocol violation” or 
“protocol deviation.” The definition is often left to the lead institution IRB.  Accordingly, 
since Emory University is the lead institution and the Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_510813], the definitions for protocol deviation as 
described by [CONTACT_510863]. 
7.1 Definitions
Minor Protocol Deviation / Protocol Non-Compliance: Noncompliance with the required 
elements of the protocol that does not have a significant effect on the subject’s rights, safety, 
welfare, and/or the integrity of the data.  Deviations may be caused by [CONTACT_243341], or the 
omission of, the subject, the investigator, the research team, or natural events.  Continuing 
non-compliance of the protocol may meet reporting requirements.
Protocol Deviation / Non-Compliance: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_510814] a deviation from a research protocol that has not been 
approved in advance by [CONTACT_510864]-compliance with a research protocol to determine if 
the protocol deviation/protocol non-compliance meets any of the following criteria: 
(a) Adversely affects the rights, welfare or safety of subjects. 
(b) Adversely affects the integrity of the research data. 
(c) Adversely affects the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the research. 
(d) Concerns study documentation associated with an FDA-regulated study. 
(e) Was a protocol deviation undertaken to prevent immediate hazard to a human subject.  
Examples include but are not limited to:

Enrollment of ineligible participant
Treatment and Procedures
Incorrect agent/treatment/procedure used
Additional agent/treatment/procedure used which is excluded by [CONTACT_990]
Errors in dosing (error greater than +/- 10%)
Dose modifications not followed per protocol or unjustified
Unjustified continuation of treatment
Disease Outcome and Response
Tumor measurements/evaluation of status or disease not performed or documented 
adequately to assess baseline or interpret response
Documented response status cannot be verified
Adverse Events
Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events not reported as required by [CONTACT_510865]
Protocol- specified laboratory, diagnostic tests, or evaluations to assess participant eligibility, 
safety, or response not completed
Unanticipated Problems (UAPs): 
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Participants or Others (referred to herein as 
UAP): Any unexpected problem related to the Research, including any Unexpected Adverse 
Experience, whether Serious or not, that affects the rights, safety or welfare of subject or 
others or that significantly impacts the integrity of the Research data. The problem may be 
physical, or it could involve social harm or risk (i.e., breach of confidentiality or harm to a 
subject’s reputation) or psychological or legal harm or risk thereof in the future. The 
problem may or may not involve drugs or devices. Examples: (a) breach of confidentiality 
stemming from theft of lap top computer containing identifiable data; (b) protocol 
violations; (c) complaints about research procedures or treatment by [CONTACT_510866]. 
(Please note: it is important to bear in mind that a UP as defined here is not the opposite of 
an Anticipated Problem (defined above). The key distinction lies in the qualifying phrase 
“involving risk to participants or others.” By [CONTACT_22242], the true opposite of an Anticipated 
Version 2

79Problem would be an Adverse Experience or event (including an experience or event 
associated with a drug or device) that negatively affects the rights, safety or welfare of 
subjects and that is not described as such in the materials describing risks associated with the 
study.)
Examples include but are not limited to: 
Participant complaints 
Breach of confidentiality of research data 
Lost, stolen or destruction of confidential information
Disqualification or suspension of investigators
Change in FDA labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device or biologic agent
Injury to research staff or others while conducting study-related procedures
Expected events not reported in a timely manner as required by [CONTACT_510867]
New information becomes available that may affect the participant's willingness to participate
Issues with preparation, storage or handling of a study drug or device
Unaccounted for study drug
Drug stability issues
Changes made to the research without prior IRB approval in order to eliminate apparent 
immediate harm
7.2 Reporting Procedures
The Protocol Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_510815]/UAPs involving subjects at an Emory site are promptly reported to 
the IRB per Emory University institutional guidelines. 
Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations/UAPs occurring at a participating institution 
will be promptly reported to the coordinating center at Emory University even if they do not 
meet local IRB reporting requirements. Participating institutions should also report to their 
IRB according to their local policies and procedures. A copy of the participating institution’s 
deviation report and the local IRB response will be included in the site’s protocol regulatory 
file. The local IRB response to the report will be forwarded to the Coordinating Center upon 
receipt.
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the deviation report from the participating 
institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_510816]. 
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
The quality assurance process for a clinical trial research study requires verification of protocol 
compliance and data accuracy. Emory University provides quality assurance oversight for the 
protocol with three basic mechanisms: 
1)Ongoing monitoring of protocol compliance
2)Verification of study data 
3)On-Site Audit 
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 80
808.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance
The Coordinating Center will perform the ongoing protocol compliance monitoring based on 
the data provided in the CRF and source documents submitted via OnCore as agreed with the 
support of the Protocol PI, Participating PI [INVESTIGATOR_27235]. Monitoring will begin at the time 
of participant registration and will continue during protocol performance and completion. 
Monitoring plan of Subsite(s): 
 At the time of study initiation at a non-Emory site, the Protocol PI, Winship regulatory 
specialist, and Winship research coordinators will perform a site initiation teleconference. 
During this teleconference, the Emory team will review the study, enrollment, reporting, 
and regulatory compliance. The participating site will have internal monitoring meetings. 
These meetings which will include the participating site investigator, the clinical research 
coordinator and the regulatory affairs coordinator, will meet at least on a monthly basis to 
review and discuss study data to ensure subject safety. The research coordinators will 
maintain a spread sheet which will be de-identified and will summarize all the patient data 
for subjects actively being treated on the trial as well as a roadmap detailing pending 
tests/treatments for each individual subject. The spread sheet will be shared with the Emory 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] e-mail. Teleconferences will be conducted at least once monthly between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_510817](s). The purpose of the meetings is to 
discuss the enrollment, regulatory updates, monitor toxicities, and evaluate the progress of 
the trial.  Scheduled teleconferences may stop after all patients have completed assigned 
protocol therapy. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_510818]. The minutes from the teleconference will be maintained in the regulatory binder 
for the study. In addition electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_510819]. Chart reviews will be performed on selected cases by [CONTACT_510868].
Winship’s MSC will perform an on-site or remote monitoring visit within the first three 
months of enrollment of the first subject. Quarterly monitoring visits will occur (annually 
once onsite and three times remotely) until subject follow-up is terminated. Monthly 
reviews of data in OnCore will be conducted to ensure compliance or identify 
discrepancies.  
8.2 Verification of Study Data
All data submitted to the Coordinating Center will be monitored for timeliness of submission, 
completeness, and adherence to protocol requirements. If study documents/data are submitted 
with missing pages, inaccurate or illegible data, the site will be notified and is required to 
resubmit the corrected document/data within 14 calendar days.
If study documents/data are not submitted on schedule, the Coordinating Center will notify the 
participating institution regarding the delinquency and describe a corrective action that includes 
deadline for bringing the data current.
Failure to comply with the delinquency notification will be communicated to the Protocol PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_510820]’s study participation.
8.2 On-Site Audit 
Version 2
May 25, 2018
Page 81
81As part of the quality assurance process, the Clinical Research Support Center (CRSC) will 
conduct on-site audits/inspections on multicenter human subject research projects for which 
Emory University is the lead institution.
The CRSC auditing staff will notify the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_510821]. Documentation of all findings will be included in the final audit report submitted 
to the PI. 
9. EVALUATION OF PARTICIPATING INSTITUTION PERFORMANCE
The Emory University Coordinating Center and Clinical Research Support Center are bound 
by [CONTACT_510869]. Protocol 
performance concerns are reported to the Protocol PI.

The Protocol Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_510822]’s 
performance when evaluating each institution.
9.2 Corrective Actions:  
Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, submission of timely accurate 
data, and adherence to protocol requirements may be recommended for a probationary period.  
Such institutions must respond with a corrective action plan and must demonstrate during the 
probationary period that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by [CONTACT_510870].  Institutions that fail to demonstrate significant improvement may be subject to 
reduced funding (if applicable) or revocation of participation as determined by [CONTACT_510871].

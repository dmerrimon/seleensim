indication for a plasma infusion is necessary and will place the plasma order accordingly. 
The type of surgical procedure indicated and important oper ative interventions will also 
be recorded. Patients determined to have a reasonable probability to receive intra-
operative plasma transfusion according to the Investigator’s clinical judgment may also 
be approached for consent to participate. If these pati ents are subsequently not prescribed 
plasma intra -operatively or postoperatively they will be determined to be a screening 
failure and not included in the analysis.  
Pre-Infusion: Within [ADDRESS_619029]  infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], vital signs an d 
several laboratory tests will be assessed  to measure metabolic derangements and renal 
function.   
72-hour Study Treatment Period:  The number of infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]1 and actual total 
volume (dose in mL/kg) of Octaplas administered to a patient within the 72 -hour 
treatment period will depend on the clinical setting and physician discretion. The infusion 
rate of Octaplas should not exceed 0.020- 0.025 mmol citrate per minute, which is equal to 
Octaplas per kg per minute. This limitation is not applicable for devices used for 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_482000]. In case 
situations like e.g. a serious hemorrhage necessitates a rapid infusion ≥ 1mL/kg and the 
benefits outweigh the potentia l risks, the infusion speed can be ≥ 1mL/kg body weight. 
The first infusion dose will be at a minimum of 10 mL/kg or one unit unless a lesser dose 
is medically justified. If infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481955] 10 mL/kg, t he medical reason justifying this dosage will be recorded in the case 
report form (CRF), since at least 10 mL/kg are required to significantly increase the 
respective plasma protein levels.   
Post-infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481956] 30 to 60 min utes after each 
infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. If the patient requires priming of the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB)

laboratory parameters be drawn for testing. If subsequent infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481961]  
(after the first infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), laboratory testing and vi tal signs should be performed 
within a maximum of 60 minutes before the start and 60 minutes after the end of each 
infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. If multiple vital sign assessments are taken within 60 minutes before 
and/or after the infusion, the vital signs that are a ssessed closest before the start and after 
the end of each infusion should be recorded. Pre - and post -infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481962] (e.g., the timing 
of the pre -infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481963] -
infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481964], or testing is not medically 
appropriate for patient at that time, etc.). I n the event that the pre - or post -infusion 
laboratory sample testing is not performed, the reason will be documented in the CRF. 
The study Treatment Period will end after [ADDRESS_619031] infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481965] <72 hours.   
72-hour Safety Follow -up Period:  Adverse drug reactions and relevant concomitant 
medications will be monitored for 72 (±6) hours after the last Octaplas transfusion is 
complete d. 
Final Examination: At the end of the 72- hour safety follow -up period, a final 
examination will be performed comprising of vital signs, Investigator assessment of 
safety (the safety assessment is to be carried out by [CONTACT_482001] -investigator) an d 
laboratory testing (Chem 7, CBC and ionized calcium) for monitoring of metabolic 
derangements, renal function, and hematologic implications.  
After the final examination, the clinical phase of the study is considered completed for the 
patient. No further  study -related assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns 
(e.g., on- going ADRs) require follow -up. 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP): 
Due to the complex and highly variable and individual medical circumstances and 
interventions that are to be exp ected in this study, no single parameter or measurement of 
outcome is chosen as the primary endpoint. All data collected will be summarized and 
presented descriptively to facilitate the review of population homogeneity and general 
patterns within and betwe en patients of similar baseline characteristics or disease 
patterns. No confirmatory hypothesis testing is planned. Any p- value or confidence 
interval presented is to be understood in the exploratory sense.  
To allow a holistic review and interpretation of each course of treatment, all parameters 
relevant for the assessment of safety will be presented descriptively in full detail, by

occurrence of SAEs, ADRs, TEs, TEEs and hype rfibrinolytic events. To facilitate the 
detection of any possible safety signal, all these events will be characterized and analyzed 
by [CONTACT_654]  (≤ and > 2 years of age respectively) , underlying diagnosis, seriousness, severity, 
relation to study drug and timel y relationship to study drug administration. In addition to 
these pre- planned categories, the collected data will be examined to identify additional 
characteristics of interest such as particular types of surgeries, relevant concomitant 
medications, or Sta ndardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) covering a noticeable number of 
events. The occurrences of all specific safety events will be presented for all these 
categories and in total, together with the associated 95% confidence intervals.  
To account for the aboveme ntioned diversity in the study population, individual patient 
profiles will be generated, displaying the baseline characteristics as well as all 
interventions, treatment details and relevant measurements on a time scale. This will 
facilitate the review of each individual course of treatment by [CONTACT_482003].  
Hemostatic parameters will be presented descriptively per time point, including shift 
tables. Individual courses of hemostatic parameters will be presented graphically as 
Trellis plots.  
Vital sign measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086], including shift 
tables. All measurements outside age- speci fic thresholds will be listed and reviewed 
individually.  
All safety laboratory data – absolute values as well as changes from baseline – will be 
presented descriptively per time point. All measurements outside age -specific thresholds 
will be listed and rev iewed individually.  
All data will be presented in total as well as in sub –groups reflecting age  (≤ and > 2 
years) , gender, underlying diagnosis, surgical procedures performed and/or most relevant 
medical history and concomitant medications.

 Page 14 of 55 1 INTRODUCTION  
Octaplas  is a solvent/detergent (S/D) treated and pooled (SDP) human plasma prepared from 
units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) pooled according to their ABO blood group. It contains the 
normal constituents of plasma. Octaplas  is a further development of octaplas® which is 
marketed in Europe since 1992. In January of 2013, Octaplas  received regulatory approval by 
[CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the US market. For Octaplas , a new prion 
affinity column was introduced in the manufacturing process of the produc t to eliminate 
potential prion proteins. Furthermore, the time of S/D treatment in the manufacturing process 
has been shortened from 4–4.5 hours to 1–1.5 hours. These measures increase the 
concentration of plasmin inhibitor and slightly increase the concentration of protein S 
compared with octaplas®. Octaplas  has received marketing authorization in Australia, 
[LOCATION_013], Portugal, the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Sweden, 
Finland, Switzerland, Malta, and Canada. octaplas® is registered in [ADDRESS_619039] 
this could lead to mismatch or misunderstanding. Therefore the name [CONTACT_482033].  
Octaplas  does not contain red blood cells (RBCs), leukocytes and platelets. The RBCs and 
cell fragments are removed in several filtration steps during the production process. 
Therefore, adverse reactions caused by [CONTACT_482005] (e.g., immunization against 
RBC an tigens or febrile non- hemolytic reactions from cytokines liberated by [CONTACT_482006]) are 
not expected to be associated with the infusion of this product. 
Virus inactivation is performed using the S/D treatment method using the virus inactivating 
reagents 1% t ri(n-butyl)phosphate (TNBP) and 1% Triton X -100 (Octoxynol). This virus 
inactivation procedure is effective against enveloped viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The efficacy of this virus 
inactivation procedure has been extensively validated according to current international 
guidelines. The S/D treatment has no effect on non- enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A 
virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19. However, the presence of neutralizing antibodies towards 
HAV a nd B19 in the starting plasma and the final product, result in immune neutralization 
and passive immunization which both serve to limit or prevent virus replication and thereby 
[CONTACT_482007][INVESTIGATOR_840]. [1]  
The virus inactiva ting reagents (TNBP and Octoxynol) may remain in trace amounts in the 
final product. Toxicity studies performed in rats and dogs have shown that these levels are of 
no toxicological relevance to humans. Furthermore, no teratogenic, embryotoxic or mutagenic  
effects of TNBP and Octoxynol were observed in the toxicity studies performed. 
In total, [ADDRESS_619040] been 
enrolled in the pro - and retrospective efficacy  studies, including one observational study, and 
the patients were exposed to 2592 infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481966]/Octaplas or Uniplas (a

in 50 pediatric patients from 0 to ≤  16 years of age with acquired deficiencies due to liver 
disease and/or who require cardiac surg ery or liver transplantation in whom replacement of 
multiple coagulation factors is required.  
The study is intended to obtain additional safety information on Octaplas in a routine clinical 
setting via the assessment of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), serio us adverse events (SAEs) 
thrombotic events (TEs), thromboembolic events (TEEs) and hyperfibrinolytic events, and will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, ICH -GCP and other regulatory 
requirements.  
1.2 Dose Rationale  
Octaplas is for intravenous use only. Please refer to the package insert of Octaplas for further 
information regarding dose ( Appendix 1 ).  
1.3 Benefit -Risk Statement  
There are several benefits associated with the administration of Octaplas . Octaplas has 
undergone addit ional steps for viral inactivation and removal. The combination of the S/D 
treatment and immune neutralization ensures a high degree of viral safety for this product. Antibodies against white blood cells are diluted and neutralized which abolishes the risk for 
immune Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury  (one of the most serious complications of 
transfusions today); this is a very favorable feature of Octaplas compared to plasma. Because cells and cellular debris are completely removed by [CONTACT_482009], 
adverse reactions attributable to residual blood cells, especially white blood cells, are not expected in conjunction with the use of Octaplas . The dilution effect on cytokines and 
allergens from the pooling of multiple units of sin gle-donor FFP units diminishes the number 
and severity of adverse reactions that can occur due to the presence of allergens/soluble substances in plasma. Additionally, Octaplas  has uniform and stable levels of both pro - and 
anti-coagulation factors. The co mbination of the uniformity of these factors  in Octaplas  and 
the consistent size of each unit could produce a more predictable hemostatic response following Octaplas transfusion compared to standard plasma. Comprehensive biochemical 
studies confirmed that Octaplas  produced with the new column possesses a biochemical 
quality  identical to its predecessor, octaplas
®, with the advantage of offering an enhanced 
safety profile in terms of prion disease transmission such as Variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob 
Disease.  
The adverse reactions that were observed in ≥  1% of subjects who received octaplas were 
mild and included pruritus, urticaria, nausea, headache, and paresthesia. [ 2] Serious adverse 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version [ADDRESS_619042], 
thrombosis due to low levels of protein S, and citrate toxicity (hypocalcemia). The infusion rate should not exceed 1 mL/kg/min . Symptoms attributable to citrate toxicity can include 
fatigue, paresthesia and muscle spasms, especially in patients with liver function disorders. Because Octaplas is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting certain infectious agents such as viruses and Variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob Dis ease. Other adverse 
reactions that have been reported in the post -marketing experience include hypersensitivity 
reactions including anaphylactoid and allergic type of reactions, alkalosis, cardiac arrest, circulatory overload, thromboembolism, tachycardia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_481967], 
bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, tachypnea, abdominal pain, vomiting, rash, erythema, fever and/or chills, chest discomfort or pain, and seroconversions (passive transfer of antibodies).  
High volumes or infusion rates  may induce Transfusion Associated Volume Overload that is 
manifested dyspnea, hypoxia, and increasing oxygen demands. Pulmonary edema can often be seen on chest X -ray. High infusion rates may rarely cause cardiovascular effects as a result 
of citrate toxicity (fall in ionized calcium), especially in patients with liver function disorders. Octaplas  should be used with caution in patients with risks for thrombotic complications 
because of the potential for increased risk of venous thromboembolism. In order t o reduce the 
risk for venous thromboembolism, appropriate measures should be considered in all patients at risk for thrombotic complications subjected to coagulation factor support for an extended period of time (e.g., during long- term, large -volume therap eutic plasma exchange [TPE]) 
using Octaplas . 
Administration of Octaplas  must be based on ABO -blood group compatibility with the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Hemolytic reactions can occur with ABO blood group mismatches. In emergency cases, blood group AB can be regarded as the universal plasma since it can be given to all patients.  
Octaplas  should not be used in patients with:  
• Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency  
• Severe deficiency of protein S  
• History of hypersensitivity to FFP or to plasma -derived products  
• History of hypersensitivity reaction to Octaplas

 Page 17 of 55 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of Octaplas  in the pediatric 
population by [CONTACT_482010], ADRs, TEs, TEEs and hyperfibrinolytic events, inc luding 
laboratory parameters for metabolic derangements, renal function, and hematologic 
implications.  
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of Octaplas  in the pediatric population by 
[CONTACT_482011].  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint(s)  
• Incidence of SAEs, ADRs (e.g., allergic reactions; refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
definition), TEs, TEEs and hyperfibrinolytic events, beginning after the start of the first infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481968] (end of safety follow -up period).  
• Clinically significant changes in laboratory parameter s to assess for metabolic 
derangements, renal function, and hematologic implications as measured by [CONTACT_716]: Chem 7 (metabolic panel), complete blood count (CBC) and ionized calcium (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definition).  
Due to the complex and highly variable and individual medical circumstances and interventions that are to be expected in this study, no single parameter or measurement of outcome is chosen as the primary endpoint.  
Secondary Endpoint(s)  
• Clinically significant changes in hemostatic parameters as measured by [CONTACT_716]: 
international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time  (PT), activated partial 
thromboplastin time  (aPTT),  thromboelastography (TEG), or thromboelastometry 
(ROTEM).  
• Volume (dose in mL/kg) of Octaplas used per infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481954].  
• Medically significant changes in vital signs.  
• Investigator’s assessment of overall safety observed for each patient.

 Page 22 of 55 3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group(s)  
Study Design  
This is an open- label, multicenter, PMR study in 50 pediatric patients with acquired 
deficiencies due to liver disease and/or pediatric patients requirin g cardiac surgery or liver 
surgery who require replacement of multiple coagulation factors. The substitution of 
coagulation factors is also applicable for young children who require cardiac surgery and require priming of the cardiopulmonary by -pass circuit  due to the dilution of the increased 
volume of the by -pass circuit relative to the circulating blood volume of the child. The study 
will be conducted in up to 10 sites in North America. The following number of patients is 
planned to be enrolled:  
1. Neonat es/Infants (0 -2 years): a maximum of 33 patients  
2. Children > 2 years and ≤ 16 years: a minimum of 17 patients   
Taking into consideration the small size of the target population of children with this disease 
condition and intervention indication, the proposed sample size of 50 children seems appropriate to obtain sufficient safety information in a reasonable amount of time.  
Control Group(s)  
This is an open -label study of Octaplas to investigate its safety, tolerability and efficacy in the 
management of pediatric patients who require replacement of multiple coagulation factors; 
there is no control group.  
Since the so le aim of this PMR study is the gathering of information on the safety and 
efficacy of Octaplas in the indicated study population, it is reasonable to omit a concurrent 
control group.  
Target Parameter(s)  
The selection of the endpoints listed in Section 3.[ADDRESS_619054]

 Page 24 of 55 4.2 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Details of relevant current and  concomitant medications administered during the trial period 
will be recorded on the CRF. Relevant medications are defined as follows:  
• Plasma products (e.g., octaplas™, regular plasma products, etc.) and all other blood 
products that are administered.  
• Antifibrinolytics ( ε-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and any other 
pharmaceutical pro - or anti -coagulants such as recombinant activated factor VII, any 
of the prothrombin complex concentrates, or fibrinogen concentrates.  
• Vaso -active agents (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], vasopressin, Milrninone, 
phenylepherine, Antidiuretics (desmopressin, DDAVP , DesmoMelt, Stimate, Minirin, 
etc.).  
• Colloids (e.g., albumin, hydroxyethyl starches).  
• Medications (including steroids) taken to treat or prevent ADRs (to Octaplas)  
• Other medications that the Investigator considers relevant to report for this trial.  
Routine medications that are considered standard and/or that have little or no impact on the study data results are not to be entered into the CRF (e.g., anesthesia medications, beta blockers, etc.). Any concomitant medications or changes thereof must be r ecorded. If the 
change influences the patients’ eligibility to continue in the trial, the Sponsor must be informed.  
Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
The following concomitant medications are permitted: 
• calcium -gluconate given IV in case of  hypocalcemia (due t o citrate toxicity),  
• antihistamines and glucocorticoids given IV in case  of anaphylactoid reactions, and 
• red blood cells, platelet units if medically indicated.  
It is permitted for patients to receive Octaplas or other plasma products (please see exception s 
below) during the 72- hour follow -up period if medically indicated.  
Although patient’s requiring ECMO at study entry are excluded, ECMO is permitted therapy while on study if it is determined to be medically indicated after the start of the first infusio n.  
Forbidden Concomitant Therapy  
Single donor plasma (e.g., FFP, FP24, thawed plasma, etc.) should be avoided during the Treatment and Follow -up study periods . Patients receiving single donor plasma during the 
Treatment or Follow -up periods should be withdrawn from the trial.  
Plasma exchange, TPE or plasmapheresis is not permitted during the study. Patients who develop the need for and undergo plasma exchange or plasmapheresis during the Treatment or Follow -up periods will be withdrawn from the trial.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version [ADDRESS_619056] be avoided. 
For any discontinuation after study entry, the Investigator will obtain all th e required details 
and document the reason(s) for discontinuation in the CRF. If the reason for withdrawal of a patient is an ADR, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorded in the CRF, and the Investigator will make thorough efforts to cl early document the outcome. 
Moreover a patient may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following reasons:  
• Whenever the patient/legal representative(s)/guardian(s) decides it is in the patient’s best interest to withdraw  
• Whenever the Investigator decides it is in the patient’s best interest to be withdrawn  
• Pregnancy  
For any premature patient withdrawal after study entry, the Investigator will obtain all the required details and document the reason(s) for discontinuation in the CRF. Data of patients 
withdrawn prematurely will be included in the safety analysis.  
Patients consented (enrolled) into the study pre -operatively for cardiac and liver surgery will 
be considered screening failures if they do not receive Octaplas intra -operativ ely or post -
operatively. Patients who are consented but do not receive Octaplas intra -operatively will be 
eligible for study treatment while they remain in the intensive care unit. Patients who are discharged from the intensive care unit without being trea ted with Octaplas will be considered 
a screening failure.  
Patient Replacement Policy

For Octaplas , a new prion affinity column was introduced in the manufacturing process of the 
product to eliminate potential prion proteins. Furthermore, the time of S/D treatment in the manufacturing process has been shortened from 4 –4.5 hours to 1–1.5 hours. These me asures 
increase the concentration of plasmin inhibitor and slightly increase the concentration of protein S compared with octaplas
®. 
The virus safety of Octaplas was maintained as shown by [CONTACT_482014]. With a total inactivation to below the de tection limit, the shortened S/D procedure has a time -safety -
margin of >98.3% versus >99.5% for the predecessor product.  
5.2 Packaging and Labeling 
Octaplas is delivered frozen in sterile, pyrogen free plastic bags containing 200 mL. The bags are vacuum sealed  in a clear plastic wrap and delivered in cartons of 10 units.

Final labeling will comply with the national requirements of each country where the study is 
to be conducted.  
Octaplas is labeled in the [LOCATION_002] with the proprietary name [CONTACT_482034]. In case the 
study will be conducted in countries outside of the [LOCATION_002] where the product is licensed unde r the name [CONTACT_482035]. Therefore the name [CONTACT_482036].  
5.3 Conditions for Storage and Use  
The shelf -life of Octaplas is 36 months when stored at ≤  -18°C (≤ -0.4°F) and protected from 
light. After thawing, the product must be used within 24 hours when stored at 1- 6°C (33.8°F 
to 42.8°F) or within 8 hours when stored at room temperature 20 to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). See 
package  insert in Appendix 1 . 
The Investigator/authorized personnel at the site will ensure that the product is stored in appropriate conditions with restricted access and in compliance with national regulations.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule  
The actual volume of Octaplas administered to a patient will depend on the clinical setting.  
If the time interval between the end of one Octaplas infusion and the beginning of the next Octaplas  infusion is no longer than 60 minutes, then this will be regarded as 1 infusion 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. If the time interval is more than 60 minutes, this will be counted as 2 different 
infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. For patients on CPB who are primed with plasma, a transfusion epi [INVESTIGATOR_481979].  
The infusion rate of Octaplas should not exceed 0.020- 0.025 mmol citrate per kilogram per 
minute, which is equal to <1 mL Octaplas per kg per minute. This limitation is not applicable 
for devices used for cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_482016]. In case situations like e.g. a serious hemorrhage necessitates a rapid infusion ≥  
1mL/kg a nd the benefits outweigh the potential risks, the infusion speed can be ≥  1mL/kg 
body weight. The dose (mL) of Octaplas to be infused will depend on the age and BW of the 
patient. The first infusion dose will be at a minimum of 10 mL/kg or one unit unless a lesser dose is medically justified. If infusions are performed and the dose administered is less than 10 mL/kg the medical reason justifying this dosage will be recorded in the CRF, since at least 10 mL/kg are required to significantly increase the respe ctive plasma protein levels  
5.[ADDRESS_619061]  (see Appendix 1 ). Octaplas 
will be administered based on ABO -blood group compatibility. In urgent cases and in the 
circums tances that no same blood group is available (type A donor plasma for type A 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016

(e.g., donor AB plasma can be administered to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481980] A).  
5.6 Blinding,  Emergency Envelopes and Breaking the Study Blind  
Not applicable. This is an open- label study.  
5.7 Treatment Compliance  
Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
Octaplas  will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. A drug dispensing and accountability log will be 
kept up- to-date at the Investigator's site, detailing the dates and quantities of the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) received at the site and dispensed and administ ered 
to each patient. The inventory will be made available to the monitor to verify drug accountability during the study. Unused trial medication will be returned to the Sponsor designated clinical supplies depot or, if approved by [CONTACT_22134], may be destroyed at the Investigator site following local policies for destruction of biologic supplies. Empty bags will not have to be returned and will be destroyed at the study site following local policies after appropriate documentation. 
Assessment of  Treatment Compliance  
Having in mind the setting and the fact that study drug administration will exclusively take 
place at the investigational site, full compliance is expected.  
[ADDRESS_619062]  
6.1 Study Periods  
Screening  
The following assessments will be perfo rmed at Screening:

 Page 32 of 55 7.3.2 Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Adverse event (AE) : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient receiving 
an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relatio nship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP . 
Adverse drug reaction (AD R): An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an IMP 
related to any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a causal relationship between the IMP and an adverse event carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out . 
Withdrawal due to ADR/AE : Is a patient whose treatment with IMP is discontinued because 
of an ADR. Any such events will be followed up by [CONTACT_301295]. Al l follow -up information 
collected will be made available to the Sponsor.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection  
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. ADRs/AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as “How have you been since the la st 
evaluation?” If children or adolescent patients are unable to adequately understand and respond to this question, the information will be obtained from the patient’s guardian and/or Investigator or study nurse. 
Any ADR or above defined AE after the firs t administration of study drug which occurs 
during the study will be noted in detail on the appropriate pages of the CRF. If the patient 
reports several signs or symptoms, which represent a single syndrome or diagnosis, the latter should be recorded in the  CRF. The Investigator responsible will grade the severity of all 
ADRs/AEs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non- serious or serious) and causality, 
as defined below ( Sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], and 7.3.3). The Sponsor is responsible to assess 
the expectedness of each ADR/AE (expected or unexpected), as defined below ( Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before  the first 
administration of IMP are not considered as ADRs/AEs when observed at a later stage unless 
they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening).  
The Investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning a ny 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other observations or comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the patients’ ADRs/AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
The intensity/severity of all ADRs/AEs  will be graded as follows:  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016  
 
 Page 33 of 55 • mild: an ADR/AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere 
with the patient’s routine activities; 
• moderate : an ADR/AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the 
patient’s routine activities ; 
• severe : an ADR/AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s 
routine activities.  
Grading of an ADR/AE is up to the medical judgment of the Investigator and will be decided 
on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  
The following causality definitions should be used for classification of each AE:  
Probable:  Reports or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake.  
  Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs.  
  Response to withdrawal clinically reason able.  
  Re-challenge not required. 
Possible:  Reports or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake.  
  Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. 
  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely:  Reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP administration. An event which may have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
Not related:  Reports for which suffic ient information exists to conclude that the etiology is 
unrelated to the IMP.  
Unclassified:  Reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g., because of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
The following causal ity definitions should be used for classification of each ADR:  
Probable:  Reports or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to 
drug intake.  
  Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs.  
  Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable.  
  Re-challenge not required. 
Possible:  Reports or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake.  
  Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. 
  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Classification of ADRs: 
ADRs will be classified by [CONTACT_301298]:  
• expected
: an adverse event that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
• unexpected : an adverse event that is not listed in the curr ent edition of the IB, or that 
differs because of greater severity or greater specificity.

 Page 34 of 55 [IP_ADDRESS] Outcome  
The outcome of all reported ADRs/AEs has to be documented as follows:  
1. recovered, resolved  
2. recovering, resolving 
3. not recovered, not resolved 
4. recovered, resolved with sequelae  
5. fatal 
6. unknown 
NOTE:  A patient’s death  per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted in 
patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 
four (4) weeks after IMP treatment end, and without respect of being considered treatment -
related or not.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Action(s) Taken  
ADRs/AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to protect the health and well -being of the patient. Appropriate resuscita tion equipment 
and medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by [CONTACT_222554]:  
a) in general  
- none  
- medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy start ed 
- test performed  
- other (to be specified)  
b) on IMP  
- none  
- product withdrawn  
- dose reduced  
- dose increased  
The responsible Investigator will follow -up each ADR/AE until it is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the patient is stable and all relevant follow -up information will be 
reported to the Sponsor.  
7.3.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious  AE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose:  
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening (this implies that the patient was at an immediate risk of death a t the 
time of the event, and not a hypothetical situation of what could or would have happened if, for example, no treatment had been administered), 
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_373498]- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481988]/AE on an out -patient status 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9

 Page 35 of 55 or to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481989] -related procedures (e.g., infusion at two 
consecutive days) or because of an elective surgical procedure for which the date had 
been scheduled ear lier),  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is another important medical event (e.g., suspected transmission of an infectious agent, 
or other reactions that should be reported in an expedited manner although they did not immediately result in one of the above seriousness criteria).  
Medical judgment sh ould be exercised in deciding whether an ADR/AE is serious in other 
situations. Important ADRs/AEs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481990], should also be considered serious.  
SAE reporting timelines  
All SAEs occurring after the start of the first infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481991], fax or e -mail immediately to the Clinic al Project Manager (CPM) or designee. Contact [CONTACT_482019].  
An Octapharma "Serious Adverse Event Report" must be completed and submitted within 24 hours after recognition of the event.  
All SAEs, TEs, TEEs and h yperfibrinolytic events ( Section 7.3.4)should be reported to:  
Octapharma’s Central Drug Safety Unit:  
OCTAPHARMA Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H.

All the above mentioned events will be reported regardless of severity or relatedness to the product. For this trial a “clinically relevant hyperfibrinolytic event” is defined by [CONTACT_482020] a bleed that requires intervention. 
1. Kaolin TEG: estimated percentage lysis (EPL) > 7.5% at 30 min (after starting assay)  
2. ROTEM EXTEM: maximum lysis (ML) > 7.5% at 30 min (after starting assay)  
The following list includes diagnoses and symptoms of possible TEs and TEEs that could be 
expected to be reported:  
Acute myocardial infarction  
Increased heart enzymes*  
Electrocardiogram signs of myocardial infarction*  
Angina pectoris*  
Acute coronary syndrome*

Sudden chest pain getting worse with a deep breath, coughing, or chest movement* Cyanosis*  
Thrombophlebitis  
Infusion site thrombosis  
* Possible sign or symptom of TEE  
** M ay be outcome of TEE  
To determine/confirm a TE or TEE the following adjudicators will be involved:  
Adjudicator 1 (Investigator)  
On the corresponding safety reporting form of the CRF, the Investigator is specifically asked if the reported event is a TE or TEE in his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
Adjudicator 2 (Octapharma Central Drug Safety Unit, CDSU)  
Once a TEE/TE is recorded on the CRF, the event will be forwarded to Octapharma's Drug Safety Unit who will process the TEE/TE in routine manner (including assessments of expectedness, causality, seriousness, TEE/TE classification of event).  
Adjudicator 3 (Independent Data Monitoring Committee, IDMC)  
The IDMC will receive anonymized case reports and/or lists of all reported adverse reactions. Serious cases, probably or possibl y related and suspected TEEs/TEs (as determined by 
[CONTACT_482021] 1 and/or Adjudicator 2) will be reviewed on an ad -hoc basis; other cases like 
ADRs and not related SAEs will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. The IDMC will then vote on all new cases (simple m ajority), record their judgment and return their decisions back to 
data management.  
In case, the adjudicators disagree, the following scheme will be applied ( Table  1):

7.3.5 Laboratory Tests  
[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of Blood Group 
The blood type will be clarified at Screening for determination of the patient’s ABO blood 
group type compatibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy testing will be done pre -infusion for females ≥ 11 years old or of childbearing 
potential  (if younger than 11 years old) . Females must have a negative pregnancy test in order 
to be in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Parameters2 
The following laboratory parameters ( Table 2 ) will be tested to assess renal, hematologic and 
metabolic function. These tests must be drawn within a maximum of [ADDRESS_619071] infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481992] 60 minutes before the start of subsequent infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], as well as within 30 to 60 minutes after each infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481993].  If the patient requires priming of the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) circuit 
with plasma, the post -infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481957] 30- 60 minutes after reversal

For all infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], the TEG sample results should be recorded if testing is performed 
(e.g., when evaluating a potential hyperfi brinolytic event, or other clinical reason for testing).  
The parameters to be recorded are: reaction time (R -time), time from the end of R until the 
clot reaches 20 mm (K -time), slope between R and K (alpha angle), maximum amplitude of 
clot strength (MA),  and EPL at [ADDRESS_619072] results should be recorded if testing is per formed (e.g., when evaluating a potential hyperfibrinolytic event, or other 
clinical reason for testing). The following ROTEM test parameters (EXTEM) will be recorded: clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle, Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF),  and ML at 30 minutes
. 
Please be aware that is sufficient to either assess kaolin TEG or ROTEM EXTEM samples.  
 
In cases where the maximum blood volume drawn for lab testing becomes an issue, it is at the 
investigator’s discre tion to determine which laboratory assessments he/she sees most 
necessary to be done with this limited amount of blood volume based on the best interest of the patients care. If the laboratory testing is being drawn strictly for the study, and no other laboratory testing is needed to manage the patient clinically at the time of the sampling then 
this is the general order of importance for this trial:  TEG/ROTEM, INR, PT, aPTT, Ionized 
Ca, Chem 7, CBC.  In situations where lab tests are omitted due to maximu m blood volume 
restrictions per protocol, an explanation should be added to the source notes and eCRF describing this.  
The investigator classifies any result that is not within its respective normal result range as either clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS). Medical judgement is 
required. For example, the investigator may not classify an abnormal result as CS unless it exceeds a certain level or appears in conjunction with other observations. An abnormal lab 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016  
 
 Page 40 of 55 value should be deeme d clinically significant by [CONTACT_482022]: 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is new or has worsened 
from baseline  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires additional active management, e.g., change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow -
up assessments, of further diagnostic investigation. 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated 
and followed- up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is 
available.  
7.3.6 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
At Screening, a physical examination will be performed.  
A physical examination will be performed in accordance wit h the site’s routine procedures. 
This may include examination of dermatological and lymphatic system, HEENT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal system, and neurological system . 
Vital signs will include heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, arterial saturation, and blood 
pressure assessment. Vitals should be assessed within a maximum of [ADDRESS_619073]
 infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481992] 60 minutes before the start of subsequent infusion 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , as well as within 30 to 60 minutes after each infusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_481994]. If multiple vital sign assessments are taken before and/or after the infusion, the vital signs that are assessed closest before the start and after the end of ea ch infusion should 
be recorded.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_619074] study related safety reports : Any ADR which occurs after the completion of the study 
should be reported by [CONTACT_737]. The usual procedure for reporting post marketing safety information should be followed, but relation to the clinical study should be stated on 
the report.  
If the Investigator becomes aware that a patient has died within four (4) weeks after the last IMP administration, this should be reported as well, without being considered treatment related or not.  
Pregnancies
: Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP.  
Pregnancies occurring during the study (fetal exposure to the IMP) need to be reported.  
In case of pregnancy during the study, the Investigator is asked to complete the pregnancy notification form and to send it (by [CONTACT_6791]) to the CPM / designee.  
Follow -up information on the outcome of both mother and fetus will be requested by a 
Sponsor representative.  
Overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse and medication error:  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as an ADR or, if the reaction fulfils one of the criteria for seriousness, as a SADR. 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016  
 
 Page 41 of 55 Drug overdose : An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a tr eatment at a 
dose higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose 
and of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose. Due to the study design, no overdose is expected. 
Interaction : A dru g interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product affects 
the activity of an IMP, i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be clearly identifi ed as drug 
interaction.  
Abuse : An abuse is the deliberate use of a medicinal product that may lead to addiction 
accompanied by [CONTACT_3584]. This is not relevant for the IMP but may be applicable for concomitant medications. 
Misuse: Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside its 
described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label -use). The 
reaction must be clearly identified as misuse.  
Medication error : Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use 
of a medicinal product which may be caused by [CONTACT_151814], presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging and instructions for use/labeling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a 
medication error.

8.1 Documentation of Data 
Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all the information related to clinical findings, observations, or other activities in the study, written down in original records or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_481995].  
The Investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or patient files for each patient enrolled). Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time required by [CONTACT_427]. 
For each patient  enrolled, the Investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the patient 
participates in this study.  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC/IRB review(s) and 
regulatory inspection(s), by [CONTACT_20618]/records.  
Case Report Forms  
The Sponsor will provide the CRFs in electronic format. They will be reviewed against source 
documentation at each monitoring visit. The Investigator should allocate sufficient time and space for the review and correction process.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016  
 
 Page 42 of 55 For each patient enrolled, an electronic CRF (eCRF) will be completed within the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system and approved by [CONTACT_222565]-investigator.  
Study site staff (e.g., research nurse) will be respon sible for entering all of the patient data 
into the validated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and study specific eCRFs prior to receiving access to the live database for data entry, as defined in applicable SOPs. The site i s also provided with the approved eCRF Completion Guidelines 
which will assist in data entry and data issues/questions. The site will be notified once the database is active to begin data entry. Additional site training may be provided as refreshers throug hout the study, if needed. All persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data must 
appear on the delegation of authority log.  
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during the data review process, discrepancies will be generated programmatically within the EDC  system, and ‘manual’ queries will be generated 
by [CONTACT_5640] a monitor or Data Management. The programmed checks fire automatically once an eCRF page is saved within the system. The output of the programmed checks is referred to as ‘discrepancies’. Discrepancies are generated by [CONTACT_482023]. The purpose of these objects is to clarify the use, context, or insertion of illogical or missing data with the site or designee.  
All discrepancies (programmed and manual) will be submitted to the site  personnel or monitor 
for the site within the EDC system. Once the site responds to a discrepancy, Data Management or the monitor will review the new or changed data to ensure an appropriate response and close the discrepancy within the system. The Investi gator should ensure the 
accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data reported to the Sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports.  
Changes to Case Report Form Data  
Errors occurring in the EDC system can only be corrected by [CONTACT_737](s) or other site personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the entire study period. If data is changed as a result of a query, a comment must be supplied within the query’s text, stating the reason for the change, prior to closing. The stud y monitor should provide guidance to 
investigators and the investigators’ designated representatives on making such corrections. In addition, any changes to a previously saved eCRF page that has not had a query generated will need to have a reason specified for the data change. This is handled within the EDC system and relevant prompts appear once any changes are made.  
Once queries have been resolved by [CONTACT_7893], the resolutions are assessed by [CONTACT_482024]. If the query response provided 
confirms the data as correct, the discrepancy will be closed based on the query response. If the response does not adequately address the question raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks ar e performed and programs are run throughout the study until the data is 
clean and the database is ready for lock. All discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock. There will be a final run of the programmed checks to ensure all discrepancies are closed out, SDV will be confirmed as complete by [CONTACT_2037], and all eCRFs will be approved by [CONTACT_230331]. 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version [ADDRESS_619076] be inserted, dated and initialed/authorized by 
[CONTACT_54101]. If reason for the change is not obvious, then a reason should be given. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_294214], at a minimum, sign the final CRF page to attest to the accuracy  
and completeness of all the data. Once the data have been entered into the database, they will be checked and any discrepancies will be raised and returned to the Investigator for resolution. Data will be monitored and tabulated in accordance with the Dat a Management 
Plan.  
8.2 Information of Investigators  
An IB will be handed out to the Investigator before the start of the study. This IB contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the Investigator to be fully and accurately informed abou t the safety of the IMP under evaluation and the respective benefit -
risk ratio.  
The IB will be updated by [CONTACT_482025].  
The Investigator will be kept informed of important  data that relate to the safe use of the IMP 
as the study proceeds.  
8.[ADDRESS_619077] of appropriately qual ified persons to whom 
he/she has delegated significant study -related duties.  
The Investigator may authorize site staff (e.g., sub -investigators, nurses) to enter study data 
into the CRF. This must be documented in the “Delegation of Authority Log“, filled in and signed by [CONTACT_301297].  
8.4 Investigator’s Site File  
At each study site, the Investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as required by [CONTACT_482026] (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_18280], study approval letters, all original 
informed consent forms, site copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining to the study, etc.) should be filed accurately and kept by [CONTACT_222569].  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential patient identification code list, which provides the unique link between named source records and CRF dat a for the Sponsor. 
The Investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for the maximum period of time required by [CONTACT_427].  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Should the Investigator elect to assign the study documents to another party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version [ADDRESS_619078], the Investigator will supply the Sponsor wit h additional data relating to the study, 
or copi[INVESTIGATOR_22936], ensuring that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained. 
This is particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are encountered. In case of particular issues or governmental queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
8.6 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  
An IDMC will be established by [CONTACT_1034]. The IDMC will be composed of recognized experts in the field of hematology, transfusion medicine, immunology, pediatric surgery and/or pediatric critical care who are not actively recruiting patients.  
The IDMC w ill review relevant quarterly safety line listings and SADR narratives 
periodically during the study and will give advice on the continuation, modification or termination of the study. A study specific Standard Operating Procedure will define in detail the composition, responsibilities and procedures of the IDMC.  
[ADDRESS_619079] Research Organization (CRO). All Octapharma procedures and policies 
have to be met by [CONTACT_222570]. Discrepancies or exceptions are to be approved by [CONTACT_1034]'s Manager of Biometrics.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
A total of 50 pediatric patients are planned to be treated . The following number of pat ients is 
planned to be enrolled:  
1. Neonates/Infants (0- 2 years): a maximum of 33 patients  
2. Children > 2 years and ≤ 16 years: a minimum of [ADDRESS_619080] such as particular types of surgeries, 
relevant concomitant medications, or Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) covering a noticeable number of events. The occurrences of all specific safety events will be presented for all these categories and in total, together with the associated 95% confidence intervals.  
To account for the abovementioned diversity in the study population, individual patient profiles or tabulations will be generated, displaying the baseline characteris tics as well as all 
interventions, treatment details and measurements on a time scale. This will facilitate the review of each individual course of treatment by [CONTACT_482027].  
Hemostatic parameters will be presented descriptively per time point, including shift tables. Individual courses of hemostatic parameters will be presented graphically as Trellis plots.  
Vital sign measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086], including shift tables. 
All measurements outside age -specific thresholds will be listed and reviewed individually.  
All safety laboratory data – absolute values as well as changes from baseline – will be 
presented descriptively per time point. All measurements outside age -specific thresholds will 
be listed and reviewed individually.  
All data will be presented in total as well as in sub –groups reflecting age  (≤ and > 2 years 
respectively) , gender, underlying diagnosis, surgical procedures performed and/or most 
relevant medical history and concomitant medications. 
Population for Analysis  
The Safety (SAF) population will include all patients who received at least one infusion of 
Octaplas.  
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined according to the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle and will 
include all patients of the SAF with any measurements on the primary endpoint variables (monitored for ADRs, hemostatic parameters, safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, etc.).  
Patients who are consented (enrolled) to participate prior to an operative procedure and then did not get transfused will not be included in the ITT analysis.  
The per -protocol (PP) population will include all patients who have complete d the infusion 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865](s) and the final examination without major protocol deviations, which may have an 
impact on the evaluation of the primary study outcome parameter(s). Examples of protocol deviations to be considered in this respect would be dosing er rors, the use of prohibited 
concomitant medications, or the occurrence of completely unrelated medical events that 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 9 
No. LAS -212 19-Nov-2016  
 
 Page 46 of 55 require an interruption of the study procedures. The final decision regarding 
inclusion/exclusion of patients from the analysis sets will be taken by a panel including the CPM, the study statistician and a medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_74964] a data review meeting before database lock. The decisions taken will be based on a review of complete data listings, and documented before the database is locked and the analysis is performed.  
Efficacy Analysis Plan  
The analysis of the efficacy parameters will be performed for the ITT and PP populations.  
Hemostatic parameters will be presented descriptively per time point, including shift tables. Individual courses of hem ostatic parameters will be presented graphically as Trellis plots.  
Adjustments for Covariates  
Adjustments for covariates will be discussed in the SAP. 
Data Presentation In addition to the sampling statistics of the measurements, graphs showing the time profiles at 
the individual patient and group mean levels will be presented.  
Safety Analysis Plan  
The analysis of the safety parameters will be performed for the SAF population. 
The occurrence of SAEs, ADRs, TEs, TEEs and significant hyperfibrinolytic event s will be 
reported. All these events will be characterized and analyzed by [CONTACT_482028], 
seriousness, severity, relation to study drug and timely relationship to study drug administration. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for hyperfibrinolytic e vents in patients 
who undergo liver transplant. 
All safety laboratory data – absolute values as well as changes from baseline – will be 
presented descriptively per time point. All measurements outside age -specific thresholds will 
be listed and reviewed individually.  
All data will be presented in total as well as in sub –groups reflecting age  (≤ and > 2years) , 
gender, underlying diagnosis, surgical procedures performed and/or most relevant medical history and concomitant medications.

Rev. 02-11-2015 1.0  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
1.1 Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Based on two randomized studies performed in the 1980s and 1990s (1, 2), chemotherapy followed 
by [INVESTIGATOR_92052]-field radiation therapy has become a standard treatment for patients with early -stage diffuse 
large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In these studi es, chemotherapy consisted of CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). Radiation therapy (RT) consisted of 30 
Gy in the ECOG study (1)  after eight cycles of CHOP and 40-55 Gy in the SWOG study (2)  after 3 
cycles of CHOP. Our practice at Duke, which is consistent with guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_772286], is to treat patients who achieve a complete response after 4 to 6 cycles 
of chemotherapy with radiation therapy, 30 Gy, to originally involved sites.  
 Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with stage III -IV DLBCL, and t he role of 
consolidation RT is not well defined. Retrospective studies evaluating the role of RT are conflicting (3, 4). The only randomized phase III trial is the one carried out by [CONTACT_772287]. This study demonstrated 
improved event -free survival and overall survival for patients with stage IV DLBCL who received 
radiation therapy to original sites of bulky disease after achieving a complete response to chemotherapy 
(5). Currently, we do consolidate with radiation therapy selected patients with advanced DLBCL with 
radiation therapy who achieve CR with chemothera py. These patients are generally treated to all sites of 
original disease if practical (as opposed to just bulky sites).  
While CHOP is the most common regimen used for DLBCL, other regimens have been found to be 
equally effective (6) . At Du ke, the vast majority of patients are treated with rituximab and CHOP (R -
CHOP), though other regimens are occasionally employed based on medical comorbidities and side 
effect profile.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1060124] evaluated CHOP versus R -CHOP showing a 
significant improvement in both progression-free survival and overall survival with the addition of rituximab (7, 8) . As a result of more effective chemotherapy regimens, a lower dose of consolidation 
radiation therapy than has previously been studied may be effective.  
 
1.3 PET Assessment after Chemotherapy  
 Positron emission tomography (PET) scans have become standard in lymphoma management to both 
assess di sease extent at diagnosis as well as evaluate response to therapy. Patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone who have not achieved a complete response by [CONTACT_772288] a negative post -chemotherapy PET (9-11) . A positive PET is 
also associated with an increased risk of local failure after chemotherapy and consolidation RT. In a 
study from Duke, patients with a positive post -chemotherapy PET were at higher risk of in-field failure 
compared with patients with a negative post -chemotherapy PET after administration of consolidation 
RT(12). Four -year in -field control was 97% with a negative PET versus 81% with a positive PET 
(p<0.01). The median RT  dose was [ADDRESS_1060125] not had 
an optimal response to chemotherapy and are at increased incidence of disease relapse after a combined modality regimen. These patients may require a higher dose of consolidation radiation therapy and 
would not be candidates for this study.  PET interpretations be standardized based on the Deauville 
Criteria. In the setting of combined modality therapy, a Deauville score of 1-3 is currently considered 
negative and a Deauville score of 4-5 is currently  considered positive.

Rev. 02-11-2015  
1.4 Risk of In -field Failure after Combined Modality Therapy  
 In-field failure (disease recurrence within the radiation field) is rare after combined modality 
therapy. In three large randomized trials, crude in-field failure rates after CHOP and radiation therapy (30 to 40 Gy) ranged between 4% and 7% (1, 13, 14) . In these studies, rituximab was not administered 
and PET scans wer e not used to assess response to chemotherapy prior to consolidation RT.  
 
1.5 Rationale for Radiation Therapy Dose Reduction 
 There are no prospective studies in DLBCL guiding the appropriate dose that should be used after 
effective chemotherapy. In Hodgkins lymphoma, the German Hodgkin Study Group HD10 recently 
demonstrated that 20 Gy was as effective as 30 Gy after 2 -4 cycles of ABVD in patients with early-
stage, favorable disease (ASH 2009).  The risk of complications related to radiation therapy, including cardiac disease and secondary cancers, appear to be related to both dose (15)  and volume (15, 16) . If the 
dose and volume of radiation therapy can be reduced, while maintaining high rates of disease control, this would undoubtedly decrease the risk of side effects and long-term risks.  
 1.6 Rationale for Radiation Therapy Field Reduction 
 There is no consensus as to the optimal RT fi eld size for patients with DLBCL. Many institutions 
follow the pattern used for Hodgkins lymphoma, namely treating an involved field (i.e., a region as 
opposed to true anatomic extent of disease) (17) .  However, several coope rative groups and institutions 
currently treat only originally involved sites (as opposed to regions). For example, in a retrospective 
analysis from the University of British Columbia of patients treated with combined modality therapy for DLBCL (3 cycles of CHOP +/ - rituximab), the local control rate was equivalent between involved field 
and involved node treatment volumes (18) . Only 2% of patients developed a marginal recurrence, 
defined as a recurrence outside the involved nodal field but within what would have been encompassed with an involved field. The same group has recently reported similar findings for Hodgkin’s Disease (19). In this study, we will treat the original anatomical extent of disease and not attempt to treat sites 
which were not clinically involved at diagnosis. The hypothesis being, that chemotherapy can successfully eradicate microscopic disease, and consolidation RT will be utilized to help control gross disease.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1060126] -chemotherapy PET scan 
following 4 to 6 cycles of rituximab containing chemotherapy,  will be associated with a low risk of in-field failure. The goal of this approach is to maintain excellent control rates while minimizing the risk of 
acute and late toxicity.  
  
2.1 Hypothesis  
Hypothesis - After more effective systemic therapy (employing rituximab), with confirmation of optimal 
response to chemotherapy(Deauville score of 1-[ADDRESS_1060127] -chemotherapy (or interim) PET scan), the RT 
dose and treatment volume can be safely reduced from 30 Gy to 20 Gy while maintaining high rates of local control.

radiation oncologists listed as Key Personnel for this study and who have completed the required ethics 
training may enroll patients on this study. The patient’s primary medical oncologist will be apprised of the patient’s intent to participate in the study. Following verification of eligibility the patient will be assigned a sequential study ID number.  
 
8.0  TREATMENT  
8.1 Radiation Therapy   
Radiation therapy is to be initiated no sooner than 3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. It is 
strongly recommended that radiation therapy start within 8 weeks of t he final cycle of chemotherap y. 
 
Equipment  
All patients will be treated using conventional or three -dimensional techniques (preferred) or intensity-
modulated radiation therapy via a linear accelerator using photon energies of 6 and/or [ADDRESS_1060132].  
 
Target Volume  
Stage I -II disease - The clinical target volume (CTV) will include the original extent of disease plus a 
margin of 0-[ADDRESS_1060133] -chemotherapy width will be 
contoured as target (to protect critical structures such as lung and kidney). The CTV will be expanded by 5-10 mm to account for dai ly set -up error and/or target motion (such as the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-induced 
movement of the hilum). The PTV will be expanded by 5-8 mm to account for beam penumbra when three -dimensional techniques are utilized.  
 Stage III-IV- Treatment volumes for patients with advanced DLBCL will be individualized based on the 
clinical presentation. When feasible, consolidation of all sites originally involved is encouraged. However, consolidation of only certain sites (such as sites of bulky disease) will be acceptable.  
 
Tre at ment  
Patients will be set up daily using on-board imaging or weekly/biweekly MV portal films. Radiation will 
be given with 5 fractions per week. Patients will be treated with 1.5 to 2 Gy fractions to a total dose of 18 to 20 Gy. Treatment to subportions of  the target volume can be reduced if critical normal structures 
are in close proximity (i.e. limiting the dose to 18 Gy to the kidneys).  
 Treatment Interruptions during RT  
Treatment breaks due to RT -induced toxicity are expected to be rare. To be eligible for study 
participation, subjects must have a baseline ANC ≥ 1000. It is very rare for patients who

11.0  PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT and DATA COLLECTION   
This study will be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal regulations  and radiation therapy 
standards. Data will be entered in the study specific database within a timely manner.  
 
12.0 RISKS/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
Radiation therapy is a standard treatment modality for patients with DLBCL. The risks of treatment are 
expected to be less since a lower dose of RT will be employed. It is possible that 20 Gy is insufficient which may increase the risk of disease recurrence which may necessitate further treatment. With smaller 
RT doses, it is expected that both acute and long-term toxicity will be less.

well as follow -up examinations will be billed to the patient or their insurance carrier.  
 14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Statistical Analysis of Primary Objective  
This trial will accrue 62 patients over a time period of approximately 5-6 years. The primary objective is 
to determine whether the observed  5-year LC rate, estimated from the Kaplan -Meier curve of time-to -
local failure, is as high as that observed in historical controls, i.e., 0.90. Time -to-local -failure is defined 
as time from on -study to time of local failure; deaths are censored; distant failures are ignored (i.e., we 
will continue to follow for local failure after observing a distant failure). The lower 90% confidence bound of the 5-year LC rate will be calculated, and if the lower 90% bound is ≥ 0.84, the study will be 
considered a success. This decision rule is equivalent to requiring that the observed 5-year LC rate be ≥ 
0.90. If the true 5-year LC rate is 0.84 (0.94), there is 7% (87%) probability that the lower bound will be ≥ 0.84. These probabilities (7% and 87%) are the alpha (one -sided) and power, respectively, for the null 
hypothesis that the 5-year LC rate is ≤ 0.84 and the alternative hypothesis that the 5-year LC rate is ≥ 0.94.  The expected number of events in this study assuming each of these distributions is 15.[ADDRESS_1060138] analysis will be done after 45 person-years (PY) of follow -up have accumulated (at about year 3). We will also perform a 
second interim analysis if the trial is accruing slower than anticipated, after 185 person-years of follow -
up. These interim analyses will assess whether the cumulative incidence of LC (i.e., the number of 
events divided by [CONTACT_772290] -up) exceeds the values shown in the table below. If the 
cumulative incidence is “too high,” the trial will stop. The probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_772285].

 Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from on-study to disease progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  Overall survival will be defined as the time from on-study to death due to any case.  Both distributions wi ll be estimated with the Kaplan -Meier method.  The 
5-year PFS rate and the 5 -year overall survival rate will be give with their 80% confidence intervals.  
 
Statistical Analysis of Secondary Objective 2  
To examine the patterns of failure, we will tabulate t he various ways that patients failed up until the time 
of the analysis.  For example, these ways will include local only, local + distant, and distant only.

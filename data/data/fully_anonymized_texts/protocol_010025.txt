Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441151] instruction in footnote 6 in the schedule of events for the 
control/delayed- treatment subjects was included in previous versions of 
this protocol. The footnote incorrectly stated that IOH photos should only 
be taken at Visit C1 -a (8 weeks after screening), if the screening photos 
were deemed unsatisfactory. In fact, all subjects in the control/delayed -
treatment group should have IOH photos taken at Screening and Visit C1-a, as outlined in other sections of the protocol. The issue was noted afte r all 
control/delayed- treatment subjects had completed the affected Visit C1 -a 
and for the majority of control/delayed -treatment subjects, no photo had 
been taken  at Visit C1 -a. T
he following changes to the planned IPR 
assessments, and statistical analyses were therefore included in this 
protocol amendment: 
•Updated timepoints of photos used for IPR assessment in Section7.2.1.3 Other Effectiveness Endpoints and Section [IP_ADDRESS] MerzInfraorbital Hollow Assessment Scale (MIHAS) . For subjects in
the control/delayed treatment group, photos from Screening, 8weeks post -screening and [ADDRESS_441152]  injection will be
included in the IPR assessment.
•Adapted the analyses of IPR assessment data to the change intimepoints of photos used in the assessment. For subj ects in the
control/delayed-treatment group, summaries will be provided for
[ADDRESS_441153] injection , using the
screening photo as reference .
•Reference to pre- treatment photos taken at the delayed treatment
baseline were removed from the definition and analysis
descriptions for the GAIS endpoints.
In Section 11.[ADDRESS_441154] screening for the control/delayed treatment 
subjects, was corrected.  
Minor fo rmatting errors and wording changes were implemented.  
Version 4.0, 27-
JAN-2021 •Updated safety email address  and removal of fax number  (Section
12.2.2)
•Increased the maximum enrollment per site from 24 to 26  (Sections
8.1, 9.1, 13.1)
•Updated internal functional contributors (Section 16.5)
Version 3.0, 20-JUL-2020 In order to address the agency’s (FDA) concerns regarding changes in 
visual function assessments that may occur immediately after treatment,

All required approvals, favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], or additional requirements of the appropriate 
Independent E thics Committee  (IEC), Institutional Review Board  (IRB) , or other 
regulatory authority will be obtained prior to initiation of the trial.  
The investigator and all study personnel will conduct the study in compliance with this protocol. The investigator will ensure that all personnel involved in the conduc t of this 
study are qualified to perform the assigned study responsibilities. Investigators will adhere to all applicable study reporting requirements. 
In the event  of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), procedures that prioritize the reporting of protocol deviations that could 
impact subject safety will be defined and communicated to the appropriate IEC/IRB. 
In addition, changes in protocol conduct necessary to ensure subject safety, such as 
conducting telephone or virtual visits for safety monitoring rather than on- site visits, can 
be implemented immediately with subsequent review by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and notification to 
regulatory authorities.

• The IEC/IRB a pproved, updated subject information sheet and consent form will 
be provided by e- mail, mail, or courier to obtain a re-consent. 
• All instances of consent that is obtained through alternative way s will be 
documented. 
The subjects’ understanding will be re -confirmed through regular  consent procedures at 
the earliest opportunity when/if the subjects are able to return to the sites, if applicable.

M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441178] deformity may develop in the under -eye area; this hollowing 
of the infraorbital region results  in a fatigued and  aged appearance on the face. While many 
anatomical and physiological factors must be considered as contributing to infraorbital 
hollowing, subjects with an inherent level of volume loss may benefit from dermal -filler 
augmentation. However, t reating the infraorbital hollow ( IOH)  may present challenges , 
and only a few fillers are suitable for this area.  
To address the aforementioned issues, the objectives of this study will be to demonstrate 
the effectiveness and safety of Belotero Balance® (+) Lidocaine (BBL)  injection for the 
treatment of volume loss in the infraorbital hollow area in a scientifically robust and adequately powered pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. 
6.2 Potential Benefits and Risks 
The potential benefit of BBL  is the correction of volume loss in the IOH  area.  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_354188]  (M930121001; A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_354189]) , the majority of treated subjects achieved at least  1-point improvement 
on the Merz Infraorbital Hollow Assessment Scale ( MIHAS ) at Week 8  (81.6% of treated 
subjects ; p < 0.0001) . The findings also demonstrated aesthetically pleasing outcomes with 
strong agreement between the blinded MIHAS evaluators and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale ( GAIS ) assessments completed by [CONTACT_354206]. FACE -Q
™ asses sments assessing satisfaction with eyes and lower eyelids  
improved over time after injection with Belotero Balance . Additionally, treated subjects 
reported looking younger after treatment when compared to untreated subjects. 
The following are AEs that have  been reported during post -approval use  of Belotero 
Balance1 : allergic reactions including Quincke’s edema, anaphylaxis, rash, hives, necrosis, 
inflammation, granuloma, indurations, papule/nodule, hematoma, Tyndall effect, 
bumps/lumps, pustule, scabbing/scarring, swelling/edema, erythema/redness, pain, bruising, discoloration, infection, migration/displacement, asymmetry, numbness, itching/pruritus, vascular occlusion, and visual disturbance.  
 
1 Belotero Balance (BB)  and Belotero B alance (+) Lidocaine (BBL) are the same formulation with the 
exception that lidocaine hydrochloride is added to the BBL formulation. Belotero Balance has been 
commercially available in the US since [ADDRESS_441179] -approval use.

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 33 of 111 [IP_ADDRESS]  Provision of Care for Subjects after Study Discontinuation  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the adequate and safe medical care of subjects 
during the study. After study discontinuation, the sponsor will follow all applicable local regulations and guidelines with regard to a subject’s  follow- up care. The investigator will 
ensure that appropriate consideration is given to a subject’s post-study care. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_441205]  of this study that may warrant the cessation of the 
study, such action may be taken. Prior to such action, consultation between the sponsor, the investigator, and, as appropriate, the FDA and/or local regulatory authorities will occur.  
In the case of a reported  vascular embolic event leading to skin necrosis, vision loss, or 
stroke, enrollment and treatment at the investigational site will be  suspended and a 
root- cause investigation will be conducted to determine the cause  and whether the outcome 
was anticipated (the investigator did not properly follow the treatment instructions ) or 
unanticipated (the investigator  did properly follow the treatment instructions) . 
The investigator and the sponsor will conduct a thorough evaluation of the event. If the  
evaluation reveals the outcome was unanticipated , the entire study will be immediately 
suspended, and no subjects will be enrolled or treated until the event can be properly 
characterized and an appropriate treatment strategy to avoid this unanticipated event can 
be devised. 
Reasons for the premature suspension or termination of the study include, but are not 
limited to:  
• Determination of a potential safety risk to subjects; 
• Inadequate subject enrollment; 
• Decision by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB to suspend or terminate approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_354191]; and/or 
• Sponsor decision. 
In the event of a public health emergency , the sponsor will inform all investigators, the 
IEC/IRB, and the relevant regulatory authorities promptly of any planned mitigations to protect the safety and well -being of subjects. This can include but is not limited to: putting 
the study recruitment on hold, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_354192] , or changing 
on-site visits to visits by  [CONTACT_354209] ( e.g., if the primary site is closed 
due to quarantine). 
In the event of premature study suspension or termination for safety reasons, the sponsor 
will inform all investigators and relevant regulatory authorities promptly  of the study 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 34 of 111 suspension/termination and reason for the action. The investigator will conduct site -closure 
activities in accordance with all applicable sponsor and local/international guidelines and 
regulations. 
9.2.8  Study Site Discontinuation 
Study participation by [CONTACT_354210]  9.2.7. Additional reasons for the premature discontinuation of 
study sites include, but are not limited to : 
• Investigator request;  
• Serious or persistent noncompliance with the protocol, local regulations, and/or GCP; 
• Failure to accrue subjects at an acceptable rate;  and/or 
• Ethical issues . 
In the event  of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), it might not be feasible for a study site to continue study participation. In this 
scenario , consideration should be made as to whether the trial site closure would affect the 
safety and well -being of participating subjects. Additionally, consideration should be made 
around impact and maintenance of data validity. 
In the event of study- site discontinuation, the sponsor will provide to the study site written 
notification documenting the  reason for discontinuation. The investigator will conduct 
site-closure activities in accordance with all applicable sponsor and local guidelines and 
regulations.

 Preparation of the Injection Region  
• Any makeup in the IOH area should be removed. 
• As with all transcutaneous procedures, BBL  injection carries a risk of infection and 
should be conducted with aseptic technique. 
• Only topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], at the preference of the treating physician, or ice may be 
applied. Any medication or therapy must be recorded in the e CRF.  
 Depth of Injection and Injection Technique  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.[ADDRESS_441218] be used to avoid intravascular injection regardless of technique used. 
2. In general, when the introductory needle and then cannula are inserted, both will be 
parallel to the skin at an approximate angle of 30° or less. BBL  will be placed at the 
junction of the lower eyelid and midface , along the inferior orbital rim in the 
supraperiosteal plane. The injection should be performed with a constant , 
low-to-moderate pressure on the plunger, while slowly and gradually withdrawing the 
cannula. Slight elevation of the skin should be observed without significant blanc hing 
of the skin. To avoid visible lumps and/or discoloration, avoid injection of BBL  
superficially when removing the cannula. When the injection is complete, the site may be gently massaged, if necessary .

 Additional injection information  
• If blanching occurs, the injection should be stopped and the area massaged until it returns to a normal color. Blanching may be a sign of a vascular  occlusion. If normal 
skin coloring does not return, do not continue with the injection. Treat in accordance with the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery guidelines, which includ e 
possible hyaluronidase injection.[1]  
• Correct to the desired volume effect. Do not overcorrect. The degree and duration of the correction depend on the character of the defect treated, the tissue stress at the implant site, the depth of the implant in the tissue, and the injection technique. Markedly indurated defects may be difficult to correct.  
• Follow national, local, or institutional guidelines for use and disposal of medical sharp devices. To help avoid needle or cannula breakage, do not attempt to straighten a bent needle or can nula. Discard it and complete the procedure with a replacement needle 
from the clinical supply. Do not re cap used needles and cannulas. Recappi[INVESTIGATOR_354194] a hazardous practice and should be avoided. Discard unshielded needles and cannulas in approved sharps containers. 
 Post- Treatment Care/Pain Management  
• To manage post- injection  pain, ice may be applied , as needed . 
• Acetaminophen may be taken if instructed by [CONTACT_12707] . Any medication 
or therapy used by [CONTACT_354212] e CRF.  
• The following information should be shared with subjects : 
o Within the first 24 hours, subjects should avoid lower eyelid makeup, strenuous exercise, extensive sun, or heat exposure, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_855]- steroidal

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 45 of 111 The following components are supplied for the injection procedure: 
• BBL  box containing one sterile 1- mL prefilled glass syringe of BBL  with two 27G ½” 
or 30G ½” needles. 
o More than one BBL  box may be used depending on injection volume. 
o Use only the 27G ½” needles provided. 
o If subject is randomized to cannula, these needles should not be used . 
• A peel -off subject  label, indicating product, to be placed in the source documents. 
• A separate bulk supply of 27G 40 millimeter (mm) blunt -tipped cannula , with a 25G 
introductory needle, will be provided for the cannula- injection procedure. 
In the event  of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), considerations may be made to supply study sites  with sufficient study 
supplies to avoid interruptions to the supply chain for the investigational product during 
the outbreak. 
10.8 Receipt, Storage, Dispensing, and R eturn/ Disposal  
Upon receipt, site personnel will verify the contents of all study supplies received and 
promptly notify the appropriate contacts of any discrepancies or damages. The investigator is responsible for ensuring an accurate record of inventory is maintained. The investigator 
will keep a current record of the study- product delivery to the study site, inventory, and 
dispensing, and this record will be made available to the sponsor upon request. Study sites will be queried about any discrepancies.  
All study devices must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, monitored area , 
in accordance with the labeled storage conditions. 
Only authorized study personnel may supply, dispense, and/or  administer study treatment, 
and only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment. The investigator is 
responsible for maintaining a current, accurate record of all study-treatment dispensation. 
Any used syringes of investigational device and needles  or cannulas  should be discarded 
per the appropriate handling and disposal procedures at the site. Any unopened product, 
needles,  cannulas,  and/or outer packaging of used kits should be retained so the monitor 
can perform device-accountability procedures.  
At the end of the study and after verification of study device accountability, it is the investigator’s responsibility to return all unused study supplies, as directed by [CONTACT_456]. Appropriate records of return must be maintained for accountability purposes. 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441224] be completed before the study is considered 
complete.  
10.9 Device Accountability Procedures  
The sponsor will provide the investigator with all necessary study supplies. Accountability 
for study supplies at the study site is the responsibility of the investigator. 
Access to  the IMD  will be controlled, and IMD  will be used only in the clinical 
investigation and according to the clinical study protocol. The sponsor will keep records to 
document the physical location of all IMDs  from shipment to the investigation sites until 
return or disposal. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124116], use, return, and disposal of the IMDs , which will include the 
following: 
• The date of receipt  and quantity  of units received . 
• Identification of each IMD  (batch number/serial number or unique code). 
• The expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] (if applicable).  
• The names of all persons who received, used, or disposed of each device. 
• The date(s) of use. 
• Unique s ubject identification  number. 
• Date and quantity of units returned. 
• The date of return of unused, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], or malfunctioning IMDs (if applicable).  
In the event  of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), considerations may be made to perform study- accountability procedures 
remotely and return of unused supplies may be delayed until return procedures can be 
safely performed by [CONTACT_8786].  
10.10  Treatment Compliance  
Treatment is administered by [CONTACT_941] t reating investigator and thus assessment of compliance 
is unnecessary. Potential deviations from the defined study- treatment admi nistration will 
be reported as protocol deviations. 
10.11  Duration of S tudy  
The planned duration of participation for individual subjects from baseline to the end of 
the study is 76 weeks  (± 14 days). In addition, subjects will also undergo a screening period 
up to [ADDRESS_441225] 3 days prior to  the baseline visit.

In the event  of a public health emergency the study might be halted, recruitment 
interrupted, and/or study processes and flow might  be modified, impact ing to the study 
duration and/or visit schedule depending on the study status  at the time of the event. 
Mitigations may  include, but are not limited to, extending visit windows, performing visits 
by [CONTACT_630], and/or performing eff ectiveness assessments remotely.

Eac h gr a de of t h e MI H A S is disti nct ; Gra de [ADDRESS_441230] is assessed independently on the MIHAS within this study.  
During the baseline and subsequent study visits , subjects will be evaluated live on the 
MIHAS by a trained evaluator  (i.e., a qualified healthcare practitioner delegated by [CONTACT_78017]); this evaluator is blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment and 
will perform the respecti ve assessment independently from any study staff. Prior to study 
enrollment, at least one  blinded evaluator at each site will be trained and qualified  by [CONTACT_354213] -grading assessments.  Training will consist of an 
instructional session , followed by a  qualification where blinded- evaluator trainees will 
score two sets of photographs , representing a variety of different MIHAS grades, at least 
two weeks apart. The purpose of this assessment is to obtain intra- and inter -evaluator 
reliability qualification analyses prior to starting the study at their respective site 
(i.e., weighted Kappa/ICC analyses) . Any blinded evaluator who does not successfully 
achieve an intra- and inter -rater (pair -wise against other raters) reliability point estimate 
value of ≥  0.70 will be retrained and requalified up to two times. If evaluator retention 
(e.g., change in personnel) becomes an issue during the study, new blinded evaluators must be trained by [CONTACT_456], and respective qualification analyses must be performed. Qualification and training of blinded evaluators will be documented. At each study site, all efforts should be made to plan for and maintain the same blinded evaluator for all assessments throughout the study. To account for illness or unplanned absence of the blinded evaluator, it is recommended to have at least one  back -up blinded evaluator trained 
and qualified per site. Evaluators will be re -trained on the MIHAS at regular intervals 
(approximately every 3  months at a minimum ). 
The treating investigator will also attend a MIHAS -instructional session to ensure 
understanding of the subject -eligibility criteria of right and left IOH volume deficit with a 
rating of 2 or 3 (moderate or severe) at study entry. 
Additionally, three blinded IPRs will assess subject photographs using the MIHAS.  Note: For subjects randomized to treatment, the photographs assessed will be from 
Screening or Day 1 (Visit V1a) and  [ADDRESS_441231]  injection  (Visit V3) . For subjects 
randomized to the contr ol/delayed -treatment group, the photographs assessed will be from 
Screening, Day 1 (8 weeks from the screening visit, Visit C1a) and [ADDRESS_441232] injection (Visit C3) .

 Adverse Events  (AEs)  
All AEs reported by [CONTACT_354214] -up visit will be recorded. Events will be recorded regardless 
of causality.  The period of observation for an AE extends from  when the ICF is signed 
until the subject’s last study visit. Additional information is provided in Section  12.1. 
Adverse events  will be assessed at all on -site study visits and  during follow -up telephone 
calls. 
Any medical occurrence from the time the ICF is signed is an AE and must be documented in the subject’s file and on the AE eCRF. Any AE observed will be fully investigated, documented, and followed until the event is either resolved or adequately explained, until the end of study/early termination visit. 
In this study, a ny AE of visual disturbance will be reported (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) . The 
investigator needs to  report any AE of visual disturbance within 24 hours to the sponsor  
using the Report of Visual Disturbances Form (see Section 12.7). 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs reported by [CONTACT_354214] -up visit  will be recorded. Events will be recorded regardless 
of causality. Any SAE observed will be fully investigated, documented, and followed until the SAE is resolved or a plausible explanation is available . Serious AEs occurring after the 
end of the observational period need to be reported if the investigator considers the event to be related to the IMD . Additional information is provided in Section 12.2. Serious AEs 
will be asses sed throughout the study, including on- site study visits and during follow- up 
telephone calls . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Safety Assessments  
 Visual -Function Assessments 
Although the incidence of AEs/SAEs associated with retinal artery occlusion is very low, treated subjects will u ndergo visual examinations to potentially identify ophthalmic signs 
and/or symptoms that may represent ophthalmic-artery occlusion. 
Visual -function assessments will include a visual- acuity test (using a Snellen chart), a 
confrontation- visual field test, and an ocular -motility examination. These assessments will 
be completed at screening , pre-treatment,  post- initial injection,  pre- and post -treatment for

[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_441243] has blind 
spots in his/her vision, and i f so, where the blinded spots are. The examination should be 
performed without the subject wearing glasses  (note: contacts are permitted) . To measure 
the visual field, the examiner will use the standard finger test according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. 
The subject will be asked to look directly at an object in front while covering one eye. 
The investigator or delegate will hold up different numbers of fingers in areas of the 
subject’s peripheral- vision field and ask how many  fingers  he/she sees while looking at the 
target in front. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_441244]’s range of ocular movement is intact in each 
direction of gaze. The examination should be performed without the subject wearing 
glasses  (note: contacts are permitted) . To begin, the subject should be asked to look at a 
distant object while his/her head is facing straight ahead. The subject’s head should not be 
tilted up, down or to the side. Symmetry between the eyes should be noted in primary position. T he subject should then be asked to follow the examiner’s finger without  the 
subject  moving his/her head. The examiner should use his/her index finger on either the 
right or left hand for guiding the direction  of eye movement. The investigator should move 
the index finger to the left, right, up and right, up and left, down and left, down and right, straight up and straight down. The subject should be asked to voice if he/she experiences 
double vision in any position of gaze  and/or in any of the fields. The examiner should look 
for and document any asymmetry in ocula r motility or abnormal ocular motility.

In this procedure, the treating investigator or delegate will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_354197] a non -mydriatic retinal camera system.  Note: pi[INVESTIGATOR_354198]. Subsequently, images will 
be uploaded and remotely evaluated by a specialist at a central ophthalmic imaging center. The investigational site will receive an assessment report from the central ophthalmic 
imaging center within [ADDRESS_441245] and the site -identified ophthalmology practice to arrange an immediate evaluation.

M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 64 of 111 12 SAFETY DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS 
12.1 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical sign (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device ( IMD). 
Note:  
1. This definition includes events related to the IM D. 
2. This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
3. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the IM D. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_441250]’s 
last study visit. Any untoward medical occurrence that happens between the time ICF is 
signed and the first treatment with the IMD is an AE and has to be documented in the subject’s file and on the AE eCRF. Any observed AE will be fully investigated, 
documented, and followed until the event is either resolved or adequately explained. 
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a 
procedure is considered the AE rather than the procedure itself. New AEs reported to the 
investigator during the observational period, after the last treatment with the IMD, must be documented, treated, and followed like all other AEs. 
Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with onset at or after the 
first administration of study treatment.  
Pre-existing conditions noted in the medical history should not be reported as an AE, unless 
the condition worsens or the disease reoccurs during the reporting period. To determine 
whether a condition has worsened, it is compared to the subject’s condition at screening. 
Elective treatments planned before screening, and which are documented in the subject’s 
source data, are not regarded as AEs. However, elective procedures should be postponed, if possible, until the subject completes their participation in the study.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_441251]’s spontaneous description, through investigator inquiry, or discovered in the course of examinations completed during the visit. The investigator will assess and record any AE 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441252] be recorded: 
• AE diagnosis or main symptom; 
• Location of AE: systemic or restricted to treatment area. If a local reaction, the 
corresponding area should be reported; 
• Date of onset; 
• Intensity (maximum observed; see Section  12.1.3);  
• Causal relationship (not related, related ; see Section 12.1.4);  
• Serious (yes or no); 
• Outcome (see Section  12.1.5);  
• AE leading to discontinuation of the clinical study (yes or no); 
• Action taken with medical device ; and  
• Stop date. 
In cases of a serious adverse event (defined in Section  12.2), the investigator must also 
complete an SAE Report Form and report it to the sponsor within 24 hours, as described in 
Section  12.2.2. 
12.1.3  S everity Grading for an AE  
The clinical severity  (i.e., intensity ) of an AE will be classified as:  
Mild:  Signs and symptoms that can be easily tolerated. Symptoms can be ignored and disappea r when the subject is distracted.  
Moderate:  
Signs and symptoms that cause discomfort and interfere with normal 
functioning but  are tolerable. They cannot be ignored and do not disappear 
when the subject is distracted. 
Severe:  Signs and symptoms that affect usual daily activity and incapacitate the subject, thereby [CONTACT_124138]/her daily activities. 
The investigator is requi red to grade the severity  (i.e., intensity ) of each AE.  
12.1.4  Causal Relationship of an AE with an Investigational Medical 
Device  
An AE is considered to be “related” to I MD or the treatment procedure if a causal 
relationship between the I MD or the treatment procedure the AE is at least reasonably

M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 66 of 111 possible (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out). In this case, the non -serious event is 
considered an “adverse device effect” ( Section  12.3). If the event is serious, it is a “serious 
adverse device effect” ( Section  12.4).  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Otherwise, the relationship should be considered as “not related”.  
12.1.5  Outcome Categories for an AE  
Reportable outcomes and/or sequelae of an AE may include the following: 
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving. 
• Not recovered/not resolved. 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal.  
• Unknown. 
If there is more than one AE, only the AE leading to death will be attributed with a “fatal” outcome. 
12.2 Definition of a S erious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an adverse event that:  
1. led to death; 
2. led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in: 
• a life -threatening illness or injury, or 
• a per manent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
• inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
• medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
3. led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note:  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_6205], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious  
adverse event.

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 67 of 111 12.2.1  Details of an SAE  
In cases of fatality, the cause of death is considered the AE, and the death is considered its 
outcome. In this case, the primary cause of death (i.e., the event leading to death) should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Death” will be recorded as the outcome of this 
respective event; death will not be recorded as a separate event. Only if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se  might be reported 
as an SAE. In cases of death, an autopsy report should be submitted (if available). The date and cause of death should be recorded. 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition is not considered an SAE. If a subject 
experiences an additional AE that prolongs a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], this event is 
considered an SAE and should be reported as such. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354199]’s source data are not 
regarded as SAEs.  
In addition, device deficiencies, as defined in Section 12.5, that might have led  to an SAE 
if: 
1. suitable action had not been taken, or 
2. intervention had not been made, or 
3. if circumstances had been less fortunate 
should be categorized as an SAE and reported accordingly. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_441253] be reported via telephone, or e- mail and an SAE Report Form should 
be submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Further  reporting 
details will be outlined in a separate document. 
Although all information required for completion of an SAE Report Form may not be 
available within the specified time period, an initial report should be submitted if the following minimal information is available: 
• An identifiable subject ( unique subject number); 
• A suspect product and how the treatment is related to the SAE; 
• An identifiable reporting source (investigator/study site identification); and/or  
• An event or outcome that can be identified as serious. 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441254] report SAEs to the sponsor  as defined in Section  12.2 and the site’s 
IEC/IRB per their reporting guidelines. 
Within [ADDRESS_441255] an evaluation of the SAE and report the results of such evaluation to 
regulatory agencies, IECs/IRBs, and investigators, as applicable. 
The investigator must supply further supporting information, and a detailed SAE 
description is an integral part of this supporting information. Follow- up SAE reports should 
be sent without delay to the sponsor or designee as an SAE Report Form (marked as a “follow- up” report) , and the eCRF has to be updated accordingly to avoid discrepancies . 
The SAE has to be followed until the SAE is resolved / recovered or a plausible explanation is available.  The SAE will be followed -up only in the Global Product Safety database after 
final SAE reconciliation is complete d. 
SAEs occurring after the end of the observational period would need to be reported if the investigator considers the event to be related to I MD. These reports generally will not be 
entered into the investigation database. Following database lock for the  study, any ongoing 
SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization under the responsibility of the investigator per his/her standard of care. 
The investigator should complete and send any SAE Report Forms or Pregnancy Forms 
(including any follow -up forms) to Merz North America Product Safety via the email 
provided below:

An ADE is defined as an adverse event related to the use of an I MD. 
Note:  
1. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for 
use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation or any malfunction of the IMD. 
2. This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the IM D. 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441258] (SADE) 
A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of an SAE ( Section 12.2).  
12.4.[ADDRESS_441259] 
(ASADE)  
An ASADE is a serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the current version of the risk- analysis report.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_441260] (UADE) 
A UADE is defined as follows:  
• Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), risk analysis report, or IFU. 
• Any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 70 of 111 12.6.1  Reporting and H andling of D evice Deficiencies  
All device deficiencies shall be documented and reported by [CONTACT_6206]. 
For reporting of device deficiencies: 
• For device deficiencies related to a specific subject’s treatment, a Device 
Deficiency eCRF must be completed and submitted by [CONTACT_3878], irrespective of the seriousness of the case.  
• For device deficiencies related to a specific subject’s treatment, a Device Deficiency eCRF must be completed and submitted by [CONTACT_3878], irrespective of whether the complaint led to an AE. All device deficiencies shall be documented and reported by [CONTACT_354216].  The investigator will attempt to evaluate 
if the device deficiency might have led to an AE if suitable action had not been 
taken, intervention had not been made, or circumst ances had been less fortunate.  
• If a device deficiency is associated with an SAE, the investigator must also 
complete and submit an SAE Report Form ( see Section  12.2.2) in addition to the 
Device Deficiency eCRF . SAE Report Forms should be sent to Merz Product Safety 
for processing ( see Section  12.2.2).  
• If a device deficiency is not related to a specific subject (e.g. , damaged packaging 
occurring prior to the subject’s visit), the investigator should complete a paper device deficiency form  (e.g., Device Technical Complaint Form), instead of the 
eCRF, and send to the sponsor within 24 hours to both their clinical study representative as well as to the Merz Technical Complaint Department for processing using the following email address: [EMAIL_6774]  
The investigator should retain the device or needle  or cannula  in question for future 
inspection and investigation by [CONTACT_456], if necessary.  The Merz Technical Complaint 
Department will decide  if the device or needle or cannula in question need to be returned 
and to whom they should be sent for investigation. 
12.7 Visual Safety Evaluation  
Any adverse event of visual disturbance including, but not limited to, any loss of vision, 
blurry vision, double  vision, pain in or around eye (i.e., other than typi[INVESTIGATOR_124112]-induced 
pain), blind spot or shadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes, etc. will be reported. The investigator will be instructed to report any AE of visual disturbance within [ADDRESS_441263] be re p orte d, usi n g t he Pre g na nc y

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 72 of 111 13 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section describes the statistical analyses foreseen at the time of study planning. Further 
details on the statistical and analytical aspects will be presented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be prepared and finalized prior to database close.  
Any deviations from planned analyses, the reasons for such deviation, and all alternative or additional statistical analyses will be described in amendments to the clinical study protocol a nd/or the SAP. All deviations and/or alterations will also be summarized in the 
clinical study report. 
Adequate descriptive statistics will be provided for each endpoint. Metric variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_67067], mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_354217]. Ordered categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_354218] , where appropriate . All variables will be analyzed as absolute data and as change 
from baseline, as applicable. D escriptive confidence limits (95%, two-sided) and 
descriptive p -values will be given, where appropriate. 
All data captured in the e CRF will be listed.  
In the event of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), if on- site visits are not possible due to site closures, travel limitations, or other 
considerations (e.g., if site personne l or trial subjects become infected  with SARS -CoV-2) , 
the following mitigations should be considered and assessed in an updated SAP: 
• Describe changes to planned and additional analyses due to the public health emergency. Thoroughly assess drop- out patterns  and sources of bias such as missing 
values and virtual instead of live assessments (if applicable).  
• Include systematic identification of protocol deviations due to the pandemic. 
• Consider the need for involvement of an independent Data Monitoring Committee  
particularly if trial sample size changes are anticipated.  
13.1 Randomization 
Subjects who complete all screening assessments and meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to the following four groups: 
• Group TN: Treatment with BBL with needle at baselin e; 
• Group TC: Treatment with BBL with cannula at baseline;

• For subjects of groups TN or TC, TEAEs will be grouped into two treatment cycles 
according to the AE onset date, as follows: 
o For subjects without retreatment : 
An AE  is considered treatment emergent for Cycle 1  if the start date of the AE is 
on or after the date of the initial treatment injection and before end of the study. 
o For subjects with retreatment : 
An AE  is considered treatment emergent for C ycle 1 if the start date of the AE is 
on or after the date of the initial injection and before the date of the retreatment.  
An AE is considered treatment emergent  for Cycle 2 if the start date  of AE  is on or 
after the date of the retreatment and before end of the study. 
• For subjects of groups DTN and DTC, an AE is considered treatment emergent for 
Cycle 1  if the start date is on or after the date of delayed treatment at Week  8. 
All other AEs are considered to be non- TEAEs (i.e., all AEs with start date prior to initial 
injection).  
An overall AE summary  table will be provided  by [CONTACT_354220], 
displaying the following content: 
• Any AEs ; 
• Any non- TEAEs ; 
• Any TEAEs ; 
• Any related TEAEs ; 
• Any TES AEs; 
• Any related TE SAEs;  
• Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study; and/or 
• Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. 
For TEAEs, related TEAEs , TESAEs, and related TE SAEs, number of subjects with  
TEAEs and number of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592], by [CONTACT_354221].

CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 87 of 111 14 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
14.1 Study Monitoring 
Study monitoring will conform to all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. 
The sponsor or designee will monitor the study through periodic site visits to verify:  
• Data authenticity, accuracy, and completeness.  
• Protection of subject rights and safety. 
• Conduct of the study i s in accordance with the currently  approved protocol and all 
applicatory regulatory requirements and guidelines. 
Investigators agree to grant access to all relevant documents and provide support at all 
times for study monitoring activities.  Study monitoring activities will be performed in a 
manner that ensures maintenance of subject confidentiality  (Section  5.3). 
In the event of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), and by [CONTACT_11384], if on- site visits are not possible due to site closures, travel 
limitations, or other considerations  (e.g., if site personnel or trial subjects become infected  
with SARS -CoV-2) , the following mitigations  should be considered and assessed in an 
updated monitoring plan: 
• On-site monitoring visits might be cancelled and/or the period between monitoring 
visits extended. When planned on- site monitoring visits are not possible, the reason 
should be clearly documented and made available for review during audits and/or 
inspections. 
• Phone and/or video visits will be implemented when feasible, considering site 
closures, reduced staff , and any other circumstances. 
• Remote monitoring or central monitoring could substitute on- site monitoring, when 
technically feasible.  
• Protocol deviations will be tracked and documented if deviations occurred due to 
the public health emergency. 
Current local regulations, incl uding data privacy regulations will be considered wh en 
accessing source data remotely.  
14.2 Data Quality Assurance  
Inspections by [CONTACT_6218]/IRBs are possible at any time, even after the end of the study. The investigator is to notify the sponsor immediately of any 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- [ADDRESS_441277] ion. The investigator and institution will permit study -related monitoring, 
audits, reviews by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and/or regulatory authorities and  will allow direct access 
to source data and source documents for such monitoring, audits, and reviews. 
14.2.1  Standardization Procedures  
Standardization procedures will be implemented to ensure accurate, consistent, complete, 
and reliable data, including methods to ensure standardization among sites (e.g., training, newsletters, investigator meetings, monitoring, centralized evaluations, and validation methods). Standardized photography methods are detailed in a separate photography user 
manual.  
This study will be monitored regularly by a qualified monitor from the sponsor/CRO/ or 
designee according to GCP guidelines and the re spective SOPs (see Section 14.1).  
14.2.[ADDRESS_441278] during the course of a clinical investigation should be retained in the respective source documentation (e.g., subject file). This includes a copy of 
the letter sent to the subject’s primary physician about the subject’s participation in the investigation (provided the subject has a primary physician and has agreed to the primary physician being informed). The source documentation must also contain a descriptive statement on the informed- consent procedure. The investigator must also confirm by 
[CONTACT_354230]. In addition to this statement, the 
subject’s meeting or non- meeting of the and eligibility criteria have to be traceable on the 
basis of the documentation in the subject ’s file. The childbearing potential of female 
subjects must be noted in the source documentation. The site will keep a source data location list, which will outline for the different (electronic) data categories (e.g. , 
demographics, medical history, and adverse events , etc.) which document serves as source 
for th ese data (e.g. , subject file , subject eDiary ). 
If an investigational site is using an electronic system for documenting source data, a member of the site staff must print out the source data after each visit. The paper print -outs 
must be overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], if possible (i.e., m ust contain at least the last row of data from the 
subject’s previous visit). If it is not possible to obtain overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_109470] -outs, the 
completeness of source data must be ensured by [CONTACT_109550]. The print -out must 
be signed and dated by a  member of the site staff who can confirm the accuracy and 
completeness of data in the paper print -out. The monitor should also sign and date after 
verifying the source data. The paper print -out should be stored in the Investigator Site File. 
If source dat a information is entered retrospectively, this must be done directly on the paper 
print- out and should be initialed and dated. The same applies to any corrections of initial 
data.  
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 89 of 111 If the site is using a validated computer system including audit trail with a n adequate  access 
for the monitor (i.e., the monitor can only access the data of the investigation subjects), 
then no such paper print-outs are required. The monitor should perform spot- checks in the 
electronic system to confirm that the process of generating paper print -outs by [CONTACT_354231]. 
14.2.3  Data Management  
Systems (e.g., eCRF, eDiary) used for electronic data capture fulfill all requirements from 
[ADDRESS_441279] been completed and 
conducted in compliance with the protocol. Data-plausibility checks will be performed according to a data -validation plan. 
Inconsis tencies in the data will be queried to the investigators via the EDC system; answers 
to queries or changes to the data will also be documented in this system directly by [CONTACT_354232]’s site staff. The audit trail in the EDC system will document all changes. Edit checks generate automatic queries during data entry when applicable. Manual queries to be answered by [CONTACT_354233] -data 
verification and/or during medical, safety, and/or data management review. After all data 
are entered and all queries are re solved, the database will be closed. If any data changes 
are required  after database close, these changes will be documented according to the 
respective SOP.  Further details of the data management process wi ll be described in the 
data management plan.  
Photographs will be archiv ed by [CONTACT_354234] (see Section 14.3). eDiary data will be transferred  electronically to the data 
management CRO . Checks will be performed to ensure plausibility and completeness of 
these data. The data management activities and  photographs processing will be delegated 
to the CROs listed in Section 16.6. 
In the event  of a pandemic disease outbreak (e.g., new COVID -19 public health 
emergency ), and by [CONTACT_11384], if data entry and cleaning is limited or not possible due to site 
closures, travel limitations, or other considerations (e.g., if site personnel become infected 
with SARS -CoV-2) , the following mitigations should be considered for data cleaning  
processes:  
• Data entry and response to data clarifications will proceed depending on availability 
of study nurses, coordinators, and investigators. 
Merz North America, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
M930121002 Version 5.0, 04-NOV- 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  Page 90 of 111 • Depending on the content of data clarifications, the necessity for  source data review 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_456]. 
• Self-evident corrections of obvious query responses will be allowed. These will be 
documented thoroughly (e.g., using a list of self -evident corrections to be approved 
before Database Lock).  
• If applicable, risk- based assessment of closing long open queries will be done 
considering their impact on trial conclusion and data validity. 
• Assessment will be completed to determine  if data clarifica tions and/or eCRF pages 
are to be signed by [CONTACT_354235]. The delegation log is 
to be updated, if applicable. 
14.2.4  A uditing 
To ensure compliance with applicable standards and regulations, the sponsor, IEC/IRB , or 
regulatory authorities may conduct a quality assurance assessment or audit of site records at any time during or after completion of the study. In the event of an audi t, investigators 
must grant access to all relevant documents (including source documents, electronic records, and other applicable study documentation) and provide support at all times for auditing activities.  
14.[ADDRESS_441280] Retention

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_363766] a common neoplasm that affects more than a half of a million people 
each year.  The most serious of skin can cers is melanoma, which was diagnosed in 
approximately 60,[ADDRESS_453139] the treatment options available to 
patients.3 The following section provides an overview of the different treatment modalities 
published in the literature. 
Lovett et al reported on 339 patients who were cons ecutively treated for hi stologically confirmed 
basal cell (71%) and squamous cell (29%) carcinoma.5 A retrospective study was performed to 
assess local recurrence.   The majority of the basal cell lesions (93%) and 97% of the SCCs were 
on the head.  Radiation therapy was the initial treatment modality in 212 patients, and 127 
patients were treated with radiation therapy after the initial surgical excision failed.  Tumor 
control was analyzed by [CONTACT_363777].  The local 
control for superficial x-ray ranged from 91 to 100% reported cat egorically by [CONTACT_44871].  
Page 6 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary  of iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  Electron beam ranged from 70 to 75% local control.  Patients were stratified into groups by [CONTACT_363778].  Excellent to good cosmesis was seen in 97% of 
the patients treated with superficial X-rays and in  78% of the patients tr eated with electrons, 78% 
of the patients treated with mixed beams, and in 80% of the patients treated with megavoltage 
photons.  The overall complication rate (complicati ons were defined as grade 4 toxicities4) for the 
310 patients whose data was available was 5.5%.  Of the 217 previously untreated patients, the 
complication rate was 3.2%.,5 
Silva et al report on a retrospective review of  radiation therapy treatment for basal cell, 
squamous cell, and basal-SCC from 313 patients w ith 334 lesions treated.  The objective of this 
study was to assess local control and late toxicitie s in patients treated wi th radiation therapy for 
the treatment of cancer of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_363767] .  For 270 patients, radiation therapy was the 
primary treatment, 50 patients received radiati on therapy for recurrent cancer that had not 
previously undergone resection, and 12 patients received radia tion therapy as an adjuvant 
treatment.6 
 Orthovoltage X-ray radiation therap y (100-250 kV) was used in 83% of the patients, and electron 
radiation therapy was used in approximately 12%.  The rest were treated with megavoltage X-
rays (primarily 
60Cobalt).  The prescriptions were as fo llows: 17.5 Gy-20 Gy in  one fraction, 35 
Gy in five fractions with 7 Gy per fraction, 42 -45 Gy in ten fractions  with 4.2 to 4.5 Gy per 
fraction, and 50 to 60 Gy divided among 20 to 30 fra ctions with less than 3 Gy per fraction.  
Thirty-five (35) Gy was prescribed for 124 of  the 313 patients.  The follow-up ranged from 0.12 
to 13.37 years.  The primary endpoint was time to  local failure, and the secondary endpoint was 
significant grade 4 late toxicities.  Local contro l rate was reported to be  9% for patients who 
present with early-stage cancer with tumor size 2cm or less in diameter .  Orthovoltage X-ray 
radiation therapy has been show n to be efficacious primary tr eatment for squamous cell and 
BCC.[ADDRESS_453140] ten years later to allow for follow-up.   All patients were treated with 45-100 kV X-
ray.  The radiation doses administered were 22.5 Gy, 20 Gy and 18 Gy.  The 18 Gy prescription 
was reserved for patients who were considered  frail or had very small tumors.  The study 
endpoints were recurrence and late necrosis over a ten-year period.   There was no difference in 
the recurrence rate for the group treated with 20 Gy versus  22 Gy, but there was a significant 
increase in late skin necrosis rate (p=0.002).  Most tumors were in the head and neck regions.  
One subgroup in this study, patients who received radi ation therapy for the treatment of cancer of 
the inner canthus of the ear, showed a higher recurrence rate because  of the concavity, or 
standoff, of the treatment area.  Chan concl uded that a standoff of 0.5 cm-1.5 cm would cause 
the radiation dose to decrease by [CONTACT_363779] 23%.
[ADDRESS_453141] brachyt herapy with 98% 5-year local control rate 
with no severe early or la te complications detected.7  
Other treatment options for patien ts with basal cell or SCCs include curettage, Mohs surgery and 
conventional surgery.  Curettage has been said to  be quick, requires mini mal equipment, and is 
associated with a cure rate of 90%  or better for select low-risk skin cancers. With this strategy, 
however, there is no margin contro l, and healing and cosmesis can be variable; moreover, it is 
not a very effective treatmen t for high-risk tumors and tumors in certain locations.3, 5, 6 
A common treatment for non-melanoma skin can cer (NMSC) has been Mohs surgery, which 
uniquely orients, maps, and processes removed tissue, permitting the microscopic evaluation of 
virtually 100% of the specimen margins. The comp leteness of this marg in control permits the 
accurate identification and rem oval of all tumor extensions under the microscope. Tissues in 
Mohs surgery are processed as modified frozen sections whic h allow the accurate and rapid 
interpretation of most skin cancers.6,[ADDRESS_453142] be individualized to determine if radiation 
therapy should be an adjuvant th erapy following surgical  resection or if the radiation therapy is 
the primary treatment fo r skin cancer.  Local recurrence ra te varies depending on the histology, 
BCC versus SCC. SCC has a higher recurrence rate than BCC; deat hs have been at tributed to the 
recurrence of SCC.2, 5, 6, 11-14 
 
Brachytherapy has the advantage of delivering a high dose to the tumor while sparing the 
surrounding normal tissues. With proper case se lection and delivery technique, high-dose rate 
(HDR) brachytherapy has great pro mise, allows short treatment ti mes, and can be performed on 
an outpatient basis.15 The Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachyt herapy (eBx) System allows for the 
administration of high dose rate  brachytherapy treatments using an  electronic source.  The Xoft 
Axxent System Controller a nd Source are cleared by [CONTACT_363780] X-ray radiation for brachytherapy.   
 
A matched pairs study was completed previously  comparing eBx treatme nt outcomes to Mohs 
surgery outcomes. The median follow-up was thr ee years.  Local recurrence, toxicities, and 
cosmesis were the endpoints.16 Because of the excellent cosmetic outcomes evident in this study 
at three years, the physicians rated cosmesis as “excellent” or “good” in 97.6% of EBx-treated

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 11 of 52 Clinical 
Evaluations will be performed at : 
  Visit 1: Baseline Visit (Day 0);  
Visit 2:  (Day 28 ± 4 Days);  
Visit 3: ( Day 56 ± 4 Days);  
Visit 4: End of Treatment  (Day 84 ± 4 Days). 
Early Discontinuation Visit:  Same Evaluations as End of Treatment Visit 
Criteria for Evaluation:    
   Primary Endpoint :  
Percent change from baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and  
pustules) lesion counts . 
Secondary Endpoint : 
The Investigator’s Global Evaluation outcome at Week 12, expressed as 
“success” or “failure”  A patient  is considered to have success if the IGE 
score is either 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear), and is considered to have a 
failure, otherwise.  
Measures :   
1. Lesion Counts will be performed using the following definitions:  
Lesion 
Name  [CONTACT_287813]; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), 
solid palpable lesion, usually with inflamed 
elevation of the skin that does not co ntain pus.  
Pustule Inflammatory lesion; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), inflamed skin swelling that is filled with pus .  
Nodule Large, hard bumps under the skin's surface. 
All facial papules, pustules and nodules, located above the jaw line to the hairline, 
will be counted, including those present on the nose. 
Counts of nodules will be reported separately and not included in the inflammatory lesion counts.  
2. The IGE will be performed and documented using the definitions in 
table below :   
Score  Grade  Definitio n  
0 Clear  No inflammatory lesions present; at most, 
mild erythema .  
[ADDRESS_350869] 
Clear  Very mild erythema present.  Very few small 
papules/pustules.  
ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1 VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 12 of 52 2 Mild  Mild erythema.  Several small 
papules/pustules .  
3 Moderate  Moderate erythema.  Several small or large 
papules/pustules, and up to 2 nodules. 
4 Severe  Severe erythema.  Numerous small and/or 
large papules/pustules, up to several nodules.  
3. Application site reactions such as erythema, dryness, scaling, pruritus, 
stinging/burning, and edema, will be recorded at each visit to allow a comparison between treatment groups. 
Data Sets to be Analyzed:   
 Three patient  populations are defined as follows: 
1. The Safety Population includes any patient who was randomized in the 
study and had at least one dose of Investigational product.  
2. The Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT ) Population includes all 
randomized patient s who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, received 
study treatment, and returned for at least one post -baseline visit with 
lesion count. 
3. The Per -Protocol ( PP) P opulation includes all randomized patients who 
met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with the assigned 
study treatment (who applied 75% to 125% of the scheduled 
applications), returned to the study site for the primary endpoint  visit (12 
week evaluation) within +/ - [ADDRESS_350870] eig ht weeks of treatment will 
be included in the mITT and PP population as treatment failures (i.e., non-responders) and the change in inflammatory lesion count from the 
baseline visit to the last completed visit prior to discontinuation due to lack of effica cy will be carried forward in the primary endpoint analysis. 
 
In addition, patients whose condition worsens after completing at least 
eight weeks of treatment and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment of facial rosacea during the study will be discontinued, 
included in the PP population analysis, and provided with effective 
treatment.   A last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) approach will be 
used for imputing missing efficacy results in these PP patients and they will be considered as failures in the IGE evaluations.  
Patients discontinued prematurely for other reasons will be excluded fr om 
the PP population, but included in the mITT population, for which missing efficacy data will be imputed using LOCF.  
For the purpose of determining the per -protocol status of the patient, a 
“protocol violation” is any patient or investigator activity th at could have 
ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1 VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 13 of 52 possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or 
the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and per -protocol 
populations.  All efficacy data will be listed by [CONTACT_287788].  
Statistical 
Methods:  
 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The percent change from baseline to W eek 12 in the inflammatory (papules 
and pustules) lesion counts  is the primary endpoint for the study. A LOCF  
approach will be used for imputation of missing efficacy results, where appropriate.  
Demonstration of Bioequivalence 
A two -way ANOVA on the test and reference results for the primary 
endpoint will be conducted using a statistical model containing terms for treatment and site.  Bioequivalence for the primary endpoint 
will be 
established if the 90% confidence interval for  the test/reference ratio of the 
mean percent change from baseline to W eek 12 in the inflammatory 
(papules and pustules) lesion counts is contained within [0.80, 1.25], using the PP population.  Non-parametric methods will be used if the skewness 
factor for  the residuals from the ANOVA model are outside the range - 2 to 
+2.  
Demonstration of Superiority 
To ensure that the study is sensitive enough, the test product and reference 
listed drug ( RLD ) will each be compared to the vehicle group to 
demonstrate their  statistical superiority at p<0.05 (two sided)  for the 
primary endpoint, using the m ITT study population.  This evaluation will 
be performed using separate two -way ANOVA of Test vs. Vehicle and 
Reference vs. Vehicle, with the statistical model containing t erms for 
treatment and site .  Non- parametric methods will be used if  the skewness 
factor for the residuals from the ANOVA model are outside the range - 2 to 
+2. 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoint  
The dichotomized Investigator’s G lobal Evaluation  (IGE) will be treated as 
a secondary endpoint for supportive evidence.  This secondary endpoint 
will be evaluated as the proportion of patients with a clinical response of “success” at W eek 12.  Success is defined as an either IG E score 0 ( clear) 
or 1 (almost clear)  at the final visit.  Any patient who is not considered a 
success will be considered to be a failure.   A LOCF  approach will be used 
for imputation of missing efficacy results, where appropriate.  Demonstration of Bioequivalence  
Bioequivalence for the secondary endpoint will be established if the 90% 
continuity -corrected confidence interval for the difference in clinical 
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350871] is contained 
within  the interval  [-0.20, +0.20] for the PP population.  
 
Demonstration of Superiority 
Superiority of the efficacy of the test treatment over that of the vehicle will 
be demonstrated if the test success proportion is greater than, and 
statistically different from (p<0.05) that of the vehicle by [CONTACT_1192] -sided 
Fisher’s exact test .  The superiority of the efficacy of the reference 
treatment over that of the vehicle will be demonst rated in an identical 
manner.  
Analysis of application site reactions 
A descriptive analysis comparing the application sit e reactions for each 
treatment group will be conducted to ensure that the test product is not 
worse than the reference product with regard to the expected and 
unexpected application site reactions.  
Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population.  Incidence of 
all adverse events reported during the study will be coded  using the 
MedDRA dictionary and summarized by [CONTACT_1570], body system, 
severity , preferred term, and relationship to study drug.  In addition, an 
evaluation will be conducted of the comparability of the test and reference 
treatments in regard to any treatment emergent adverse events  that occur in 
5%, or more, of the patients in either test or reference treatment group. 
The report of AEs will include date of onset, description of the AE, and date of resolution. 
Concomitant medication  
The start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study will 
be provided in the data listings in addition to the reason for the medication 
use.  
Demographics and Base line/Randomization Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline/randomization characteristics will be compared 
for the m ITT, PP, and Safety  populations.  Continuous variables will be 
analyzed with an analysis of variance with factors of treatment and 
investiga tional site.  Categorical variables such as  gender, ethnicity, and 
race will be analyzed with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by 
[CONTACT_76537].  
Summary of patients who terminate prematurely  
Reasons for premature termination will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 15 of 52 9 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
Rosacea is a chronic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_287789] (persistent erythema) of the 
nose, cheeks and forehead which most commonly occurs in patients between the ages of 30 and 60 years -of-age.  The vascular dilation cause is unknown but has been linked with hair 
follicle mite s, Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis , as well as Helicobacter pylori infection.  
However, after successful treatment (wherein rosacea symptoms were improved) with tetracycline or metronidazole, respectively, actual numbers of the organisms were not found to be reduced.  The earliest stage of rosacea is characterized by [CONTACT_287790], often primarily 
on the nose and cheeks, recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_287751], and telangiectasia.  The erythema is usually worsened by [CONTACT_287791], or ingestion of trigger foods or beverages.  Inflammatory lesions develop in the areas of erythema and appear similar to the inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris , but present without comedones.  The diagnosis of rosacea is based on 
the presence of one or more of the following:  flushing, nontransient erythema, papules/pustules, or telangiectasia.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_287752].  Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_287753].  
FINACEA
® (azelaic acid) FOAM , 15% contains azelaic acid, a naturally occurring saturated 
dicarboxylic acid that has proven anti -inflammatory effects, as well as anti- keratinizing and 
antimicrobial action, although its mechanism of action in rosacea  is not well understood.  This 
study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good C linical Practices (GCP) and 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s).   Marketed by [INVESTIGATOR_8998], Finacea® (azelaic 
acid) Foam , 15% is a safe and effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_287754].  Actavis Laboratories UT  has developed a generic formulation of azelaic acid 
15% foam  and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  this 
formulation.  
10 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence and safety  of a generic 
Azelaic Acid Foam , 15% and Finacea® (Azelaic acid) Foam , 15% in the treatment of m oderate 
facial rosacea, and to demonstrate superiority of the efficacy of the two active foam s over the 
vehicle control. 
11 INVESTIGATIONAL AND ANALYSIS PLAN 
11.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, vehicle- controlled, parallel -group, multi center , double -blind study of a 
generic Azelaic Acid Foam , 15% and the reference listed Finacea® ( Azelaic acid) Foam , 15% 
in patient s with moderate  facial  rosacea.  
11.[ADDRESS_350872] 840 mITT  patients in a 1:1:1 ratio (280:280:280 patients, respectively) to each treatment group and 672 (224:224:224) evaluable subjects in PP population.  Patients  will be assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_350873], Azelaic Acid Foam , 15% ( Actavis Laboratories UT ), 
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350874], Finacea® ( Azelaic acid) Foam , 15%  (Bayer HealthCare) or the vehicle 
control ( Actavis Laboratories UT ) in this multicenter, double -blind, randomized, vehicle -
controlled, parallel-group study.   
The assigned Investigational Product will be self -applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_287755] 
(cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose)  twice  daily for [ADDRESS_350875] should be gently massaged into the affected areas on the face twice daily, in the 
morning and evening  after the patient’s face has been washed with a mild  cleanser  and patted 
dry with a soft towel .  Patients will be required to use diaries to document study treatments, 
any missed treatments and the occurrence of all  adverse events.  
The duration of each patient’s participation in the study will be 84 days.  Scheduled study visits 
will include: Visit 1 (Baseline Visit, Day 0), Visit 2 (Day 28 ±4 days ), Visit 3 (Day 56±4 days ) 
and Visit 4 (End of Treatment, Day 84±4 days ).  A window ± 4 days will be considered 
acceptable for each scheduled visit following the baseline visit. If the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287756]’s condition has worsened to the degree 
that it is unsafe for the patient to continue in the  study, the patient may be discontinued from 
the study as a treatment failure and the patient may be treated using the standard care.  
An Unscheduled Visit is allowed at any time, for any reason, if in the Principal Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_187378].  If a patient is discontinued from the study during an Unscheduled 
Visit, the Unscheduled Visit will be referred to as an Early Discontinuation Visit and all procedures scheduled for Visit 4 will be performed.  If the Unscheduled Visit is not an Early 
Discontinuation Visit (i.e., the patient will continue to take part in the study), then the activities 
performed will depend on the reason for the unscheduled visit and will be left to the discretion of the Investigator.  The Investigator should perform any ac tivities necessary to appropriately 
evaluate the patient  at this Unscheduled Visit .  If the Unscheduled Visit is due to an AE, the 
Investigator will determine whether additional visits are needed.  
At Visit 1, an informed consent will be obtained from the potential study patient before any study procedures take place.  After the patient has been consented, the patient’s medical history 
will then be documented, including the patient’s concomitant medications.  A urine pregnancy 
test will be performed for all female patients  of child- bearing potential .  A baseline facial 
rosacea grade will be assigned to the patient using the Investigator’s Global Evaluation (IGE) 
and a baseline lesion count will be performed.  The patient will undergo a physical 
examination, including the recording of vital signs.  The patient will be evaluated for signs 
and/or symptoms of erythema and t elangiectasia.  The patient will be reviewed against the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Blind ed Investigational Product will be dispensed to patients who 
meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Patients will be instructed on the application 
of Investigational Product and completion of patient diaries.  
Patients will return to the study site for Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4.   The patient’s concomitant 
medications will be reviewed and documented.  A urine pregnancy test will be performed for 
female patients  of child- bearing potential .  The patient’s facial rosacea will be assessed using 
the IG E, the patient’s lesions will be counted and all  results will be document ed.  The signs 
and/or symptoms of local irritation will be evaluated for the patient and any other adverse events will be documented.  The patient will b ring their used Investigational Product and their 
study diaries to each study visit after the baseline visit.  Compliance with drug applications 
will be assessed at each visit after the baseline visit.  New  can(s) of Investigational Product

11.3.4 Patient  Discontinuation Criteria  
Investigators are urged to enroll only those eligible patients who are likely to complete the 
entire study and who are willing to comply with the protocol -specified procedures.  It is the 
right and duty of the investigator to interrupt the treatment of any patient whose safety and well-being are determined to be at risk, or who may be experiencing unmanageable factors 
that may interfere with the study procedures and/or the interpretation of study results.  Such patients should be withdrawn from the study rather than continued under a modified regimen.  
Discontinuation is permanent; once a patient  is discontinued, he/she shall not be allowed to 
enroll again. 
A patient  may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
1. Patient  decision/withdrawal of consent; 
2. Adverse event, including intercurrent illness, which required study discontinuation; 
3. If the patient’s condition has worsened to the degree that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287761]; 
4. If the patient’s drug code is unblinded; 
5. Insufficient  therapeutic response (after at least 8 weeks of compliant treatment);

patients to stop the application of treatment (“rest period”) to reduce patient discomfort and to allow local skin reactions to subside based upon the Investigator’s clinical assessment.  Treatment should resume as soon as the reaction subsides sufficiently to allow reapplication.  If significant discomfort continues, or if the patient cannot return to daily applications after missing more than six consecutive doses the patient should be discontinued from the study.  Multiple rest periods during the study are allowed, but they should only be used when absolutely necessary based upon the patient’s tolerability needs as determined by [CONTACT_737].  The patient should not modify or resume the treatment regimen without consultation with the Investigator.  The Investigator may make this decision based upon a 
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350896] medical occurrence (sign, symptom or laboratory 
finding) regardless of severity and whether or not attributed to the Investigational Product.  All 
adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_287795], whether related to study drug or not related to study drug, shall be documented in the eCRF and patient records .  Details such as  date of onset, the duration and intensity of each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken, the relationship to the Investigational Product , and the degree of 
severity , the seriousness, and the outcome should be recorded. 
11.6 Clinical Assessments  
An examination of the patient’s face  
 will be performed at baseline and at each subsequent visit.  During the dermatol ogic 
examination, evaluations to determine efficacy of treatment will be conducted, including lesion counts and grading of the patient’s facial rosacea using the criteria outlined in the IGE.  
Whenever possible, a single Investigator (i.e., Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720]- Investigator) will 
perform evaluations of efficacy (i.e., lesion counts and IG E) for each patient at each visit from 
the beginning to the end of the patient’s partic ipation to maintain consistency.  H owever, up to 
two Investigators may perform evaluations of efficacy for a single patient if necessary.  All 
Investigators who will perform evaluations of efficacy must attend study -specific training for 
the conduct of these evaluations (i.e., lesion counts and IGE ). 
11.6.1 Inflammatory Lesion Count 
All facial papules, pustules and nodules, located above the jaw line and extending to the 
hairline, are to be counted at Visit 1/Baseline and at each subsequent visit.  When counting facial lesions, it is important that all lesions be counted, including those present on the nose.  The total count for each lesion type is to be recorded and the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) will be calculated.  A papule with a pustule on its apex will be 
counted as a pustule. 
A patient must have at least eight and not more than fifty inflammatory facial lesions (i.e., 
papules/pustules) and ≤2 nodules on the face  to be eligible for the study .  Counts of nodules 
and cysts will be reported separately and not included in the inflammatory counts. 
ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 27 of 52 Inflammatory lesion types: 
Lesion Name  [CONTACT_287813]; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), solid palpable 
lesion, usually with inflamed elevation of the skin that does not 
contain pus .  
Pustule Inflammatory lesion; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), inflamed skin 
swelling that is filled with pus .  
Nodule  Large  (>5 mm  in diameter ), hard bumps under the skin's surface . 
 
For optimal visualization, the Investigator, or other qualified lesion counter, should use the 
same light source, either fluorescent or natural light, in approximately the same position during each count.  To avoid counting sub- clinical lesions, the skin should not be stretched and 
magnification should not be used during this assessment. 
11.6.2 Investigator’s Global Evaluation (IGE) 
For each patient  at each visit, the Investigator will make an independent clinical evaluation of 
the patient ’s rosacea severity.  For study enrollment, the patient  must have an IGE rosacea 
severity score of 3 at Visit 1/Baseline.  
IGE: 
Score  Grade  Definition

11.7 Study Procedures  
A study flow chart can be found in Appendix I, outlining visit procedures. 
11.7.1 Visit 1/Baseline/Day 0 
The prospective patient s will visit the study center and be examined by [CONTACT_5989].  If the 
patient  is screened and not randomized to study drug on the same day (e.g. due to the required 
washout of a prohibited medication), the Visit 1/Day 0 procedures should be re -confirmed on the 
day the patient  returns prior to being randomized to study medication.  The following procedures 
will be performed at the Baseline Visit: 
1. The study personnel will review the ICF with each patient  and give the patient  an 
opportunity to have all questions answered before proceeding.  A copy of the signed 
consent will be given to every patient  and the original will be maintained with the patient ’s 
records.  
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350898] 6 months  of 
signing the Informed Consent is to be obtained using generic name, if known, with the 
corresponding indication.  The medications to be recorded will include prescription and 
over-the- counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements.  All medications taken on a 
regular basis, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_287772], should be recorded. 
4. A physical examination including heart, lung and abdomen e valuation as well as height, 
weight, and vital signs will be performed.  Vital signs are to include sitting blood pressure, oral temperature, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  
5. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all females  of child-bearing potenti al.  
6. All facial papules, pustules and nodules, located above the jaw line and extending to the hairline, will be counted (see Section 10.6.1). 
7. The overall status of the patient’s facial rosacea will be assessed using the IGE (see Section 10.6.2). 
8. Telangiectasia assessment will be performed (see Section 10.5.5). 
9. Patients will be evaluated for any signs and/or symptoms of facial irritation  (see Section 
10.5.6). 
10. When the patient has completed all screening procedures, compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed .  After the inclusion and exclusion criteria have 
been confirmed, the patient will be randomized to a treatment group.  The patient will be 
assigned a randomization number (s ee Section 10.8.3). 
11. The following will be dis pensed during Visit 1:  
• One can  of the Investigational Product 
• A diary card to record product use from Visit 1 to Visit 2 
• One bottle of c leanser  
• One bottle of sunscreen  
• One bottle of moisturizing lotion  
• One pack of towels

11.7.5 Unscheduled Visit  
An Unscheduled Visit is allowed at any time, for any reason, if , in the Principal Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is warranted.  
If a patient is discontinued from the study during an Unscheduled Visit, the Unscheduled Visit will be referred to as an Early Discontinuation Visit and all procedures scheduled for Visit 4 will be performed.  If the Unscheduled Visit is not an Early Discontinuation Visit (i.e., the 
patient will continue to take part in the study), then the  activities performed will depend on the 
reason for the unscheduled visit and will be left to the discretion of the Investigator. 
The Investigator should perform any acti vities necessary to appropriately evaluate the patient .  
If the Unscheduled Visit is due to an AE, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287773].  
If the patient’s condition has worsened to the degree that it is unsafe for the patient to continue in the study, the patient may be discontinued from the study as treatment failure and a standard of care treatment may be advised at the Principal Investigator’s discretion.

All study medication will be stored at controlled room temperature 68° - 77°F ( 20° - 25°C) 
with excursions permitted between 59° - 86°F (15° - 30°C), in a climate -controlled, limited 
access area.  
The Investigator agrees to store and dispense the study medication only at the site(s) listed on 
the Form FDA 1572 (or Investigator Agreement/Statement).  The Investigator agrees that the study medication will be dispensed by [CONTACT_91564]-I nvestigator(s) named on the 
Form FDA 1572 (or Investigator Agreement/Statement), or their qualified designees.  The Investigator, Sub-I nvestigator(s), or qualified designees also agree that the s tudy medication 
will be dispensed only to patient s who have provided written informed consent, and have met 
all entry criteria.  Clinical supplies may not be used for any purpose other than as stated in the protocol. 
At baseline, and as needed during the study, Investigational Product will be dispensed to 
randomized patients along with a diary, which includes study instructions.  Dispensing will be 
done by [CONTACT_287796]. The containers should not be opened by [CONTACT_287797].  Each patient will 
receive training, which detail s the proper application method of the Investigational Product 
and general study instructions. 
Areas to be treated should be washed wit h a mild cleanser before application and patted dry 
with the provided towel.  A thin layer of study treatment should be gently massaged into the  
entire facial area (cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose)  twice daily, once in the morning  after 
waking up and once in the evening before going to bed, for [ADDRESS_350901] should not 
be opened at the clinic.   
11.8.3 Method of Treatment Assignment  and Randomization 
After satisfying all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient will be eligible to enter the study and be randomly allocated in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_350902] party.  A sealed copy of the randomization scheme will be provided to each study site and will  be retained at the study site 
and should be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of the treatment identity of each patient. 
Only one patient number will be assigned to each patient.  The patient will maintain the same 
patient number and treatment assignment throughout the study.   
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350903], and the vehicle will be 
identical in appearance and will be packaged identically so that treatment blind is maintained.  
Neither the patient  nor the investigational staff ( Sponsor, I nvestigator, and evaluators) will 
know which treatment the patient  is receiving.  
The Investigator must not break the blind unless absolutely necessary , in order  to provide 
medical treatment to a patient  in an emergency , and only with prior authorization from the 
Sponsor or designee.  If the blind is broken for a patient , the patient  will be discontinued from 
the study and the reason recorded. 
11.8.5 Unblinding Study Medication 
In the event of an emergency, the patient -specific treatment may be iden tified, however, every 
effort should be made to maintain the blind.  Each patient  kit will be labeled with a 2 -part label.  
In the blinded part of the label, included information will contain the compound name, strength and lot number .  To unblind, scratch -off the black portion of the label to reveal the treatment 
received.  
11.8.6 Method of Packaging, Labeling and  Storage  
Study medications will be supplied in cans  by [CONTACT_1034].  Cans  will be labeled and packaged 
so that neither the patient  nor the Investigator can identify the treatment.   
The medication will be supplied to the sites in b locks. Each block will contain 3 patient kits 
(in a 1:1:1 randomization). Each patient kit includes a can; each patient kit will also have a 2 -
part label on the outside. Each 2- part label will clearly disclose the protocol number, patient 
number, content statement, storage statement, caution statement, and sponsor's name [CONTACT_3816].  The label will also contain the compound name, strength and lot number in the blinded panel.  The tear -off kit label will be attached to the source document.   
The Sponsor’s independent packaging and labeling facility will be responsible for labeling and assembly of investigational product, as well as, for shipment of clinical supplies to investigational sites.    
All study medication will be stored at controlled room temperature 68° - 77°F (20° - 25°C) 
with excursions permitted between 59° - 86°F (15° - 30°C), in a climate- controlled, limited

(azelaic acid) Foam , 15% .  The following adverse experiences have been reported with the use 
of Finacea® (azelaic acid) Foam , 15% : erythema, dryness, pain and pruritus.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287777] f ollow the patient until the adverse event has resolved, 
becomes clinically insignificant, is stabilized or the patient is lost to follow -up.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287778] s who discontinue use of study drug due to 
adverse events to the Contract Research Organization by [CONTACT_258839]-up in writing.  
11.9.2 Assessment of Severity  
The intensity or severity of an adverse event (AE) is characterized as:  
• Mild: an AE that is easily tolerated  
• Moderate: an AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity  
• Severe: an AE that prevents normal daily activities  
11.9.3 Relationship to Study Medication  
The relationship is characterized as:  
• Not Related : This applies to any AE that is clearly not related to use of the study 
drug.  
• Possible : This means the association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; 
however, a relationship between drug and event cannot be ruled out.  
• Probable : There is a reasonable temp oral relationship between the use of the study 
drug and the AE.  Based upon the Principal Investigator’s clinical experience, the 
association of the event with the study drug seems likely.  
• Definite : The AE occurs following the application of the study drug and it cannot 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_287802]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  It disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study drug a nd 
reappears on a re- challenge of the Investigational Product.  
11.9.4 Action  taken  regarding  the IMP  
• None:  There was no action  taken.  The subject  receives  IMP in accordance 
with the protocol. 
• Dose  reduced:  The dosage of IMP  was reduced.  
• Interrupted:  Discontinued temporarily.  The treatment  is expected  to be re-

ring (NuvaRing®), Depo -Provera® (Medroxy progesterone acetate), double barrier methods 
(e.g., condom and spermicide), Essure  or IUD.   
A negative result of a urine pregnancy test having a minimum sensitivity of at least 50mIU/ml for hCG should be obtained, prior to study participation, at Visit 1.  Pregnancy testing will 
also be performed at every study visit and the results of all pregna ncy tests (positive or 
negative) will be documented. 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a study patient is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of Investigational Product exposure, the subject  will be p ermanently discontinued.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287779]. 
Protocol- required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 
the patient.  Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if 
ACTA/AZEL/[ADDRESS_350911] report to the sponsor follow -up 
information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including prenatal  and neonatal outcome. 
Infants should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks after birth.  
Pregnancy occurring during a patient’s participation in a clinical trial must be notified to the 
sponsor within [ADDRESS_350912] to the father prior to sexual intercourse. 
Timeline for follow  up: 
• Site should follow the patient  until termination of the pregnancy or until at least 30 
days after the birth.  
• Infant (s) should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks after birth. 
 
Timeline for reports: 
• Pregnancy notification: with in 24 hours after Study Coordinator becomes aware of 
its occurrence; 
• Pregnancy initial report: expected within 1 to 3 days of notification; 
• Pregnancy follow up report: at least every 3 months; 
• Pregnancy final report: upon termination of the pregnancy or unt il at least 30 days 
after the birth ;

11.9.9 Serious Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death ;  
• A life threatening adverse event; (Note: the term “life -threatening” as used here 
refers to an event in which the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe);   
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
• Any “other” important medical event . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287780], based on appropriate

12 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 Sample Size Rationale  
The sample size for this protocol is based on published data ( Finacea
® Summary Basis of 
Approval ); Finacea® produced a percent reduction for inflammatory lesions of approximately 
55% and the vehicle had a percent reduction of 40% after [ADDRESS_350918] deviation for inflammatory lesio ns is < 47%.  A sample size of  
n1 = 280, n 2 = 280 and n 3 = 280 evaluable mITT patients  (1:1:1 ratio) to provide at least  
[ADDRESS_350919] 
an  probability of showing that, the 90% confidence interval on the Test/Reference ratio 
of percent reduction from baseline is contained within the  interval 0.[ADDRESS_350920] and Reference products are superior to the vehicle in the mITT population.  
In this study, enrolled patients will be randomized in the ratio of 1:1:[ADDRESS_350921], reference and 
vehic le treatments.  It is anticipated that 75% of the mITT patients will qualify for the PP 
population.  Accordingly, approximately [ADDRESS_350922] 84 0 mITT patients in a 1:1:1 ratio ( 280:280:280
 patients, respectively) to each 
treatment group.  
12.2 Randomization and Unblinding Procedures  
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_350923] of the study in order to minimize bias.  A sealed copy of the 
randomization scheme will be retained at each study site.  

ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 41 of 52 The treatment assignments will remain blinded until the final database is loc ked.  The contents 
of the cans  of IP may not be viewed by [CONTACT_978], any Sub -investigator, evaluator or any other 
(blinded) member of the site staff.  
In the event of an emergency, the patient -specific treatment may be identified; however, every 
effort should be made to maintain the blind.   
In the event of unblinding, the patient should be excluded from the PP population.  The 
Sponsor or designee must be notified in the event the blind is broken. 
12.3 Significance Level  
All statistical tests will be carried out at a significance level of α = 0.05  (two sided), unless 
otherwise indicated.  No adjustment will be made for multiplicity.  
12.4 Efficacy A ssessment  
12.4.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory 
(papules and pustules) lesion counts. 
12.4.2 Secondary Endpoint 
The secondary endpoint is the clinical response of “success” or “failure” at Week 12 on the IGE.  Success is defined as an IGE score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).  Any patient  who is 
not considered to be a success will be considered to be a failure.  
12.4.3 Measures   
Lesion Counts will be performed using the following definitions:  
Lesion Name  [CONTACT_287813]; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), solid palpable 
lesion, usually with inflamed elevation of the skin that does not 
contain pus .  
Pustule Inflammatory lesion; small (≤ 5mm in diameter), inflamed skin 
swelling that is filled with pus .  
Nodule  Large  (> 5 mm in diameter) , hard bumps under the skin's surface . 
 
When counting facial lesions, all lesions will be counted, including those present on the nose.  
Counts of nodules will be reported separately and not included in the inflammatory lesion 
counts.  
The I GE will be performed and documented using the definitions in table below: 
IGE:  
Score  Grade  Definition  
0 Clear  No inflammatory lesions present; at most, mild erythema .  
[ADDRESS_350924] Clear  Very mild erythema present. Very few small 
papules/pustules .  
2 Mild  Mild erythema. Several small papules/pustules .  
ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 52 3 Moderate  Moderate erythema. Several small or large 
papules/pustules, and up to 2 nodules .  
4 Severe  Severe erythema. Numerous small and/or large 
papules/pustules, up to several nodules .  
Application site reactions such as erythema, dryness, scaling, pruritus, stinging/burning, and 
edema, will be recorded at each visit to allow a comparison between treatment groups.  A 
detailed scale is presented in Section 10.5.6.  
12.4.4 Datasets to be Analyzed  
Three analysis populations will be used in the analysis of the clinical data and they are defined as follows: 1. The Safety population includes any individual who was randomized into the study and used 
at least one dose of Investigational Product. 
2. The mITT population includes all randomized patient s who met all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, received study treatment, and returned for at least one post -baseline visit  with 
lesion count. 
3. The PP population includes all randomized patient s who met all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, were compliant with the assigned study  treatment (who applied 75% to 125% of 
the scheduled applications), returned to the study site for the primary endpoint visit (12 week evaluation) within +/ - 4 days OR discontinued from the study as a treatment failure 
(after completing at least 8 weeks of  compliant study medication use), and did not have 
any protocol violations.  The compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_287804].  
Patients who are discontinued early from the study due to lack of treatment effect, or who require alternate or supp lemental therapy to treat their rosacea, after completing at least 
eight weeks of treatment will be included in the mITT and PP population as treatment failures on the IGE and their change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to the last completed visit prior to discontinuation will be carried forward (LOCF).   
Patients discontinued prematurely for other reasons will be excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT population, with missing efficacy data imputed using LOCF.  
For the purpose  of determining the per -protocol status of the patient, a “protocol violation” is 
any patient or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and Per -protocol populations.   
 
12.5 Statistical Analysis  
12.5.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
Demonstration of Bioequivalence 
The 90% confidence interval on the test -to-reference ratio for the mean change from baseline 
in inflammatory lesions will be constructed using Fieller’s method. The analysis will use the common error term from the Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA) of the test a nd reference results 
with a statistical model containing terms for treatment and site.  
ACTA/AZEL/2015  PROTOCOL VERSION FINAL  
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43 of 52 Bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence interval on the test -to-reference 
ratio is contained within the interval [0.80, 1.25] in the PP population. 
An identical analysis will be performed on the results from the mITT population to test for 
robustness of the findings in the PP population.  A LOCF approach will be used for missing 
efficacy results in the mITT analysis.  
Demonstration of Superiority 
To ensure that the study has adequate sensitivity to a difference between products, should such a difference exist, the primary efficacy results for the test and reference treatments will each be compared to those of the vehicle treatment.  
The evaluation of the superiority of the test treatment over the vehicle treatment will be conducted using ANOVA with a statistical model containing terms for treatment and center.  
If the mean percent change from baseline for inflammatory lesions for the test treatment is greate r than, and statistically different from (p<0.05) that of the vehicle in the mITT 
population, then the test product will be considered superior to the vehicle.  The results for the reference treatment will be compared to those for the vehicle in an identical manner.   The 
same analyses will be conducted for the results from the PP population to test for robustness of the findings in the mITT population.  A LOCF approach will be used for missing efficacy results in the mITT analysis.  
For both the Bioequivalence and Superiority evaluations, a non- parametric rank based 
ANOVA will be considered when the data is highly skewed. The evaluation of skewness, (SAS® PROC UNIVARIATE) will be performed using the residuals from each ANOVA and if the skewness statistic is less than - 2 or greater than +2, the analysis will be performed on 
the ranks of the percent change in inflammatory lesion count values. 
12.5.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint 
Demonstration of Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence for the secondary endpoint, will be established if the 90% confidence interval, 
Wald’s method with Yate’s continuity correction, for the test -to-reference difference in IGE 
success proportions is contained within the interval [ -0.20, +0.20] in the PP population.  An 
identical analysis will be conducted on the mITT population to test for the robustness of the findings for the PP population. A LOCF approach will be used for missing efficacy results in the mITT analysis.  
Demonstration of Superiority  
The evaluation of the superiority of the test treatment over the vehicle treatment for the proportion of patients with success on the IGE at Week 12 will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test . If the success proportion for the test treatment is great er than, and statistically 
different from (p<0.05) that of the vehicle in the mITT population, then the test product will be considered superior to the vehicle.  The results for the reference treatment will be compared to those for the vehicle in an identi cal manner.  The same analyses will be conducted for the 
results from the PP population to test for robustness of the findings in the mITT population.  
A LOCF approach will be used for missing efficacy results in the mITT analysis .

12.5.4 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population.  Incidence of all adverse events 
reported during the study will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ) dictionary and summarized by [CONTACT_1570], body system, severity, preferred 
term, and relationship to study drug.  In addition, an evaluation will be conducted of the comparability of the test and reference treatments in regard to any treatment emergen t AEs that 
occur in 5%, or more of the patients in either test or reference treatment group.  
The report of AEs will include date of onset, description of the AE, and date of resolution.

The start and stop date s of concomitant medicat ion use d during the study will be provided in 
the data listings  in addition to the reason for the medication use.  
12.5.6 Demographics and Baseline/Randomization Characteristics   
Demographic and baseline/randomization characteristics will be compared for the m ITT, PP, 
and Safety  populations.  Continuous variables will be analyzed with an analysis of variance 
with factors of treatment and investigational site.  Categorical variables including gender, ethnicity, race, and some baseline/randomization characteristics will be analyzed with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by [CONTACT_76537].

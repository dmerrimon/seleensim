Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint in this study is the change from baseline  (CFB)  to EOS 
in the ADHD -RS-5 total score . 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : a) CGI-I, b) Conners 3  - Parent composite T -score , and 
c) WFIRS -P average score  
Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  a) Proportion of responders with 50% improvement in  
ADHD -RS-5 Total score , b) SIPA , c) ADHD -RS-5 Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity 
subscale scores, and d) Conners 3  - Self composite T -score   
   
 
 
 
Safety Assessments : Safety will be assessed using Adverse Events ( AEs), clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
(C-SSRS) . 
Sample Size : 
Seventy -two subjects per treatment group in the I ntent-To-Treat (ITT)  population will yield 90% 
power at a significan ce level of 0.05 (two -sided) using a two -sample t -test with equal allocation to 
the treatment groups . This assumes an effect size of 0.547, which was observed in the 
comparison of SPN -812 200 mg and placebo in the SPN 812 Phase IIb study (based on 
the CFB to endpoint in the ADHD -RS-IV total score) and will maintain consistency in the 
sample size assumption used between this clinical trial and the SPN -812 P302 study 
(e.g., across the SPN -812 clinical trials in the adolescent population).   A total of 300 
subjects ( 100 subjects in each of the three  treatment groups) will be randomized to account for 
an anticipated 27.9% of randomized subjects not completing the study . 
Analysis Populations:  
 The Randomized population will include all enrolled subjects who ha d a baseline visit and 
are randomized via the IWRS.  
 The ITT population for efficacy will include all randomized subjects  who took at least one 
dose of study medication, and had a Baseline and at least one post -randomization  ADHD -
RS-5 assessment.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they 
were randomized.  
 The Per Protocol (PP) population consists of all subjects in the ITT population who 
completed all 9  visits with no missing ADHD -RS-5 assessments and no major protocol 
violations . Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  
 The Safety Population consists of all subjects randomized into the study who receive at 
least one dose of SM.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received. 
 The PK population will include all subjects in  the safety population with ≥1 PK sample  
that is not below the Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) . 
Handling of Missing Data:   
With respect to the primary analysis, missing ADHD -RS-5 Total scores  will be assumed to be 
missing at random (MAR) and will be handled using a Mixed Model  for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM)  method in SAS.  The sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed by 
[CONTACT_419650] -RS-5 Total Scores are missing not at  random  (MNAR). For analysis 
of secondary endpoints, missing values will be assumed as MAR.  
Statistical Methods:

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. All tabulations of analysis results will include summaries for the following three treatments: 
SPN-812 ER 600 mg, SPN -812 ER 400 mg, and placebo . 
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency count and percent for 
categorical variables, and number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, 
minimum, and maximum  for continuous variables) .  
Categorical v ariables will be analyzed using categorical response methods such as Pearson’s 
Chi-square test. If expected frequencies are less than [ADDRESS_529090] testing 
techniques will be used.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for demographics, data from the clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs, weight, ECGs, and C-SSRS .   
Efficacy Analyses  
Primary: The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in ADHD -RS-5 Total Score to 
Week  7 (EOS), will be analyzed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Mea sures ( MMRM ), which 
assumes that missing data are missing at random (MAR). The model will include fixed effect terms 
for baseline ADHD -RS-[ADDRESS_529091] 
(co)variance structure which does not have convergence problem will be used for the analysis 
from the following ordered list: 1) Toeplitz , 2) Autoregressive of order 1 , and  3) Compound 
symmetry . 
The adjust ed mean (LS Mean) of CFB to EOS for ADHD -RS-5 Total Score for each treatment 
group (Placebo, SPN -812 ER 400 mg and SPN -812 ER 600 mg) will be presented, along with the 
corresponding standard error. Each of the active  treatment groups (SPN -812 ER 400 and 
600 mg) will be compared with placebo. The p -values, Least Squares (LS) of treatment means, 
differences between the LS treatment means and placebo, and 95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences will be computed.  
Sensitivity analysis: The sensit ivity analysis assumes that missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores are 
missing not at random (MNAR). Placebo -based multiple imputation will be used to fill in missing 
values . 
Secondary: The secondary analyses will be based on the ITT population with missing values  
imputed using multiple imputation assuming MAR. All secondary analyses will be analyzed using 
ANCOVA at Week 7 (EOS) on the change from baseline at Week 7 (EOS) with treatment and 
baseline  as fixed effect.  
Analyses of key secondary endpoints will be repeated for the PP population.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_385571]. The 
incidence rate , severity, and relationship to SM for all  AEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_419651] n Class  and Preferred Term.

1.1 Background  
Viloxazine hydrochloride (2-[(2-ethoxyphenoxy) methyl] morpholine hydrochloride) is a 
structurally distinct bicyclic norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (NRI) with antagonistic activity 
observed at 5 -HT7 and 5-HT1B receptors and agonistic activity at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C 
receptors . Viloxazine was previously marketed in sever al European countries as an 
antidepressant . Supernus is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_419643] (SPN -812) for potential use 
in the treatment of subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), based on 
the compelling pharmacological properties and favorable safety profile of viloxazine, as 
well as on the current unmet medical need for effective l ong-acting non-stimulant ADHD 
treatment in children and adolescents. 
Compared to other bicyclic antidepressants, viloxazine has generally been found to be 
well tolerated, with no reports of major toxicity during short or long -term research studies.  
Antich olinergic -like effects and sedation have been less marked and less frequent than 
those of the tricyclic antidepressants, but nausea and vomiting have been common 
complaints with the immediate -release (IR) formulation and may be dose-related.  
Viloxazine is similar in structure to reboxetine and atomoxetine and is a racemic mixture 
of two stereoisomers of similar affinities for many important neurotransmitter receptors.  It 
is an inhibitor of the reuptake of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_419644]-related 
functional activities, and although its inhibitory action on serotonin re -uptake appears to 
be weak, viloxazine may facilitate serotonin activity pre- or post -synaptically.  Furthermore, 
viloxazine is known to upregulate GABA B binding sites.  These neurotransmitters have 
been implicated in pathophysiology of ADHD, and drugs that are effective in the treatment 
of ADHD act in noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. 
Viloxazine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_419645]. 
Unchan ged drug is the major component in blood at all times in man and is probably the 
pharmacologically active moiety. Viloxazine is metabolized and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_419646]; there are no known active metabolites. 
1.[ADDRESS_529103] been conducted with SPN -812 IR or ER. An additional  
open label extension study in children  is ongoing . 
Phase 1 Studies 
Phase 1 studies included comparison of SPN-812  ER formulation to an immediate-release 
(IR) formulation at single and multiple doses (812P103), evaluation of maximum tolerable 
doses  and cardiac safety in a single- and multiple-ascending dose study (812P120) , and 
assessment of the effects of food and sprinkling on the relative bioavailability of viloxazine 
(812P105) .  In addition, a [14C]-labelled oral IR solution was used to examine a bsorption, 
metabolism, and excretion of viloxazine in healthy males (812P111 ).

Phase 2 Studies 
The proof-of -concept Phase 1/2 study (812P201 ), compared an IR formulation of SPN-812 
and placebo in a randomized, blinded study, administered three times a day in a dose 
range of 150 to 
300 mg/d in 52 adults (26 per treatment) with ADHD .  In addition to 
assessing the safety and tolerability of SPN -812 IR, scores of both the investigator-rated 
and patient- rated Conner’s’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) were collected at weekly 
intervals during the [ADDRESS_529105] of SPN-812 ER in reducing 
the symptoms of ADHD as measured by [CONTACT_419652]-IV (ADHD-RS -IV).  
Subjects aged 6 -12 years were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio of placebo or active 
treatment (SPN  812 ER  100, 200, 300, or 400  mg) and received  three weeks of titration 
at 100 mg/week followed by [CONTACT_419653] a total of eight weeks 
of therapy.   Mean ADHD -RS-IV Total Scores improved throughout treatment, in all groups.

An initial Phase 2 study demonstrated a 300  mg dose of an immediate- release formulation 
of SPN-812 was able to significantly lower the CAARS total score in adults with ADHD. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
When used for over 20 years as an anti-depressant, the IR form of viloxazine was 
approved at dosages of 200 -600 mg/day.  Although higher doses were occasionally used 
and reported, no clear advantage in efficacy was dem onstrated and a modest decrease 
in tolerability could occur (often related to nausea).  
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In addition to assessing the effect of SPN-812 ER treatment on ADHD symptom reduction, 
the study aims to explore treatment response within other domains of the disorder, 
including functional impa irment and parental stress (Becker, 2011 ; Wiener, 2016 ).  ADHD 
is a chronic, debilitating disorder that  affects many aspects of daily life and has a 
substantial burden on family functioning.  Children with ADHD exhibit a number of 
functional impairments, and the motivation in seeking medical treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_419647], emotional, academic, and familial domains 
(Epstein and Weiss, 2012 ).  Therefore, optimal medical and behavioral management 
should ideally incorporate treatments that do not just improve symptoms of ADHD, but 
improve broader functioning of a patient, especially in the areas of self-esteem, 
educational achievement, and relationships with peers, teachers, and family.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, parallel-group 
study , to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  SPN-812 ER as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adolescents (12-17 years old) with ADHD. Approximately 300 subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio of placebo or one of the two active treatment arms 
(SPN -812 ER 400 or 600  mg). Following up to four weeks of screening, subjects will be 
randomized and undergo two week s of titration followed by [CONTACT_419654] 
a total of seven weeks of treatment and total study duration of up to 9-11 weeks .  The 
study schematic appears in Figure  1. 
Screening (Visit 1):  After administering the informed consent form (ICF; and informed 
assent form  [IAF], if applicable), s ubjects will undergo initial screening evaluation including 
medical and psychiatric history, ECG, vital signs, physical exam ination , routine laboratory 
assessment , PGx sample collection , and urine drug screen .  Data from testing may also 
be used for future research but will not be used for individual genetic characterization. 
ADHD diagnosis will be confirmed, as will all s tudy inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Eligible 
subjects will be scheduled for a Baseline Visit within  [ADDRESS_529108] 2018

4.2 Study Medication Administration 
Each treatment will be administered as a single oral dose, once -a-day (QD), with or without 
food as either intact capsule, or as capsule content sprinkled on soft food.  
4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Group 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at Visit 2 (Baseline) and will receive 
either placebo, SPN -812 ER 400 mg/day, or SPN-812  ER 600 mg/day. 
Allocation of study treatment will occur  centrally via an interactive web response system 
(IWRS) using  a randomization schedule to determine the kit assignment for each  subject 
being randomized.  Each SM kit contains eight dosing cards.  One dosing card will be 
given to the subject at each weekly visit. 
The initial dose may be taken at the clinic during the Baseline Visit, with the next dose 
taken the next morning.   Subjects will be titrated up at 200 mg/week to the final dose 
(1:1:1) as follows:  
Treatment A : Placebo  
Treatment B : SPN -812 ER 400 mg/day ( 2  200 mg SPN-812  ER) 
Treatment C : SPN-812 ER 600 mg/day ( 3  200 mg SPN-812  ER)

5 Study Methods 
5.1 Study Visits and Procedures 
All subjects who are randomized and take the initial dose of SM will be followed according 
to the protocol regardless of the number of doses of SM taken, unless consent for follow-
up is withdrawn.  The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee must be notified of all deviations 
from the protocol visit or procedures, except as noted, and these procedures, if applicable, 
will be rescheduled or performed at the nearest possible time to the original schedule.  
Subjects will be instructed to call study pe rsonnel to report any abnormalities during the 
intervals in between study visits and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is 
needed and as the urgency of the situation indicates.  For emergency and other 
unscheduled visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_385576] -up.

6 STUDY VARIABLES 
6.1  Primary Efficacy Variable 
6.1.1  ADHD -RS-5 
The primary endpoint in this study is the CFB to EOS in the ADHD- RS-5 Total Score. 
The ADHD- RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess 
current ADHD symptomatology as described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manu al of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).  The scale consists of 18 items that 
directly correspond to the 18 DSM-5 symptoms and are further subdivided into two 
subscales: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Inattention (DuPaul, 2016 ).  The ADHD-RS -5 
scale rates the frequency and severity of each symptom on a 4-point Likert-type scale 
from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and allows assessment of functional impairments linked to 
each symptom dimension.  The ADHD-RS -[ADDRESS_529132] commonly 
used measures of drug efficacy in the treatment of ADHD and is the primary outcome 
measure for this study.  The ADHD-RS -5 Home Version: Adolescent instrument will be 
administered and scored by [CONTACT_419656] t hrough  EOS.  
6.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The key secondary efficacy variables include:  
a) CGI-I 
b) Conners 3 – Parent, composite T -score 
c) WFIRS-P average score 
 
Additional secondary variables include: 
a) Proportion of responders with 50% improvement in the ADHD -RS-5 Total score 
(50% Responder rate) 
b) SIPA 
c) ADHD- RS-5 Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale scores  
d) Conners 3 – Self, composite T-score

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.2.1  Clinical Global Impression – Improvement 
The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand- alone assessment of the clinician’s 
view of a subject’s global functioning prior to  and after administration of a SM ( Guy 1976 ).  
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI -S) is a single item clinician rating 
of clinician’s assessment of the severity of the ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician’s 
total experience with patients with ADHD.  The Clinical Global Impression – Improvement 
Scale (CGI- I) is an assessment of how much the patient’s illness has improved or 
worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning o f treatment. Both CGI -S and CGI -I 
are rated on a 7- point scale of 1 to 7 with 7 being “extremely ill” or “very much worse”, 
respectively.  Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overal l score in subsequent

 CGI-S will be evaluated by [CONTACT_385578] a 7 -poin t 
scale with 1=Normal, 2=Borderline ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill, 
6=Severely ill, and 7=Extremely ill. 
 CGI-I, relative to the condition at baseline, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_385579]-baseline visi t on a 7-point scale with 1=Very much improved, 2=Much

6.2.[ADDRESS_529134] Edition™ (Conners 3) is a focused diagnostic tool for assessment of 
ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children ages 6 to 
18 years (Sparrow, 2010 ). The scale is based on the solid findings and key elements of 
its predecessor, the Conners' Rating Scales –Revised  (CRS –R™), but offers a more 
refined assessment of ADHD and comorbid disorders  (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder 
and conduct disorder). The Conners 3 instrument includes items related to inattention, 
hyperactivity, and impulsivity, as well as assessment s of executive functioning, learning 
problems, and relationships. Like previous versions, the Conners 3 combines teacher, 
parent, and student reports to provide a particularly detailed and comprehensive 
evaluation of student behavior as observed in different settings. Teacher, parent, and self -
report (for 8- 18 year-olds ) rating scales are all available in long and short versions.  The 
short forms of Parent, Teacher, and Self Reports of Conners 3 are comprised 
(respectively) of 45, 41, and 41 items.  All Con ners 3 scale versions are scored on a 
4-point scale (0-3), where a higher score indicates more severe symptom presentation. 
The Conners  3 – Parent:  Short, and Conners  3 – Self -Report:  Short assessments will be 
performed at Visit 2 (Baseline) and at Visit  9 (EOS).  
6.2.3  WFIRS-P 
The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (WFIRS) instrument evaluates ADHD-
related functional impairment  (Gajria, 2015 ; Thompson, 2017 ).  This scale allows the 
clinician to assess to what degree a patient’s behavior and emotional problems affect 
his/her ability to accomplish daily tasks and interactions  and helps to identify specific areas 
of difficulty.  The scale has been validated in the ADHD population.  The parent -based 
version (WFIRS-P) completed by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian of a child is used in this study and 
comprises 50 items grouped into six domains: Family, School (learning and behavior), Life 
Skills, Child’s Self -Concept, Social Activities, and Risky Activities.  The items relate to the 
past month and are scored using a 4-point Likert scale.  Higher WFIRS-P scores indicate 
more severe functional impairment.   
This instrument will be completed at Baseline and EOS by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver.

The Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA) is a screening and diagnostic 
instrument that identifies areas of stress in parent- adolescent interactions and is 
appropriate for parents of adolescents aged 11 -19 years  (Sheras, 1998 ).  The SIPA scale 
is a 112 -item questionnaire that yields scores across three domains (Adolescent Domain, 
Parent Domain, and Adolescent-Parent Domain) and the Life Stressors Scale.  The 
Adolescent and Parent Domains are further subdivided into four subscales that focus on 
the parent‘s perception of their child’s personality and on the parent’s characteristics and 
behaviors.  The Life Stressor Scale assesses external life factors contributing to stress 
experienced by a parent. The Index of Total Parenting Stress (TS) is the composite score 
of all items across all domains and reflects the total stress experienced as a function of 
parenting a particular adolescent.   
The SIPA questionnaire will be completed at Baseline and at EOS by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver.

Schedule of Events and Assessments. 
6.4 Adverse Events 
As defined by [CONTACT_419657] G ood Clinical Practice (GCP) , an adverse event (AE) 
is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
• Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease. 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in 
symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation from SM. 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline.  
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require 
surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected 
during the study period.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Suspected adverse drug reactions (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which 
there is evidence to sugg est a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, i.e., there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.   
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event.  
6.4.2  Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are screened (Visit 1) will be questioned regarding the occurrence of AEs.  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek information on AEs by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all AEs should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event 
module of the eCRF. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results should b e recorded in the source document, though they may be 
grouped under one diagnosis.  For example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest 
X-ray, etc., can all be reported as “pneumonia”.  
All AEs occurring after screening and throughout the study period must be recorded.  A 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug is taken, or that worsened following first administration of study 
drug.  All AEs in this study will be recorded after administration of SM, therefore all will be 
treatment-emergent. The clinical course of each AE should be followed until resolution or 
until, in the medical judgment of the Investigator, the event has stabilized or is assessed 
as chronic.  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
• Serious vs. Non -serious: Is the event a S erious Adverse Event (SAE)? 
• Causality: Was AE related or possibly related to the SM?  
• Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by [CONTACT_1149]? 
6.4.[ADDRESS_529138] and the response to treatment 
in order that he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  Severity refers 
to the accumulated intensity of discomfort/impairment of health since the last recording of 
AEs and will be assessed according to the following criteria: 
• Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated 
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may 
warra nt intervention 
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness. 
6.4.4  Criteria for Assessing Causality  
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the administration 
of SM and the occurrence of an AE as not suspected or as a suspected reaction to SM.  
These are defined as follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. • Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or 
implausible, or there is an evident other cause. 
• Unlikely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal  
relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Possibly related:   Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event.  
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  This will be reported 
as a Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
• Definitely related : Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, and 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event.  The 
response to withdrawal of the medication (dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible. The event must b e definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) . 
6.4.[ADDRESS_529140] is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• life-threatening  AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred.  This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.) 
• in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5183] o f existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may 
jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a 
seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385569] . 
6.4.[ADDRESS_529141] complete an SAE Form and include a detailed 
description of the SAE, as well as other available information pertinent to the case (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], autopsy reports and other relevant documents).  The investigator will 
keep a copy of this SAE Report form on file at the study site.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. The Investigator or study physician, after thorough consideration of all facts that are 
available, must include an assessment of causality of an AE to SM in the report to the 
Sponsor.  
Follow -up information, or new information available after the initial report, should be 
actively sought and reported to the Sponsor , as it becomes available using the SAE Report

Pregnancy should be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form.  The Investigator should 
discuss the case with the Medical Monitor; the Investigator must follow any pregnant 
subject for [ADDRESS_529144] becoming aware of the event. 
6.4.8  Sponsor Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs  
The Sponsor will inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., within 
specific timeframes).  For this reason, it is imperative that study sites submit SAE 
information to the Sponsor in the manner described above. 
Investigators must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Investigators must also submit 
the safety information provided by [CONTACT_419658]. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to notify all participating investigators, in a written 
IND safety report, of any SADR that is both serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor will 
also notify participating investigators of any findings from other sources (other studies, 
animal and in vitro testing, etc.) that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  Such 
findings will typi[INVESTIGATOR_345652]- related changes in the study protocol, Informed 
Consent, and/or Investigator’s Brochure.  
6.5 Treatment-Emergent Suicidal Ideation 
Prospective assessment of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior is a mandatory part of 
the safety evaluations for any drug developed for a psychiatric indication (FDA Guidance 
for Industry: Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Prospective Assessment of Occurrence in 
Clinical Trials, 2012).  In this study, the initial evaluation of subjects will be cond ucted prior 
to enrollment to assess lifetime suicidal ideation and to identify subjects who must not 
participate in the trial due to pre -existing suicidality risk.  The assessment will then be 
repeated at each subsequent study visit to monitor the occurren ce of new suicidal and 
self-injurious tendencies.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.5.1  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)  
Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior will be conducted using the Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  The C-SSRS is an FDA-recommended 
prospective assessment instrument that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior 
events into [ADDRESS_529146]’s safety.  If a disclosure of suicidal ideation is revealed as 
part of the C -SSRS questionnaire or when a subject spontaneously expresses that he/she 
may be a threat to him/herself, the study team should be prepared to quickly evaluate the 
event and to determine the appropriate course of action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Suicide Risk 
Any indication of suicidal ideation should be evaluated as soon as possible by 
[CONTACT_65384]. The Investigator is responsible for making the final judgment 
regarding potential suicide risk and need subsequent action.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acute Suicidal Crisis 
A person evaluated as being at high risk should be transferred to an immediate care 
facility. The Investigator will guide intervention as clinically indicated and follow up with 
the subject within one week and/or refer him/her to a qualified mental health professional.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-acute Suicidal Risk 
The Investigator will conduct safety planning with the subject and will follow up within 
one week. 
 
Reference materials for subjects and caregivers should include lists of mental health 
organizations and professionals, outpatient behavioral services, local crisis and peer 
support groups and Suicide/Crisis Hotlines. 
6.6  Clinical Measurements 
6.6.1  Laboratory Tests   
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a central laboratory as specified in the 
reference binder.  
Details for collecting, handling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_128876] (including shipment addresses) will 
be detailed in a separate clinical laboratory manual.  The Schedule of Events and 
Assessments ( Table  2) shows the time points at which blood and urine samples will be 
collected for clinical laboratory tests (and plasma concentration levels for those subjects 
that choose to participate in the PK substudy).

7 STATISTICAL METHODS 
7.1 General Considerations 
All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher by , which is 
the designated CRO.  will be responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a unique program for each 
TLF to create a TLF report and deliver to Supernus at the completion of the study.  
All tabulations of analysis results will include summaries for the following three treatments: 
SPN-812 ER 600 mg, SPN-812 ER 400 mg, and placebo. 
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency count and 
percent for categorical variables, and number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum for contin uous variables) .  
Categorical variables will be analyzed using categorical response methods such as 
Pearson’s Chi -square test. If expected frequencies are less than [ADDRESS_529148] identifier.  All 
data available from the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be listed. Unscheduled 
measurements will be excluded from the descriptive statistics and statistical analysis but 
will be included in listings.  
Complete details of the statistical analysis will be provided in a separate statistical analysis 
plan (SAP). The statistical analysis methods described in the SAP will supersede the 
statistical methods described in this protocol. 
7.[ADDRESS_529149] to the primary analysis, missing ADHD-RS -5 Total Scores will be assumed 
to be missing at random (MAR), that is, given the observed data, the reason for the missing 
data does not depend on the unseen data. The Mixed Model for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM)  method, implemented via SAS® PROC MIXED (SAS/STAT Software), will be 
used for handling missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores under MAR assumption . Under MAR, 
the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but is related 
to some of the observed data.  
The sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed by [CONTACT_419659]- RS-5 Total Scores are missing not at random (MNAR) meaning that the 
probability that an observation is missing may depend on its underlying unobserved value.  
For analysis of secondary endpoints, missing values will be assumed as MAR. 
For safety analyses, missing dates for AEs and  non-study medication use will be imputed 
as described in the SAP. Missing data for all other safety endpoints will not be imputed.  
7.3 Analysis Populations

7.4 Demographics and Baseline Analysis 
Demographic/baseline variables includ ing age, age group, sex, ethnicity, race, height and 
weight at screeni ng, and BMI will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables and using counts and percentages for categorical variables.   The descriptive 
summary will be presented by [CONTACT_419660] .  
Baseline disease characteristics will include ADHD -RS-5 Total score, subscale scores, 
and hyperactivity/impulsivity score. These will be summarized for the ITT population. 
Baseline comparability among the trea tment groups will be summarized using a 
chi-square test for categorical variables and F-test for continuous variables. P-values will 
be used for descriptive purposes only.

7.8 Efficacy Analysis  
7.8.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in ADHD-RS -5 Total Score to Week  7 
(EOS) , will be analyzed using MMRM, which assumes that missing data are MAR. The 
model will include fixed effect terms for baseline ADHD- RS-[ADDRESS_529155] (co)variance structure 
which does not have convergence problem will be used for the analysis from the following 
ordered list: 1) Toeplitz , 2) Autoregressive of order 1 , and  3) Compound symmetry. 
The adjusted mean (LS Mean) of CFB to EOS for ADHD-RS -5 Total Score for each 
treatment group (Placebo, SPN-812 ER 400 mg and SPN-812 ER 600 mg) will be 
presented, along with the corresponding standard error. Each of the treatment groups 
(SPN -812 ER 400 and 600 mg) will be compared with placebo. The p -values, Least 
Squares (LS) of treatment mea ns, differences between the LS treatment means and 
placebo, and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be computed.  
To maintain the Type I error rate at 5% level, a sequential testing ( Westfall et al,1999 ) of 
the null hypotheses H01: No treatment mean difference between SPN-812 ER 600 mg 
group and placebo group and H 02: No treatment mean difference between SPN-[ADDRESS_529156] 2018

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. [IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity Analyses 
The sensitivity analysis assumes that missing ADHD- RS-5 Total Scores are MNAR. 
Placebo -based multiple imputation will be used to fill in missing values. This approach 
may be considered “worst -case” sensitivity analyses as it assumes that after 
discontinuation, subjects from the active treatment arms would adopt the outcome model 
estimated from the placebo arm. The placebo-based imputation will be implemented as 
described in the SAP . 
7.8.2  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary analyses will be based on the ITT po pulation with missing values imputed 
using multiple imputation assuming MAR. 
 
All secondary analyses will be analyzed using ANCOVA at Week 7 (EOS) on the change 
from baseline at Week 7 ( EOS ) with treatment and baseline as fixed effect. Each of the 
treatment groups (SPN-812 ER 400 mg and 600 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. 
The p-values, Least Squares means of the treatment groups, di fferences between the LS 
treatment means and placebo (SPN-812 ER 400 mg minus Placebo and SPN- 812 ER 600 
mg minus Placebo), and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be 
computed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Key secondary efficacy analyses 
The analyses of key sec ondary objectives will be conducted on the following sequentially 
ordered endpoints  for testing: 1) CGI-I, 2) Conners 3 - Parent composite T-score, and 
3) WFIRS-P. 
To pr eserve the overall type I error rate at 0.[ADDRESS_529157] H 01 (i.e., the 600 mg is not superior to 
placebo) or the primary endpoint analysis rejects only H 01, then no multiplicity adjustment 
is required. Otherwise, multiplicity adjustment will be performed with the following features. 
The first of the secondary endpoints (CGI-I) will be used to test each treatment group to 
placebo using a sequential testing of the null hypotheses H 01: No treatment mean 
difference between SPN -812 ER 600 mg group and placebo group and H 02: No treatment 
mean difference between SPN-812 ER 400 mg group and placebo group will be 
performed. If H 01 is not rejected, then H 02 will not be tested and the conclusion will be that 
neither dose groups are efficacious. If H 01 is rejected, then H 02 will be tested. If H 02 is 
rejected, then it will be concluded that both SPN -812 ER 600 mg and SPN-812 ER 400 mg 
are superior to Placebo. If H 02 is not rejected, then it will be concluded that only SPN-812 
ER 600 mg is superior to placebo. Then, the sec ond secondary endpoint (Conners 3) will 
be tested in the same manner but only using those doses that were retained from the 
primary and the first secondary endpoint. Finally, the third key secondary endpoint 
(WFIRS-P) will be tested in the same manner but only using those doses that were 
retained from the primary, the first key secondary endpoint, and the second key secondary 
endpoints.  
a) CGI-I – The absolute value of CGI-I at Week 7 ( EOS ) will be analyzed using 
ANCOVA with treatment as a fixed classification var iable and baseline CGI-S as a 
covariate. To compare the treatment groups, the difference in LS means (SPN-
812 ER 400 mg minus Placebo and SPN-812 ER 600 mg minus Placebo) will be

600 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The p-values, Least Squares means, 
differences between the LS treatment means and placebo, and 95% confidence 
intervals for the treatme nt differences will be computed. 
c) WFIRS-P - The change from baseline in WFIRS-P to Week 7 (EOS) will be 
analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and baseline as a 
covariate. Missing Subscale scores and Total Score will be handled using multiple 
imputation under MAR assumption for inferential analyses. Each of the treatment 
groups (SPN -812 ER 400 mg and 600 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The 
p-values, LS means of treatment groups, differences between the LS means and 
placebo, and 95% confi dence intervals for the treatment differences will be 
computed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Additional secondary analyses  
Additional secondary analyses of the secondary efficacy variables will include : 
a) 50% Responder rate for ADHD-RS- 5 - Percent reduction will be calculated as:  % 
reduction =  100*(ADHD-RS -5 Total Score at Week 7 (EOS) - Baseline ADHD -RS-
5 Total Score)/Baseline ADHD-RS -5 Total Score. The proportion of responders 
will be presented for each treatment group. The 2-sided 95% CI around the 
difference in proportions (SP N-812 ER 400 mg minus Placebo, SPN-812 ER 
600 mg minus Placebo) and the p- value from Pearson’s Chi -squared Test or 
Fisher’s Exact Test  will be presented .  
b) SIPA - The change from baseline in SIPA total score to Week 7 (EOS) will be 
analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and baseline as a 
covariate. Each of the treatment groups (SPN-812 ER 400 mg and 600 mg) will be 
compared with the Placebo. The p-values, LS means of treatment groups, 
differences b etween the LS means and placebo will be presented. 
c) ADHD- RS-5 Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales - The primary 
analysis for ADHD-RS -5 Total score will be repeated for the change from baseline 
to EOS in ADHD -RS-5 Inattention and the change from baseline to Week 7 (EOS) 
in Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales.

Exploratory analyses of the key exploratory efficacy variables will include: 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
7.9 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
Seventy -two subjects per treatment group in the ITT population will yield 90% power at a 
significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) using a two-sample t-test with equal allocation to the 
treatment groups . This assumes an effect size of 0.547, which was observed in the 
comparison of SPN-812 200 mg and placebo in the SPN 812 Phase IIb study (based on 
the CFB to endpoint in the ADHD-RS -IV total score) and will maintain consistency in the 
sample size assumption used between this clinical trial and the SPN-812 P302 study (e.g., 
across the S PN-812 clinical trials in the adolescent population). A total of 300 subjects 
(100 subjects in each of the three  treatment groups) will be randomized to account for an 
anticipated 27.9% of randomized subjects not completing the study.  
7.10 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed. 
7.11 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Plasma concentrations for viloxazine (and 5-hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide, If applicable) 
will be provided. 
 
  Population PK data analysis will be performed using 
nonlinear mixed -effects modeling program (NONMEM ). The structural model for 
viloxazine (and 5-hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide, if applicable) may include data from 
studies in which sampling was more intensive than in the present study.  Inclusion of 
covariates in the pharmacokinetic model will be accomplished through a systematic 
process.   For each NONMEM run, covariate graphics will be  examined for relationships 
between covariates and the post hoc etas.  Covariates of interest will include (but not be 
limited to) age, gender, body size, etc. Population PK analyses will be reported sep arately 
from the clinical study report.

IND # 108,864 
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS 
This amendment incorporates the following protocol revisions: 
 Updates and clarifications to the secondary and exploratory objectives and endpoints  
 Increase in sample size 
 Revisions and clarifications to the Statistical Methods sections (based on the revised Statistical 
Analysis Plan) 
   
 Expanded concomitant medications prohibitions to include CYP1A2 substrates 
 Other minor editorial and administrative changes to improve clarity and correct errors 
 
RATIONALE  
1. The 812P304 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was revised and updated based on FDA review 
comments (FDA Advice Letter dated 19 July 2018, Ref ID 4294123).   The protocol was amended to 
reflect the changes in the revised SAP, including the following updates: 
 The secondary objectives and endpoints were updated and clarified to identify those considered 
“key” for data analysis and interpretation purposes. The exploratory objectives and endpoints 
were updated accordingly. 
 To maintain consistency across similar study protocols and to increase the probability of 
success, the same effect size from the SPN-812 ER 200 mg and placebo in the SPN-812 ER Phase 
IIb study was used for the power calculation for 812P304, and the sample size was increased 
accordingly.  
 Methods for handling missing data and for conducting the sensitivity analyses were revised (e.g., 
the LOCF method will no longer be used).

  Clarifications were made to the definitions of the analysis populations and to the subject 
disposition categories. 
 The section on the primary endpoint analysis was updated to include a fixed effect of age group 
and to provide new details with respect to the analysis of covariance (per FDA suggestion ).  
 The Secondary Efficacy Analyses Sections were expanded to include descriptions of the key 
secondary analyses , additional secondary analyses, and subgroup analyses.  The Exploratory 
Analyses section was also added for the newly identified exploratory efficacy variables.

The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand -alone assessment of the 
clinician’s view  of a subject’s global functioning prior to and after administration of a 
SM ( Guy 1976 ).  The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI -S) is a single 
item clinician rating of clinician’s assessment of the severity of  the ADHD symptoms in 
relation to the clinician’s total experience with patients with ADHD.  The Clinical Global 
Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI -I) is an assessment of how much the patient’s 
illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state  at the beginning of 
treatment. Both CGI -S and CGI -I are rated on a 7 -point scale of 1 to 7 with 7 being 
“extremely ill” or “very much worse”, respectively.  Successful therapy is indicated by a 
lower overall score in subsequent testing.  
 CGI-S will be eval uated by [CONTACT_385578] a 7 -point 
scale with 1=Normal, 2=Borderline ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill,

For primary efficacy analysis, missing data 
will be assumed as Missing at Random

Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
technique according to the MMRM 
paradigm. U nder MAR, the propensity for 
a data point to be missing is not related to 
the missing data, but is related to some  of 
the observed data.  For secondary and first 
sensitivity analyses, the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) method of 
imputation will be used. The underlying 
assumption for using the LOCF method is 
based on the fact that 35% of subjects 
early terminat ed (ET) before completion 
of the Phase II [ADDRESS_529200] 
dropout in the Phase III trial will follow the 
same pattern and hence, the assumption

Key secondary analyses will include:  
a) Conners 3 - Treatment comparisons 
will be performed using ANCOVA or 
ANOVA on CFB to EOS, as appropriate.  
b) 30% Responder Rate - The proportion 
of subjects with ≥30% improvement 
(decrease) from baseline to  EOS in 
ADHD -RS-V Total Score  will be 
calculated for each treatment group. 
The 2 -sided 95% CI around the 
difference in proportions (SPN -812 ER 
dose minus Placebo) and the p -value 
from Pearson’s chi -squared test will be 
presented.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Key secondary efficacy  analyses, 
p.39  
Key secondary analyses will include:  
The analyses of key secondary objectives 
will be conducted on the following 
sequentially ordered endpoin ts for testing: 
1) CGI -I, 2) Conners  3 - Parent composite 
T-score, and 3)  WFIRS -P. 
To preserve the overall type I error rate at 
0.[ADDRESS_529226] H 01 (i.e., 
the 600 mg is not superior to placebo) or 
the primary endpoint analysis rejects only 
H01, then  no multiplicity adjustment is 
required. Otherwise, multiplicity 
adjustment will be performed with the 
following features.  
The first of the secondary endpoints (CGI -
I) will be used to test each treatment 
group to placebo using a sequential 
testing of the n ull hypotheses H 01: No 
treatment mean difference between SPN -
812 ER 600 mg group and placebo group 
and H 02: No treatment mean difference 
between SPN -812 ER 400 mg group and 
placebo group will be performed. If H 01 is 
not rejected, then H 02 will not be teste d 
and the conclusion will be that neither 
dose groups are efficacious. If H 01 is 
rejected, then H 02 will be tested. If H 02 is 
rejected, then it will be concluded that 
both SPN -812 ER 600 mg and SPN -812 ER 
400 mg are superior to Placebo. If H 02 is 
not rejec ted, then it will be concluded that 
only SPN -812 ER 600 mg is superior to 
placebo. Then, the second secondary 
endpoint (Conners 3) will be tested in the 
same manner but only using those doses 
that were retained from the primary and 
the first secondary endp oint. Finally, the 
third key secondary endpoint (WFIRS -P) Updated for

using those doses that were retained from 
the primary, the first key secondary 
endpoint, and the second key secondary 
endpoints.  
a) CGI-I – The absolute va lue of CGI -I at 
Week 7 ( EOS) will be analyzed using 
ANCOVA with treatment  as a fixed 
classification variable and baseline CGI -S 
as a covariate . To compare the treatment 
groups, the difference in LS means (SPN -
812 ER 400 mg minus Placebo and SPN -812 
ER 600 mg minus Placebo) will be 
presented along with the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) around the difference and p -
value.  
b) Conners 3 - Parent  - Treatment 
comparisons will be performed usin g 
ANCOVA or ANOVA on CFB to EOS  as 
appropriate.  A composite T -score will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_419668], and the change from baseline to 
Week 7  (EOS) in the composite T -score will 
be analyzed using ANCOVA model with 
fixed effects for treatment and baseline as 
a covariate. Each of the treatment groups 
(SPN -812 E R 400 mg and 600 mg) will be 
compared with the Placebo. The p -values, 
Least Squares means, differences between 
the LS treatment means and placebo, and 
95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences will be computed.  
b) 30% Responder Rate  The prop ortion of 
subjects with ≥30% improvement

value from Pea rson’s chi -squared test will 
be presented. c) WFIRS -P - The change 
from baseline in WFIRS -P to Week 7  (EOS) 
will be analyzed using ANCOVA model 
with fixed effects for treatment and 
baseline as a covariate. Missing Subscale 
scores and Total Score will be handled 
using multiple imputation under MAR

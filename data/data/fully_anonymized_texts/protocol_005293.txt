Social  and Biological  Sciences  
Study  Instruments  
Discuss the particulars of the research instruments, questionnaires and other evaluation instruments in  
detail. Provide validation documentation and or procedures to be used to validate instruments. For well  
know  and generally  accepted  test instruments  the detail  here can be brief.  More  detail  may be required  
for a novel  or new instrument.  For ethnographic  studies  identify  any study instruments  to be used (i.e. 
for deception studies) and describe in detail where, when and how the study will be conducted and who  
or what are the subjects of study. Note: For more information on how to conduct ethical and valid  
ethnographic  research,  follow  the link For oral historie s or interviews  provide  the general  framework  
for questioning and means of data collection. If interviews or groups settings are to be audio taped or  
video taped describe in detail the conditions under which it will take place. Include a copy of any novel  
or new test instruments  with the IRB  submission.  
Study instruments  will be e-mails  sent to patients,  employees,  and/or  students  through the institution  
that is contact[CONTACT_769274]. E-mails  will always  contain basic  information  about  
COVID Alert PA and a link to download -  they will also include message variations based on what the  
institution wants to test, including messages emphasizing data privacy and security, social norming,  
individual vs. community protection, and more. See atta ched file for a sample draft message and  
variation.  
 
Group Modifications  
Describe  necessary  changes  that will or have been made  to the study instruments  for different  groups. 
Groups  will all receive the  basic  e-mail with  background information  on COVID Alert  PA and a 
download link. Messages  will vary between  groups  with message  variations  including emphasizing  data 
privacy and security,  social  norming, individual  vs. community  protection,  and more.  
 
Method  for Assigning  Subjects  to Groups  
Describe  how subjects  will be randomized  to groups.  
Institutions will be responsible for selecting the group of subjects within their institution to send e -mails  
to, and will randomize  from  that group to [ADDRESS_1055564]  with randomization  
recommendations as needed.  
 
Administration  of Surve ys and/or  Process  
Describe the approximate time and frequency for administering surveys and/or evaluations. For surveys, 
questionnaires and evaluations presented to groups and in settings such as high schools, focus group  
sessions or community treatment centers explain how the process will be administered and who will  
oversee the process. For instance, discuss the potential issues of having teachers and other school  
personnel administer instruments to minors who are student s especially if the content is sensitive in  
nature. Describe the procedure for audio and videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_405567]/or focus groups and  
the storage  of the tapes.  For instance,  if audio tape recording is to be used in a classroom  setting,  
describ e how this will be managed  if individuals  in the class  are not participating  in the study. Explain 
if the research  involves  the review  of records  (including  public  databases  or registries) with identifiable  
Page  5 of 13  private information. If so, describe the type of information gathered from the records and if identifiers  
will be collected and retained with the data after it is retrieved. Describe the kinds of identifiers to be  
obtained, (i.e. names,  social  security  numbers)  and how long the identifiers  will be retained  and 
justification for use.  
E-mails  will be  sent through  the institutions  directly.  
 
Data  Management  
Describe how and who manages confidential data, including how and where it will be stored and 
analyzed. For instance, describe if paper or electronic report forms will be used, how corrections to the  
report form will be made, how data will be entered into any database, and the person(s) responsible for  
creating  and maintaining  the research  database.  Describe  the use of pseudonyms, code numbers  and 
how listing  of such  identifiers will be  kept  separate from  the research  data.  
Data reported back to the research team will include open rate of e -mails, click through rate of e -mails,  
and any deidentified demographic information associated with these rates that is available from the  
institution.  No confidential  or identifiable  information  will be shared  with our research  team.  All 
information  and data  received  back  from  institutions  will be  stored  on Penn  Box.

Protocol  
Abstract  
PA DOH rolled out a digital contact [CONTACT_144842]/exposure notification app statewide in September called 
COVID Alert  PA. Digital contact  [CONTACT_769278] a person testing positive for COVID -19. We will deploy  
message testing  via e-mail to better  understand what  motivates  people  to download the app, at 
institutions  ranging from  health  systems,  to colleges  and universities,  to employers  in the state of PA. 
The results  of the research  will be used to aid in the uptake  of COVID Alert  PA across  the 
Page  [ADDRESS_1055567] to increase downloads  of COVID Alert  PA by a 
variety of  groups, including  patients,  students, and employees  of PA state  employers.  
 
Primary  outcome  variable(s)  
The primary  outcome  variable  is click  through rate to the download link embedded  in e-mails.  
 
Secondary  outcome  variable(s)  
Open  rate of e-mails.  
 
Background  
The Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania  released  a digital contact  [CONTACT_144842]/exposure  notification  app 
(COVID  Alert  PA) statewide  in early  September  to aid in the COVID- [ADDRESS_1055568] name, location, or movements and the data is collected and stored only on the phone itself  
until the person choose  to release it. Through IRB#  [ADDRESS_1055569] to increase uptake.  
 
Study  Design  
Phase*  
Not applicable  
 
Design  
Participants  will be randomized  as to what  message  they receive in their e-mail; as all communication  
will be  done via  e-mail, this  is considered  internet research.  
 
Study  duration  
This study will be ongoing for the duration of the COVID Alert PA app deployment, currently estimated  
to run through 06/30/2021. A subject's participation depends on the amount of time it take for them to  
read the e- mail and click through to download, if they choose; estimated at 3- [ADDRESS_1055570]  and complete  the research.  Please  confirm  that there  are adequate facilities  for 
the research.

allowed  in a tweet)  and any appropriate  confidentiality  practices  necessary  to be compliant  with posting  
Page  10 of 13  research  recruitment  text.*  
Message testing  is likely  to include  subjects  in a variety  of roles  at Penn  such as Penn  Medicine  
patients,  undergraduate  students, employees  of Penn Vet,  and any other  department  or org that is 
interested  in message testing.  Therefore,  Penn  communications  or marketing  may be involved  in 
sending the e-mails  out to subjects,  however, there  is no recruitment  to the study in a traditional sense,  
as we are simply measuring link  clicks in  e-mails.

Waiver  or alteration  of required  elements  of consent  
 
Minimal  Risk*  
The research  involves  no more  than minimal risk - participants  will be sent e-mails  from  their 
institution recommending COVID  Alert PA, including  a link to  download.  
 
Impact  on Subject  Rights  and Welfare*  
Subjects are not required to open the e -mail, read the e -mail, or click on the link in the e -mail, similar to  
any other  e-mail campaign  they may receive from  their institution.  Link clicks  are commonly tracked  
by [CONTACT_510599], and do not  require  written  consent  outside  of the research  context.  
 
Waiver Essential  to Research*  
In our prior study -  IRB# [ADDRESS_1055576] asked  people  what  they may do, or are likely  to do, 
if presented with the opportunity to download COVID Ale rt PA.  In this context, we want to measure  
what  people  would  actually  do when  provided  the opportunity to download as suggested  by [CONTACT_769283] e -mail. Without a waiver of consent, subjects may be influenced in their response via the  
process  of being  informed  about  the research  and going through  the consent  process.

1. Summary - Title
Protocol Title
An Open Label Trial of Growth Hormone in Children and Adolescents with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Targeting
 Social Withdrawal
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_659393]: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a genetic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated
 with developmental delay and hypotonia. IGF-[ADDRESS_889394] (ABC) and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Growth
 hormone (GH) binds to its receptor and initiates a cascade of events which directly increases synthesis and release
 of IGF-1 levels. 
HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that rise in IGF-1 stimulated by [CONTACT_221485] (GH) administration should produce
 the same improvement in behavior in children and adolescents with Phelan McDermid Syndrome as previously
 demonstrated  with use of IGF-1. 
RESEARCH PLAN: We seek to recruit [ADDRESS_889395]
 thorough history and physical evaluations prior to, during and following the trial. 
SIGNIFICANCE: Autism is a severe lifelong neuro-developmental disorder. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_659394]-[ADDRESS_889396] be explored.

3. Summary - Background
Objectives
1. To evaluate if growth hormone will adequately elevate IGF-1 levels within 12 weeks of therapy.
Hypothesis: Growth hormone will cause a rise in IGF-1 levels within 12 weeks of therapy.
2. To evaluate efficacy of growth hormone induced elevation in IGF1 on social withdrawal as the primary outcome
 measure using the ABC – Social Withdrawal subscale (Aman et al., 1985). 
Hypothesis: Growth hormone will produce the same effects in improvement in social withdrawal as compared to
 IGF-1. 
3. To evaluate efficacy of Growth hormone induced elevation in IGF1 on repetitive behaviors using the Repetitive
 Behavior Scale-Revised (Bodfish), sensory reactivity using the Short Sensory Profile (Dunn) and the Sensory
 Assessment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (Siper et al., 2017), and hyperactivity using the ABC-Hyperactivity
 subscale.
Hypothesis: Growth hormone will be associated with improvement across all outcomes comparable with the use of
 IGF-1.
4. To evaluate the effect of growth hormone therapy on visual evoked potentials and auditory event related potentials
 in children with Phelan McDermid Syndrome. 
Hypothesis: Growth hormone will be associated with similar changes in visual evoked potentials and auditory event
 related potentials following [ADDRESS_889397] been major changes in the understanding of the etiology of autism spectrum disorders
 (ASD) and many genes associated with ASD have been identified. This has led to a profound shift in thinking, such
 that ASD can now be conceived of as having multiple independent causes, which in many cases can be largely
 attributed to a specific etiological genetic event. One such example is the 22q13 deletion syndrome, also called
 Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), characterized by [CONTACT_659417], hypotonia, delayed or absent
 speech, and ASD features, for which convincing evidence implicates SHANK3 as the critical gene (Bonaglia et
 al, 2006). SHANK3 codes for a master scaffolding protein which forms the framework in glutamatergic synapses
 (Boeckers et al, 2006) and makes up the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Recent studies exploring the rate
 of 22q13 deletions/SHANK3 mutations suggest that haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 can cause a monogenic form of
 ASD and intellectual disability with a frequency of up to 2% of ASD cases (Durand et al, 2007; Moessner et al, 2007;
 Gauthier et al, 2008; LeBlond et al., 2015). Although SHANK3 mutations and deletions account for a relatively small
 proportion of ASD cases, recent evidence suggests that this variant may be treatable, and therefore important to
 identify. 
Work on PMS at our Center began with Shank3-deficient mice showing a reduction in basal neurotransmission
 reflecting decreased glutamate (i.e., AMPA receptor-mediated) transmission. Long-term potentiation was impaired
 with no significant change in long-term depression (Bozdagi et al., 2010), and intraperitoneal injection of IGF-1
 reversed the electrophysiological and motor deficits seen in the Shank3-deficient mice (Bozdagi et al., 2013). 
Our clinical group began prospectively evaluating patients with PMS using standard evaluation tools in 2010; [ADDRESS_889398] published
 descriptive results from 32 patients thus far, 27 of whom (84%) met criteria for ASD using a priori definitions derived
 from expert consensus commonly used in ASD research (Soorya et al., 2013). Subsequently, we began a controlled
 trial of IGF-1 in PMS and provided evidence of improvement in core ASD symptoms (Kolevzon et al., 2014) using the
 Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC; Aman et al., 1985) and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish
 et al., 2000). IGF-1 also reversed phenotypic and electrophysiological changes in human neuronal models of PMS
 (Shcheglovitov et al., 2013) and iASD (Marchetto et al., 2016), providing additional support for this intervention.
IGF-1 enters the brain from the circulation where it is released mainly by [CONTACT_659418].
 Blood-borne IGF-1 is found in the CNS and promotes brain vessel growth (Lopez-Lopez et al., 2004), neurogenesis,
 and synaptogenesis (O'Kusky et al., 2000). Once IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor, activation of the PI3K/mTOR/
AKT1 and MAPK/ERK pathways induces its downstream effects (Costales & Kolevzon, 2016). A recent study in Rett
 syndrome provides evidence of IGF-1 brain penetrance: cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_659395]-1 levels after treatment (Khwaja et al., 2014). 
The proposed clinical trial seeks to collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_659396]-[ADDRESS_889399] positive
 effects on social withdrawal, repetitive behaviors, sensory reactivity, and hyperactivity. There is currently no
 treatment available for PMS and the use of growth hormone may be practical and effective.
Growth hormone binds to its receptor and initiates a cascade of events which involves transcription of several genes
 resulting in rise of IGF-1. (Vottero et al., 2013, Hormone Resistance and Hypersensitivity; Ashpole et al., 2015,
 Experimental Gerontology). We hypothesize that increase in IGF-1 stimulated by [CONTACT_659419]-1 (Kolevzon et al., 2014). 
Growth hormone is an easily available drug whose safety profile has been studied since 1985 (Ranke et al.; 2018).
 The experience with growth hormone has shown that it is well tolerated by [CONTACT_659420]-1. Hypoglycemia is not associated with growth hormone therapy while it is a serious adverse
 event with IGF-[ADDRESS_889400] on the
 behavior of these children.  
Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints
1. Improvement in social withdrawal following growth hormone administration measured using the ABC - Social
 Withdrawal Subscale and repetitive behavior using the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised.
2.Improvement in other behavioral scales following growth hormone administration, such as the Short Sensory
 Profile, Sensory Assessment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, and the ABC-Hyperactivity subscale as seen with
 the IGF-1 trial.
2. VEPs  will show improvement in amplitudes in children with Phelan McDermid Syndrome following 12 weeks of
 growth hormone therapy, similar to the changes seen following IGF-1 therapy.

Feasibility of Meeting Recruitment Goals
Power is calculated for differences in baseline to week 12 change scores. Testing for treatment x time interactions
 and # at .05, we have 80% power to detect moderate to large effects. 
Based on data from our previous clinical trial of IGF-1 in patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome, a 12 week study
 was feasible in 9 patients. 
We feel that 20 patients would provide adequate data to establish the utility of growth hormone in this population. The
 Seaver Autism Center has access to this population of children with Phelan Mcdermid Syndrome which should help
 facilitate recruitment.

10. Subjects - Risk and Benefits
Risks to Subjects
Growth hormone will be administered as subcutaneous injections once daily by [CONTACT_659423]. 
Blood draws will be done every 4 weeks during study and 4 weeks following study. 
Potential adverse events from Growth Hormone(GH) are described in the package insert. Some adverse effects
 include headaches, myalgia, fluid retention, benign intracranial hypertension, slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_659401],
 insulin resistance and hypothyroidism. Local reactions include erythema or pain at injection site and lipoatrophy with
 long term use. 
Patients will require to be seen by a physician at our center every [ADDRESS_889403]. Medical
 history, family history, physical and neurological examination (including anthropometric measurements, fundoscopic
 exams), routine hematology and blood chemistry and X-ray will be performed at baseline.  All families will be
 educated on appropriate growth hormone administration. Patients will be monitored for tolerability every 4 weeks
 throughout the study using physical and neurological and psychological evaluations (including anthropometric
 measurements, fundoscopic exams). This monitoring will occur at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and then again 4-weeks after
 study termination. 
All testing will be scheduled at the same time as the four weekly visit in order to avoid inconveniencing patient. 
Provisions for Research Related Harm / Injury
Serial evaluations by [CONTACT_659424] 4 weeks during study and also safety parameters monitored by [CONTACT_659425]/injury. 
An adverse event (AE) will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject, temporally associated
 with the use of the experimental medication, whether or not considered related to the medication. An adverse event
 can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or
 disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the experimental medication. A serious adverse
 event (SAE) will be defined as an AE that meets any of the following criteria:
results in death; 
is life threatening; 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and
 may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Adverse Events Reporting 
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria
 and definition of an adverse event or serious adverse event, as provided in this protocol. During the study, when
 there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or team member will be responsible for reporting adverse events and
 serious adverse events. Each subject's parents/guardians will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_659426]. 
Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualifying as adverse events and serious adverse
 events:
Abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are judged by [CONTACT_659427]. Clinically significant abnormal
 laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and
 significantly worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. The investigator will exercise
 his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal
 assessment is clinically significant. 
Medically attended visits 
For each AE the subject experiences, the subject's parents/guardians will be asked if they received medical attention
 defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], an emergency room visit or a visit to or from medical personnel (medical doctor/doctor of
 osteopathy or nurse practitioner) for any reason. This information will be recorded in the CRF (case report form). 
Lack of Efficacy 
Lack of efficacy per se will not be reported as an AE. The signs and symptoms or clinical sequelae resulting from lack
 of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE definition (including clarifications). 
Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting AEs:
All AEs occurring from the initiation of therapy until [ADDRESS_889404]'s CRF, irrespective of severity or whether or not they are considered medication-related.
 Onset of chronic illness (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes and allergies) and conditions prompting
 emergency room (ER) visits or physician office visits that are not related to well-child care, injury, or common acute
 illnesses (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], otitis media, pharyngitis, and gastroenteritis) will be reported during
 the entire study period. The investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AEs at every visit/contact [CONTACT_659428]-up phase as appropriate. All AEs either observed by [CONTACT_1720] a clinical
 collaborator or reported by [CONTACT_423]'s parent/guardian spontaneously or in response to a direct question will be
 evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. AEs not previously documented in the study will be recorded in the Adverse Event
 form within the subject's CRF. The nature of each event, date and time (where appropriate) of onset, outcome,
 intensity and relationship to drug administration should be established. Details of any corrective treatment should be
 recorded on the appropriate page of the CRF. 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it will be the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_659402], laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant
 information regarding an AE/SAE on the eCRF or SAE Report Form as applicable. The investigator will attempt to
 establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. 
Safety: To evaluate safety, participants will be assessed every [ADDRESS_889405]. There are a number
 of tertiary outcomes designed to monitor the safety of GH. 
Monitoring for AEs will be conducted during scheduled and unscheduled visits per clinical and laboratory
 assessments.  General AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) CTCAE scales (note: please see
 discussion immediately following for AEs with neurological signs and symptoms).  Examples of possible AE grades
 for parameters which will be measured during treatment (shown in Table 3 Research Protocol PDF).  Also, any AE
 that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32555], although not easily categorized in the National Cancer Institute grading system, will be
 considered # grade 3.
If a subject develops significant (CTCAE AE # 3 grade) neurological signs and symptoms (e.g.  cerebrovascular
 event or peripheral neuropathy), they will be seen immediately for a comprehensive evaluation, appropriate
 treatment, and removal from active participation in the study. We will also apply NCI-CTCAE criteria for attribution of
 AE by [CONTACT_659429], following the NCI guidelines for their application.
unrelated to treatment   1
unlikely related to treatment  2
possibly related to treatment  3
probably related to treatment  4
definitely related to treatment  5
The following are the potential adverse events associated with GH and how we intend to monitor and prevent these
 occurrences.
 
Slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_659401] (SCFE)
SCFE is a potential adverse effect of growth hormone therapy. We will monitor for this by [CONTACT_659430] (unilateral or bilateral), limpi[INVESTIGATOR_659403]. Children suspected of SCFE will undergo bilateral hip
 x-ray in a frog leg position for diagnosis. 
Alterations in glucose homeostasis
Glucose homeostasis will be measured using hemoglobin A1C levels as well as glucose and insulin levels prior to
 and during therapy. 
Increased intracranial pressure
In order to monitor for increased intracranial pressure, children will undergo fundoscopic examination. 
Expected Direct Benefit to Subjects
Autism is a severe lifelong neuro-developmental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_659431], communication deficits and repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior and interests with onset in the
 first three years of life.
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_659404]-[ADDRESS_889406] (ABC) and the Repetitive Behavior SubScale-Revised (RBS-R) after 12 weeks of
 therapy (Kolevzon, 2014). 
Considering growth hormone acts via the IGF-[ADDRESS_889407], this medication that is easily accessible and administered
 once daily (in comparison to twice daily IGF-1) should improve social withdrawal in this population. Growth hormone
 will also not produce hypoglycemia in patients that has been known to occur with IGF-[ADDRESS_889408] on IGF-1 (Donze et al, 2018). 
The success of this clinical trial could have implications on other genetic forms of autism spectrum disorder in the
 future. It will also provide more information to the healthcare community in this field. 
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Members of the research team may also provide clinical care to this population in the Seaver Autism Center; thus, it
 is acceptable and appropriate for the team to present the research to patients in the clinic. Patients recruited outside
 of the Seaver Autism Center will approach study personnel after viewing our ads and only if the family is willing will
 our research personnel discuss the study with family. We may conduct initial telephone conversations with these
 families to inform them regarding the study. Prospective subjects and their parents will be informed of and consented
 for the study in the privacy of an investigator's office during a clinic visit.  Follow-up visits and phone calls made to
 subjects will be carried out in the context of clinical care.
It will be explained to the subject's parents that all questions asked and procedures performed will be part of the
 study, and they will be informed that they do not need to answer all of the questions or they can decline a procedure
 if they feel uncomfortable.

 with radiographic evidence of open epi[INVESTIGATOR_269643]. Phenotype definition will be conducted using a comprehensive
 assessment battery, including: (1) psychiatric evaluation; (2) clinical genetics evaluation; (3) neurological
 examination; (4) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales.  The study will include newly recruited children in addition to
 those who have been previously recruited for the purposes of genetic studies by [CONTACT_659433]. 
Patients recruited will have screening prior to trial and will then follow up at [ADDRESS_889410] therapy follow up will also be arranged. 
Inclusion criteria: 
Diagnosis: Pathogenic deletions or mutations of the SHANK3 gene confirmed by [CONTACT_659422]/or direct
 sequencing. 
Age Range: Cases will be between 2 and 12 years old at the time the phenotypic measures were collected. 
Exclusion criteria: 
Cases will be excluded if any of the following criteria are applicable: 
closed epi[INVESTIGATOR_269643];
active or suspected neoplasia;
intracranial hypertension; 
hepatic insufficiency;
renal insufficiency;
cardiomegaly/valvulopathy;
history of allergy to growth hormone or any component of the formulation (mecasermin); 
history of extreme prematurity (<1000 grams) with associated early neo-natal complications, e.g. intra-cerebral
 hemorrhage, prolonged hypoxia, prolonged hypoglycemia;
patients with comorbid conditions who are deemed too medically compromised to tolerate the risk of experimental
 treatment with growth hormone.
Patient with visual problems that preclude the use of VEPs
Drug
Growth hormone is secreted by [CONTACT_659434][INVESTIGATOR_646854] a pulsatile manner. It binds to its
 receptor, signaling a cascade of intracellular events which directly stimulated the synthesis and release of IGF-1.
 (Ashpole et al; 2014, Grimberg et al; 2016).
 
Growth hormone is FDA approved for use in children with growth hormone deficiency (including idiopathic [of
 unknown cause] growth hormone deficiency), Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, short
 stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, idiopathic short stature and
 children small for gestational age. (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm237839.htm)
 
It is available in the form of several commercial preparations. This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_659406] a 10 mg vial to be
 reconstituted with in-package syringe of 1 mL of bacteriostatic water (preserved with 0.33% metacresol), and a 25G
 reconstitution needle.
Drug Administration
Growth hormone will be administered subcutaneously once daily using a 12-week single group design. No placebo
 will be used. The 12-week duration was selected because of our previous trial with IGF-1 showing effects in
 standardized behavior scales in that duration, hence establishing proof of concept. 
The dose of daily growth hormone varies with the indication for therapy. Approved doses of growth hormone range
 from 0.16-0.25mg/kg/week for growth hormone deficient patients (Grimberg et al.; 2016) and up to 0.47 mg/kg/week
 for patients born small for gestational age. 
In our proposed trial, we expect a majority of our patients to be growth hormone sufficient and therefore similar to
 the population of children with idiopathic short stature treated with growth hormone. We will recommend a dose of
 0.15mg/kg/week divided daily for 2 weeks as a starting dose to ensure safety and tolerance. The dose will then be
 increased to 0.3mg/kg/week for 10 weeks, an average growth hormone dose in children with idiopathic short stature.
 The growth hormone dose will be titrated based on IGF-1 levels monitored serially up to a maximum dose of 0.45mg/
kg/week.(http://www.ferringusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ZOMACTON-PI-7-18.pdf )
Drug dose is calculated on a mg/kg/week basis. Using Center for Disease Control average Weight-for-age statistics
 in typi[INVESTIGATOR_659407] 2 to 12 years (www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm), the overall average
 weight across a representative sample of males and females in this age range is 24.65kg. 
Average growth hormone dose for weeks 1-2: 0.15mg * 24.65kg per week = 3.7 mg per week
Average growth hormone dose for weeks 3-10: 0.3mg * 24.65kg per week = 7.4 mg per week
With a recruitment target of 20 patients, we anticipate the need for a total of 1628 mg of growth hormone with
 each person requiring about 81 mg of growth hormone in 12 weeks. We anticipate the need for 17 vials of growth
 hormone (10 mg per vial). 
Description of Procedures Being Performed
Description of Phenotypic Measures (See Table 3): 
The phenotypic measures include standardized measures such as history and physical, neurologic exam, treatment
 history, prenatal-perinatal questionnaire as well as the measures listed below. 
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS): The VABS is a semi-structured interview designed to measure personal
 and social sufficiency in individuals from birth to adulthood. It provides a general assessment of adaptive behavior
 within the sub-domains of Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. Administration takes
 between 20-60 minutes.  
Description of Outcome Measures:
Parent-Rated Measures 
The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Aman et al., 1985) is a caregiver report symptom checklist validated and widely
 used for assessing problem behaviors in children and adults with intellectual disability. Fifty-eight specific items are
 rated and a manual provides comprehensive descriptions for each assessed behavior. The 58 items resolve into five
 subscales: Irritability; Lethargy/Social Withdrawal; Stereotypic Behavior; Hyperactivity; Inappropriate Speech. 
The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (Lam and Aman, 2007) is a validated tool that captures the breadth of
 restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD. The RBS-R has 43 items that resolve into five factors and a total
 score: Ritualistic/Sameness; Stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; Self Injury; Compulsive Behavior; Restricted Interests. The RBS-R is
 a continuous measure of the presence and severity of repetitive behaviors. A total score is generated, with higher
 scores indicating more restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors but each subscale independently shows
 adequate psychometric properties and acceptable reliability and validity.  
The Sensory Profile (Dunn, 1999) is a caregiver questionnaire which measures responses to sensory experiences
 in everyday life. There are 125 items in the full Sensory Profile, and there is a short version which contains 38 items
 commonly used in research settings. Sensory processing subscales on the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) include
 tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity, visual/ auditory sensitivity, movement sensitivity, low energy/ weak, and
 under-responsivity/seeks sensation. Tactile, smell/taste and visual/auditory sensitivity scores represent a child's
 ability to respond to respective sensory stimuli in the environment. Parents use a Likert scale to rate how frequently
 their child demonstrates a particular behavior (ranging from 1 = always to 5 = never). A lower score indicates greater
 deviation from typi[INVESTIGATOR_659408]. 
The Caregiver Top Three Concerns is a Visual Analog Scale rating of severity of the top three causes for concern for
 the caregivers. Caregivers are instructed to identify causes for concern that are related to the individual's PMS.
Clinician-Rated Measures
The PMS Domain Specific Concerns is a Visual Analog Scales that assesses domain specific individualized items
 that are identified as key areas of impairment by [CONTACT_50633]. The domains that are assessed are: Social Withdrawal,
 Repetitive Behaviors, Speech and Language, Anxiety, Motor Performance, Sensory Reactivity, and Cognition. The
 identified concerns should be related to the subject's PMS.
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement of Illness
 (CGI-I; Guy, 1976) are brief, easy to administer, clinician-rated measures. The CGI-S asks the clinician to rate the
 patient's current severity of illness based on the clinician's clinical experience with the relevant population. The CGI-
S is rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all ill) through 7 (amongst the most
 extremely ill patients). The CGI-I asks the clinician to rate the patients' total improvement since baseline, whether
 or not the improvement is judged to be due entirely to the experimental treatment. The CGI-I is rated on a 7-point
 scale, with a range of responses from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). For both the CGI-S and the
 CGI-I, the clinician is allowed to use all available information at the time of the rating. The CGI-I has emerged as a
 convention for bifurcating clinical trial subjects into "responders" (i.e. a CGI-I of 1 or 2) and "non-responders" (i.e. a
 CGI-I of 3 to 7) (Busner et al., 2009). In this application, the CGI-I can be a useful tool for gaining a general overview
 of the therapeutic potential of an experimental treatment. We will improve the sensitivity of the CGI-S and –I by [CONTACT_659435].
Peabody Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] (PPVT): This is a wide-range measure of receptive language for standard English
 that is administered by a clinician to children in the 2-6 age range. It takes 10-15 minutes to administer. 
Objective Measures 
Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) provide a noninvasive technique to evaluate the functional integrity of visual
 pathways in the brain from the retina to the visual cortex via the optic nerve/optic radiations. The VEP is recorded
 from the head's surface, over the visual cortex, and is extracted from ongoing EEG through signal averaging. VEPs
 reflect the sum of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occurring on api[INVESTIGATOR_32550] (Zemon et al., 1986)
 which modulate excitatory and inhibitory signals received by [CONTACT_32615]. The major positive and negative
 peaks and troughs in VEP waveforms reflect different cellular events. The contrast-reversing checkerboard stimulus
 used in this study produces a positive peak at approximately 60 ms (P0 or P60), reflecting activation of the primary
 visual cortex from the lateral geniculate nucleus. A negative peak at approximately 75 ms (N0 or N75) reflecting
 depolarization and glutamatergic postsynaptic activity spreading to the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, and
 a positive peak at approximately 100 ms (P1 or P100) reflecting superficial hyperpolarization and GABAergic activity
 (Zemon et al., 1980). VEPs have been used in clinical trials; for example, an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551] (gabapentin; Conte
 et al., 2009) and an infant formula (O'Connor et al., 2001); both received FDA approval based in part on positive
 findings from VEP studies. Data from ongoing clinical trials at Mount Sinai provide support for use of VEPs as a
 measure of treatment response. 
Auditory Event Related Potentials (AERPs) are useful for characterizing early processing of auditory tones and
 habituation to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_659409]. Tones are presented in rapid succession (e.g., up
 to every 500 ms) and ERP components to both initial stimulus presentations and their habituation to subsequent
 stimuli (i.e., reduction in amplitude) are examined. Auditory gating waveforms have been well characterized across
 development (Milner at l., 2014; Tremblay et al., 2014; Magnee et al., 2011) and are comprised of a fronto-central
 peak 100 ms after the onset of the auditory stimulus (N1) and a subsequent positive peak (P2) reflecting activity
 in auditory cortex, mesencephalitic reticular activating system, planum temporale, and auditory association cortex
 (Crowley et al., 2004; Godey et al., 2001). The N1-P2 complex reflects two distinct components: initial stimulus
 processing (N1) and subsequent attention to and processing of stimulus information (P2). P2 also has been
 implicated in speech processing (Knowland et al., 2014; Klucharev et al., 2003) suggesting that its analysis may
 be important for understanding neurophysiological mechanisms associated with broader cognitive and language
 developmental dysfunctions in FXS. Recent AERP studies suggest that measures of auditory gating may provide
 a sensitive and selective probe of sensory physiology in FXS (Hall et al., 2009). Individuals with FXS, for example,
 show auditory hypersensitivities consistent with Fmr1KO mouse models of local-circuit hyper-excitability involving
 prolonged "UP" states in the gamma frequency range, decreased glutamatergic drive on fast-spi[INVESTIGATOR_659410], and heightened neurophysiological response to auditory stimuli (Rotschafer et
 al., 2013). 
The Sensory Assessment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (SAND) is a clinician-administered assessment and
 corresponding caregiver interview that is not dependent on verbal or cognitive ability and is therefore appropriate
 for severely affected or nonverbal individuals with FXS. The algorithm measures sensory discrete hyperreactivity,
 hyporeactivity, and seeking behaviors across visual, tactile, and auditory domains. The SAND has also been
 validated in ASD with significant correlation to the previously validated Sensory Profile. Results from our preliminary
 data suggest the SAND can identify sensory reactivity subtypes that differentiate FXS and other forms of ASD.
Eye tracking will utilize three tasks to measure attention in general and social attention specifically. (1) The Visual
 Paired Comparison task presents two identical stimuli (faces or patterns) side by [CONTACT_32614]. The familiar
 stimulus and a new stimulus are then paired on test and recognition is inferred from preferential looking to the new
 target. (2) The Gap-Overlap task measures the latencies of gaze shifts from a central fixation point to a peripheral
 target are under 2 conditions. During gap trials, the fixation cross disappears prior to the onset of the peripheral cue,
 whereas in the overlap condition, the fixation cross remains on the screen throughout the trial. Saccadic latencies
 are typi[INVESTIGATOR_659411] a target (gap effect). (3) Flicker measures the temporal resolution of attention. Four squares that flicker
 from black to white are presented against a grey background. The target square flickers 180 degrees out-of-phase
 from the three distractors. Flickering occurs at 1 of 4 frequencies: 0.2, 0.5, 1, or [ADDRESS_889411] Data About Subjects 
Data will be collected from patient's medical records including history and physical examinations, laboratory and
 radiological information and psychiatric evaluations. We use EPIC as electronic medical record system. Patient

Selection Procedures to Minimize Toxicity
Growth hormone will be administered subcutaneously once daily using a 12-week single group design. No placebo
 will be used. The 12-week duration was selected because of our previous trial with IGF-1 showing effects in
 standardized behavior scales in that duration, hence establishing proof of concept. 
The dose of daily growth hormone varies with the indication for therapy. Approved doses of growth hormone range
 from 0.16-0.25mg/kg/week for growth hormone deficient patients (Grimberg et al.; 2016) and up to 0.47 mg/kg/week
 for patients born small for gestational age. 
In our proposed trial, we expect a majority of our patients to be growth hormone sufficient and therefore similar to
 the population of children with idiopathic short stature treated with growth hormone. We will recommend a dose of
 0.15mg/kg/week divided daily for 2 weeks as a starting dose to ensure safety and tolerance. The dose will then be
 increased to 0.3mg/kg/week for 10 weeks, an average growth hormone dose in children with idiopathic short stature.
 The growth hormone dose will be titrated based on IGF-1 levels monitored serially up to a maximum dose of 0.45mg/
kg/week.(http://www.ferringusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ZOMACTON-PI-7-18.pdf )
Drug dose is calculated on a mg/kg/week basis. Using Center for Disease Control average Weight-for-age statistics
 in typi[INVESTIGATOR_659407] 2 to 15 years (www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm), the overall average
 weight across a representative sample of males and females in this age range is 30kg. 
Average growth hormone dose for weeks 1-2: 0.15mg * 30kg per week = 4.5mg per week = 0.6mg per day

Laboratory: any abnormality on any test with adverse event (AE, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
 National Cancer Institute, scales) # 3 or greater at any time in the study.
Any AE of any sort (clinical, laboratory) # 4 will result in halting for the individual and also for the study as a whole.
Primary or Secondary Safety Endpoints
The study will be halted* if two patients experience stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19944].  (Exceptions for this criterion: Patients who
 withdraw voluntarily for reasons not directly related to or intrinsic to the study, e.g. incidental considerations such as
 concerns about travel time to study visits, unexpected pregnancy in the family, etc.  Clearly, patients who experience
 adverse effects during growth hormone treatment would count towards this criterion for whole study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).
In addition, the study will be halted if one patient experiences a serious related adverse effect (grade # 4 AE).
All safety data will be reported to the IRB, and FDA every six months, or, in the case of any major safety concern or
 question, immediately.  If any study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_32544], this will be reported immediately and the study halted,
 pending review by  [CONTACT_1744], and FDA, and until the decision by [CONTACT_32599], suspend or close the
 study has been made.
*Operationally, "halting" will ordinarily mean that no further screening of new subjects and no treatment initiation will
 occur until the safety issue has been investigated and resolved (i.e., a final decision has been made to resume,
 suspend or close the study has been made).  Enrolled study participants who have no new symptoms or adverse
 effects will ordinarily be allowed to continue study observation or treatment without interruption while the safety issue
 is being investigated, unless it is the contemporaneous judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_659413], or
 FDA that it is unsafe to do so, in which case all observation or treatment interventions will be suspended forthwith.

 research is intended as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_659414] a new indication for GH treatment. Our study
 population will not have growth hormone administered for any of the FDA approved
 indications. The results of this study may warrant further such studies in the future. The
 dose of daily growth hormone varies with the indication for therapy. Approved doses
 of growth hormone range from 0.16-0.25mg/kg/week for growth hormone deficient
 patients (Grimberg et al.; 2016) and up to 0.47 mg/kg/week for patients born small for
 gestational age. In our proposed trial, we expect a majority of our patients to be growth
 hormone sufficient and therefore similar to the population of children with idiopathic
 short stature treated with growth hormone. We will recommend a dose of 0.15mg/
kg/week divided daily for 2 weeks as a starting dose to ensure safety and tolerance.
 The dose will then be increased to 0.3mg/kg/week for 10 weeks, an average growth
 hormone dose in children with idiopathic short stature. We will obtain an exemption
 from the FDA IND for the use of growth hormone in this study. Neither the patients nor
 their insurances will be charged for growth hormone. The medication will be funded by

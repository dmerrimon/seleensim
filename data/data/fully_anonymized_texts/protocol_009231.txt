Sleep Innovations for Preschoolers With Arthritis (SIPA): Developi[INVESTIGATOR_532048] 
a Self-Management Intervention 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
8/5/2022 
 
SIPA Intervention Description  
An existing sleep intervention for typi[INVESTIGATOR_532049] (Sleep Health in 
Preschoolers - SHIP; shipstudy.org; National Institute of Child Health & Human Development 
1R01HD071937-01A1) provided overall structure and content for SIPA. The SHIP intervention 
draws on a Social Cognitive Theory framework in an initial home visit and follow-up phone calls 
to coach parents through an iterative process of assessment, learning, goal-setting, and 
problem-solving to target multi-faceted early childhood sleep issues such as problems with 
sleep onset, night waking, and sleep duration. Building on the foundation of SHIP, we 
developed the web-based SIPA intervention via user-centered design processes. First, parents 
would receive from the research team Weekly Emails  notifying them to access weekly materials; 
these emails would be automatically sent to registered users every week. Each email described 
steps to be done in the week and included a link that connected to the Instructional Website  
which provided a general guide through that week’s content and activities. The SIPA Website 
with Learning Modules  would then provide the detailed content that participants would need to 
review for that week. After the user reviewed the content, they would then go back to the 
Instructional Website to engage in activities such as taking a short knowledge quiz, applying 
what they learned on the SIPA website to set 1-2 sleep goals and details plans to fulfill the goals 
for the coming week (see Figure 1below for the user flow).  
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_690795], then guide them to the learning module. After learning about this topic 
on the learning modules website, parents would then go back to the Instructional website, go 
through a set of activities to set goals (e.g., creating a sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_532050]), and generate a concrete 
plan to carry out the goals. In the subsequent week, parent will answer questions about the 
goals and activities they did in the previous week. Below is a list of the weekly topi[INVESTIGATOR_532051].

Assessment Plan 
 
T0 BASELINE ASSESSMENT 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325058] a phone conversation with eligible and interested participant parent, talk about 
the purpose of the study, show parents and their child the sleep watch, and obtain consent from 
parent participants using REDCap (see SIPA2 Consent). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_532054] (see assessment table below). The estimated 
time burden for parent is 1.[ADDRESS_690798] method (phone/email) mid-week to check in and will be available to answer 
questions. This method of collecting Actigraphy data have been successful in our previous 
studies. After the parent has confirmed the mailing of the actiwatch, they will begin the 8-week 
intervention program. At week [ADDRESS_690799] received the 
actiwatch back and will provide a brief report of the actigraphy results to the parent as part of 
the intervention, including a screenshot of the actigraphy graph, summary report (average 
bedtime, risetime, sleep duration, etc.). 
 
The SIPA intervention will be interactive and personalized. Each parent will have a specific 
REDCap account with their email. Every week, parent will receive an email sent automatically 
through REDCap with instructions for this week’s activity, designed to take about [ADDRESS_690800] participants 
through goal setting, anticipated barriers, and problem solving.  The REDCap pages will include 
fillable responses to queries, instructions, and assignments.  Tasks for parents and their young 
children will use multimedia elements to enhance delivery of information, such as links to videos 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_532055]-efficacy, motivation, and patient activation.  The materials used are 
modified from an existing intervention, Sleep Habits in Preschoolers (SHIP), which has been 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_532056] 450 typi[INVESTIGATOR_532057] (PIs: 
Garrison, consultant on SIPA, and Ward, part of the CISSM team).   
 
Submissions and progress will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_532058] (Bromberg, Clinical 
Pscyhologist), who will send email, call or text with reminders (whichever the family prefers) and 
answer questions as needed, review progress, and help problem solve any technology issues or 
barriers to implementing skills. This online structure and feedback process is modeled after the 
work by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Palermo, who has successfully implemented web-based interventions with parents 
and children, and is on the CISSM advisory committee. [CONTACT_532061] (CoI) was an 
interventionist on [CONTACT_532062]’s web-based interventions. 
 
T2 – IMMEDIATE POST INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT 
At the end of the 8-week SIPA intervention, actiwatches will be mailed to the parents for 
their children to wear for [ADDRESS_690801]-
intervention assessment via REDCap (see assessment table below) and have a brief phone 
interview with a research team member about the intervention (15 min). The estimated time 
burden for parent is 1.5 hours. 
 
T3 – [ADDRESS_690802] intervention, parent will complete a follow-up assessment via REDCap (see 
assessment table below). The estimated time burden for parent is 1.5 hours.

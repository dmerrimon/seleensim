and based on PTEN status  
• PF rate at 6 months based on PTEN status  
• Safety at RP2D  
Exploratory Endpoints  
• Biomarkers:  
o Pre-treatment metastatic tumor biopsy:  (fresh or 
archival) are required from all patients to assess 
baseline biomarker and mutational analysis, including 
PTEN loss evaluation, PIK3CA and Ras mutational status, and mTOR pathway markers (including, but not 
limited to S6K, 4EBP1).  In particular, PIK3CA mutations 
and PTEN loss will be analyzed by [CONTACT_724162].  If tissue from metastatic site is not available, 
primary lesion tissue is acceptable.  Report s on 
mutational status will be collected from all patients , if 
available. 
o Blood samples:  for cell -free plasma DNA collection 
(pretreatment, C3 and C6 D1 post -treatment , upon 
disease progression, and/or end of last dose of 
treatment ) for all patients. Molecular analysis of 
circulating DNA assay using next generation sequencing 
to assess changes over time as response to therapy of 
the prevalence of mutations identified in the baseline 
tumor samples  
 Nucleic acids extracted from blood can also be used to investigate whether circulating tumor nucleic acids are associated with disease 
progression   
STUDY DESIGN 
and DOSE -
FINDING RULES  This study is a prospective phase 1/2, single arm, open -label, multi -
institutional study to identify the RP2D and determine the efficacy and 
safety profile of ABI -[ADDRESS_988737] of 28 
days.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
In the dose- finding portion of the study (phase 1), dose levels of ABI -
009 will be tested in cohorts of 3 patients each using the 3+3 dose-finding design, with the starting dose of 2 0 mg/m
2 given once every 2 
week on Days 1 and 15 in a 28- day cycle .

Protocol: COLO -007                                                                                 A adi Bioscience  
Confidential and Proprietary  7 Amendment 2.1   
Dose Levels  ABI-009 in mg/m2 
IV every [ADDRESS_988738] 1 cycle (28 days). There 
will be no intra- patient dose escalation allowed. If a DLT occurs in a 
cohort, additional 3 patients will be recruited to the cohort. If no further DLTs occur, then a new cohort of 3 patients at the next higher dose level can be enrolled. If 2/[ADDRESS_988739] dose level in which ≤[ADDRESS_988740] (qw3/4) has been changed to every [ADDRESS_988741] of 
care, FOLFO X + bevacizumab. Patients receiving ABI -009 qw3/4, the 
original dosing schedule, will drop Day 8 ABI -009 and switch to the 
every -2-week schedule.  
Once the dose- finding portion of the study is concluded and RP2D is 
identified, patients receiving a lower dose may  be allowed to receive 
ABI-009 at the RP2D, based on the investigator judgment and 
discussion with the medical monitor.  
NUMBER OF PATIENTS  Up to 55 evaluable patients will be enrolled in th is phase 1/2  study, 
with up to 18 patients in the dose- finding phase 1 portion, and 34 -37 
additional patients in phase 2 (total N = 40 in phase 2, including 
patients from phase 1 at the RP2D).  
SAMPLE SIZE 
ESTIMATE In phase 1, it is estimated that a maximum of 18 patients will be 
required to achieve the MTD; however, MTD could be reached with as few as 5 patients.  
In phase 2, 34- 37 additional eligible patients will be enrolled at the 
RP2D, for a total of 4 0 evaluable patients (including 3 -6 patients from 
phase 1 at the RP2D). Assuming a 10% attrition rate, at least 44 
patients would need to be enrolled for the phase 2 portion of the study. 
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988742], as measured by [CONTACT_724163] 6 
months. Based on an assumed 6- month PF rate of 90% and a sample 
size of 40 patients, the 95% confidence intervals for the 6- month PF 
rate will be 76.3% to 97.2%.

Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988757] patient follow -up, including approximately 12  
months of enrollment period, an estimated 12 months of treatment (or 
until treatment is no longer tolerated).   
End of Treatment (EOT) for a patient is defined as the date of the last 
dose of ABI -009. End of Treatment Visit for a patient is when safety 
assessments and procedures are performed after the last treatment, 
which must occur within [ADDRESS_988758] dose of ABI -009.   
The End of Study (EOS) defined as either the date of the last visit of 
the last patient to complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last 
data point from the last patient that is required for  primary, secondary, 
and/or exploratory analysis, as pre- specified in the protocol.  
Follow- up period begins  after the EOT Visit. All patients that 
discontinue study drug and have not withdrawn full consent to 
participate in the study will continue in the follow- up phase for survival 
and initiation of new anticancer therapy. Follow up will continue 
approximately every 12 weeks (±3 weeks), until death, withdrawal of 
consent, or the study closes, whichever is the earliest. This evaluation may be made by [CONTACT_663727]/or telephone contact.  
STUDY DRUG 
ADMINISTRATION  With Amendment 2, t he starting dose and schedule of  ABI-009 is 20 
mg/m2 given every -2-weeks ( 28-day cycle) by [CONTACT_12781] 30 
minutes  (+10 mins window allowed, ie 30-40 mins infusion) . 
Bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 will be administered every 2 weeks, 
starting Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Modified FOLFOX6 regimen: Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV with LV 400 
mg/m2 IV over 2 hours plus 5 FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 
continuous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks. Dose modifications 
of each agent in FOLFOX may be made independently based on the specific types of toxicities observed. Bevacizumab may be skipped or discontinued for bevacizumab-
related toxicities, but the dose is not 
reduced.  
Patients will continue to therapy until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_663699], or at the patient’s 
discretion. Patients who remain on treatment for more than [ADDRESS_988759] (qw2/3, 
21-day cycle) at the discretion of the investigator. Single agent ABI -
009 may be continued if mFOLFOX6 and/or bevacizumab are discontinued due to toxicity or achievement of maximum benefit in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_724142].  
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988760] / PET scans and 
RECIST v1.1. Only RECIST v1.1 criteria wi ll be used to assess 
response; PET will be used for qualitative purposes only.  
For the phase [ADDRESS_988761] two- sided 95% confidence 
interval will be provided.  
Progression- free survival is defined as the time from the first day of 
study drug administration to disease progression or death due to any cause. For PFS , the KM estimates and corresponding two- sided 95% 
confidence intervals for the median and quartiles will be provided. The KM plot may also be provided.  
The ORR and DCR will be reported along with exact 95% confidence intervals computed by [CONTACT_39715] -Pearson method. Additionally, all 
efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed based on PTEN status.  
KEY SAFETY 
ASSESSMENTS  Safety and tol erability will be monitored through continuous reporting 
of treatment -emergent and treatment -related adverse events (AEs), 
AEs of special interest, laboratory abnormalities, and incidence of 
patients experiencing dose modifications, dose delay/dose not giv en, 
dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP due to an 
AE. All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_724165] [ADDRESS_988762] dose of IP. Adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_724166] (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. 
Physical examination, vital signs, laboratory assessments (eg, serum 
chemistry, hematology), and ECOG performance status will be 
monitored. All serious AEs (regardless of relationship to IP) will be 
followed until resolution. Local laboratory analysis will be performed 
as per study schedule.

Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988767].   
 
 
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988768] common cancer and one of the leading causes of death 
among cancer types  (Siegel, 2017) . In the early stage, colorectal cancer often does  not 
present symptoms and usually becomes symptomatic when it progresses to more 
advanced stages.  Surgery is the most common treatment for cancers that have not 
spread, and chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy is given for patients whose cancer metastasized.  However, the 5 -year survival rate is still a dismal 14% for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  (Siegel, 2017) , and improved therapeutic options 
are needed.  
1.2. Treatment Options in Colorectal Cancer  
1.2.1.  FOLFOX and Bevacizumab in Colorectal Cancer  
Oxaliplatin with infusional  5-fluorouracil (5- FU) and leucovorin (LV) (FOLFOX) and 
irinotecan with infusional 5- FU and LV (FOLFIRI) are standard chemotherapy regimens 
for the first- line treatment of patients with mCRC  (NCCN, 2017 ). Since its approval for the 
first-line treatment of mCRC in 2004, bevacizumab, a VEGF- A inhibitor, has become a 
standard treatment option in combination with chemotherapy for patients with mCRC. In particular, mFOLFOX6 combined with bevacizumab are now well established for 
treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinomas  (Hochster, 2008; Saltz, 2008; Bendell, 
2012; Strickler, 2012; Baba, 2017; Rivera, 2017) . The median progression- free survival 
(PFS) we re 9-11 months, with approximately 5 0% overall response rates (ORR)  in most 
studies  (Hochster, 2008; Saltz, 2008; Bendell, 2012; Strickler, 2012; Baba, 2017; Rivera, 
2017) , and improvement in reducing tumor burden and time to progression in the first- line 
setting is still needed. Improving efficacy of  first-line treatments may help in optimizing 
the overall treatment plan and improve the outcome of subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724143] (OS) for patients in colorectal cancer.  
1.2.2.  mTOR Inhibit ion in Colorectal Cancer  
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR ) oncogenic  pathways (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) are 
frequently dysregulated in human cancers, including colorectal cancer  (Wu, 2015; Laes, 
2017) . mTOR is downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and 
the tumor suppressor gene PTEN coding for the Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog, and 
a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. Activating mutations in 
PIK3CA or null mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and subsequent loss of 
expression can lead to mTOR -pathway activation (Laes, 2017) . Additionally, mTOR is 
involved in regulating angiogenesis by [CONTACT_724167]- inducible factor -1α and vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)  (Corradetti, 2006) . Consistent with its role in cell proliferation, the mTOR pathway 
is frequently overactivated in a number of human malignancies and is considered to be an attractive target for anti -cancer therapy.  
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988769] cancer , and are under investigation for several 
cancer types , including mCRC. A recent phase 1/2 study that showed evidence for 
antitumor activity of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor , in combination with mFOLFOX6 plus 
bevacizumab (standard of care) for the first- line treatment for mCRC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
(Gilcrease GW, 2012) . The 6- month PF rate was 96%,  at the maximum -tolerated dose 
(MTD) ( Gilcrease GW, 2018) , compared to a historical estimate of approximately 77% for 
mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab (Saltz, 2008; Bendell , 2012 ; Baba, 2017; Rivera, 2017) . The 
ORR was 53% in the intent -to-treat population and 86% for  patients with PTEN loss, a 
population that typi[INVESTIGATOR_724144]. Evidence of anti -tumor activity correlated 
with mutation status (k -RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) and PTEN deletion status. Thus, evaluation 
of PIK3CA or PTEN mutations or expression in combination with the mTOR activity status 
could provide additional information on disease prognosis and potential sensitivity to 
cancer treatments in future studies.  While the efficacy of  the mTOR inhibitor combined 
with FOLFOX/bev was highly promising, 62% patients developed grade 2 stomatitis, 
mainly related to the addition of everolimus.  
A novel mTOR inhibitor , ABI-009 (albumin- bound sirolimus  nanoparticles, nab-sirolimus ), 
is a solvent -free, intravenous  (IV) form of sirolimus  and has relatively high bioavailability . 
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) including mucositis/stomatitis that were observed with other  
mTOR inhibitors were not dose- limiting with ABI -009 (Gonzalez -Angulo, 2013) . The 
particularly safe toxicity profile of ABI -009 allows this mTOR inhibitor to be combined with 
other therapeutics, and offers a promising new therapeutic for colorectal cancer . 
1.3. ABI-009 Background  
1.3.1.  Sirolimus  and Rapalogs  
Sirolimus  (formerly  rapamycin) is a protein kinase inhibitor that is approved for 
immunosuppression in renal  transplant patients  and for the treatment of 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis , and is under investigation for various  cancer treatment. 
Sirolimus  and its analogs (rapalogs) function as allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1. 
Rapalogs are currently used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and other 
tumors  (Dowling, 2010 ). 
Although sirolimus  is an efficacious mTOR inhibitor, it has poor solubility, low oral 
bioavailability, and produces DLTs, including mucositis and stomatitis  (O'Donnell, 2008; 
Yuan, 2009) . Marketed sirolimus  analogs are temsirolimus and everolimus. 
Temsirolimus, a prodrug of sirolimus  requiring conversion to sirolimus in vivo , is approved 
for the treatment of kidney cancer. Everolimus is approved for pediatric and adult pat ients 
with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, advanced hormone receptor -positive  HER2 -
negative breast cancer in combination with exemestane, progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNETs), subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associ ated with tuberous sclerosis , and advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of 
treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib( Hanna, 2008; Molina, 2011 ; Yao, 2011; Baselga, 
2012; Thompson, 2012) .

 Oral sirolimus  and currently available rapalogs induce common side effects including 
hypertension, maculopapular rash (75%), mucositis (50%), asthenia (40%), nausea 
(43%), thrombocytopenia, metabolic abnormalities and more rarely pneumonitis (8%, 3% 
grade 3) sometimes fatal  (de Oliveira, 2011; Albiges, 2012; Qi, 2013) . The most frequently 
occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were hyperglycemia (17%), 
hypophosphatemia (13%), anemia (9%), and hypertriglyceridemia (6%)  (Zhou, 2010) . 
1.3.2.  ABI-009 ( nab- Sirolimus ) 
The novel nanoparticle albumin- bound sirolimus (nab-sirolimus , ABI -009) is freely 
dispersible in saline and is suitable for IV administration, and has produced both a 
favorable safety profile and evidence of efficacy in patients with metastatic solid tumor s 
(Gonzalez -Angulo, 2013) . 
Nanoparticle albumin- bound or nab® technology (Abraxis BioScience, a wholly -owned 
subsidiary of Celgene Corporation) when applied to hydrophobic molecules, such as paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane
®), has led to improved drug delivery, safety, and 
efficacy in various solid tumors compared with the conventional paclitaxel formulation  
(Gradishar, 2005) . This suggests that the nab form of sirolimus  may also produce similar 
advantages over the standard sirolimus . 
The nab technology may enhance tumor penetration and accumulation via the albumin 
receptor -mediated (gp60) endothelial transcytosis. Albumin is highly soluble, has long 
plasma half -life, broad binding affinity, and accumulates in tumors, making it an ideal 
candidate for drug delivery  (Kremer, 2002; Kratz, 2008) . Albumin c irculating in the 
bloodstream can interact with gp60 to initiate caveolae- mediated transcytosis to reach 
tumor cells  (Schnitzer, 1992; Schnitzer, 1995) . Indeed, nab-paclitaxel transcytosis across 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_724145] (Desai, 2006) . In 
accordance with these observations, at equal doses, nab- paclitaxel showed greater 
selectivity to tumors compared with solvent -based paclitaxel, which is likely attributed to 
the biologically active ingredient albumin and lack of solvent  (Desai, 2006) . 
1.3.3.  Preclinical Studies with ABI-009 
Preclinical primary pharmacology studies in vivo demonstrated significant antitumor activity of ABI -009 as a single agent administered intravenously at 40 mg/kg, 3 times 
weekly for 4 weeks, across different tumor xenograft models in nude mice (see Figure 1 A 
and B,  below), including colorectal  and pancreatic cancer  (De, 2007; Desai, 2009; Trieu, 
2009; Cirstea, 2010; Kennecke, 2011) . This dose level correlates to approximately 120 
mg/m
2 in human. These findings are consistent with published information on sirolimus  
as an mTOR inhibitor and the role of mTOR in tumor growth (Fasolo, 2012) .

 Figure 2: ABI -009 Administered IV C ompared with Equal Weekly Dosing of O ral 
Sirolimus  and Oral Everolimus  
 
Preclinical pharmacokinetic ( PK) studies in rats showed that IV  ABI-[ADDRESS_988770] to dose and large volume of distribution (Vz), due to efficient tissue 
extraction of sirolimus  from the central blood compartment  (De, 2007) . Shortly after 
dosing, tissue sirolimus  level was 3 -5 folds higher than that of blood, indicating efficient 
extraction. The terminal half -life of ABI -009 was long in rats, ranging from 13.4 - 25.8 
hours and resulted in significant blood level at 48 hours (~10 ng/m L) and 120 hours (>1 
ng/ml). Consistent with sirolimus  literature  (Sehgal, 2003) , excretion of ABI -009 was 
primarily through the fecal route (68.57 - 69.99%) with minimum contribution from the 
renal route (7.73 - 8.84%).  
The safety and toxicity of ABI -009 were evaluated in a series of preclinical studies. In a 
Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP) repeat -dose toxicity study in male and female rats, ABI -
009 administered IV was well tolerated at doses up to 90 mg/kg (equivalent to 540 mg/m2 
human dose) when delivered every 4 days for 3 cycles. Nonclinical toxicology studies of 
ABI-009 showed no new or unexpected toxicity compared to what is already known for 
sirolimus  and other rapalogs  ([COMPANY_007], 2011a; [COMPANY_007], 2011b; [COMPANY_001], 2017) . 
1.3.4.  Clinical Studies with ABI-009 
In a phase 1 dose- finding, tolerability , and PK study conducted at MD Anderson Cancer 
Center (Protocol CA401, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), ABI-009 was well tolerated with evidence of 
responses and SD in various solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer , 
and colorectal cancer , all of which typi[INVESTIGATOR_724146]  (Gonzalez -Angulo, 2013) . 
Twenty -six patients were treated with 45, 56.25, 100, 125, or 150 mg/m2 ABI-009 per 

ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988771] (28- day cycle , qw3/4). ABI-009 was  
administered IV. The MTD  was established at 100 mg/m2. 
Nineteen patients were evaluable for efficacy. One patient in the 45 mg/m2 (95 mg actual 
sirolimus  dose) cohort , diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the kidney and with bone and 
intrathoracic metastases , had a confirmed PR. The target lesion of this patient was 
reduced by 35.1% and the duration of response lasted 183 days. Two (11%) patients (at 
doses 45 and 125 mg/m2, with actual sirolimus  doses of 88 mg and 193 mg, respectively) 
had an overall tumor evaluation of stable disease  (SD, confirmed): 1 patient with 
mesothelioma had SD for 365 days and 1 patient with a neuroendocrine tumor in the left axillary node had SD for 238 days.  
In the phase 1 study described above, for all cohorts and all grades, 25 of 26 (96%) 
patients experienced at least [ADDRESS_988772] common AEs were mucosal inflammation 
(10 patients, 38%), fatigue (7 patients, 27%), rash (6 patients, 23%), diarrhea (6 patients, 
23%), and nausea (5 patients, 19%). Most of these AEs were grade 1/2 events, with only 3 grade 3 nonhematologic AEs ([ADDRESS_988773] and 1 dyspnea). Specifically, at the MTD  
of 100 mg/m
2, all [ADDRESS_988774] 
common AEs were mucositis and fatigue (5 patients, 71% each). Four (15%) patients experienced at least 1 treatment -related serious AE  (SAE) , including arrhythmia (grade 
2) and mood alteration (grade 3) both in the 125 mg/m
2 cohort, vomitin g (grade 3) in the 
45 mg/m2 cohort, and dyspnea (grade 3) in the 100 mg/m2 cohort.  
The most common hematologic AEs, for all cohorts and grades, were thrombocytopenia 
(58%), followed by [CONTACT_560655] (23%), and anemia and hypophosphatemia (19% each), 
and neutropenia and hypertriglyceridemia (15% each). Most of these events were grade 
1/2, and only 1 grade 4 hematologic event occurred (thrombocytopenia in the 150 mg/m2 
arm). At the MTD, the only hematologic AE was a grade 3 anemia. In this clinical study, 16 of  26 patients (62%) had treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) requiring a week 
dose delay.  
Currently, t here are several ongoing trials investigating the safety and efficacy of single -
agent ABI-009 in various disease areas, including a trial in patients with malignant 
perivascular epi[INVESTIGATOR_724147] (PEComas ), a rare type of soft -tissue tumors  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The particularly safe toxicity profile of ABI -009 allows this mTOR 
inhibitor to be combinable with other therapeutics  and a trial in patients with advanced 
STS is currently evaluating the combination of ABI -009 and nivolumab ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
1.4. Rationale for Combination of ABI -009 with FOLFOX and Bevacizumab in 
Colorectal Cancer  
In the phase 1/2 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of everolimus added to mFOLFOX6 + 
bevacizumab described in Sec tion 1.2.2, the observed 96% PF rate at 6 months  
(compared with a historical estimate of approximately 77% for mFOLFOX6 + 
bevacizumab) (Saltz, 2008; Bendell, 2012; Baba, 2017; Rivera , 2017)  and the observed  
86% ORR in patients with PTEN loss (compared with 53% in the all patients ) suggest that 
mTOR inhibition may be beneficial when added to the standard of care treatment . On the 
basis of the safety  profile of single agent ABI -009, the evidence of antitumor activity in

 various solid tumors  (Section 1.3.4 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , as well as the tumor xenograft study 
demonstrating improved therapeutic potential of ABI -009 vs oral sirolimus  or everolimus , 
we propose a phase 1/[ADDRESS_988775] of care a) is safe and efficacious  
and b) suggests an improved benefit in patients with PTEN loss.   
1.5. Rationale for Starting Dose selection and Schedule of ABI -009, 
mFOLFOX6, and Bevacizumab 
Considering the safety profile of FOLFOX and bevacizumab, a dose lower than the MTD 
of single -agent ABI-009 is recommended when combined FOLFOX/bevacizumab. The 
original planned starting dose of 30 mg/m2 ABI-[ADDRESS_988776] (qw 3/4) gives a wide >3x  safety margin for patients with advanced colorectal 
cancer over the established MTD of 100 mg/m2. This dose, assuming a body surface area 
(BSA) of 1.7, is 51 mg/week (or 38 m g/week on average in a 4- week cycle), which is 
within  the therapeutic range for rapalogs :   
• In the phase 1/2 study with everolimus combined with mFOLFOX6 and 
bevacizumab [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  (Gilcrease GW, 2012) , the MTD of everolimus was 
7.5 mg/day (52.5 mg/week), which is similar to the dose range evaluated in this study.  
• Using the PK data from the phase 1 study  (Gonzalez -Angulo, 2013) , linear 
modeling of sirolimus  blood concentration predict s that 1 week after 10 and 20 
mg/m
2 ABI-009 IV administration, therapeutic trough sirolimus  levels are still 
maintained (7.11 and 14.22 ng/mL, respectively, A adi data on file). Thus, potential 
dose reduction from the starting dose of 30 mg/m2 should still result in therapeutic 
levels . 
• ABI-009 has shown similar safety profile to other rapalogs, even at a higher dose 
of 100 mg/m2. In particular, mucositis/stomatitis that were observed with other 
mTOR inhibitors has not been dose- limiting with ABI -009. 
The qw 3/[ADDRESS_988777] -in-human study 
for ABI -009 (CA401, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab will be given as in the phase 1/2 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
mFOLFOX6:  oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV with leucovorin 400mg/m2 IV over 2 hours plus FU 
400 mg/m2 IV bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks . 
Bevacizumab will be given at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks . 
While the original qw3/4 schedule starting at 30 mg/m2 was based on the studied 
schedule, with Amendment 2,  the every -2-week ABI -009 dosing schedule with a lower 
starting dose of 20 mg/m2 has been implemented based on a) alignment with the every -
2-week standard of care (FOLFOX + bevacizumab) dosing schedule and b) to allow 
sufficient time to recover from the potential cumulative myelosuppressive effect of the 
FOLFOX+ bevacizumab+ABI -009 regimen given on Day 1.

 a All visits are allowed to occur in a window of ±3 days unless otherwise specified.   
b Baseline screening visit will be done within 28 days prior to study treatment Day 1.  
c Days 8 and 22 evaluations are not required with every -2-week dosing implemented with Amendment 2.  
d End of Treatment -phase (EOT) Visit should be within [ADDRESS_988800] study treatment with either ABI -009 or mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab, whichever 
is later . Follow up will be every [ADDRESS_988801] visit till study closes or withdrawal of consent, via phone call.  
e Monitor ECG in all patients in Cycle 1 Days 1and 15, when ABI -009 infusion is given. In each case ECG is to be monitored during infusion at 
around the 30 min time point after start of infusion to coincide with the end of infusion ±10 mins . 
f Ensure that metastatic tumor sample s are collected from all patients for biomarker analysis , either fresh- frozen  or formalin -fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tumor block s or unsta ined slides (min 6) . 
g For all female patients of childbearing potential , a serum pregnancy test will be done at screening. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated within 
[ADDRESS_988802] occurred >72 hours before dosing, and at EOT. Pregnancy tests conducted after 
screening will be recorded in the source documentation only.  
h Heights are measured only at screening. BSA will be capped at 2.0 m2 for all therapeutics that require BSA calculation (ABI -009 and FOLFOX) . 
Dose recalculation due to >10% weight change is from the last known value when the weight was used for dose calculation (applies to all 
therapeutics, including bevacizumab).  
i Monitor proteinuria by [CONTACT_724170]. For patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick 
reading bevacizumab treatment should be held. Patients  should undergo further assessment with a 24- hour urine collection, if nephrotic syndrome 
is suspected . Suspend bevacizumab for >2 grams of proteinuria/24 hours and resume when proteinuria is < 2gm/24 hours. Discontinue 
bevacizumab in patients with nephrotic  syndrome.  
j Sirolimus  levels are analyzed only for patients enrolled in the dose-finding phase (phase 1). C1D1 and C1D15 post-dose samples are done 
centrally; however,  all trough levels  (pre-dose) are done locally . C1D1: predose  (anytime)  and post -dose at 0.5 hr (end of infusion), 1, 2, and 4 hrs 
after start of infusion  (±10 mins) ; C1D15 : predose ( anytime ) and post-dose at 0.5 hr  (end of infusion, ±10 mins ). Additionally, pre -dose levels will be 
analyzed on these following infusion days  C2D1 , C2D15, C3D1, C3D14, C4D1, and C4D15.  Note, pre -dose sample collection does not have a 
specific time and window; the collection should be made on the day of dosing, prior to dosing.  
k Baseline imaging must be done within 2 weeks of C1D1, but preferably as close to the day of enrollment as possible, then every 8 weeks (±1 
week) from first treatment during the 1st year, and every [ADDRESS_988803]/PET scans are 
acceptable for the study but if a CT/PET scan can be done, this is preferable. PET results are only used for qualitative assessments. MRI is 
allowed, if CT is contra- indicated for a patient. The same mode of imaging at screening must be used consistently throughout the study.   
l ABI-009, mFOLFOX6, and bevacizumab must be administered after all study specific assessments are done in a visit , with ABI-[ADDRESS_988804] followed by [CONTACT_338216]6 + bevacizumab.  It is r ecommended to limit the infusion  to central line, which is used for the standard of care 
combination agents (FOLFOX  + bevacizumab).

study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a patient  is rescreened.   
Before patient s may be entered into the study, the sponsor  requires a copy of the sites’ 
written IRB/IEC  approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other patient  
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable.  A signed and dated Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form (latest approved version) must be 
obtained from each patient  prior to performing any study -specific procedures. All patient s 
or legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the consent form 
before commencement of study -specific procedures.  Adverse events are to be collected 
for a patient  once t hey have signed the informed consent .  
Screening evaluations will be performed for all patients to determine study eligibility.  These evaluations must be obtained ≤ 28 days prior to enrollment. Any questions 
regarding patient eligibility should be directed to A adi Bioscience, Inc , or other sponsor -
nominated representatives or designees for approval.

/ BEVACIZUMAB) 
6.1. ABI-009 plus mFOLFOX6 / Bevacizumab Dosage, Administration, and 
Schedule  
Treatment with ABI -009 combined with mFOLFOX6 / bevacizumab will continue until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . A physician must be available at the time 
of administration of IP on dosing days that correspond to study visits. Supportive care per 
the institution’s normal standard of care including concomitant medications can be provided at the investigator’s discretion.  
As described in Section 2.3, with Amendment 2, an alternate dosing schedule is 
implemented to allow evaluation of ABI -[ADDRESS_988812] of care, FOLFOX + bevacizumab. The starting dose of the every -
2-week schedule is 20 mg/m
2, see table below. Dose escalation to the next dose level will 
follow the same 3+[ADDRESS_988813] 3+3 rules , per Table 4.

400 mg/m2 IV bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks) 
will be combined with b evacizumab given at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  If oxaliplatin is 
skipp ed, the 2- hr infusion time may be reduced as per institutional standards. 
Levoleucovorin (Fusilev) may be administered as a substitute for leucovorin. The levoleucovorin dose will be 200 mg/m
2 IV infusion over 2 hours, or as per institutional 
standards . The starting dose of FOLFOX + bevacizumab may also be modified as per the 
product labels and institutional standards . 
Screening or day 1 weight will be used to calculate BSA for ABI -009 and FOLFOX 
(leucovorin included) dosing; BSA will be capped at 2.0 m2 for all therapeutics that require 
BSA calculation (ABI -009 and FOLFOX). Bevacizumab dose will be calculated based on 
the actual patient weight in kilograms.   
Dose modification for weight change:  
• In the event of a ≥ 10% weight loss or gain,  BSA will be recalculated.  Dose 
recalculation is from the last known value when the weight was used for dose calculation (applies to all therapeutics, including bevacizumab).

 6.2. ABI-009 Dose Modification and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724150], ABI -009 may be 
administered ±[ADDRESS_988814] meet the following hematological requirements:  
• ANC ≥1. 0 x 109/L 
• Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L 
• Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL 
ABI-009 will be on hold up to 28 days until the patient has fulfilled these criteria.  The 
maximum delay between a missed scheduled ABI-009 dose and the next one 
(whichever dose was missed) should not be longer than 28 days. Approval from the 
medical monitor is required to restart study treatment after ≥2 8 days of interruption  
In the event of clinically significant AE  related to ABI -009 in any part of the study, ABI -
009 may be withheld, and supportive therapy administered as clinically indicated. If the 
toxicity or event is not grade 3/[ADDRESS_988815] not be increased 
to the previous level. In phase 2, if an AE resolves to grade 1 or baseline at the reduced dose level, and no additional toxicities are seen during the following cycle of study 
treatment at the reduced dose, the dose may be increased to the previous dose level , 
based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] . A maximum of 2 dose level reductions are 
allowed for a patient.  
Missed Doses  
When ABI -009 is missed on any days (D1 or D15) but FOLFOX (or at least 5FU) was 
given on D1 and/or D15, the cycle follows the schedule set by [CONTACT_16679], a standard of care.  
Day 1 Dose Missed  
When 5FU or  the entire FOLFOX regimen is missed (not given within the 3- day window) 
on CXD1 visit, the next treatment (if counts and chemistries permit) becomes Day 1 of a 
new cycle . 
Day 15 Dose Missed  
When 5FU or the entire FOLFOX regimen is missed (not given within the 3- day window) 
on CXD15 visit, the next treatment, if occurs >[ADDRESS_988816] 28 days of dosing (1 cycle) . Patients 
need to receive 2 rounds/sessions of all chemotherapy agents in the first 28 days in order 
to be evaluable for DLT assessment, unless a delay was due to toxicity in cycle 1.  Patients who did not receive 2 rounds of all chemotherapy agents within 28 days due to 
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988817] 2 doses of chemotherapy can be 
given over a longer period of time but a minimum assessment of 2 weeks will be required 
for toxicity assessment after the second dose of chemotherapy.  
Definition of DLT for the Phase 1 part of the trial:  
• Any grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity (NCI  CTCAE v 5.0), including febrile 
neutropenia,  thought to be related to the regimen, with the exception that grade [ADDRESS_988818] less than 
5 days  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with associated bleeding  
• Grade 4 anemia or thrombocytopenia related to the regimen 
• Grade 4 neutropenia

 • AND no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities 
is immediately apparent; important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or TBL values include, but are not limited to:  
− Hepatobiliary tract disease  
− Viral hepatitis (eg, Hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, 
Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella, Toxoplasmosis, and Parvovirus)  
− Right sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver 
causing ischemia.   
− Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants and mushrooms   
− Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation ( eg, Gilbert’s 
Syndrome, Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin 
glucuronidation (eg,  indinavir, atazanavir)  
− Alpha -one antitrypsin deficiency  
− Alcoholic hepatitis  
− Autoimmune hepatitis  
− Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
− Nonalcoholic Fatty  Liver Disease including Steatohepatitis (NASH)  
− Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomylosis, hemolysis)

Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AS T, 
and ALP) and/or elevated TBL is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to 
normal or baseline.  
6.4.3.  Overdose  
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as 10% over the protocol -specified dose of 
ABI-009 or mFOLFOX6 / bevacizumab assigned to a given patient, regardless of any 
associated AEs or sequelae.  
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent 
than the protocol required schedule or frequency.   
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol -
specified rate of 30 minutes for each infusion.

treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in Section  8.2. 
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724155].  Use of prohibited medications  and procedures  will be evaluated and 
documented during screening and on study. Therapy name [CONTACT_663752], dose, frequency, route, start date and stop date will be recorded on each patient ’s CRF (s). 
8.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures  
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from 
the time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the CRF . The minimum requirement is that drug name, dose, and the dates 
of administration are to be recorded. Additionally, a complete list of all prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724156] . 
Patient s should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of 
blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti -emetics, anti -diarrheals, 
and analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines.  G-CSF growth factors may be administered at the discretion of 
the investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines.  
Extreme precaution must be taken with contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only), as it is not known if there is the potential of inhibition/induction of enzymes that 
affect the metabolism of estrogens and/or progestins.   
8.2. Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
The use of certain medications, and illicit drugs within [ADDRESS_988831] dose of study drug and for the duration of the study  will not be

bevacizumab 
• Phase 2: PF rate at 6 months in patients treated with ABI -009 at the RP2D, in 
combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab, assessed by [CONTACT_724174](s): data both from phase 1 and 2 
• Phase 1:   
o Safety profile of dose cohorts analyzed separately and together  
o DCR assessed by [CONTACT_431], dose cohorts analyzed separately and 
together   
• Phase 2:  
o Median PFS, ORR, DOR, and DCR assessed by [CONTACT_724175]  
o PF rate at 6 months based on PTEN status  
o Safety at RP2D  
Exploratory Endpoint(s):  
• Biomarkers:  
o Pre-treatment metastatic tumor biopsy:  (fresh or archival) are required 
from all patients to assess baseline biomarker and mutational analysis, 
including PTEN loss evaluation, PIK3CA and Ras mutational status, 
and mTOR pathway markers (including, but not limited to S6K, 4EBP1). In particular, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_724176].  If tissue from metastatic site is not 
available, primary lesion tissue is acceptable. Reports on mutational status will be  collected from all patients, if available.  
o Blood samples: for cell -free plasma DNA collection (pretreatment, C3 
and C6 D1 post -treatment, upon disease progression, and/or end of last 
dose of treatment) for all patients. Molecular analysis of circulating D NA 
assay using next generation sequencing to assess changes over time 
as response to therapy of the prevalence of mutations identified in the 
baseline tumor samples . 
 Nucleic acids extracted from blood can also be used to 
investigate whether circulating tumor nucleic acids are 
associated with disease progression

Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988834], laboratory abnormalities, 
and incidence of patients experiencing dose modifications , dose delay/dose not given,  
dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP due to an AE. All AEs will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_724177] [ADDRESS_988835] dose of IP. Adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_4652] v5.0. 
Physical examination, vital signs, laboratory assessments (eg, serum chemistry, 
hematology), and ECOG performance status will be monitored. All S AEs (regardless of 
relationship to IP) will be followed until resolution. Local laboratory analysis will be 
performed as per study schedule.  
9.3. Efficacy Analysis  
The Efficacy Analysis Set includes all enrolled patients with measurable tumor per 
RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_988836] / PET (or MRI).  
Efficacy will be a ssessed by [CONTACT_724178] / PET scans and RECIST v1.1.  Only 
RECIST v1.1 criteria will be used to assess response;  PET will be used for qualitative 
purposes only.  
For the phase [ADDRESS_988837] two- sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided.  
Progression- free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study drug 
administration to disease progression or death due to any cause. For PFS , the KM 
estimates and corresponding two- sided 95% confidence i ntervals for the median and 
quartiles will be provided. The KM plot may also be provided.  
The ORR and DCR will be reported along with exact 95% confidence intervals computed by [CONTACT_39715] -Pearson method.  
All efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed based on PTEN status.

 10. MONITORING, RECORDING AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
10.1. Toxicities of ABI -009  
ABI-009 is an albumin- bound formulation of sirolimus . No unexpected toxicities not 
already known for sirolimus  (Rapamune®) or the sirolimus  prodrug, temsirolimus  
(Torisel®), were identified in the nonclinical toxicity studies, or observed in the phase 1 
studi es for ABI -009. 
More details on the known precautions, warnings, and AEs of sirolimus  and rapalogs  are 
found in the Rapamune® and Torisel® Package Insert s ([COMPANY_007], 2011a; [COMPANY_007], 2011b) . 
10.2. Toxicities of FOLFOX  
FOLFOX regimens combine oxaliplatin and leucovorin with bolus and infusional 5-
fluorouracil (5- FU). Oxaliplatin is a DNA cross -linking agent consisting of a platinum ion 
chelated with1, 2- diaminocyclohexane (DACH) and an oxalate ligand. It undergoes 
spontaneous activation in aqueous solutions via displacement of the labile oxalate ligand by [CONTACT_16657]. The activated compounds bind with DNA, resulting in inter - and intra- strand 
platinum -DNA crosslinks. 5 -FU is an anti -metabolite that blocks the methylation reaction 
of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, causing thymidine- less cell death in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_724157]. Leucovorin is reduced folic acid that modulates the activity of 5- FU by 
[CONTACT_724180] 5- FdUMP/ thymidylate synthetase complex. Side effects associated 
with FOLFOX include neuropathy including pharyngo- laryngodysesthesia, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, and mild myelosuppression.  
10.3. Toxicities of Bevacizumab 
Per the prescribing information, the most common adverse reactions incidence (incidence 
> 10%) are epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry 
skin, rectal hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain and exfoliative dermatitis  
(Genentech, 2017) . 
Due to bevacizumab’s influence on blood vessels, it causes coagulative side effects and conversely also bleeding and wound repair problems, including GI perforation and fistulae  
(Tahover, 2013) . 
10.4. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes:  
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol]  
• Assessment of relatedness to the IP 
• Assessment of relatedness to protocol -required procedures  
• Action taken 
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988839] 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening (places the patient  at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event necessitated an 
in-patient admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of 
the serious criteria, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “other 
medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could inc lude allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug- induced liver injury, or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
Since the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory  criteria for SAEs, 
if AEs correspond to grade 4 “life threatening” CTCAE grading scale criteria 
(eg, laboratory abnormality reported as grade 4 without manifestation of life threatening 
status), it will be left to the investigator’s judgment to also repor t these abnormalities as 
SAEs.  For any AE that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the 
event’s severity status must be recorded in the patient ’s medical record.   
10.5.2.  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse experiences that are drug- related must be reported by [CONTACT_724181], and to the FDA within 7 days as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be 
reported to A adi Bioscience Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form , or 
approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any 
follow- up reports.  
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that 
occur during the study (from the time of signing of the informed consent form to [ADDRESS_988840] dose of IP), and those made known to the investigator at any time thereafter 
that are suspected of being related to IP.

Protocol: COLO -007          Aadi Bioscience 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  63          Amendment 2.1  
 The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise 
summary of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724158]. If a patient  died and an 
autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_724159] A adi Bioscience Drug Safety as soon as these become available. Any follow- up 
data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and 
sent to A adi Bioscience Drug Safet y.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up information 
about the event. The investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_724160] A adi Bioscience and the IRB/EC.  
10.6. Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Reporting 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female patient , or female partner of a male patient , while the 
patient  is taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , report the pregnancy to A adi Bioscience as 
specified below.  In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, 
investigators should monitor for pregnancies that occur up to [ADDRESS_988841] 
notify Aadi Bioscience Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy 
(either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or 
approved equivalent form. If a lactation case occurs while the female patient  is taking 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], report the lactation case to A adi Bioscience as specified 
below.  In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should 
monitor for lactation cases that occur up to [ADDRESS_988842] dose of protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988843]  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a patient from 
the IP:  
• AE(s) (that are intolerable)  
• Disease progression  
• Physician decision  
• Withdrawal of consent (from treatment only)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up 
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specified on the CRF ) 
The reason for treatment discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
11.2. Discontinuation from the Study  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a patient from the study:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up 
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specified on the CRF ) 
The reason for study discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
At the time of withdrawal, it should be determined whether the patient is withdrawing from treatment alone, or from treatment and collection of further data (e.g. , survival). Every 
effort should be made to  collect survival data after patient withdraws from treatment.  
Patient s have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].

 12. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
12.1. Informed Consent  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator  to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template ar e to 
be communicated formally in writing from the investigator to A adi Bioscience. The written 
informed consent document is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient 
population.  
Before a patient ’s participation in the clini cal study, the  investigator  is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the patient  after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any 
protocol- specific  screening procedures or the IP is  administered.   
The investigator  is also responsible for asking the patient  if the patient  has a primary care 
physician and if the patient  agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the 
patient ’s participation in the clinical study . If the patient  agrees to such notification, the  
investigator  is to inform the patient ’s primary care physician of the patient ’s participation 
in the clinical study.  If the patient  does not have a primary care physician and the  
investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator  is to document such in the 
patient’ s medical record. 
The acquisition of informed consent  and the patient ’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician is to be documented in the patient ’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  to be signed and personally  dated by [CONTACT_724182] a legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_67622].  The original  signed informed consent  form is to be retained in 
accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form  is to be 
provided to the patient  or legally acceptable representativ e. 
If a potential patient  is illiterate or visually impa ired and does not have a legally acceptable 
representative, the i nvestigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed 
consent form to the patient  and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the patient  and 
the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was 
freely given and understood.   
12.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent  Ethic s Committee  
A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, other written patient  information, 
and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IRB for written approval.  
A copy of the written approval of the protocol and infor med consent form must be received 
by [CONTACT_724183] s into the study and shipment of A adi 
Bioscience IP. 
The investigator  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amend ments and changes to the informed consent document.  The 
investigator  is to notify the IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAEs  occurring at the 
site and other AE reports received from A adi Bioscience, in accordance with local 
procedures.

Protocol: COLO -007          Aadi Bioscience 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  67          Amendment 2.1  
 The investigator  is responsible for obtaining annual  IRB approval [IRBs only]/renewa l 
[IRBs and IECs] throughout the duration of the study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] i nvestigator’s report s 
and the IRB  continuance of approval must be sent  to Aadi Bioscience . 
12.3. Patient Confidentiality  
The investigator  must ensure that the patient ’s confidentiality is maintained fo r documents 
submitted to A adi Bioscience. 
• Patient s are to be identified  by a unique patient  identification number. 
• Wh ere permitted, date of birth  is to be documented and formatted in 
accordance with local laws and regulations. 
• On the CRF demographics page, in addition to the  unique patient  identification 
number, include the age at time of enrollment. 
• For SAEs  reported to A adi Bioscience , patient s are to be identified by [CONTACT_724184], initials (f or faxed reports,  in accordance  
with local laws and regulations), and dat e of birth ( in accordance with local laws 
and regulations ). 
• Documents that are  not subm itted to Aadi Bioscience (eg, signed informed 
consent forms)  are to be kept in confidence by [CONTACT_093] , except as 
described belo w. 
In compliance with Federal regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the 
investigator  and institution permit authorized rep resentatives of the company, of the 
regulatory agency(s), and the IRB direct access to review the patient ’s original medical 
records for verification of study- related procedures and data.  Direct access includes 
examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are 
important to the evaluation of the study.  The investigator  is obligated to inform and obtain 
the consent of the patient  to permit  such individuals to have access to his/her study-
related records, including per sonal information.  
12.4. Protocol Amendments   
If investigator amends the protocol, agreement from A adi Bioscience must be obtained.  
The IRB must be informed of all amendments and give approval.  The investigator must 
send a copy of the approval letter from the IRB to Aadi Bioscience. 
12.5. T ermination of the Stu dy 
Both Aadi Bioscience and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the Investigator ’s 
participation in the study according to the study contract.  The investigator  is to notify the  
IRB in writing of the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the 
notification to Aadi Bioscience .

 13. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
13.1. Data/Documents 
The investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct 
of the study and the distribution of the investigational product  are complete, accurate, 
filed, and retained. Examples of source documents include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]; clinic and 
office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; checklists; dispensing records; recorded data 
from automated instruments; copi[INVESTIGATOR_12607]; microfiche; x -ray film and reports; and records kept at the pharmacy; 
and the laboratories, as well as copi[INVESTIGATOR_164371] s or CD- ROM.  
13.2. Data Management  
Data will be c ollected via CRF and entered into the clinical database. These data will be 
electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by [CONTACT_210092].  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and 
investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected 
in the database.  An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
13.3. Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection  
The i nvestigator  is responsibl e for compl ying with the requirements  for all assessments 
and data collection (including patient s not receiving protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  as 
stipulated in the protocol for each patient  in the study.  For patient s who withdraw prior to 
completion of all protocol- required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of  Assessment s (Table 2) , the investigator  can search publicly  available records 
(where permitted) to ascertain survival status.   
This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as 
comprehensive as poss ible. 
13.4. The i nvestigator  is responsibl e Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood or  tumor sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment s (Table 
2) can be analyzed for any of the tests out lined in  the protocol and for any tes ts necessary 
to minimize risks t o study patient s. This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study . This can also include, 
but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be no less than single coded prior to being shipped 
from the  site for analysis, or storage.  Tracking of samples will be independent of the 
patient ’s identification number for the study. Results are stored in a secure database to 
ensure confidentiality.   
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.   
The records should be retained by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator/ sponsor according to ICH, local 
regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer; but at a 
ABI-009/mFOLFOX6/Bev  
Protocol: COLO -[ADDRESS_988844] elapsed since formal discontinuation of clinical development of ABI -009. 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the patient  directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of other exploratory studies are not placed in the patient ’s 
medical record and are not to be made available to the patient , members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The patient  retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_582386].  Following the request from the patient , the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and patient  number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor  samples and any other components from the cells  can be located and 
destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.   
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request 
of the patient  through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate 
(e.g., the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type  no longer  
justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this research 
project, the sponsor owns the commercial product. The patient  has no commercial rights 
to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or 
derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.

 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
The Institution representative, A adi Bioscience representativ e(s) or designee and 
regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contact[CONTACT_724185], upon request, inspecting the various 
records of the clinical study (eg, CRF s and other pertinent data) provided that patient  
confidentiality is respected.  
The Institution representative together with the A adi Bioscience representative or 
designee are responsible for verifying the CRF s as needed throughout the study to verify 
adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and 
adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  Monitoring will include 
on-site visits with the investigator and his/her  staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
IP storage area, CRFs, patient’s source documents, and all other study documentation 
will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_941] A adi Bioscience representative or designee in 
accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan.   
The investigator  agrees  to cooperate with the clinical monitor  to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completi ng CRFs, 
are resolved.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s  audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by [CONTACT_724186] A adi Bioscience ’s Inspection of site facilities (eg, 
pharmacy,  protocol- required therapy  storage areas, laboratories) and review of study-
related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, 
ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.

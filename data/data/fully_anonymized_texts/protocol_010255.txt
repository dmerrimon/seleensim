Study Aims  
Aim 1.1:  To compare reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by [CONTACT_163977], pr otein expression of 
p47phox subunit of NADPH oxidase, in MNC’ s prior to and following 12 w eeks of dapagliflozin or 
placebo.  
Aim 1.2 : To compare intranuclear NFκB binding and the expression of JN K-1, TLR-4, SOCS-3, 
IL-1, and TNFα in MNC before and following 12 weeks of treatment wi th dapagliflozin or 
placebo. 
Aim 1.3:  To compare plasma hs-CRP, endotoxin and IL-6 concentrations an d oxidized lipi[INVESTIGATOR_144045] 
p l a s m a  ( T B A R S )  a n d  i n  u r i n e  ( F 2-isoprostane) of obese type 2 diabetic patients prior to and 
following 12 weeks of dapagliflozin or placebo.  
Aim 1.4 : To compare postprandial (after a High fat and high carbohydra tes meal) changes in ROS 
generation, NFκB binding in MNC and plasma LPS prior to and fol lowing 12 weeks of 
dapagliflozin and placebo. 
Aim 2 : to study the effect of single dose of dapagliflozin or placeb o on oxidative stress and 
inflammatory mediators listed in  Aim 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 in MNC fr om obese type 2 diabetic patients. 
Aim 3.1 : To evaluate effects of treatment with dapagliflozin for 12 we eks on blood pressure and 
the requirement of anti-hypertensive medication.  
Aim 3.2 : To compare the in plasma concentrations of cGMP, cAMP, ANP, B NP, and a reduction 
in plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen, renin and angioten sin II before and following 12 
weeks of dapagliflozin or placebo. 
 Page 6 of 39  IRB Version: JAN2016  1.3 State the hypotheses to b e tested, if applicable. 
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about wh at you expect to 
happen in your study that co rresponds with your above listed ob jectives. 
Response: 
 Hypothesis 1:  Dapagliflozin treatment suppresses basal and meal induced oxid ative and 
inflammatory stress in mononuclear  cells (MNC) of patients with  type 2 diabetes.  
Hypothesis 2:  Dapagliflozin acutely  suppresses oxidative and inflammatory stress in MNC of 
patients with type 2 diabetes  
Hypothesis 3 : Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with dapagliflozin  will reduce blood 
pressure and increase vasodilato rs and suppress vasoconstrictor s concentrations.  
 
2.0 Scientific Endpoints 
 
2.1    Describe the scientific endpoi nt(s), the main result or occurrence under 
study.   
 
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are out comes defined before the stu dy begins to determine 
whether the objectives of the stu dy have been met and to draw c onclusions from the data.  
Include primary and secondary endpoints.  Some example endpoint s are:  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement in quality of life, or survival.   Your response should not be a 
date.   
Response:  The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a significant d ifference in the percent 
change in fasting NF κB activation (DNA binding activity) in MNC before and after dap agliflozin 
use (0 week vs. 12 weeks) as compared to placebo. Secondary end points include comparing 
changes in expression of p47phox, SOCS-3, IL-1 , JNK-1, TLR4; and plasma concentrations of 
LPS between dapagliflozin and placebo groups. In addition, plas ma concentrations of TNF- , IL-
6, IL-1, CRP, ANP, b-NP, cGMP, cAMP, angiotensinogen, renin and angiot ensin II will also be 
measured at 0, [ADDRESS_190371] ing literature and how it will c ontribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe a ny gaps in current knowledge.  I nclude 
relevant preliminary findings or  prior research by [CONTACT_31691].  
Response:  Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT-2 mediated glucose trans port. This action 
inhibits the reabsorption of glucose from proximal convoluted t ubules and hence induces 
glucosuria. This action has recently been utilized in the treat ment of diabetes since with the 
reduction of renal threshold for glucosuria following the inhib ition of SGLT-2, glucose 
concentration falls. This acti on is independent of insulin and β-cell function and thus, may 
potentially be of use in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes.  
Since glucose and hyperglycemia induce oxidative and inflammato ry stress ( 1,2), it is likely that 
dapagliflozin will reduce oxidative and inflammatory stress. Si nce oxidative and inflammatory 
stresses are the basic mechanis ms underlying atherosclerosis, a  potential anti-oxidative and 
inflammatory action would be an ti-atherogenic. Furthermore, dap agliflozin is also known to 
 Page 7 of 39  IRB Version: JAN2016  reduce blood pressure ( 3,4), the mechanism underlying which is not known. An anti-hyperte nsive 
action is also anti-atherogenic.  Since dapagliflozin is current ly licensed for use in type [ADDRESS_190372] described by [CONTACT_3019] ( 5), is associated with an increase in plasma 
concentrations of known vasodilators, ANP, cGMP and cAMP; in ad dition, there is a reduction in 
plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen, renin and angiotensin  II. Although the blood pressure 
lowering effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors is attributed to osmotic d iuresis secondary to glucosuria and 
hypovolemia, it is possible that other mechanisms, as enumerate d above, are involved. 
These data will provide us with novel information on the potent ial anti-inflammatory 
effects of dapagliflozin; in addition, they will also provide i nformation on post prandial 
glycemia, insulinogenesis and incretin secretion. Finally, it m ay provide us with 
information on the mechanisms underlying the anti-hypertensive effect of this drug   
It is also important that the mechanisms underlying the blood p ressure lowering effect be 
investigated. Our recent work h as shown that blood pressure low ering effect of GLP-[ADDRESS_190373] described by [CONTACT_3019] ( 5), is associated with an increase in plasma 
concentrations of known vasodilators, ANP, cGMP and cAMP; in ad dition, there is a reduction in 
plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen, renin and angiotensin  II. Although the blood pressure 
lowering effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors is attributed to osmotic d iuresis secondary to glucosuria and 
hypovolemia, it is possible that other mechanisms, as enumerate d above, are involved.

4.0 Study Design 
4.1 Describe and explain the study de sign (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, inte rventional, longitudinal, obser vational). 
Response: This is a single center, prospective, randomized, placebo –cont rolled, parallel design 
and double blind study. The st udy will be conducted at the Diab etes – Endocrinology Center of 
Western [LOCATION_001] under the direction of [CONTACT_28590], M.D . 
Two groups of 26 patients each ( total 52 patients) with type 2 diabetes on oral agents will be 
included in the study. One group will be randomized to dapaglif lozin (a dose of [ADDRESS_190376] week) while the oth er will be placebo. The patients will 
be treated for 12 weeks. Randomiz ation will take in considerati on even distribution of patients in 
regards to background medications (statins, ACE inhibitors, TZD s and ARBs). Only half the 
patients (equal numbers in both  groups) will be tested for the secondary endpoints related to 
postprandial and single dose induced changes.   
 
5.0 Local Number of Subjects

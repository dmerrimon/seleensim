Version: 1.[ADDRESS_928238] -stroke hemiplegia , but not multiple sclerosis (MS) . We are aware  of only one pi[INVESTIGATOR_366371] a powered exoskeleton (ReWalk®) in MS . Thir teen persons with MS and EDSS 5.[ADDRESS_928239] frequent adverse event.  
Qualitative improvement of sitting, standing, and walking posture was noted in those who used the 
device cons istently.  We are not aware of any study of the EksoBionics GT  exoskeleton in MS.  
Device  
The EksoGT is a powered motorized orthosis intended to enable individuals who are experiencing 
muscular or neurological conditions affecting their lower extremities to perform ambulatory functions 
such as gait training. (See Figures 1 and 2.) It consists of a fitted metal brace that supports the legs, feet, 
and torso. It is adjustable to a ccommodate different length seg ments and different hip widths. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
a physica l therapi[INVESTIGATOR_684947]’s feet, legs, and torso into the device. Soft goods (pads, spacers, 
straps, and supports) are available for bracing and adapting to various body types. The straps and soft 
goods are specifically designed to prevent pressure p oints or other skin issues. There is also a link (Don -
Doff Link) just below each hip joint, which permits abducting the legs while seated to facilitate donning 
and doffing the device.

dimensions.  
 
The EksoGT  manipulates the patient’s legs and waist to stand up, walk over level ground, and then to sit 
down. Battery powered motors drive knee and hip joints. The batteries are designed to last for 

[ADDRESS_928240] stops 
at the limits of healthy Participant ranges of motion to prevent powering the joint of the user to a 
position that the joint cannot reach. The actuated range of motion at the hip is -20° to 135° and the 
actuated range for the knee is 0° to 120°. Not all of this range of motion is needed in normal walking; 
howeve r the ranges of these joints were selected to provide for other necessary functions such as 
standing and sitting. At the ankle the device is passive, with springs to resist sagittal plane motion, and 
locked in the other degrees of freedom. The range of mot ion provided at the ankle is from -10° to 20° 
dorsiflexion with hard stops at the limits of this range to protect the user and a setting to specify the 
neutral angle.  
Redundant position sensing on all of the actuated joints ensures that the motors are alwa ys controlled 
using reliable sensor information. In addition, the device has numerous sensor, motor, and software 
monitoring systems.  If any abnormality is detected (i.e. excess joint speed or force, or if redundant 
sensors do not agree) the device enters  a safe mode, which prevents continued walking and enables the 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554947]. The device is also equipped with fail -safe brakes on the 
actuated knee joints, such that if the device loses power or is shut down for any reaso n the knees will 
continue to support the patient. Finally, an emergency disable button is available to instantly shut down 
the device for any reason. This is implemented via hardware, so it is effective even during a software 
malfunction.   
All study physi cal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_684948]. The training 
will be conducted at our facility.  
Aims  
1. To assess the feasibility and safety of using the EksoBionics GT  exoskeleton for gait training in patients 
with relapsing or progressive MS and severe mobility limitations (EDSS 5-5 – 7.5). 
2. To collect preliminary efficacy outcomes on gait and walking  for the purpose of designing a larger 
clinical trial of the EksoBionics GT exoskeleton for gait training in patients with MS .

MS Walking Scale-12 
 
The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  is a comprehensive, quantitative neurological examination,  
and is the most widely used measure of MS -related disability f or clinical and research purposes . The 
order of the exam may vary slightly among providers, but generally the patient undergoes a complete 
neurologic examination, then completes up to a 500 met er walk (with or without an assistive device) 
which involves walking the length of our [ADDRESS_928244] 10 times. The examiner notes the 
distance the patient is able to walk, along with the presence of an assistive device, if applicable . 
The Mini Me ntal State Examination (MMSE)  is an 11 -question measure that tests five areas of cognitive 
function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. Widely used in clinical 
practice, the MMSE will be administered in this study t o screen for severe cognitive impairment that 
precludes safe participation.  
The Numeric Pain Rating Scale  evaluates pain by [CONTACT_684952] a 0 -10 level scale (from no pain to maximal pain). In addition, th e patient will be asked 
to report the location of the pain. A publication from a cross -sectional study using the NRS on 236 MS 
patients with pain proposed the following cutoff scores: 0 -2 : mild, 3 -5 : moderate,  6 -10 : severe.1 Pain 
will be assessed as a safety measure.  
The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology ( QUEST ) questionnaire  v.2 is a 
new outcome measurement instrument designed to evaluate a person’s satisfaction with his or her 
assistive technology device. It can be used with adolescents, adults and elderly persons who as a result 
of a physical or sensory impairment have acquired an  assistive technology device. The QUEST 2.[ADDRESS_928245] factors and comfort  
The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) : the Ashworth scale, first published in 1964, grades resistance to 
passive mobilization on a [ADDRESS_928246] widely used measure of spasticity in clinical trials. The modified version of the Ashworth 
scale, which allows one intermediate grade, will be used for this study. We will evaluate t he following 
muscle groups: hip adductors, knee flexors, and knee extensors. The MAS scores for all muscle groups in 
both legs will be averaged.  
Hip Flexor Strength  will be measured bilaterally with a hand -held dynamometer (the Lafayette Manual 
Muscle Testing System, Lafayette IN). This device provides a digital display of the force generated by 
[CONTACT_684953]. Two measurements of peak strength will be tak en on each side, and the 
average of the measurements will be calculated. Hand -held dynamometry was found more reproducible 
and sensitive to change than the manual muscle test grading system .

visit The GAITRite electronic walkway  is a computerized gait analysis s ystem consisting of a 30 -foot mat with 
embedded sensors and a data acquisition and processing software. The GAITRite has been used to 
analyze gait patterns in various neurologic populations, including MS. The spatiotemporal gait 
parameters analyzed include  stride length, double support time, base of support (step width), and the 
functional ambulation profile (FAP) score.  
The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN)  system is installed in the Mellen Center 
building and routinely used for patient care and clinical research. The hardware includes: a 6 degrees of 
freedom motion base on which sits a 3 -meter diameter platform with a dual belt instrumented 
treadmill; a 10 -camera real -time motion capture system; a 120 -degree cylindrical screen projection  
system with surround sound; wireless EMG and [ADDRESS_928247] 
motion. The software allows to define inputs, perturbations  and sensory disturbances, for research and 
training purposes. Gait data is continuously recorded and analyzed offline using the Gait Off -Line 
Analysis Tool. The CAREN system is staffed with two trained operators, who are also developers for the 
system.  
The Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW)  is part of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), an 
outcome measure for MS therapeutic trials. This test has been widely used to measure walking speed in 
MS. The patient is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as  possible, but safely. Two trials are conducted, 
and the average time is calculated.  
The 2-Minute Walk (2MW)  has been validated in cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], in lower limb 
amputation, and has been used in neurorehabilitation trials in stroke [ADDRESS_928248] as possible (but safely) for [ADDRESS_928249] or evaluator decision, the time and reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_684950].  
The MS Walking Scale -12 (MSWS -12) is a disease -specific instrument gathering subject -reported 
information about the impact of MS on the ir walking ability, designed for use in clinical prac tice and 
clinical research.  The MSWS -[ADDRESS_928250] been extensively evaluated in diverse MS populations in both  
community and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], with demonstration of internal consistency, high reliability and 
validity, and good generalizability.

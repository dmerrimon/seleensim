 3 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  Background and Scientific Justification for Conducting the Study  
Antibody mediated rejection ( AMR ) is one of  the most challenging adverse events after  kidney 
transplantation and despi[INVESTIGATOR_295075]. AMR  can occur in 
patients with preexisting anti -Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) Donor-Specific Antibodies 
(DSA) or  in patients without DSA at transplantation  but who develop de novo DSA.  
Transplant Glomerulopathy  (TG)  is a known consequence of persistent DSA positivity which 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295076] .  
Currently used therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295077] g +/- rituximab, Plasma Exchange (PE)  with 
low dose IVI g +/- rituximab , eculizu mab and a minimal experience with bortezomib. However, 
no therapy is currently  approved,  and patients are often treated with combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295078]. Thus , there is a large unmet clinical need 
for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295079] .   
This study  is designed to investigate  the safety and efficacy of imlifidase removing anti -HLA 
antibodies in the  treatment of  active or chronic active AMR after transplanta tion. The primary 
objective of this study is to determine if imlifidase is effective in removing DSAs and thus  
lessen  antibody mediated kidney damage  in subjects experiencing post-transplant  antibody 
mediated rejection .  
Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to:  
• Investigate the efficacy of imlifidase compared with PE in removal of DSA  in 
patients who are experiencing an active or chronic active AMR epi[INVESTIGATOR_295080]: 
• Evaluate DSA  levels up to 180 days after treatment  
• Evaluate HLA -antibodies levels up to 180 days after treatment  
• Evaluate the overall kidney function  up to 180 days after treatment  
• Investigate the occurrence of AMR up to 180 days after treatment  
• Investigat e the safety and tolerability of imlifidase compared to PE  in patient s 
experiencing active  or chronic active AMR  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• Evaluate the number of PE-sessions needed  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of imlifidase

 4 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of this study is:  
• Maximum reduction in mean DSA level at any time  point during the 5 days following 
the  start of treatment  
Secondary endpoints of this study are:  
• DSA levels up to 180 days after treatment  
• HLA -antibodies  levels up to 180 days after treatment  
• Kidney function  change from baseline, (at screening), as evaluated by [CONTACT_67889], 
P-creatinine  and albumin/creatinine ratio in urine up to 180 days after treatment   
• Proportion of subjects with graft loss withi n 180 days of treatment  
• Signs of transplant glomerulopathy  [ADDRESS_359608] treatment  
• Change from baseline (at screening) in histopathology per Banff Criteria at 29 and 
180 day s 
• Change from baseline (at screening) in mRNA levels in kidney biopsies evaluated  
at 29 and 180 days from baseline . If kidney biopsy is performed before 
screening, mRNA levels will be evaluated on day 29 and day 180 (no baseline will be 
available)  
• Safety parameters (AEs, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG)  
• Type, frequency and intensity of adverse events  
• Number of sessions with PE  
• Total Serum IgG levels o ver time  
• Presence of intact IgG on SDS -page/Western blot until start of IVIg treatment  
• DSA functionality determined by C1q or C3d analysis pre - and post -treatment  
• PK profile of imlifidase (C max, Tmax, t½, AUC, CL, V)  
• Presence of  ADA (anti -imlifidase IgG)  
Methodology  
This is a  randomized,  open label, multi -centre, active control  study. The study will primarily 
examine the reduction in mean levels of DSA after treatment with imlifidase compared with 
PE in patients diagnosed  with active  or chronic active  AMR  according to Banff 20 17 criteria, 
including presence of DSA(s) . Included subjects will be randomized to receive either one dose 
of imlifidase 0.25 mg/kg or [ADDRESS_359609] treatment , followed by a tapering  
schedule with prednisolone /prednisone . Subjects will receive  high dose IVIg [ADDRESS_359610] PE.  A single dose of rituximab will be given 5 
days after completed IVIg  infusion.

 5 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  Study Procedures/Assessments  
Before inclusion into the study, a biopsy will be collected fro m all subjects , and assessments  
of DSA and ADA (IgE), vital signs, ECG as well as laboratory parameters  including 
haematology, clinical chemistry, haemostasis , urinalysis , and PCR test for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_359611]. Subjects will b e randomised to imlifidase infusion, 0.25 mg/kg over 15 min, or 5-
10 PE treatment, and subsequently followed for 180 days after start of  treatment . Blood 
samples for DSA, PK, PD and ADA will be collected at multiple time points during the study. 
Protocol bio psies will be performed on day 29 and on day 180  and kidney function will be 
followed by [CONTACT_295107] , eGFR calculations and urine sample 
for measurement of albumin/creatinine ratio  during the full study period.  
Safety parameters will be assessed up to day 180. Reporting of adverse events will be done 
throughout the study.  
Number of subject s 
A total of 30 subjects will be included in the study distributed as 20 subjects in the imlifidase 
arm and 10 subjects in t he PE arm. The sample size is not based on a formal calculation but 
with 20+10 subjects the expected width of the 95% CI of the difference in DSA reduction at 
any timepoint during the 5 days following the  start of  treatment (primary endpoint) is 8% 
point.  This expected width is considered acceptable for evaluating a possible difference or 
similarity between the two treatments.  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion /exclusion   
Main inclusion criteria are:  
• Male and/or female  donor kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  age ≥18 years  at the time of screening  
• Presence of DSA(s)  
• Meet the Banff 2017 criteria for active  or chronic active  AMR   
• At least 25% rise in serum creatinine compared to last individual value taken prior to 
the AMR. Patients with delayed graft  function and AMR within 10 days after 
transplant (confirmed by [CONTACT_295108]) can be included regardless of serum 
creatinine level  
Main ex clusion criteria are:  
• Previous treatment with imlifidase  
• Previous high dose IVIg treatment (2 g/kg) within 28 days pr ior to inclusion  
• Subject s with significantly abnormal general serum screening lab results, judged 
inappropriate for inclusion in the study by [CONTACT_093]   
• Clinically  relevant active infection(s) as judged by [CONTACT_093]  
• Any condition that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_295081] ’s risk

 14 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
The company code initially used for the active substance in this project was HMED -IdeS 
(sometimes abbreviated to IdeS) and thus many reports refer to this name.  
The International Non -proprietary Name (INN) imlifidase was recently assigned for the active 
substance and  this name [CONTACT_295155] .  
1.1. Background  
Patient population and unmet medical need  
Antibody Mediated Rejection ( AMR ) is one of the most challenging adverse events  after kidney 
transplantation and despi[INVESTIGATOR_295075]. AMR  can occur in patients 
with preexisting anti -Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) Donor-Specific Antibodies (DSA) or  
in patients without DSA at transplantation  but who develop de novo DSA.  
Significant advances have occurred in the ability to predict patients at risk f or and to diagnose 
AMR . The pathophysiology of AMR  suggests a prime role for antibodies, B -cells and plasma 
cells. Recent research  has indicated that B -cells and plasma cells produce DSAs  that interact 
with the endothelium, which activates the  cellular pathways responsible for the development of  
microcirculatory changes and tissue injury .   
Satisfying data on the effectiveness of currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295082], and  
post-transplant AMR  and chronic AMR  remain significant problems  (Djamali et al. 2014 ). 
Transplant Glomerulopathy  (TG)  is a known consequence of persistent DSA positivity which 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295083] (Gloor et 
al. 2008 ; Jordan et al. 2010 ; Lefaucheur et al. 2010 ; Port et al. 1993 ; Reinsmoen et al. 2008 ; 
OPTN 2012 ). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295084]  (Sellares et al. 2012 ). Currently used therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295085] g +/- rituximab, plasma exchange (PE)  with low dose IVI g +/- rituximab , 
eculizumab  and a minimal experience with bortezomib. However, no  therapy is currently 
approved,  and patients are often treated with combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295086]. Thus , there is a large unmet clinical need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295087] .   
Imlifidase  
Imlifidase  is an IgG -degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes  that cleaves all four human 
subclasses of IgG with strict specificity. Imlifidase  hydrolyzes human IgG below the hinge 
region thereby [CONTACT_295112] F(ab’) 2 fragment and one Fc -fragment which does not bind to 
Fc-receptors and does not activate complement. Thus, the proteolytic activity of imlifidase  on 
IgG molecules prevents IgG mediated phagocytosis, antibody -depend ent cellular cytotoxicity  
and complement mediated injury  (Winstedt et al. 2015 ; Jarnum et al. 2017 ). Imlifidase  is highly 
specific towards IgG and other Ig molecules, i.e. IgA, IgD, IgE and IgM, are not cleaved and 
no other substrates have been identified.  Apart from imlifidase  restrict ed target specificity, the 
speed of the reaction is a major advantage of imlifidase . Within a few hours after dosing, the

(LOAEL ) to 20 mg/kg in both species.  
Previous clinical experience with imlifidase  
Six studies with imlifidase  have been completed:  
1. First human study , to assess the safety and tolerability of the IgG cleaving enzyme from 
the Streptococcus pyogenes  Immunoglobulin G degrading enzyme of 
(11-HMed IdeS-01, EudraCT no. 2012 -000 969 -21). 
2. A study to evaluate the safety and  efficacy o f imlifidase in Chronic Kidney Disease 
Patients  (CKD ) (13-HMed IdeS-02, EudraCT no. 2013 -005417 -13) 
3. A phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
intravenous ascending doses of imlifidase in kidney transplantation  in sensitized 
patients (13-HMedIdeS -03, EudraCT no. 2014 -000712 -34)

in sensitized CKD patients with the primary endpoint  to find an imlifidase  dosing scheme 
result ing in HLA -antibody levels acceptable for transplantation in the majority of patients. 
Patients receive d imlifidase  infusions of 0.12  mg/kg twice, 0.25 mg/kg once , or 0.25 mg/kg 
twice. The study also assessed safety, tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and  pharmacodynamics 
of imlifidase . The study did not include transplantation of the patients. However, patien ts were 
not removed from the transplant waitlist during the study and one patient was transplanted  
following imlifidase  treatment . The efficacy objective was reached,  and imlifidase  was 
considered safe and well tolerated.

 16 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  Study 13 -HMedIdeS -03 was a Swedish two-centre , single arm, Phase II study to assess safety 
and efficacy of imlifidase  given immediately prior to kidney transplantation to reduce DSAs in 
sensitized CKD patients awaiting deceased donor (DD) or living donor (LD) transplantation. 
The primary endpoint  was safety. Ten patients ( 8 DD, 2 LD ) were  treated with single doses of 
0.25 or 0.5  mg/kg imlifidase  along with standard immunosuppressive treatment, but no 
additional desensitizing agents. Imlifidase  was well tolerated at both doses, efficiently reduced  
anti-HLA antibod y levels , including DSA , and all [ADDRESS_359625] two patients , presumably related to the underlying disease . The patients were do sed 
with 0.25 mg/kg imlifidase . 
Study 14 -HMedIdeS -04 was an investigator -initiated phase I/II, single arm, exploratory study  
in the US .  Patients receive d a single dose of 0.24 mg/kg imlifidase  in addition to pre -treatment 
with rituximab and IVIg. Patients  were  eligible for inclusion if they had a panel reactive 
antibodies ( PRA )> 50% and a positive crossmatch test against  their available DD or had DSA (s) 
before imlifidase  treatment. The study enrolled [ADDRESS_359626] to their available LD or DD. A total of 18 patients 
were  enrolled and transplanted with a kidney from a DD (13) or LD (5). Enrolled patients were  
treated with imlifidase  on day 0.  In addition to imlifidase , patients were  given high dose IVIg 
(2 g/kg, maximum of 140 g) on day 7  and rituximab on day 9. DSA levels  were  monitored pre- 
and at several  time points after imlifidase  dosing. Safety, including kidney function , was 
monitored at multiple time points up to 180 days after treatment. Pharma cokinetics  (PK), 
Pharmacodynamics  (PD) and Anti-Drug Antibody ( ADA ) were  measured.  
Two studies with imlifidase are ongoing:  
1. A phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of imlifidase  in anti -GBM disease 
(Glomerular Basement Membrane/ Goodpasture’s disease) with adverse renal prognosis  
(15-HMedIdeS -10, EudraCT no. 2016 -004082 -39) 
2. A prospective, observational long -term follow up study of patients treated with 
imlifidase prior to kidney transplantation (17 -HMedIdeS -14, FDA IND 128074)  
Study 15 -HMedIdeS -10 is an ongoing  investigator initiated multi -centre , open -label Phase II 
study  conducted in EU . The study will enroll 15 patients . Imlifidase  0.25 mg/kg is given IV 
over [ADDRESS_359627] care 
consisting of pulse  methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone /prednisone  and intravenous 
cyclophosphamide combined with PE.

 17 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  1.2. Study Design and Dose Rationale   
Antibod ies to HLA antigens have  a strong correlation with  allograft injury and loss.  More than 
[ADDRESS_359629] each year in the U.S., approximately 75 -80% due to antibody 
mediated injury  (Loupy et al. 2012 ). Clearly, the most important way to approach antibody 
mediated allograft injury is through the development of antibody -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This would 
address all pathogenic mechansism s associated with alloantibod ies and allow grafts to continue 
functioning for much longer periods of time. Successful treatment would improve the length 
and quality of life of allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_295089].  
This is a randomized, open -label, multi -centr e study , designed to investigate  the safety and 
efficacy of imlifidase compared with PE , in removi ng anti -HLA antibodies to treat active or 
chronic active AMR post -transplant. Imlifidase at 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg have been demonstrated 
to be safe and effective in removing IgG antibodies including DSAs in patients awaiting kidney 
transplantation . 
20 subjec ts will be randomized to receive  a single dose of 0.25  mg/kg imlifidase . High dose 
IVIg will be given on day 4 (this may be given  over 2 days)  and then a single dose of rituximab 
5 days after complet ion of the  IVIg infusion .  
10 subjects will be  randomized to be  treated with PEs. 5-10 sessions of PE will be performed 
at the discretion of  the investigator . Immunoadsorption (IA) may replace  PE, at the 
investigator’s discretion. Subjects in the PE  arm will be treated with high dose IVIg on the last 
day of PE (may be given over 2 days as judged by [CONTACT_093] ) followed by a single dose 
of rituximab given 5 days after complet ion of the IVIg infusion . 
1.3. Benefit /Risk Aspects  
Subjects  in this study may benefit from being treated with imlifidase  to resolve  early graft 
rejection . The potential benefit of imlifidase compared to currently used methods, e.g . PE, is 
the efficacious and immediate removal of DSAs. It is anticipated that a fast er DSA removal 
will result in less damage to the allograft and thus a better outcome for the patient.  If imlifidase 
fails to remove DSAs to satisfactory levels or if the DSAs rebound, the patient will be treated 
with PE and/or other standard of care (SOC) treatments , as judged by [CONTACT_093] . SOC 
treatment can be initiated at any point for patients in the treatment arm if  needed . The decision 
to initiate other SOC treatments  will normally be based on DSA rebound. Since DSA is 
monitored frequently , sign s of antibody rebound will be detected early and appropriate 
treatment initiated immediately. Thus, it is anticipated that there will be no risk that the patient 
does not receive the best available treatment.  
Since imlifidase  effectively removes the IgG pool, there may be an increased risk of infection. 
To minimize the risk for bacterial infections all subjects included in the study  will receive 
prophylactic antibiotics. Subjects will be closely monitored for infections  and in structed to 
contact [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_295090]. There will be 
a physician specialized in infectious diseases available for medical advice in case of a patient 
showing signs of infection. In case of infection i n a patient with low IgG plasma levels, 
intravenous immunoglobulin may be indicated.  Subjects  will be screened for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_359630]  will not be included in the study.  As SARS -CoV -2-naïve subjects

Clinical Study Protocol No.: 16 -HMedIdeS -12 Hansa Biopharma Doc No.: 2017 -182 
 18 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  do not have any IgG antibodies t owards the virus, and since imlifidase does not prevent IgG 
synthesis, administration of imlifidase is not considered to have any  impact on patient safety 
should the subject subsequently become infected with SARS -CoV -2. 
Although s amples for analysis of ADA will be taken at screening , it is not possible to wait for 
the sample to be analyzed before inclusion in the study as this would delay the treatment and 
thus have a serious impact on patient outcome.   
As for all biologics, there is a risk of infusion rea ctions associated with imlifidase treatment. 
Three  non-serious  and one serious infusion related reaction s regarded as related to treatment 
have occurred in [ADDRESS_359631] revealed that imlifidase cleaves biologics originatin g from  rabbit and 
human IgG including;  thymoglobulin,  IVIg, basiliximab, alemtuzumab, rituximab, 
adalimumab, denosumab, belatacept and etanercept. The optimal interval between imlifidase 
administration and these biologics has not been tested (2018 -003R ).  
The rationale for the 3 -day window between imlifidase and IVIg dosing is aimed to prevent 
cleavage of the I VIg based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of 
imlifidase. In one of the clinical stud ies (14-HMedIdeS -04), alemtuzumab was given f our days 
post dosing of imlifidase and in one clinical study (15 -HMedIdeS -06), IVIg was given seven 
days post dosing of imlifidase.  
Adverse events after administration of IVIg do occur but are seldom serious. There is a very 
small risk of anaphylaxis, oft en in subjects with severe IgA deficiency. Other reported side 
effects include headache, myalgia, transient hypotension and flushing (all of which can be 
corrected by [CONTACT_1743]), meningism, aseptic meningitis, skin reactions 
(especially ecz ema), neutropenia, worsening of renal failure, and thromboembolic events 
(DVT, MI and stroke) attributable to hyperviscosity  (Hughes et al. 2014 ).  
As an extra safety measure for women of child bearing potential, the requirement for highly 
effective contraception is part of the inclusion criteria for this study. Additionally, a pregnancy 
test will be performed at the screening visit to ensure the patient is not pregnant.  
The pr incipal investigator s will make sure that sufficient facilities and procedures are available 
to handle emergency situations during the study. Study site s have  extended experience in phase 
I/II studies within transplantation and graft rejection treatment as well as handling bio logical 
drugs. The site s have adequate procedures in place to handle unexpected adverse reactions.  
A guidance for the investigator and Reference Safety Information regarding imlifidase can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a  randomized,  open label, multi -centre , study  with an active control . The study will 
primarily examine the reduction in mean levels of DSA after treatment with imlifidase 
compared to PE  in patients  diagnos ed with active  or chronic active  AMR  according to Banff 
2017 criteria  (Haas et al. 2018 ), including presence of DSA(s). A total of 30  male and/or female 
patients will be included in the study .   
The randomization will be 2 :1. 20 subjects will receive a single dose of 0.25  mg/kg imlifidase 
and 10 subjects will be treated with 5 -10 sessions of PEs. High dose IVIg followed by a single 
dose of rituximab will be given after treatments with imlifidase and PE . For doses, see 
Section  5. Other treatments and/or procedures for AMR  can be used as required at the 
investigator ’s discretion . SOC treatment can be initiated at any point for patients in the 
treatment arm if needed a s judged by [CONTACT_093]. The decision to initiate other SOC 
treatments  will normally be based on DSA rebound. Since DSA is monitored frequently , signs 
of antibody rebound will be detected early and appropriate treatment initiated immediately . 
The dura tion of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295092]  [ADDRESS_359633] to be repeated at screening visit  and mRNA 
levels will be measured on day 29 and day 180.  In addition, kidney function will be followed 
by [CONTACT_295113] , eGFR calculations and albumin/creatinine ratio 
in urine during the full study period.

 45 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  9. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Definitions  
9.1.1.  Adverse event  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre -
existing medical condi tion following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether 
or not considered causally related to the product. Relationship  to the study drug will be deemed 
as not related, unlikely, possible or probable.  An undesirable medical condition can be 
symptoms (e.g., nausea and chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia and enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings and ECGs ).  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition /illness leading to such a procedure 
is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the death is considered as 
its outcome.  
9.1.2.  Serious adverse event  
An SAE is an AE or suspecte d adverse reaction (SAR) that is considered "serious" if, in the 
view of either the investigator or Hansa Biopharma , it results  in any of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295101]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above . Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dep endency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening event:  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" 
if, in the view of either the investigator or Hansa Biopharma , its occurrence places the subject  
or subject  at immediate risk of death. It does not include  an AE or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.

Clinical Study Protocol No.: 16 -HMedIdeS -12 Hansa Biopharma Doc No.: 2017 -182 
 46 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15537] : Admittance to an emergency room for observation without being  admitted to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295102] t is not considered  as an SAE. However, 
complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], and if a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered serious.  
9.2. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
In clinical studies, an AE/SAE can occur at any time after signing of the informed consent until 
the end of the study, including run -in or washout periods, even  if no study treatment has been 
administered, e.g., a n AE can be related to a procedure in the protocol.  
AEs will therefore be collected on the AE CRF from the time of signing  of the informed consent 
and thro ughout the study  including the follow -up period .  
AEs can be collected by:  
• The subject ’s response to  questions about his/her health (a standard non -leading 
question such as “Have you had any health problems since you were last 
asked/your la st visit?”)  
• Symptoms sponta neously reported by [CONTACT_423]  
• Investigations and examinations where the findings are as sessed by [CONTACT_295125]  
• Other information relating to the subject ’s health becoming known to the 
investigator (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956])  
9.2.1.  Variables  
The following variables will be recorded in the CRF  for each AE; description of the AE, the 
date and time (if applicable) when the AE started and stopped, severity based on Common 
Terminol ogy Criteria  for AEs grading (CTCAE v.4. 03) whether the AE is serious or not, 
causality assessment , action taken and outcome.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Assessment  
For each reported AE, the investigator will make an assessment of the relationship of the event 
to study procedures and/or IMP using the following c riteria.  
• Unrelated:   applicable to an AE that occurs when the subject  was not exposed to 
study treatment or another cause is obvious.  
• Unlikely to be related:   applicable to an AE that meets the following criteria  
• Does not follow a reasonable temporal seque nce from study drug dosing  
• May readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental, 
or toxic factors, or other therapy administered to the subject  
• Possibly related:  applicable to AEs where connection with dosing of study drug 
appears  unlikely but cannot be ruled out.  Applicable to AEs where:

 47 (64) CONFIDENTIAL  • It follows a reasonable temporal sequence dosing with study drug  
• It follows a known pattern of response to study drug dosing (based on animal 
studies)  
• Probably related :  applicable to AEs that ar e considered, with a high degree of 
certainty, to be related to the study drug.  Applicable to AEs where  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence study drug dosing  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s 
clinical st ate, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy  
• It follows a known pattern of response to study drug dosing (based on animal 
studies ). 
• For SAEs,  causal relationship will also be assessed for any study procedure.  
9.2.2.  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) rather than 
recording a list of signs and symptoms, for example: co ngestive heart failure ra ther than low 
ejection fraction.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that 
are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom not part of the 
diagnosis will be recorded  separately, for example: congestive heart failure and conjunctivitis.  
9.2.3.  Adverse Events Based o n Examinations and Tests  
If lab values are judged as clinically significant and/or a treatment has been given,  they will be 
captured as AEs and if SAE criteria are fulfilled they will also be SAEs . 
If vital signs are judged as clinically significant and/or require a treatment,  then they will be 
captured as AEs and if SAE criteria are fulfilled they will also be SAEs . 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnorma l medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE and if SAE criteria are 
fulfilled they will also be SAEs.  
Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laborat ory term 
(e.g., anaemia versus  low haemoglobin value).  
9.2.4.  Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject ’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_129159], for as long as medically indicated or the overall clinical 
outcome of the subject  is known, unless the subject  is documented as “lost to follow -up”. All 
SAEs and AE s leading to discontinuation should be followed until the event resolves  or 
stabilizes.

Biopharma  retains the right to request additional information for any subject  with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
9.2.5.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered related to the investig ational product, 
or to the study procedure(s) , on a separate SAE  form . In the AE form,  it will be added that the 
AE is considered serious . SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent.  
An assigned contract research organisation ( Primevigilance ) will be responsible for reporting 
all SAEs to RAs in accordance with ICH GCP  and loc al regulations.  Hansa Biopharma  or the 
study monitor will be responsible for reporting to IEC s/IRBs .  
As soon as the i nvestigator is aware of a potential SAE he/she should contact [CONTACT_295126] e-mail and no later than [ADDRESS_359647] Information  to Primevigilance : 
   
For fatal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow -up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform Hansa 
Biopharma , the monitor , and Primevigilance  of any follow -up information on a previously 
reported SAE immediately but no later than within 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware 
of it. The monitor or Hansa Biopharma  will advise the investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed.  
The SAE reporting procedures are detailed in the  study specific Safety Management Plan. This 
plan is an agreement between Hansa Biopharma  and Primevigilance . 
9.2.6.  Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to RAs . A suspected serious adverse reaction is any SAE  for w hich 
there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the AE. A serious 
adverse reaction is considered "unexpect ed" if it is not listed in the reference s afety information 
section of the investigator brochure or is not listed at th e specificity or severity that has been 
observed.  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs with an outcome of death or which are life threatening mu st be reported to the relevant 
RAs within [ADDRESS_359648] be submitted within 15 calendar days. The 
S[LOCATION_003]R reporting pro cedures are detailed in the study Safety Management Plan. This plan is 
an agreement between Hansa Biopharma  and Primevigilance . Hansa Biopharma  will notify the 
appropriate RA(s)  and all participating study  investigators of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs on an expedited 
basis and in accordance with applicab le regulations. In addition, Hansa Biopharma  is

appropriate institutional regulatory bodies of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs received involving risk to human 
subject s as per their applicable requirements . 
9.3. Pregnancy and Pregnancy  Outcome  
Pregnancy is an exclusion criteri on and a p regnancy test is performed  at the screening visit and 
at the last study visit.  
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the follow up phase of the study, the subject  will continue 
in the study according to study protocol, if possible. A Pregnancy Report Form mu st be sent by 
[CONTACT_295127]. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscar riage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) will be followed up on the Pregnancy Report Form even after the 
subject  has completed or discontinued the study.  Primevigilance  will follow up on pregnancy 
outcome [ADDRESS_359649] be reported to Hansa Biopharma  and will be handled as a SAE. 
Spontaneous abortions, congenital abnormalities/birth de fects are always considered to be 
SAEs and will be reported and followed up in accordance with other SAEs. Any SAE occurring

The primary endpoint is the maximum reduction in DSA (MFI sum for relevant DSAs) at any 
time point during the [ADDRESS_359650] 1000 MFI pre -dose. The reduction is 
derived as follows:  
1) Calculate the reduction (%) in sum of DSA s as 100*(DSA 0 – DSA t)/DSA [ADDRESS_359651] and time point . Only DSAs with a pre -dose MFI of 1000 or more will be  
included in the calculations   
2) Find the time  point with maximum reduction within [ADDRESS_359652]  
3) The maximum reduction per subject will give a single value as the primary endpoint 
for the subject  
Where DSA t is the analysis result in total MFI for relevant DSA s at time t.  
Due to the exploratory nature of this study,  no formal  hypothesis will be tested. The difference 
in reduction between the two treatments will be presented with 95% CI. Each subject will be 
given equal weight in the ca lculation of the treatment difference irrespective of number of DSAs 
for the subjects.

A treatment emergent adverse event is any adverse event occurring after the administration of 
the IMP and with in the time of residual drug effect, or a pre -treatment adverse event or 
pre-existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after administration of the IMP and 
within the time of residual drug effect.  
The time of residual drug effect is the estimated  period after the administration of the IMP, 
where the effect of the product is still considered to be present based on pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic or other substance characteristics. The residual drug effect is generally 
accepted to be [ADDRESS_359654] is likely to 
be well within the 29 Day assessments. All AEs occurring up to Day 29 are regarded as 
treatment emergent.

A post -treatment emergent adverse event is any adverse event occurring after the time of 
residual drug effect of the IMP, i.e. between the end of the treatment period , visit 8, and the 
follow -up visit 11.  
12.3.14.  Analysis of Other Safety Variables  
The clinical safety laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG parameters will be summarised  for 
both absolute values and changes from baseline. Values outside the reference ranges will be 
flagged in listi ngs. 
12.3.15.  Immunogenicity  
Anti-imlifidase  antibody data will be summarized by [CONTACT_295149].  
12.4. Determination of Sample Size  
Due to the exploratory nature of the study,  there is no formal statistical hypothesis. The 
difference between trea tments for the reduction of DSA will however be presented with 95% 
confidence interval. A sample size of 20 imlifidase and 10 PE subjects is proposed.  
In two previous imlifidase studies , 14-HMedIdeS -04 and 15 -HMedIdeS -06, the IgG reduction 
for 5 days was 90% and 93% respectively. The corresponding standard deviations are 6% and 
4% respectively. Assuming a similar variability in the PE treatment arm, the expected width of 
the 95% CI for the difference in DSA reduction will be around 8% point. This supports that 
20+10 patients are appropriate.  Also, the sample size is in line with experience from previous 
similar Phase II studies with other compounds to obtain adequate safety, tolerability and PK 
data to achieve the objectives of the study.

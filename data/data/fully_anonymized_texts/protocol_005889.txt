6 Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral VT -1161 in the treatment of RVVC  through Week  48. 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability  of oral VT -1161 in the treatment of RVVC through 
Week 48 . 
• To evaluate the impact of oral VT -1161 treatment on patient  reported outcome s through 
Week 48 . 
Methodology:  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, multi center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study.   
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral VT -[ADDRESS_1152634] 12 months , 
as described below:  
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251107] , with a documented positive 
potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) or Gram stain performed at the investigative site 
• Subjects must also have had [ADDRESS_1152635] (i.e., culture, 
PCR, Affirm test, KOH test,  Gram stain,  a documented Papanicolaou (Pap) test, or other 
approve d diagnostic test s) 
The study consists of two Phases: 1) an open -label Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute VVC 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_830472] 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of fluconazole, and 2) a Maintenance Phase 
in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive VT-[ADDRESS_1152636] provided informed consent or assent (for those ages 12 to 17), the investigational site 
will evaluate  all subjects by [CONTACT_12550] a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital signs , 
weight and height , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and laboratory tests , reviewing clinical signs and symptoms 
of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of the 
vagina, perform ing a KOH  wet mount test  or Gram stain  from a vaginal smear  to confirm the presence 
of yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline  culture  for identification of fungal species .  
Patient reported outcome survey s (SF-36, EQ-5D-3L or EQ -5D-Y (for ages 12 to 17) , WPAI :SHP , 
PHQ -9) for all regions and questions regarding their RVVC history (US only) will also be administered.  
Eligible subjects must have an acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251108], defined as a total signs and symptoms 
score of ≥3 and a positive local KOH wet mount preparation  or Gram stain  from a vaginal smear 
revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast cells , and must meet other initial entry 
criteria .  Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will enter the Induction P hase.  During the Induction 
Phase, t he presenting  acute VVC infection  will be treated with 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 
72 hours) of fluconazole.  Subjects will return approx imately  [ADDRESS_1152637]: VT -[ADDRESS_1152638] resolved (defined by 
a signs and symptoms score of <3), they will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive  either  VT-1161 or 
a matching placebo  regimen .  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_251192].  If the acute VVC has not resolved (defined by a signs and symptoms score of ≥3), the subject 
will be considered a screen failure and encouraged to see their physician for follow -up care.  
Study Duration:  
The planned study duration is expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_1152639] Participation:  
The duration of individual subject partic ipation will be approximately 50 weeks , including the 2-week  
Induction  Phase .  See Table 1 for the Schedule of Assessments and P rocedures  which will be performed . 
After Screening , subjects wil l return to the clinic on Day  1 (Baseline ), the start of the Maintenance Phase. 
Subjects  will then have visi ts on Day  14 (±2 days), Weeks 6  (±7 days), 12 (±14 days), 18  (±14 days), 
24 (±14 days), 30 (±14  days), 36 (±14 days) , 42 (±14 days) and 48  (±14  days) (end of study [EOS]). 
Subjects who return to the clinic with a recurrent acute VVC  epi[INVESTIGATOR_830473].  
Scoring of Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms:  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptom s will be evaluat ed at  Screening  and at each subsequent study visit.  
Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored  and the individual scores 
combined , for a maximum score of 18 using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any sign or symptom)  
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( present ) 
3 = severe (marked, intense)  
Mycology Assessment:  
A local mycological assessment using KOH wet mount followed by [CONTACT_830520] a recurrent  acute  VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_41102].  The 
investigative site is to use the same local mycology test (KOH or Gram stain) consistently for al l subjects 
throughout the study.  In  addition, a vaginal swab for culture testing will be obtained and sent to the 
central mycology laboratory  at the Screening and each subsequent study visit.

e. Change  from Screening  through We ek 48  in the SF -36 patient  reported outcome survey total score . 
 
Safety:  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population.  AEs will be collected throughout the 
study.   Physical and vaginal examination findings and vital  signs will be recorded at Screening  and 
throughout the study per Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
ECGs  and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained throughout 
the study. All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to Screening  through 
the Week 48  (EOS) visit will be recorded in the case repo rt form (CRF).  Pertinent and all major m edical 
conditions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.  
Subject  who want to  discontinue from the study  should be encouraged to remain in the study for all 
remaining visits  through Week [ADDRESS_1152654] all EOS procedures performed  on the day of discontinuation .  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
A statistical analysis plan will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled . 
Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary statistical objective of this study is to determine if there are differences in the proportions 
of subjects with one  or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_251165] -verified acute VVC in those receiving VT -[ADDRESS_1152655] 95% power to detect a 
treatment difference of 35% between the VT -[ADDRESS_1152656] one or more culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_830481] ( post randomization through Week 48 ).   (PASS 2008: Fisher ’s exact test, two -sided 
alpha=0.05, and assuming 50% of placebo subjects have recurrence).  Based on an estimated 20 % 
discontinuation rate, approximately 128 total subjects (85 active, 43 placebo) will be necessary for 
randomization to arrive at approximately 102 evaluable subjects.     
Safety Analysis:  
AEs will be code d using  the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s® dictionary.  The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting  treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] , 
preferred term , and greatest severity  with a breakdown by [CONTACT_1570].   Mean changes from pre -
treatment in vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].

25 1 INTRODUCTION  
Lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme essential for fungal growth, catalyzes an early step 
in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation 
and integrity ( Yoshida, 1988 ).  Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of 14 -methylated 
sterols, some of which are toxic to the fungus.  CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs 
referred to as ‘azole antifungals’.  All currently approved azole drugs contain either an imidazole 
or triazole ring system that binds tightly to the catalytic heme -iron of fungal CYP51 as well as to 
the heme -iron of many off -target mammalian cytochrome P450  enzymes.  This inherent lack of 
selectivity is responsible for many of the side effects associated with the azole antifungals.  
For example, the potent inhibition of one or more human cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes 
found in the liver (e.g. CYP3A4, C YP2C9, CYP2C19) or in the adrenal and sex organs 
(e.g. CYP19, CYP17, CYP21), is the basis for azole drug -drug interactions ( Bates and Yu, 2003 ) 
and reproductive warnings ( Zarn et al., 2003 ), respectively.  Additional azole class toxicities that 
are less well understood but may be related to off -target protein interactions include hepatic 
toxicities, skin photosensitivity, and vision impairment.  In the acute care setting, these dose -
limiting si de effects prevent attainment of plasma drug levels that might reduce the longstanding 
40% mortality rate attributed to invasive fungal infections.  The safety profile of the class similarly 
limits its use for chronic treatment of non -life-threatening fung al infections, such as 
onychomycosis (OM) and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).  A safer antifungal drug 
would also improve treatment options for infections seen in otherwise healthy individuals, such as 
OM and recurrent VVC, which require protract ed treatment in a patient population where 
significant side -effect risks are unacceptable.

26 1.1.1 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_830482] (inflammation of the vagina and vulva) a re common and are among  
of the most frequent reasons for women’s visits to physicians.  Vulvovaginitis is associated with 
considerable morbidity including genital discomfort, decrease in sexual pleasure, loss of 
productivity, and psychological distress ( Eschenbach, 2004 ).  There are several  etiologies for 
vulvovaginitis; candidiasis being the second most common after bacterial vaginitis.  Vulvovaginal 
candidiasis is a common disorder, with nearly 75% of all adult women hav ing had at least one 
“yeast infection” in their lifetime.  Approximately half of these women experience a recurrence, 
with 5 to 8 % developi[INVESTIGATOR_251129], defined as 3 or more e pi[INVESTIGATOR_251130] ( Sobel, 2016 ).  
Estrogen in creases the glycogen concentration of the vaginal lining; glycogen is a substrate on 
which C. albicans  thrives.  As estrogen levels are significantly lower in both pre -menarcheal and 
post-menopausal females, the incidence of VVC is lower in these populatio ns.  Vulvovaginal 
candidiasis is most common in women aged 25  to 34 years  (Foxman et al., 2013 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pathophysiology  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs when there is an overgrowth of the normal yeast in the vagina.   
Most cases (85%  - 95%) are caused by C. albicans , followed by  C. glabrata , and infrequently by 
C. parapsilosis , C. tropi[INVESTIGATOR_251131] , and C. krusei .  Vulvovaginitis caused by [CONTACT_105] -albicans Candida 
species, in particular C. glabrata , is clinically indistinguishable from C. albica ns VVC but is more 
resistant to current treatments.  
Candida organisms gain access to the lumen and secretions of the vagina primarily from the 
adjacent perianal region.  Normal anti -candida defense mechanisms allow for long -term 
persistence of Candida as c ommensal organisms in the vagina without signs or symptoms of 
vaginitis.  Factors predisposing to VVC versus asymptomatic colonization include those attributed 
to the health (immunosuppression, use of anti bacterial agents, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes 
mellitus) and behavior (frequent intercourse, orogenital sexual activity, use of oral contraceptives 
or estrogen -based hormonal replacement therapy) of the host.  Other dermatologic conditions such 
as psor iasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosus also predispose women to VVC  (Goncalves et al., 
2016 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Presentation and Diagnosis  
The clinical array of signs and symptoms of VVC include genital pruritus associated with edema, 
an erythematous rash and excoriation of the vulva and surrounding skin, a burning sensation in the 
vagina and vu lva, and a vaginal discharge.  These symptoms may persist for days to weeks, and 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 Product:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152676] commonly present 
with acute pruritus and a vaginal discharge, though neither is specific for candidiasis.  
The discharge may range from being watery to quite thick and “cottage -cheese -like”.  
Common  symptoms include vaginal soreness, irritation, v ulvar burning, dyspareunia, and external 
dysuria.  Physical examination typi[INVESTIGATOR_251132] a pustulopapular rash, vaginal erythema, and a normal cervix.  Symptoms often w orsen the 
week prior to menses.  
The diagnosis of VVC requires more than a history and physical examination as symptoms and 
signs, in particular pruritus, are often non-specific.  Diagnosis is made by [CONTACT_251184] a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount showing the presenc e of yeast cells and mycelia 
and the absence of both clue cells (pathognomonic of bacterial infection) and trichomonads.  
The vaginal pH is normal, approximately 4.0.  A vaginal culture should also be performed, 
particularly for women with negative microsc opy, as up to 50% of patients with culture -positive 
VVC will have no findings on microscopy ( Sobel, 2007 ); additionally, a culture will p recisely 
identify the organism . Papanicolaou  (Pap)  smears are also not reliable, typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y positive in only a 
quarter of patients with VVC.  
As up to 15% of asymptomatic women are colonized with Candida species and are thus culture 
positive, the final diagnosis of VVC requires a comprehensive assessment of clinical findings, 
microscopic examina tion, and vaginal culture.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment and Outcome  
In general, women who are asymptomatic carriers of Candida do not require treatment.  
Acute  VVC in symptomatic women requires individualized treatment, the selected agent and 
duration of therapy being based on whether the VVC is categorized as either:  
• Uncomplicated, defined as having all of the following characteristics: (mild or moderate in 
symptom severity, sporadic in frequency, C. albicans as the infecting organism, in non -
pregnant women with normal immun e function), or  
• Complicated, defined as having any one or more of the following characteristics: severe in 
symptom severity, recurrent, a non -C. albicans  organism as the infecting agent, abnormal 
immune function, or pregnant ( Eschenbach, 2004 ). 
Women with uncomplicated VVC can be treated with single -dose or short -course treatments, while 
those with complicated VVC require longer -term therapy, at least [ADDRESS_1152677]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 IND 111675  
       Ver. 6 U.S. Only, 01 October 2019  
 
28 maintenance therapy  up to 6 months  (Sobel et al., 2004 ).  Pregnant women, who are at higher risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_251134], can only be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_251135].  T opi[INVESTIGATOR_251136], 
especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore,  most patients prefer the oral regimens.  
However, the systemically administered azoles listed in Table [ADDRESS_1152678] ug-drug-interactions (DDIs) and have poor activity against C. glabrata  and 
fluconazole resistant C . albicans .

Abbreviations: mg  = milligrams; d  = day; q.d.  = once daily ; Rx = prescription . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recurrent, Resistant and Non -Albicans VVC  
Up to 20% of women will develop recurrent, resistant, or complicated VVC.  In a study that 
compared a 6 -month maintenance weekly fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with 
recurrent VVC, the time to recurrence increased from 4.0 to 10.2 months, and the cure rate at 
12 months doubled versus placebo from 22% to 43% (Sobel et al., 2004 ).  However, fewer than 
half of patients remained disease -free after discontinuation of fluconazole which highli ghts the 
unmet medical need for these patients.  
The prevalence of infection with non -albicans species, in particular C. glabrata , is increasing, 
especially in patients who are immunosuppressed and/or are diabetics; C. glabrata  is poorly 
sensitive to curren t azole antifungal agents.  
1.2 VT-1161  
VT-1161 is a novel oral antifungal agent with a lower affinity for heme -iron and a greater affinity 
for the fungal lanosterol 14 α -demethylase (CYP51)  than the currently available azole drugs.  
As a result, VT -[ADDRESS_1152679]:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152680].

In the Phase 2b RVVC study (VMT -VT-1161 -CL-006), 413 clinical isolates were collected from 
subjects at screening visits until the end of the study.   The minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole for the isolates collected were; <0.0005  – >0.5 µg/ml 
and <0.06 -32 µg/ml, respectively.  The MIC 50 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 
0.004  µg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC 90 values for VT-1161 and fluconazole 
were 0.06 µg/ml and 4 µg/ml, respectively.  These data further demonstrated that VT -[ADDRESS_1152683] the Candida strains obtained from  clinical strains .  For all tested 
isolates, the VT -1161 demonstrated MIC 50 and MIC 90 that were 5 dilutions lower than those 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_251186].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Activity in Animal Models of VVC  
VT-1161 was evaluated as an oral treatment of vaginal candidiasis ( C. albicans ) in a murine model 
(Garvey et a l., 2012 ).  Three days after infection, VT -1161 was dosed orally once daily at 4, 10, 
or 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days.  Fungal burden measured in vaginal lavage fluid was highly 
significantly suppressed (p <0.0002) compared to vehicle -treated controls at all doses and when 
measured [ADDRESS_1152684] dose 
of VT -1161 indicated that levels as low as 1 µg/mL resulted in this high degree of efficacy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
VT-1161 formulated as a suspension  in carboxymethylcellulose was well absorbed and exhibited 
approximately dose linear pharmacokinetics (PK) and a long plasma half -life in both rats and dogs.  
There was no evidence of an effect of gender on the PK of VT -1161 in either rats or dogs.  
VT-1161 accumulated during repeat -dosing in rats and dogs as expected based on the long 
half-life.  VT -1161 was widely distributed into tissues and was mostly excreted in bile and feces 
in the rat.  In vitro plasma protein binding of VT -1161 is high with approxi mately 99.5% binding 
to rat, dog and human plasma and slightly lower binding in mice (97.6%).  The absolute oral

finding.  The NOAEL for liver findings was 1.5 mg/kg, based on adverse findings at the high dose 
of 5 mg/kg/day including a minimal increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and an inc rease in frequency of minimal focal necrosis and 
single cell necrosis.   Findings of liver hypertrophy, sub -capsular necrosis and multinucleated 
hepatocytes were considered rat -specific and associated with metabolic adaptation.   Focal necrosis 
may be an exa ggerated response to hepatocellular hypertrophy which is known to cause 
sub-capsular and single cell necrosis.   The findings were reversible and similar to  the findings 
observed in a prior 28 -day study in the rat, providing support that the increased treatment duration 
in the 6-month  rat study did not result in new findings of clinical concern.  At the 1.5  mg/kg dose 
at steady state on Day 182, maximum plasm a concentration ( Cmax) was 4,055  ng/mL and area 
under the curve ( AUC 0-24) was 81,900 ng·h/mL.  The NOAEL for the 9 -month dog study was 
determined to be the high dose of 17 mg/kg/day (Day 273 C max was 74,700  ng/mL and AUC 0-24 
was 1,675,000 ng·h/mL), as no a dverse findings were identified.  The NOAEL in the previous 
28-day dog study was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decreased body weight and mild effects on 
lymphoid organs including increased 31icromol  body macrophages in the mandibular and 
mesenteric lymph nodes and  in the Peyer’s patches at 30 mg/kg and higher.  These findings were 
largely reversed during the recovery period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Genotoxicity  
VT-1161 was found to be negative for genotoxicity in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay, 
the chromosome aberration assay i n human peripheral lymphocytes and the in vivo  bone marrow 
micronucleus assay in rats.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reproductive Toxicology  
VT-1161 at doses resulting in maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decrease in body weights) did 
not cause alterations in uterine and ovarian pa rameters in embryofetal development studies in rats

skelet al malformations and variations were observed at any of the dose levels evaluated.  
There  were no effects on male or female fertility at clinically relevant doses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Pharmacology  
The effects of VT -1161 on the neurological and pulmonary systems were ev aluated in 
Sprague -Dawley rats.  The data demonstrated that there were no VT ‑1161 -related effects in either 
the neuropharmacological or pulmonary studies in rats given an oral dose of up to 1 ,000 mg/kg 
VT-1161, the highest dose tested.  
Evaluation of cardi ovascular function in telemetered dogs revealed no treatment -related changes 
in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm or morphology, including the QT/QTc  (Fridericia 
correction)  interval, at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In Vitro Cytochrome P450 Interactions  
VT-1161 inhibited cytochrome P450 enzymes with the following potencies:  
CYP1A2  (half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC50] ≥10 µM), CYP2B6 (IC 50 = 4.0 µM), 
CYP2C8 (IC 50 = 1.4 µM), CYP2C9 (IC 50 ≥10 µM), CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 9.7 µM), 
CYP2D6  (IC 50 = 9.4 µM), and CYP3A4 (IC 50 = 9.6 µM [testosterone], IC 50 ≥10 µM [midazolam]).  
Based on the high plasma protein binding of VT -1161, no clinically significant drug -drug 
interactions are expected.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Effects of VT -1161 on Cardiac Repolarization  
An in vitro  human ether -à-go-go related gene study was conducted to assess the potential of 
VT-1161 to inhibit the repolarizing current of the cardiac action potentia l.  VT -1161 i nhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go related  gene potassium current by 94.7 ± 1.3% at 6 µM.  The  IC50 was 
calculated to be 1.9 µM (Hill coefficient = 2).  However, a cardiovascular safety study in dogs 
showed that VT -[ADDRESS_1152687] doses of up to 300  mg/kg, the highest dose tested, with exposures 
reaching 24,000 ± 6,881 ng/mL at [ADDRESS_1152688] -dose.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Single  Dose -Escalation  Study (Stu dy VMT -VT-1161 -CL-001) 
Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-001 was a single -center, Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled, dose -escalating study in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of single oral  doses of VT -1161.  Sixty -four subjects (43 males and 
21 females) between [ADDRESS_1152690] 7  cohorts, 
escalating singl e oral doses (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg) or matching placebo were 
administered in the fasted state.  An 8th cohort received a single [ADDRESS_1152691].  Subjects in Cohorts 1  to 6 were followed 
for 14 days for safety and PK assessments.  Visits on Days 28 and 42 were added for Cohorts 7 
and 8.  Dose escalation proceeded only after safety and PK of the previous dose was determined.   
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SA Es) reported.  There were no treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to discontinuation from the study.   
Overall, mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and electrocardiogram [ECG]s) were generally small and were considered not clinically 
significant.  None of the treatment -emergent physical examination abnormalities were of clinical 
significance.  The maximum tolerated dose for the study was the highest dose administered, 
320 mg, administered in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT ‑1161 in the fasted state, median time to reach maximum 
plasma concentration (T max) ranged from 4 to 10 hours.  Overall, C max increased slightly less than 
proportional to dose. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
infinity (AUC inf) values generally increased with increase in dose, ranging from an average of 
16,145 ng•hr/mL at 20 mg to 241,9 71 ng•hr/mL at [ADDRESS_1152692] high -fat meal resulted in higher 
plasma concentrations than those observed following 320 mg in the fasted state in a separate group  
of subjects.  Average fasting C max was 338 ng/mL and this increased to 988  ng/mL in the fed state.  
AUC inf also increased from 241,971 ng•hr/mL when subjects were fast ed to 953,119 ng•hr/mL 
with a high -fat meal.

34 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Multiple  Dose -Escalation  Study (Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-002) 
Study VMT -VT-[ADDRESS_1152693] TEAEs were mild in intensity and no severe TEAEs 
were reported.  
Mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, 
vital signs, and ECGs) were generally small and not considered clinically significant.  There w as 
no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -[ADDRESS_1152694] dose 
administered, 320 mg, administered once daily  for 7  days in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT -1161 in the fed state, median T max values ranged from 4 to 
6 hours after dosing.  The increase in mean C max was nearly proportional to dose over the 40 to 
320 mg dose range.  The concentrations were 3 to 4 -fold hi gher on Day 7 than they were on Day  1, 
indicating accumulation during the 7 -day dosing interval, with a mean C max of 3,300  ng/mL on 
Day 7 at 320 mg.  The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing 
interval (AUC τ) values on Day 7 also increased nearly proportionally to dose over the 40 to 320  mg 
dose range.  The mean half -life ranged from 1,905 to 3,046 hours.

Study VMT -VT-[ADDRESS_1152695] of single and multiple oral doses of VT ‑1161 when co -administered 
with single oral doses of midazolam (DDI cohort) and to evaluate the PK of a single oral dose of 
an alternate strength of VT -1161 alone (pharmacokinetic evaluation [PKE] cohort).  All dosing 
was conducted 30 minutes after the start of a high -fat, high -calorie meal.  A total of 36 subjects 
were enrolled in the study.   
In the DDI cohort, 28 subjects were enrolled in a fixed -sequence design to receive a 2 -mg oral 
dose of midazolam on Day 1, followed by 14 daily 600 mg oral doses of VT ‑1161 ([ADDRESS_1152696]:  VT-1161

35 tablets) on Day [ADDRESS_1152697] dose of study drug.  Twenty -four subjects in the DDI cohort completed the study and 4 subjects 
withdrew from the study prior to comple tion; 2 subjects voluntarily withdrew consent and 
2 subjects withdrew due to an AE (discussed in more detail below).   
There were no deaths reported in the study.  One SAE (acute psychosis) was reported in a subject 
in the DDI cohort on Day [ADDRESS_1152698] 
dose of VT -1161; the Investigator assessed causality as unrelated to study drug.  Otherwise, mean 
changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemis try, coagulation, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and ECGs) in both the DDI and PKE cohorts were generally small and not considered 
clinically significant and there was no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on 
physical examinations in either  cohort.  
In the DDI cohort, midazolam mean plasma C max increased 30% and AUC inf decreased 15% on 
Day 3 (after the first dose of VT ‑1161) relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  Midazolam mean 
plasma C max decreased 3% and AUC inf decreased 37% on Day 16 (after  14 daily doses of VT ‑1161) 
relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  
In the PKE cohort, 8 subjects were enrolled to receive a single 600 mg oral dose of VT -1161 (2 x 
300 mg tablets) on Day 1.  Subjects in the PKE cohort were followed for safety, tolerability a nd 
PK assessments through Day 2, 1 day after the dose of study drug.  All 8 subjects in the PKE 
cohort completed the study.  VT -1161 mean plasma C max and AUC 0-24 values after a single oral 
administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (2 x 300 mg) on Day 1 were 1,946 n g/mL and 
28,070  ng•hr/mL, respectively.  These values are similar to VT -1161 mean plasma C max and 
AUC 0-24 values after a single oral administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg) in the DDI 
cohort (1,994 ng/mL and 25,330 ng•hr/mL, respectively), indicating  the comparative 
bioavailability of the 2 strengths of tablets is similar.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Japanese  Bridging  Study  (Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-008) 
Study VMT -VT-[ADDRESS_1152699]:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152700] was withdrawn from the study for a n AE of  rash 
(subject request), which was categorized as an unlikely -related TEAE.  There was [ADDRESS_1152701].  
Of the 51 subjects enro lled in the study, 11 Japanese subjects from both dose groups and 
12 Western subjects from both dose groups were included in the full PK analysis population. 
Trough concentrations on Days 1 through 14 rose each day; thus, steady -state conditions had not 
been met by [CONTACT_2006] 14.  Larger differences between the 2 ethnic groups were seen in C max and 
AUC 0-72 following the 300  mg dose compared with the 600  mg dose. At the 300  mg dose, C max and 
AUC 0-72 were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects compared with W estern subjects. 
At the 600 -mg dose, C max and AUC 0-72 were approximately 10% higher in Japanese subjects 
compared with Western subjects. However, median T max was similar across doses at 4 hours for 
Japanese subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages an d 6 hours for Western subjects at both 
the 300  mg and 600 mg dosages. The terminal elimination phase was very flat and half-life 
exceeded 1800 hours. Total clearance following the 300 -mg dose was 1.642 L/hr for the Japanese 
subjects compared with 2.332 L/h r for the Western subjects.  Following the 600  mg dose, clearance 
was similar for the Japanese and Western subjects (2.000 and 2.086  L/hr, respectively).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 2 Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Dose Ranging  Study in Tinea Pedis  (Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-003) 
VMT -VT-1161 -CL-003 was a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 over -encapsulated tablets compared to placebo in the treatment 
of subjects with moderate to severe in terdigital tinea pedis.  A total of 50 subjects participated in 
the study across 4 dose groups: 1) VT -1161 200 mg once daily  for 4 days, followed by 50 mg once 
daily  for 10 days  (low dose) ; 2) VT -[ADDRESS_1152702]:  VT-1161

37 daily for 10 days  (mid -dose) ; 3) 600 mg twice daily  for 4 days, followed by 300 mg once daily  for 
10 days  (high dose ; or 4) placebo matching the VT -1161 treatment regimen.  VT-1161 plasma 
concentrations increased with dose and were as high as 6,230 n g/mL on  Day 14 in the 600  mg 
twice daily/[ADDRESS_1152703] of cure ( TOC ) 
visit (Day 42) of the [ADDRESS_1152704] AEs reported were mild to moderate in severity  and considered unrelated to 
study drug .  A single VT-1161 treatment related AE was reported (r ash) that was considered by 
[CONTACT_63033] “possibly related.”  The subject discontinued treatment after the first dose, 
and the rash completely resolved by [CONTACT_53016].  There were no clinically significant 
treatment -emergent changes in vita l signs, physical findings, ECGs, or laboratory parameters.  
One subject experienced a significant elevation of creatine kinase ( CK) along with a slight  increase  
in ALT and AST that was associated with a rigorous exercise program.  These changes were 
consi dered unrelated to treatment and all enzyme levels returned to normal at a subsequent follow -
up visit.   
At the Day 42 TOC visit, 42%, 42%, 50% and 0% of subjects receiving low dose, mid -dose or 
high dose VT -[ADDRESS_1152705] achieved  effective therapeutic cure 
(defined as having a total severity score of ≤2 with no individual severity score of >1, and  also, 
having negative mycology [culture and KOH]) in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Dose Ranging  Study in  Acute Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  (Study VMT -VT-1161 -
CL-004)  
VMT -VT-1161 -CL-004 was a randomized Phase 2a, double -blind, dose ranging study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 over -encapsulated tablets compared to fluconazole in the 
treatment of 55 subjects with moderate to severe acute VVC.  A total of 55 subjects with moderate -
to-severe acute VVC (severity score ≥[ADDRESS_1152706]) participated in the study 
across 4 dose groups: 1) VT  1161 300  mg once daily for 3 days, 2) 600  mg o nce daily  for 3 days, 
3) 600 mg twice daily  for 3  days, or 4) a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg followed by [CONTACT_251188].  Subjects were enrolled into the high -dose cohort following an interim analysis that 
included safety data generated through the TOC visit (Day 28) of the [ADDRESS_1152707]:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152708] TEAEs were reported in the low - and mid -dose co horts and only 1 TEAE 
(insomnia) was noted in the high -dose cohort.  One subject developed urticaria that was considered 
possibly related to study drug and which resolved with prednisone.  There were no clinically 
significant treatment -emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs or laboratory 
parameters.  
The efficacy of VT -1161 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe acute VVC was evaluated at the 
TOC visit in the ITT population (defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of 
study drug) and the per protocol ( PP) population (defined as subjects that were compliant with all 
key aspects of the protocol).  Subjects in the ITT population were rando mized into the 
VT-1161  300 mg once daily  for 3 days (n  = 14), VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 3  days (n  = 12), 
VT-1161 600 mg twice daily  for 3 days (n  = 14) or fluconazole (n =  15).  Effective clinical cure 
rate (defined as having a total severity score of 0 or 1 and a negative culture) were 29%, 83%, 86% 
and 73%, respectively.  Subjects in t he PP population achieved effective therapeutic cure at a rate 
of approximately 87%, 86%, 86% and 75%, respectively, in the low -dose, mid -dose, or high -dose 
VT-1161 or fluconazole groups at the Day 28 TOC visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Phase 2b Study in Subjects with Distal and L ateral Subungual Onychomycosis of

In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with distal 
and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the toenail w ere evaluated.  A total of 259 subje cts 
participated in the study in 5 treatment  groups  and were  administered either:

39 • Matching placebo  
Subjects in all cohorts were followed for 60 weeks.  Consenting subjects were enrolled into an 
extension study to assess the long -term safety and PK of VT -1161 through Week 96.   
The incidence of  adverse events  (AEs) was balanced across the VT -1161 treatme nt arms and 
placebo.    A total of 148 subjects (57%) had at least 1 TEAE, and the frequency was within the 
range of 49% to 67% for all treatment groups.  The majority  of TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_830524].  Most TEAEs were transient and 
occurred during the first 12  weeks of treatment for all treatment groups, including placebo.   
Nineteen subjects reported related TEAEs through Week 60.  Sixteen subjects were on VT -1161 
and three subjects were on pla cebo.  The only related TEAE reported by [CONTACT_726] 2 subjects was 
nausea.  Eleven subjects reported a total of 16 SAEs, which were considered unrelated to study 
drug.   
The incidence of study drug related TEAEs was within the range of 6% to 11% for all tre atment 
groups, with the highest frequency in the [ADDRESS_1152710] common (≥2 total 
subjects) TEAEs that were considered related to VT -[ADDRESS_1152711] common TEAE that wa s considered related to 
placebo was dizziness.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was low, in the range of 0% to 6% 
for all treatment groups.  
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by [CONTACT_251191], physical 
exam findings or ECGs.  
There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -[ADDRESS_1152712] population being studied and were generally balanced across the 
VT -1161 treatment and placebo group.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was complete cure at Wee k 48.  The proportion of subjects in the 
ITT population with complete cure at Week 48 ranged from 32% to 42% in the VT -[ADDRESS_1152713] rate in the 300 mg 12 –week treatment group and the highest rate in the

40 600 mg 12 –week treatment gr oup. No subjects receiving placebo experienced complete cure at 
Week 48.   The proportion of ITT subjects with complete cure was statistically significantly higher 
for all VT -1161 treatment groups compared with placebo at Week 48 (p<0.001).  
Overall, the eff icacy at Week 48 was clearly demonstrated in all the VT -1161 treatment groups, 
with little to no improvement seen in the placebo group.

In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, P K and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with 
recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was evaluated.   A total of 215 subjects participated in the study , 
were randomized to 5 treatment  groups and were administered either:  
• Low dose 12 -week: Loading doses of 150 mg o nce daily for 7 days , then 150 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by [CONTACT_251189] 12 weeks.  
• Low dose 24 -week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days , then 150 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• High dose 12 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7  days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by [CONTACT_251189] 12 weeks.  
• High dose 24 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days , then 300 mg once weekly

41 The primary efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251137] 48 of the study  in the 
ITT population.   Culture -verified acute VVC was defined as a positive fungal culture for Candida 
species associated with a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3.   The proportion of su bjects 
with one or more culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251138] 48 was lower in VT -1161 
dosing regimens : 4.8%  in 150 mg 1 2 weeks, 7.0% in 150 mg 24 weeks, 0.0% in 300 mg 12 weeks, 
and 4.9% in 300 mg 24 weeks, treatment group s compared with 52.2%  in the placebo group . 
The difference was statistically significant in the VT -1161 dosing regimens compared with 
placebo (p<0.0001).  
In conclusion, VT -1161 was determined to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated at all dose levels 
through the final visit at Week 48 of the study.  
1.3 Study Rationale  
RVVC  can be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or oral agents  and patients may  receive m aintenance

Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficac y of oral VT -1161 in  the treatment  of RVVC  through Week  48. 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability  of oral VT -1161  in the treatment of RVVC  through

Secondary:  
• Time to  first recurrence of a culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251140] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase.  
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture  for Candida during the 
Maintenance Phase . 
• The prop ortion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_830483] ≥[ADDRESS_1152719] randomization  through Week 24.  
• Change from Screening through Week 48  in the SF -36 mental component s core (MCS) . 
• Change from Screening through Week [ADDRESS_1152720]:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152721] 
12 months , as described below:   
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251107],  with a documented positive 
KOH  or Gram stain  performed at the  investigative  site 
• Subjects must also have had [ADDRESS_1152722] (i.e., 
cultur e, PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, Gram stain, a documented Pap  test, or other approved 
diagnostic test)  
The study consists of two Phases: 1) an open -label Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute 
VVC infection with 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of fluconazole, and 
2) a Maintenance Phase in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive VT-1161 or 
placebo  for 7 daily doses followed by 11 weekly doses  and then enter a 36 -week follow -up period . 
Once subjects hav e provided informed con sent or assent ( for those ages 12 to 17), the 
investigational site will evaluate all subjects  by [CONTACT_12550] a review of pertinent medical history, 
obtaining vital signs,  weight and height, ECG and laboratory tests,  reviewing clinical signs and 
symptoms of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum 
examination of the vagina, perform ing a KOH wet mount test or Gram stain from a vaginal smear  
to confirm the presence of yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline  culture  for 
identif ication of fungal species . Patient reported outcome survey s (SF-36, EQ-5D-3L or EQ -5D-

fluconazole for evaluati on and, if the acute VVC infection  has resolved (defined by a signs and 
symptoms score of <3), they will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either VT -1161 or a 
matchi ng placebo regimen .  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_830525].   If the acute VVC has not resolved  (define d by a signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3), 
the subject will be considered a screen failure and encouraged  to see their physician for further 
evaluation and follow -up care . 
4.2 Treatment Arms and Duration of Study  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_1152725] participation will be approximately 50 weeks: including the 
2-week Induction Phase  with fluconazole administration , followed by [ADDRESS_1152726].  
4.3 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 600 screened and 300 randomized subje cts are planned for this study.  Assuming 
a 20% discontinuation rate for the remainder of the study, approximately 240  subjects are expected 
to complete the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled at 60 to 80  sites in  North America  and Europe.  
4.4 Design Justification  
The VT -1161 dose and duration selection in the planned Phase 3 studies is based primarily on the 
results of VMT -VT-1161 -CL-006; “A Phase 2, Randomized, Double Bli nd, Placebo -Controlled, 
Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of VT -1161 Oral Tablets in the Treatment 
of Patients with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis .”   The study was designed to be consistent 
with the principles put forth in the ICH  E4 Guideline, “Dose -Response Information to Support 
Drug Registration.”

47 Given VT -1161’s large therapeutic window and favorable safety profile as demonstrated in the 
single - and multiple -ascending dose Phase 1 studies as well as Phase 2a studies, the Pha se 2b 
RVVC study was designed to demonstrate prolonged remission following short courses of 
VT-1161 dosing.    
The proportion of subjects in the ITT population with one or more culture verified acute VVC 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_830484] 48 was lower in  the VT 1161  dose groups; 4.8% in the 150 mg/12 -week, 
7.1% in the 150 mg/24 -week, 0.0% in the 300 mg/12 -week, and 4.9% in the 300 mg/24 -week 
treatment group s, compared to 52.2% in the placebo group.  This difference was statistically 
significant in all VT -1161 groups com pared to placebo (p<0.0001) .  However, the study was not 
designed to demonstrate a statistical  difference between the VT -1161 dosing regimens.  
In the PP population, the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -verified acute VVC 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_830485] 48 in VT -1161 dos e groups were 3.3% in the 150 mg/12 -week, 10.7% in 
the 150 mg/24 -week, 0.0% in the 300 mg/12 -week, and 0.0% in the 300 mg/24 -week treatment 
groups, compared to 65.6% in the placebo group, indicating a numerically higher rate of recurren ce 
in the lower VT -1161 dose groups.   A similar trend was observed in subjects wit h one or more 
positive  cultures through Week 48; 13.3% in the 150 mg/12 -week; 25.0% in the 150 mg/24 -week; 
16.1% in the 300 mg/12 -week ; and 3.2% in the 300 mg/24 -week treatment groups, compared to 
84% in the placebo group.  The mean plasma concentra tions for the VT -1161 150 mg/12 -week 
treatment group was 1.3 µg/mL at the start of weekly dosing (Day 7), 2.6 µg/mL at the end of the 
dosing phase (Week 12), and was followed  by a slow decay to reach 0.75 µg/mL at Week 48. 
Based on the PP analysis , it appears that the 150 mg/12 -week treatment group is at or near a 
minimally effective dose and duration of therapy.  
In the Kaplan -Meier analysis  (ITT population) , most recurrent ep isodes occurred in the early phase 
of the study.  In total, [ADDRESS_1152727] 5 weeks of the study.  
Notably, 3 of the se 5 subjects (all in the 150 mg group) experienced a recurrence by [CONTACT_2006] 7.   
Taken  together, the data suggest  that these subjects in the VT-1161 low dose (150  mg) treatment 
groups may have not attain ed effective therapeutic drug levels early enough to preve nt the early 
recurrences .  Therefore, a lower  than [ADDRESS_1152728]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 IND 111675  
       Ver. 6 U.S. Only, 01 October 2019  
 
48 was similar to the placebo group.  There were  also no meaningful differences observed between 
placebo and the VT-1161 treatment  groups  in other safety parameters including chemistry, 
hematology and ECG analyses .  To that end, from a safety  perspective  any of the dosing group s 
tested in the Phase 2b study could be potentially selected for the Phase 3 studies.  This  is important 
since, in addition to exhibiting excellent safety and tolerability, all VT -1161 treatment groups also 
achieved clinical outcomes that were far superior to fluconazole historic data where approximately 
60% of RVVC patient s experienced one or more acute  culture -verified  VVC recurrences within 6 
month s after the cessation of weekly prophylactic/maintenance therapy .  (Sobel et al. 2004 ).    
The proposed dosing regimen for the Phase 3 studies, inc orporates a 7 -day 150 mg loading  dose 
phase  to minimize early breakthroughs, followed by a 150 mg once weekly maintenance dose  
phase  for 11 weeks .  Based on the PK results from the Phase 2b study, the proposed dosing regimen 
of 150 mg daily for 7 days foll owed by a 150 mg once weekly maintenance dose is expected to 
provide a mean plasma concentration of approximately 2.5 µg/m L at the end of the dosing period 
(Week 12).  
4.4.1 Justification for Inclusion of Adolescents in the Study  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis , and esp ecially RVVC, is  rare in pre -menarch eal girls (typi[INVESTIGATOR_162812] -
adolescents less than 12 years of age) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_251142].  
Adolescent females  (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive)  represent a menarch eal population that is 
newly influenced by [CONTACT_251195]. The changes in  reproductive hormones in adolescents 
cause  vast changes in tissues and may increase the  susceptibility to VVC . In this population, cases 
of VVC and RVVC exist but are substantial ly less common than in adult females. While 75% of 
healthy women will likely experience one epi[INVESTIGATOR_251143] , and potentially 9% 
will be characterized as having recurrent disease , the prevalence of symptomatic acute VVC in 
adolescents is le ss than 2% of the population  and there is  no publish ed data that address es the 
incidence of RVVC in this patient population  (Fidel, 200 2; Blostein, 2017; Barousse, 2004 ). 
Presenting symptoms of VVC in menarch eal adolescents are similar to those in the adult 
population, and treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_830486]  (Joishy, 2005 ). The dose  and 
administration of the agents used in adolescents are the same as those used in adult females with 
VVC and RVVC.

7.1.1 Induction Phase (Screening to  Day 1  Pre-Randomization ) 
All subjects will receive 3 sequential 150 mg doses of fluconazole that are administered 72 hours 
apart.  
Regarding the dosing of fluconazole in adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age, inclusive), 
fluconazole exposure  at the planned dose is anticipated to be similar to that in adults and 
proportional to weight. AEs associated with fluconazole would also be expected to be similar in 
adolescents as in adults. There are currently no [LOCATION_002]  FDA - or European -approved dose s 
or regimen s of fluconazole for treatment of VVC or RVVC in adolescents. While the U nited States 
FDA -approved  labeling for fluconazole ( Diflucan, [COMPANY_007] 2017 ) is silent on treatment of 
adolescents with VVC, the European  prescribing information for fluconazole ( Diflucan® Summary 
of Product Characteristics [2017 ]) provides the following guidance ; “If treatment is imperative in 
adolescents (from 12 to 17 years old), the posology should be the same as in the adult population.”  
Therefore, a dolescent subjects (ages 12 to 17 years) enrolled in the study will receive the same 
150 mg doses of fluconazole as adult subjects.  
In Hungary , Romania,  Ukraine, and Czech Republic,  only subjects 18 years of age or older  will 
be enrolled in  the study.  
7.1.2 Maintenance Phase ( Day [ADDRESS_1152751] Randomization  to Week 12)  
Subjects will receive either:  
• 150 mg once daily dose of VT -1161 for 7 days followed by a 150-mg once weekly dose of 
VT-1161 for 1 1 weeks, or  
• a matching placebo regimen for 12 weeks.   
All subjects will take  1 capsule  once daily on Days 1 to 7 and 1 capsule  once weekly starting at 
Week 2  (7 days after the completion of daily dosing) through Week [ADDRESS_1152752]’s main meal  (as determined by [CONTACT_423]) , at approximately the same time of the day 
consistently  throughout the study .  Subjects should consume approximately 240 mL

replaced.  
7.7 Randomization and Blinding  
A randomized design through an interactive web response system  (IWRS)  will be used to assign 
subjects in a 2:1 ratio to the dose regimen  of VT -1161 or placebo.  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as 
the first day of VT -1161/Placebo administration and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_830528].  
The subjects, study I nvestigators and their staff, all clinical staff  members within Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals , the clinical study monitor, the study p roject team, and the study Medical 
Monitor (s) will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until  the co mpletion of the 
study.  The Unblinded Statistician responsible for creating the final randomization list and the 
IWRS personnel responsible for loading the final randomization list into the IWRS  will be 
unblinded to the treatments .  The bioanalytica l personnel responsible for assay of VT -[ADDRESS_1152759] treatments.  
7.8 Conditions for Breaking the Blind  
In the event the breaking of the blind is required, the following will apply:  
• The Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an 
emergency  (i.e., a Grade 4 AE)  OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge 
of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the 
subject as judg ed by [CONTACT_737]  (ICH GCP 4.3.1 ). If the SAE requires that an expedited 
regulatory report be sent to [ADDRESS_1152760]’s treatment assignment, may be sent to Investigators in accordance with local 
regulations.  
• The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_830529]’s treatment assignment  
immediately after the unblinding occurred  (ICH GCP 4.7) . 
• If unblinding is required, t he Mycovia Pharmaceuticals’  Medical Monitor  and Investigator  will 
be provided with the treatment assigned to the subject. The Investigator  must NOT disclose 
the treatment assignment to the subjec t and/or other study personnel including other site

81 9.1.7 Vulvovaginitis Clinical Assessment  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be evaluated at the Screening and each subsequent 
study visit.  Each of the following vulvovaginal signs a nd symptoms will be scored  and the 
individual scores combined for a maximum score of 18,  using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be objectively defined on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any signs or symptoms)  
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( definitely present)  
3 = severe (marked, intense)  
9.[ADDRESS_1152794], regardless of causal relationship.  
A “pre-existing” condition is one that is present prior to the start of IMP administration  and is 
reported as part of the subject ’s medical history.   Pre-existing conditions should be reported as 
AEs only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre -existing condition worsens during 
the study.  
Any abnormal safety assessments , such as ECGs, radiol ogical  scans, vital sign measurements,  
that are judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to be clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or 
SAE provided it meets one of those definitions.   Laboratory abnormalities generally are not 
considered AEs unless they ar e associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical 
intervention.  A laboratory abnormality (e.g., a clinically significant change detected on 
clinical chemistry, hematology) that is independent from a known underlying medical 
condition and th at requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to IMP interruption or 
discontinuation, should  be considered an AE.

82 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied are not considered AEs unless their severity is greater 
than expected in the judgement of the Investigator .  
In addition, t he following apply:  
• All AEs, including clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities, will be documented as 
an AE and followed until resolution.  
• All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of taking  the first dose of  fluconazole  
until the last foll ow-up visit of the study, at the time points specifie d in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
• Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of fluconazole  but after obtaining informed 
consent should be reco rded in the medical history section of the eCRF.  
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects.  
However, if the Investigator  learns of an SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject 
has been discharged from t he study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to 
the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly notify Mycovia

NOTES:  
a. “Death” is an outcome and is NOT the AE.  In the event of death, the cause of death should 
be recorded as the SAE.  The only exception is “sudden death” when the cause is unknown.  
b. Life-threa tening SAEs include any adverse drug experience, which, in the view of the 
Investigator, places the subject  at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurs.  It 
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have c aused 
death.  
c. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
All SAEs, regardless of causal relation ship, must be reported to Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals 
(or designee) within 24 hours of the site’s know ledge of the event.   The initial report must be 
captured in the electronic SAE CRFs within 1 business day.  
The SAE report should provide as much of the required information as is available at the time.  
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE:  subject  identification  
number , reporting source, and an event outcome.   Supplemental information may be entered 
into the electronic SAE CRFs  and should not delay the initial report.   Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  
(or designee) may contact [CONTACT_941] i nvestigational site to solicit additional information or to follow -
up on the event.

84 9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Subjects should be instructed to report all AEs to the Investigator.  In addition, the Investigator 
should seek to elicit any clinical or objective reactions by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questioning (“How have 
you been feeling?”) and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  All AE information obtained during 
the subject que stioning should be documented in the subjects’ clinical records and enter ed into 
the CRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed 
because of an AE should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.  The 
component parts of the diagnosis may be listed for verification.  If the AE is a laboratory 
abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the 
syndrome or diagnosis rather than the individual laboratory abnormali ty.  It should also be 
documented, verbatim, dir ectly on the laboratory report.  
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all AEs should be recorded in standard 
medical terminology on the CRF and on the medical record rather than in the subject ’s own 
words.   Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, 
association with the IMP, action(s) taken, and outcome.  
9.2.4 Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_251205], according 
to the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) Adult Toxicity Table, (Draft, 
November 2007) Appendix A .  For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value which is 
not addressed in the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, the most recent version of the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.[ADDRESS_1152796]  and lower limit of normal  (LLN)  laboratory ranges occur 
between those included in the DMID and those of the central laboratory that performs the 
assays, the values provided by [CONTACT_830530] s everity 
grade.  
For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value not addressed in the DMID Adult 
Toxicity Table, the following general scale may be used with I nvestigator discretion to assign 
severity:  
• GRADE 1 Mild : An event easily tolerated by [CONTACT_29320]; transient or mild discomfort 
(usually <  48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required.

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 IND 111675  
    Ver. 6 U.S. Only , 01 October 2019  
 
85 • GRADE 2 Moderate : An event that may interfere with normal, everyday activities; some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy requi red. 
• GRADE 3 Severe : An event that prevented the subject  from performing their normal, 
everyday activities; some assistance usually required; medica l intervention/therapy 
required;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
• GRADE 4 Life -threatening : At the time of the eve nt the subject  was at risk of death or 
the event resulted in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• GRADE 5 Death : An event that resulted in death.  
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over 
several  days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
NOTE: An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event (such as mild, moderate, o r severe 
myocardial infarction).  However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, (such as a severe headache), and both AE(s) and SAE(s) can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in  Section 9.2.2.

Unlikely Related:  
• The temporal sequence from administration of the IMP suggests that a relationship is 
unlikely.

separation between the treatment groups.   
While 102 t otal subjects will provide more than 90% power to detect reasonable differences 
between treatment groups in most of the pre -specified key secondary endpoints  a sample size 
of 160 active subjects and 80 placebo subjects is needed to provide 80% power to det ect a 
treatment difference of 3.[ADDRESS_1152810] deviation of 10 
points. (PASS 2008: two -sample t -test, alpha = 0.05).  Therefore, with the expected 
discontinuation rate, approximately 300 subjects will be necessary for randomization to arrive 
at approximately 240  evaluable subjects.   Approximately 600 subjects will be screened to 
randomize approximately 300 subjects that w ould meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria.  
12.2 Analysis Populations  
ITT Population : All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who receive d at least 1 dose of IMP.  
PP Population:  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Had no deviations to  inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact treatment outcome.  
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% complian ce during the 
daily dosing phase and ≥50% complian ce during the weekly dosing  phase . 
• Had the Week 4 8 visit completed within the  acceptable time window  (±14 days) . 
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome . 
Modified ITT:  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Positive  KOH or Gram stain at Screening.  
• Positive culture  at Screening.  
• Negative culture at Baseline.  
All statistical populati ons will be defined in the SAP.

12.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion  of subjects with one or more  culture -
verified  acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s during the Maintenance Phase (post randomization  through Week  
48 of the study ) in the ITT population.  An acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_830493] 
(considered a recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865])  is defin ed as a positive culture  for Candida species  and a 
clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.  
The primary method of analysis is a Chi -square test for active treatment versus placebo based 
on the ITT population.   
 
 
The number and percentage of subjects with one or more culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_830494] ≥[ADDRESS_1152812] random ization through Week 48 will be summarized 
across treatment groups including a 95% exact confidence interval and odds ratio.  
The percentages will also be plotted by [CONTACT_1570].  
The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following:  
• Time t o first recurrence of  a culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251140] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase . 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture  for Candida species  during the 
Maintenance Phase . 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one  culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_830495] ≥[ADDRESS_1152813] randomization  through Week 24 . 
• Change from Screening through Week 48  in the SF -36 patient mental component score 
(MCS) .

96 • Change  from Screening throug h Week [ADDRESS_1152814] all Week 48/ EOS assessments performed on the 
day of discontinuation .  
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each scheduled evaluation from all subjects 
who have been randomized, including those who discontinue the study prior to the EOS  Week 
48 visit.      
For scheduled visits where the investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and symptoms or the 
culture result is missing, missing values will be imputed using the method of multiple 
imput ation.  For subjects who discontinue the study early and have missing assessments for all 
visits after discontinuation, the missing values for the expected scheduled visits will be 
imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  The missing values will b e imputed using 
the following auxiliary information: region, treatment, baseline BMI, baseline age, ethnicity, 
and visit.  The procedure PROC MI in SAS will be used to generate [ADDRESS_1152815] 
randomization through Week 48 (including unscheduled vi sits) will be counted as having an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_830496] g the primary endpoint.  The multiple datasets containing the primary 
endpoint will be analyzed using a Chi -square test and the results will be combined using PROC 
MIANALYZE to obtain an inferential  result.   Sensitivity analyses will be performed for the 
primary endpoint to assess the impact of missing/censored data on the results  using different 
time to event and censoring calculations.  Further details on the steps of these analyses are 
presented i n the VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 SAP.  
12.5 Safety Analyses  
To meet the safety dataset  requirement, approximately 600  subjects will be scree ned to 
randomize approximately 3 00 subjects that would meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. 
Assuming a 20% discontinuation rat e, it i s expected that approximately [ADDRESS_1152816]:  VT-[ADDRESS_1152817] dose of  fluconazole  through Week 48  (EOS).   
Physical examination findings, vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory tests (hematology and 
chemistry) will be obtained throughout the study as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
and Procedures .  All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to 
Screening through the Week 48 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the CRF.  Pertinent and all 
major medical cond itions will be recorded on the Medical H istory CRF.   
For subjects discontinuing early from the study, every effort will be made for all EOS 
procedures to be performed as outlined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionar y for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA®) version 
21 dictionary, or higher.  The number and percentage of subjects having treatment -emergent 
AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_251211]® preferred term with a breakdown 
by [CONTACT_1570].  Mean chang es from pre -treatment in vital signs, ECG, and clinical 
laboratory variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The AE profile will be 
characterized with severity and relationship to IMP.  SAEs and AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of IMP will be ident ified.  
Treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory test results will be identified.  Treatment -emergent 
abnormal laboratory tests results are those in which the baseline value is within normal 
laboratory limits and at least [ADDRESS_1152818] dose of IMP.  
Per protocol, the baseline for laboratory values should be obtained at the Day 1 (Baseline) visit.   
Change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and final vital sign value after first dosing 
will be summarized descriptively.   
ECG measurements will include heart rate, QT interval, QT c interval, PR interval, and QRS 
interval.  Baseline for ECG measurements is defined per protocol as the value pre -dosing at 
the Day 1 (Baseline) visit.  Change from baseline will be summarized descriptively at each 
scheduled evaluation.  Subjects with clin ically significant changes in ECG rhythm or 
waveform will be identified.  Subjects who meet each of the following criteria from ICH

If there is primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis then bilirubin is classified as <68  =1; 6 
– 170 = 2; >170  = 3. 
The individual scores are summed and then grouped as:  
• <7 = A (Mild impairment)  
• 7 – 9 = B (Moderate impairment)  
• >9 = C (Severe impairment)  
A C classification forecasts a survival of less than 12 months.

Subjects  should not be menstruating at time of the study visits to ensure proper sample collection 
of the vaginal fluid.   
6.2.3 Vulvovaginal Exam and Clinical Assessment  
A vulvovaginal exam and clinical assessment of signs and symptoms will be evaluated at the 
unscheduled clinic visit.  Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored 
and the individual scores combined for a maximum score of 18, using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be objectively defined on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any signs or symptoms)  
1 = mild (sli ght) 
2 = moderate (definitely present)  
3 = severe (marked, intense)

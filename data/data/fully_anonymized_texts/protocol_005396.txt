1.  WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
Relieving post -operative pain is extremely important to orthopedic surgeons and 
anesthesiologists at HSS. The purpose  of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two 
methods of pain control along with an accelerated physical therapy protocol in aiding the 
achievement of rehabilitation milestones. The two pain control methods include: (1) peri -
articular injections du ring the surgery and (2) peri -articular injections during the surgery and a 
peripheral nerve block. The peri -articular injections are performed by [CONTACT_686359]. The nerve block  (injection of local anesthe tic, 
numbing medicine, near a nerve leading to the knee ) being investigated in this study is the 
adductor canal block. The adductor canal block has been shown to decrease pain and morphine 
use and preserve quadriceps strength post total knee replacement. Y our overall participation will 
continue over  the course of your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_686355] .  
 
2.  WHAT WILL YOUR PARTICIPATION REQUIRE ?

study groups:  
 
Group 1 - Peri-articular  Injection group   
A spi[INVESTIGATOR_9359] 0.5% bup ivacaine (10 or 12.5mL) will be  performed. The surgeon will 
perform the periarticular injections. The deep injection will consist  of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 30cc; morphine, 8 mg/ml, 1 cc; methylprednisolone, 40 mg/ml, 1 ml; cefazolin, 500 
mg in 10 ml; normal saline, 22cc. The superficial  injection w ill be 2 0 ml 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 
Patients will also be given 2 mg of intravenous decadron

Group 2 – Peri-articular + Adductor Canal Block group  
 
In addition to the above peri -articular injection protocol, patients will receive an adductor cana l 
block: 15 cc of Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.25% with 2 mg of Preservative free Dexamethasone.  
 
The randomization process is comparable to (or similar to) the flip of a coin.   It is not known if 
any treatment you receive will benefit you.  It is hoped the knowledge ga ined will benefit others 
in the future.  You, as well as the research, nursing, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and acute pain staff will be 
blinded as to which study group you are in. However, your anesthesiologist will not be blinded.  
 
You and/or your insurance will be responsible for any costs of all procedures performed that are 
standard of care, that is, care that you would receive even if you were not in this study.

3.  WHAT ADVERSE (BAD) EFFECTS CAN HAPPEN FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?  
WHAT RISKS ARE KNOWN ABOUT THE STUDY DRUG/STUDY DEVICE?  
The known effects, discomforts and foreseeable risks of  physical, psychological, sociological, or 
other harm which you may reasonably expect to occur from being in this study are:  
 Adductor Canal Block: One group will receive the adductor canal block. This will be an 
injection of local anesthetic near the saph enous nerve with ultrasound guidance. It is a 
possibility that the nerve may become irritated or injured during the injection. Your 
anesthesiologist will talk with you more about this procedure.  
 Peri-articular Injection: Both groups will receive the peri -articular injection. This is an 
injection performed near the knee joint  by [CONTACT_238084] . The injection is a combination 
of local anesthetic and other medications hoped to reduce pain and side effects. It is 
possible that the tissue near the knee may become irritated or injured with the injection.  
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_686357]. Sometimes nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation and 
confusion, and constipation can occur.  
 Other M edications: Meloxicam (an oral non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug) is used in 
both groups. It is standard of care at HSS for total joint replacements and is thought to 
reduce pain and improve mobility. Meloxicam is rarely associated with kidney problems.  
Steroids are given in both groups. Usually significant side effects do not occur with a 
single dose, but a short term rise in blood sugar is possible.  
 
Participation in this research involves the potential risk of a breach of confidentiality to your 
store d health information.  HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some direct 
identifiers from stored information [(i.e., names, social security numbers, medical recor d 
numbers) ; (ii) securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to informat ion that would 
identify you ; and (iii) limiting access to informati on stored to HSS investigators.

All patients participating in the study will receive an accelerated physical therapy program 
postoperatively, at no cost to you .  
 
If you are in the group receiving peri -articular injections (50% chance) you may or may not 
receive any additional benefit . If you are in the group receiving peri -articular injections and the 
adductor canal block (50% chance) you may or may not experience less pain. If you experience 
less pain then you may reduce your opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. Reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_686358]. Such side effects include constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
sedation, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], difficulty concentrating, difficulty urinating, and dry  mouth.  
 
5.  COST   
Those research procedures listed in Section [ADDRESS_930346] of Care for your treatment 
here at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for Special Surgery will be your/or your insurance’s responsibility.   You will be 
responsible for any co -pays, deductibles, and co -insurance associated with your medical care, 
just as you would be for any costs billed to your health insurance outside of this study.  You will 
also be financially responsible for any medical care  costs  not covered by [CONTACT_168528] . 
 
HSS is committed to providing financial assistance when financially warranted and consistent 
with its resources, regardless of age, gend er, religion, race or sexual orientation.  So if you do not 
have health insurance, or if your health insurance does not pay for your medical care, you may 
seek financial assistance from HSS.  Eligibility determinations are made on a case -by-case basis 
in accordance with HSS’s financial assistance policy.  You will be responsible for any costs not 
covered by [CONTACT_268171], which could be all of the costs (if HSS determines that you are 
not eligible for financial assistance) or some of the costs (if fi nancial assistance awarded by [CONTACT_268172]). For more information about the Financial Assistance 
Program or to request a Financial Assi stance Application  call (212) 606 -1505 to speak with a

11.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION  
HSS is concerned about possible conflicts of interest in research, and has policies that require all 
investigators and senior research staff to report to HSS significant financial interests (such as 
stock ownership , royalty payments, and consulting agreements) and relationships (such as 
membership on a scientific advisory board) that are related to their research studies.  When an 
investigator reports a significant financial interest or relationship that relates to one of his/her 
studies, HSS’s Conflict of Interest Committee for Research reviews the information to evaluate 
the risk that the interest or relationship might influence how the investigator conducts the study 
or interprets the results of the study.  HSS ma y also take steps to minimize that risk.   
 
 The Conflict of Interest Committee for Research has determined that there are no 
conflicts of interest associated with this study.

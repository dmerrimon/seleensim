4.  Safety Endpoint 1. Incidence and frequency of Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), assessed throughout the study. 
Statistical Methods The data collected in this study will be summarized using number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values for quantitative variables, and frequencies for qualitative variables.  1) Efficacy analysis Primary endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of variance including only the treatment as main factor followed by [CONTACT_094]-planned comparisons from Vehicle and rhNGF dosages according to Williams procedure. In addition, primary endpoint will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables by [CONTACT_10659]. The change from baseline value will also be summarized for all post-baseline visits. An explorative sensitivity analysis of primary endpoint will be conducted including in the analysis of variance the absence/presence of diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome and its interaction with treatments as covariates. If the interaction term is statistically significant (at the 0.10 level given its explorative nature), the treatment effects within patients with and without Primary Sjögren's Syndrome will be provided. It will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables by [CONTACT_10659]. The change from baseline value will also be summarized for all post-baseline visits. Secondary endpoints will be presented with the appropriate descriptive statistics and inferential statistics appropriate for the nature of variable analyzed will be done in order to test treatment effect.    Explorative endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_395833]. Any statistical testing will be descriptive in nature.  2) Safety analysis AEs Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 2.1.1. Nerve Growth Factor - Overview   Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic and sensory neurons, and for differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. It binds with at least two classes of receptors: high-affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, and low-affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR), also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR).  NGF and TrkA are expressed in the anterior segment of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva), and NGF is released in the aqueous humor. Several pi[INVESTIGATOR_395800], playing a crucial role in the physiopathology of several anterior ocular segment diseases.   2.1.2. Chemical And Formulation Data   As recombinant human NGF (rhNGF) production in mammalian cells does not achieve adequate yields, a manufacturing process based on the use of recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been developed. However, because the biological activity of NGF relies on the formation of three disulfide bonds, and because disulfide bonds cannot occur in the reducing cytosol, the purification and renaturation of NGF produced in E. coli is problematic. Based on the knowledge that the prosequence increases the yield and rate of refolding of NGF, we have developed a manufacturing process starting from proNGF. After expression of proNGF in E. coli, the insoluble protein is isolated in the form of insoluble inactive aggregates (inclusion bodies), solubilized in a strong denaturing agent and subsequently converted into the natural conformation, which is determined by [CONTACT_317863]. Biologically active rhNGF is finally obtained by [CONTACT_317864]. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of human proNGF has been optimized for E coli expression (codon adjustment) and two changes in the furin cleavage site, R101V and K103A, have been introduced. These two changes are important Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

to ensure a homogeneous rhNGF preparation during the process with the mature protein starting with serine 105.  2.1.3. Rationale for rhNGF therapy in patients with dry eye  Dry eye is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ocular surface with severe symptoms and visual impairment, leading to worse efficiency to perform duties for an average of 184 work days and resulting in an average loss of productivity estimated in 5,000USD per year per patient (1).  Dry eye results from systemic diseases (Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thyroid disease, Bell's palsy), ocular conditions (Meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis, ocular rosacea, corneal dystrophies), elective surgeries (refractive surgery, blepharoplasty), eyelid conditions (lagophthalmos, entropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]/ectropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), cranial surgeries, side effects of drugs (antihistamines, diuretics, beta-blockers), ocular injuries and burns, chemotherapy and radiation, aging, menopause, etc. (2).  Dry eye pathogenesis is multifactorial; however, a number of common mechanisms can be identified: (i) chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva; (ii) decrease of ocular surface sensitivity; (iii) impairment of quantity of tears and/or quality of the tear film, including tear film hyperosmolarity; (iv) changes of conjunctival epi[INVESTIGATOR_395801]; (v) corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_58158].  Until now, treatment has been limited to the use of artificial tears to temporarily improve lubrication of the ocular surface, or the use of steroids to decrease the inflammatory reaction. However, chronic use of steroids is associated with severe complications such as cataract and glaucoma (2). Cyclosporine eye drop therapy for dry eye patients has been approved in the [LOCATION_002] but not in Europe. This drug seems to affect only inflammation and tear film production, without any effect on ocular surface sensitivity or the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. On the other hand, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that NGF may affect all the pathogenic mechanisms of dry eye, potentially restoring ocular surface homeostasis (3). Indeed, several studies have shown that NGF is involved in the regulation of tear film production. In fact, NGF, TrkA and p75, as well as other neurotrophins (NTs) and related receptors, are expressed by [CONTACT_58195]; moreover, NGF has been quantified in human tears, indicating that NGF is basally released by [CONTACT_58196] (4,5,6). These data suggest that NGF may play a role in the maintenance of the tear film and in its alterations in drying ocular surface diseases. Specifically, considering that NGF potentially affects all the components of the ocular surface (cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, and sensory innervation), it might play an important role during dry eye disease. In line with this hypothesis: 1) NGF eye drop administration in a dog experimental model of dry eye increases tear production, conjunctival goblet cell density and corneal transparency (7, 2), an increased tear concentration of NGF has been reported in patients affected by [CONTACT_395835]é farmaceutici s.p.a.

(8;9), NGF stimulates glycoconjugate secretion by [CONTACT_58198], without affecting cell proliferation (10).  2.2. A SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA  rhNGF has been already studied in healthy volunteers and in different subject populations.  In the completed Phase I study in healthy volunteers (study NGF0112), a total of 58 subjects (out of 74 enrolled) were treated with single and multiple dose of different concentrations of rhNGF eye drops showing a good safety profile.  Furthermore, a Phase I/II multicenter, double-masked, vehicle controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhNGF at 10 and 20 μg/mL six times a day in 174 patients with stage 2 and 3 of Neurotrophic Keratitis NK (study NGF0212) was completed in 2015 demonstrating that rhNGF was very well tolerated and effective in patients with NK. A successful confirmatory study (NGF0214) was completed in 2016 and marketing authorization for rhNGF 20 μg/mL eye drops has been granted by [CONTACT_395836] [ADDRESS_497669] been evaluated in a Phase I/II study in retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) patients at the doses of 60 and 180 μg/mL (NGF0113), and in a phase I/II study in glaucoma at the dose of 60μg/mL (NGF0314). An open arm, uncontrolled study showed that 4 weeks treatment with rhNGF eye drops at 20 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL concentrations was safe and effective in improving symptoms, corneal staining and tear function in patients with severe dry eye disease as compared to baseline (NGF0213). These results prompted to the conduction of two additional phase II RCTs in patients with dry eye disease (NGF0216) and in patients with ocular discomfort symptoms following refractive surgery (NGF0116) which confirmed the favourable tolerability profile of rhNGF eye drops at a concentration of 20 μg/mL up to 6 times daily for 8 weeks.  In the double-masked vehicle-controlled Phase II study NGF0216 no major differences were observed in term of efficacy when comparing the two regimens (6 vs. 2 times/day) and treatment durations (8 vs. 4 weeks) in a subset of patients with similar characteristics (hyposecretive dry eye with Schirmer test <10mm/5min).  The results of these two studies in dry eye disease patients, as well as the results on reflex tear secretion obtained in the neurotrophic keratitis trials NGF0212 and NGF0214, suggest that the rhNGF may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with hyposecretive dry eye disease. In all studies rhNGF was well tolerated and the reported ocular AEs were generally transient and mostly mild and moderate in intensity during the controlled treatment period and the follow-up period. Only moderate and transient ocular AEs possibly related to rhNGF administration were reported. In the  Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Japanese ethnicity (study NGF0117) a total of 30 subjects were enrolled. 20 subjects were treated with  single dose of rhNGF (formulation containing L-methionine as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) at concentration 20 μg/mL and a total of 10 subjects were treated with placebo. During the studyno adverse events  occurred.   Single and multiple doses of rhNGF delivered Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

topi[INVESTIGATOR_395802]. No clinically important changes in ECG were observed after dosing with rhNGF. There was no apparent relationship between treatment and plasma rhNGF levels, and this study did not give any indication for an immunogenic potential of rhNGF in humans after ophthalmic treatment. 2.3. STUDY RATIONALE The data reported above, together with the evidence of rhNGF eye drop effectiveness in the treatment of patients affected by [CONTACT_317876][INVESTIGATOR_317816], make rhNGF a strong candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease (11, 12, 13). As part of the development plan, the present study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/mL in patients with moderate to severe dry eye. For additional information regarding the development of rhNGF, please consult the current IB. 2.3.1. Risk assessment/benefit evaluation The study is considered a low risk interventional trial. It is conducted with a dose of medicinal product already tested and already authorized in some European countries and recently by [CONTACT_395837].  The study is conducted in severe to moderate dry eye, a disease not approved, however [ADDRESS_497670] the dose proposed in this protocol is rhNGF 20 µg/mL three drops per day (both eyes), which is well below the dose approved for the treatment of NK (rhNGF 20 µg/mL six drops/eye per day). Considering what is discussed above no particular safety risks are foreseen with respect to the safety profile of the marketed product (OXERVATE® 20 µg/mL).  The patients with dry eye participating in this study may potentially benefit from the application of rhNGF for 28 days.   The following potential study risks were evaluated:  1) Participant well-being e.g.- risk-benefit balance - burden of study visits  2) Lifestyle requirements- Study specific procedures which carry risk -additional to standard care (es: week of run in) 3) Complexity of study procedures  4) Education, training, experience and resources of all investigator site staff in GCP and study procedures Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  3.1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  The study objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of rhNGF when administered as eye drops to patients with moderate to severe dry eye and to exploratively evaluate the preliminary efficacy data also in a group of  dry eye patients with diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome(14). 3.2. STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE This study will be performed at 8-12 study centers located in the [LOCATION_003]. At each study center, the Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring that the investigation is conducted according to the signed Investigator agreement, the protocol, GCP guidelines, and local regulations.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_243861], which will consist of maintaining the study file and the patient records, corresponding with the IRB, and completing the case report forms (eCRFs) and reporting SAEs within 24 hours of initial awareness.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_395803]. If the investigator/institution retains the services of any individual or party to perform trial-related duties and functions, the investigator/institution should ensure this individual or party is qualified to perform those trial-related duties and functions and should implement procedures to ensure the integrity of the trial-related duties and functions performed and any data generated. 3.3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN   This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double masked, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to perform dose ranging and evaluate efficacy of rhNGF eye drops at 20 µg/mL concentration administered two or three times daily for 4 weeks in patients with moderate to severe dry eye. Patients will be evaluated at screening visit (day -8), baseline (day 1+2), week 2 (day 14±2), week 4 (day 28±2) or early withdrawal and week 8 (day 56±2), week 12 (day 84±4), week 16 (day 112±7) of follow up. During the screening (day -8) all procedures for inclusion will be performed. From the day of screening the patients will stop any kind of further treatment, except commercially available preservative free artificial tears for a period of 7 days and 9 days as maximum (day -8 to day -1+2) until the baseline visit (day 1). At the end of the wash out period (day -8 to day -1+2) , patients meeting the entry criteria for this study will be randomized 1:1:1 and treated for 4 weeks with either rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/mL TID, rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/mL BID and vehicle SID or vehicle TID.

During the 4 weeks of masked treatment only the administration of IMP it is allowed. Nevertheless, if strictly needed, the patient can take  preservative free artificial tears (provided by [CONTACT_1034]). The use (n° drops/day) of preservative free artificial tears will be clearly documented in a patient’s diary and in the eCRF.   Following the completion of the double-blind treatment patients will be followed up for safety assessments for an additional [ADDRESS_497671] treatment and will be evaluated at the end of the safety follow-up period. During the safety follow-up period patients will not use further treatment except preservative free artificial tears provided by [CONTACT_395828] (morning, afternoon, evening ).  The use of preservative free artificial tears will be clearly documented in a patient’s diary and in the eCRF. The total duration of the study is 17 weeks.

3.3.1. Rationale for Selection of dose, control group and treatment schedule in the study  The dose proposed in this study (rhNGF 20 µg /mL) has already been tested both in heathy volunteers for five consecutive days (NGF0112 and NGF0117) and in patients affected by [CONTACT_395838], including dry eye. rhNGF 20 µg /mL (one drop in each eye six times daily for 8 weeks), was also tested in the Phase I/II of the NK studies (NGF0212 and NGF0214), dry eye (NGF0216) and in patients after cataract and refractive surgery (NGF0116). rhNGF 20 µg/mL administered two times daily, demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated (NGF0213)  will also ensure the lubrification of the ocular surface in the present study where the use of artificial tears will be not allowed during the treatment period.  Higher doses of rhNGF (up to 180 µg /mL) were administrated to patients with diseases of the back of the eye, such as retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (Study NGF0213) for up to 168 days.  The 20 μg/ml concentration of rhNGF is well sustained by [CONTACT_395839] a commercial formulation.  A dose regimen of [ADDRESS_497672] the minimum amount of lubrication that is compatible with symptoms’ relief. A double-blind study design was adopted to minimize systematic bias. Randomization is expected to minimize patient selection bias and increase baseline comparability between treatment groups. The use of placebo control is critical to the study design for, providing an accurate estimate of the additive benefit of pharmacotherapy.   The use of the drug’s vehicle as placebo helps in making the latter as indistinguishable from the rhNGF solution. Patients with insufficient therapeutic response, tolerability issues, or worsening of symptoms may be discontinued at any time during the study. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

4. SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION  Male and female ≥ 18 years with moderate to severe dry eye will be included. A total of 300 patients will be enrolled.  The safety and efficacy of rhNGF eye drops will be investigated also in a specific subgroup of patients with hyposecretive dry eye, i.e., patients with dry eye due to primary Sjögren's syndrome (2, 14). To gain information on the safety and efficacy of rhNGF in this subgroup of patients at least sixty (60) patients with a documented diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome are out of [ADDRESS_497673] already been enrolled based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the previous version of the study protocol. This amendment is applied only to set a minimum prespecified number of patients with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.  The nature of the resulting statistical analysis in this subgroup of patients will be explorative. Including at least y 60 subjects with documented diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome within the total sample size (20%) will have no impact on the initial assumptioms concerning sample size for the following reasons: x The previous study (NGF0216), on which sample size assumptions have been based (see section 9.1), reports a similar prevalence of patients with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome in their medical history (⁓25% in the FAS population). x As dry eye due to Sjogren’s syndrome is a hyposecretive form of the disease, the primary endpoint is appropriate for both the whole study population and the subgroup with Sjögren's syndrome.  x As anticipated, the same patients could have already been enrolled based on the previously applied and approved inclusion/exclusion criteria.  4.1. INCLUSION CRITERIA To be eligible for inclusion into this study, each patient must fulfil the following inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female aged ≥ 18 years 2.

ELIGIBLE EYE Assuming that all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met in both eyes, the worse eye (eligible eye) will be determined at the baseline visit using a stepladder approach, as follows: 1. Schirmer’s Test (since this is the primary endpoint)-Worse eye determined as eye with lower Schirmer I score. If Schirmer I score is the same in both eyes, worse eye will be determined by [CONTACT_317881] (cornea+conjunctival staining). 2. NEI score (cornea+conjunctival staining).  If all of the above are identical, determination of the worse eye will be based on the Investigator’s judgement, then simply use the right eye as the eligible eye. 4.4. ASSIGNMENT OF PATIENT NUMBER Each patient who provides written consent to participate in this study will be assigned a unique 5-digit PID number (e.g. 01-001) consisting of a 2-digit study center number followed by [CONTACT_941] 3-digit screening number assigned sequentially by [CONTACT_180443], from 001 to 300.  4.5. RANDOMISATION Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either rhNGF eye drops solution 20 µg/ml TID (⁓100 patients) or rhNGF  eye drops solution 20 µg/ml BID plus vehicle eye drop solution SID (⁓100 patients) or vehicle eye drop solution TID (⁓100patients). Randomization will be stratified according to absence/presence of a documented diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome to ensure balanced assignment across treatment groups. Each randomized patient will be allocated with randomization number, according to the stratified randomization list. Drop outs after randomization will not be replaced. Randomization list as well as associated kit numbers will be be generated by a member of Syneos Health Biostatistics department, not involved in the conduct of the study.  Patients will be assigned to treatment in numerical order. A tear-off label from the kit box, with the kit number, will be attached to the investigational product dispensing log.  The enrollment of patients will be scheduled in order to assure an inclusion of approximately 240 patients without Primary Sjögren's Syndrome diagnosis and at least 60 patients  with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.

4.6. MASKING The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator, site staff and Sponsor’s clinical research personnel until the study is unmasked for the final statistical analysis (after data base lock) except in case of specific events that will require unmasking of the patient. The vials containing rhNGF (20 µg/ml) or vehicle will be identical in appearance, and the contents of the vials will be indistinguishable. All staff directly involved in the analysis of study results will remain masked to treatment assignments while the study is in progress. A list of sequential kit numbers will be generated by a member of the Syneos Health not involved in the conduct of the study. Each kit number will be randomly associated with a treatment group. Patients will be assigned to treatment in numerical order. A tear-off label from the kit box, with the kit number, will be attached to the investigational product dispensing log.

A temperature probe and data logger will accompany the drug on shipment. It is essential that the investigational sites will verify the temperature excursion during shipment vs. the acceptable storage conditions, in order to identify potential stability concerns during shipment. These must be immediately communicated to the Sponsor that will decide upon appropriate actions to be taken. The IMP will be stored in a locked place, sheltered from light. The vials will be not shaken since agitation of vials may cause foaming and/or particle formation.  On Day 1 (baseline visit), the study personnel will give to the patient the monthly boxes containing the study medications Patient should bring the study medication, one monthly box, at home as soon as possible and immediately store it in a freezer at -20 ± 5 °C. The weekly box must be kept at 2-8°C for 7 days protected from light; the daily box can be kept at room temperature,  before the patient will use the single vial for each instillation (both eyes) as long as 12 hours are not exceeded. Agitation of vials may cause foaming and/or particle formation. Drug preparation and administration instructions will be provided separately to the site and to the patients.   Together with the IMP monthly box, the patient will also receive a separate kit of vial adapters (one per vial), pi[INVESTIGATOR_6343] (1 per vial) and disinfectant wipes (1 per vial). IMP eye drops solution instruction will be provided to patients.  Patients will use one vial to instill one drop in both eyes (group 1: rhNGF TID; group 2: rhNGF BID and vehicle SID; group 3: vehicle TID) between 7 AM and 9 PM (every 6-8 hours) for [ADDRESS_497685] given authorization for its continued use. The IMP supplies are to be used only in accordance with this protocol. The Investigator will not use any drug samples for other purposes (e.g., treating patients or deviating from the protocol with regard to dose regimen, duration of treatment, etc.). Under no circumstances will the Investigator give any drug samples to a third party. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

The dosing scheme of the different study groups is summarized below:  Group 1: one drop of rhNGF 20 µg/ml will be instilled in both eyes three times daily (every 6-8 hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm).  Group 2: one drop of rhNGF 20 µg/ml will be instilled in both eyes two times daily plus one drop (40 µL) of vehicle will be instilled in both eyes once daily (every 6-8 hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm). NB: rhNGF will be instilled in the morning and in the evening while the vehicle will be instilled in the afternoon.  Group 3: vehicle eye one drop will be instilled in both eyes  three times daily (every 6-8 hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm).  During the 4 weeks of masked treatment only the administration of IMP  is allowed. Nevertheless, if strictly needed, the patient can take a preservative free artificial tears (provided by [CONTACT_1034]). The use (n° drops/day) of preservative free artificial tears will be clearly documented in a patient’s diary and in the eCRF.  Both the patients and the investigator will be masked to the study treatment. Information about the  study drug administration, and comments, will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  5.5. ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE IMP The Pharmacist and/or Investigator will confirm the receipt of the IMP supply in writing by [CONTACT_58206].

6.3. EARLY WITHDRAWAL FROM THERAPY OR ASSESSMENT 6.3.1. Primary Reason For Discontinuation From The Study A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study protocol procedures. Patients can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons:   ¾ Adverse event (AE): Any significant AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_317831],  is not compatible with study continuation. ¾ Disease progression or worsening, that according to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_395816].. ¾ Death. ¾ Lost to follow-up (Every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; a registered letter must be sent). ¾ Non-compliance with study drug: an indication that a patient has not agreed with or followed the instructions related to the study medication. ¾ Physician decision: a position, opi[INVESTIGATOR_58179] a physician with reference to the patient. ¾ Severe Protocol violation: an event or decision that stands in contrast to the guidelines set out by [CONTACT_760]. ¾ Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034]: an indication that a clinical study was stopped by [CONTACT_2728]. ¾ Withdrawal of consent: study discontinuation requested by a patient for whatever reason. ¾ Other reasons, such as administrative reasons or pregnancy.   Before removal, each case should first be discussed with Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the study will be reflected on the Study Termination Record of the eCRF. Unless the patient has withdrawn consent, the follow up visit assessments should be performed as detailed in § 6.  The investigator should advise patients that prematurely discontinue on any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_395817]é farmaceutici s.p.a.

6.3.2. Discontinuation procedures For any patient discontinuing the study following randomization, the Investigator will:   ¾ ask the patient to undergo, as far as possible, a final medical visit (ETV) to examine the patient's health conditions. This examination will verify that all values tested at screening have remained within a clinically acceptable range (i.e., not clinically significant changes compared to screening). ¾ arrange for alternative medical care of the withdrawn patient, if necessary. ¾ report in the eCRF date and time of the last dose administration, and date and primary reason of study discontinuation. ¾ record in the eCRF any follow-up if the patient is withdrawn for an AE. AE’s should be followed until resolution.   6.3.3. Replacement procedure Patients in this study who prematurely discontinue treatment will not be replaced.  It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If, for a patient, study treatment or observations are discontinued, the primary reason for discontinuation will be recorded.  6.4. END OF STUDY Patients completing the double-blind treatment (Visits 1 Baseline to Visit 6 Follow up) will be considered completers.  For the purpose of this trial, the End of Study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient or upon completion of any follow-up procedure described in the protocol. The Investigator and the Sponsor have the right to discontinue the study at any time for reasonable medical and/or administrative reasons. As far as possible, this should occur after mutual consultation. Reasons for discontinuation have to be documented appropriately. In this event, no further patients will receive doses of the study drugs, and patients already having received a dose of study drug will not receive any further doses of the study IMP but will undergo all safety assessments scheduled after the last dose of study drug, up to an including the end of study examination.

8. EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY INFORMATION 8.1. DEFINITIONS  Adverse Event An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  Adverse Drug Reaction  An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is defined as any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose. Any responses to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event..  Adverse events are to be considered unrelated if the relationship to the study drug, as described in the table in § 8.2.1,  is none or unlikely; whereas any AE reported in the study having a possible, probable or highly probable relationship to study drug will be considered as an ADR. The determination of expectedness should be made by [CONTACT_395848]. Serious Adverse Event A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined in line with (CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Sec. 312.32) as any adverse experience that, in the view of either the Investigator or sponsor, meets any of the following criteria:: x results in death, x is life-threatening (i.e. the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), x requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395818]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

x results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption x is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, x is an important medical event. NOTE: An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient’s wellbeing and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395819]-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317836], not associated with any deterioration in condition are not considered to be SAEs (see Par. 8.3.2).   These events must be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF where a variable will be ticked to indicate that they are not SAEs.  Death shall always be reported as SAE and cause of death shall always be specified when known. Unexpected Adverse Event/Reaction An AE or ADR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed and listed in the Investigator Brochure. Events that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure (section Reference Safety Information)  as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are considered unexpected (21 CFR312.32(a)). Suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction A suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as an adverse reaction that is both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and also meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Reaction. As mentioned, the determination of expectedness should be made on the basis of the IB (section Reference Safety Information)  . Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

Adverse Events (AEs) of special Interest (Sight-threatening Events) The following adverse events are considered to be of special interest and by [CONTACT_317895] (medically important criteria): ¾ AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity of >30 ETDRS letters or > +0.6 LogMAR (compared with the last assessment of visual acuity at the last visit) lasting >1 hour ¾ AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity to the level of Light Perception or worse lasting >1 hour ¾ AEs that required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or biopsy with intravitreal injection of anti-infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy with gas) to prevent permanent loss of sight ¾ AEs associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis) ¾ AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may require medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight. 8.2. ADVERSE EVENT (AE) MONITORING At visit 3 (end of treatment), visit 4 (FU), vist 5 (FU) and visit 6 (FU), after the patient has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator or appropriate designee should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_243932]:  x “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?” x “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change in concomitant condition(s) that is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in patient's medical conditions. Changes in any protocol-specific ocular or systemic parameter evaluated during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. In addition, the patient’s responses to any questionnaire utilized during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in a protocol-specific parameter or questionnaire response that is clinically relevant is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality. All AEs should be followed-up to determine outcome of the reaction.  In order to collect as complete as possible information in the clinical study database, all ADRs and SAEs ongoing at the time the subject’s study participation ends should be evaluated within 10 days after the final visit. After this period, all unresolved ADRs and SAEs will be reported as “ongoing” in the eCRF. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

8.3. RECORDING AE data should be obtained through observation of the patient, from any information volunteered by [CONTACT_102], or through patient questioning.  Adverse Events: All AEs (non-serious and serious) that occur during the course of the study will be recorded in the eCRF. Any pre-existing medical conditions or signs/symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed consent is signed) should be specified in the dedicated eCRF sections. Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be documented on eCRF. AEs will be collected till last Follow Up visit (week 16). When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity),any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverseevent relationship to the study treatment.   Serious Adverse Events: The Investigator must record all SAEs, including sight-threatening events, occurring at any time during the study regardless of presumed causal relationship, on the Serious Adverse Event form in the eCRF of the EDC system within 24 hours of learning of the event; information on the SAE must also be recorded on a specific Non-Carbon Repeat SAE form (included in the Investigator’s Site File).

 Version No. 2.0 – Final 08/AUG/[ADDRESS_497693] The Investigator will assess the possible relationship between the AE and the investigational medication, according to the criteria in Table below: Relationship of the Adverse Event to the IMP None (Intercurrent Event) An event that is not and cannot be related to the Investigational Product, e.g. patient is a passenger in a road traffic accident or surgical intervention performed during the study, but planned before patient enrolment into the study Unlikely (remote) Relationship is not likely e.g. a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality with temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide more plausible explanations Possible Relationship may exist, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s condition or treatment or other cause Probable Relationship is likely, the AE abates upon discontinuation of Investigational Product and cannot be due to the patient’s condition Highly Probable Strong relationship, the event abates upon discontinuation of Investigational Product and, if applicable, re-appears upon repeat exposure  An ADR is defined as an adverse experience which is reasonably likely to have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. Events considered “Possible”, “Probable” and “Highly Probable” related to the IMP treatment and implying a reasonable possibility, if considered unexpected, will be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities. 8.3.2. Severity of AEs The Investigator will grade the severity of any AE using the definitions in the Table below. For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the highest severity grade attained should be reported. Severity of the Adverse Event Mild Grade 1 - Does not interfere with patient’s usual function (awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated [acceptable]). Moderate Grade 2 - Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function (enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity [disturbing]). Severe Grade 3 - Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function (incapacity to work or to do usual activities [unacceptable])   Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

Follow-up reports (as many as required) should be completed and faxed/e-mailed following the same procedure above, marking the SAE form as “follow up Number XX”.   Whenever more than one SAE is observed, the Investigator should identify which is the primary adverse event, i.e. the most relevant one. If other events are listed in the same report, the Investigator, along with their relatedness to the Investigational Product, should identify which adverse events are serious and which are non-serious. In any case, the Investigator is requested to record his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_395820](s) with the investigational medication. An assessment of expectedness and causality of each serious adverse event will be performed case by [CONTACT_58235]é/Syneos Health. For SAE reported by [CONTACT_395850]é, the Investigator will receive a notification. Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, further information, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_317837], as well as results of laboratory tests performed will need to be included in the patients chart. If the patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a copy of the discharge summary should be available, if possible. In line with CT3 Detailed Guidance and ICH E2A provisions, although the Investigator does not usually need to actively monitor patients for AEs once the trial has ended, if the Investigator becomes aware of a SAE occurring to a patient after that patient has ended his/her participation in the study (whether study completion or withdrawal), the SAE should be reported by [CONTACT_395851]é/Syneos Health Pharmacovigilance. Such “post-study cases” should be regarded for expedited reporting purposes as though they were study reports. Therefore, a causality assessment and determination of expectedness are needed for a decision on whether or not expedited reporting is required.  8.4.2. Conditions that should not be reported as serious adverse events The conditions listed below, that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient, are not considered to be SAE and shall not be reported as such, but only need to be recorded in the eCRF: x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317838].  x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58172], not associated with any deterioration in condition. x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243888], which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58174].  x Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of SAEs  given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

In addition, the following situation shall not be considered SAE:  x Trial end points x Abnormal test results that do not induce clinical signs and/or symptoms and require intervention/therapy, i.e. are not clinically significant. 8.4.3. Reporting Procedure to IRB and to Regulatory Authorities In addition to reporting the SAE to Dompé, the Investigator must also comply with the requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB which approved the study. The requirements of IRBs vary from one IRB to another; however, as a minimum requirement, the Investigators must promptly report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) to their IRB. In line with provisions set forth in 21CFR312, Dompé shall notify all participating Investigators in an IND safety report of any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected  and of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than:  x seven calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is fatal or life threatening; to be followed by [CONTACT_243934]. x fifteen calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is serious but neither fatal nor life threatening. The Investigators in turn shall notify their IRB.  If the results of an investigation show that an ADR not initially determined to be reportable is reclassified as reportable, the Sponsor shall report such reaction in a written safety report as soon as possible, but in no event later than 7/15 calendar days after the determination is made. Treatment will be unblinded by [CONTACT_58231]é Drug Safety Pharmacovigilance prior to submission of a S[LOCATION_003]R to Regulatory Authorities and only cases referred to active treatment will be considered expeditable for regulatory reporting, in line with law requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_395821]’s Files. Dompé shall also notify FDA in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible after Dompé determines that the information qualifies for reporting, in particular shall notify of: x any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. Dompé must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

Periodical Reporting to Regulatory Authorities Dompé shall be responsible to prepare and submit annual safety reports (Development Safety Update Report – DSUR) to relevant Regulatory Authorities.  8.5. UNMASKING OF THE STUDY TREATMENT Masked information on the identity of the assigned investigational product will be provided for each patient. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of patient safety, Dompé must be informed in all cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, Dompé Drug Safety may be need to unmask the patient’s treatment if the a reported SAE meets criteria of a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) in order to fulfil expedited regulatory reporting requirements. Unmasked information shall not be disclosed to Investigators. The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator, site staff and Dompé’s clinical research personnel and Syneos Health staff (apart from pharmacovigilance). 8.6. FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH ADVERSE EVENTS (AES) The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of patients during the trial and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up procedures are maintained after the trial. All AEs should be followed-up to determine outcome of the reaction or until 10 days after the final visit. The Investigator should follow-up the event until resolution or stabilization of the condition. It is the Investigator's responsibility to assure that the patients experiencing AEs receive definite treatment for any AE, if required. If patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a SAE, a copy of the discharge summary is to be forwarded to Syneos Health/Dompé as soon as it becomes available. In addition, a letter from the Investigator that summarizes the events related to the case as well as results of any relevant laboratory tests also may be requested. Further, depending upon the nature of the SAE, Dompé may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_243885]’s medical records. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed-up in order to elucidate as completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached or the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up may therefore continue until after the subject has left the study up to  10 days after his/her discontinuation from the study for unrelated SAEs, and without timelines for related SAEs, unless the patient denies consent. 8.7. PREGNANCY IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL Women of childbearing potential are not excluded from the study as long as adequate birth control methods are being utilized. Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. Adequate birth control methods are summarized in the protocol’s exclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment in the clinical trial, female patients of childbearing potential and their partners must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during the entire course of the study treatment and for the 30 days after the study treatment period ends and of the potential risks associated with an unintentional pregnancy. During the trial (during the study treatment period and during the follow up), female patients are to be instructed to contact [CONTACT_12696]; in the same way, male patients who become aware that the partner might be pregnant, are to be instructed to contact [CONTACT_201433].  The Investigator must report every pregnancy on a pregnancy report form as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy) to  Syneos Health/Dompé Drug Safety contacts reported at Paragraph 8.4.1, even if no AE has occurred, and follow it to term.  The pregnancy form will be utilized to capture all pregnancy-related information until the birth of the child for both the patient and the partner.  If the pregnancy is associated with a SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16113]), in addition to the pregnancy report form, a separate SAE report form must be filed as described in § 8.4 with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated on the SAE report form. Miscarriage, stillbirth and any malformation/disease must be reported as a SAE. Any pregnancy leads to the immediate cessation of the study treatment.  8.8. ADVERSE EVENTS CAUSING TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION If a patient is withdrawn from the study as a consequence of an AE, this must be recorded and reasoned in the eCRF, and the patient must be followed up until the resolution of the AE or as instructed by [CONTACT_7195].

8.9. OVERDOSE  Cases of overdose (accidental or intentional) which may or may not result in serious adverse reactions are to be reported to Sponsor Drug Safety/Syneos Health by [CONTACT_71345], following the same procedure for SAE, within 24 hours from the Investigator’s knowledge of its occurrence. This includes reports related to drug intake with suicidal intentions and consequent drug overdose. Since in the preclinical toxicology studies in animals and in the multiple ascending dose study performed in healthy volunteers none of the dose has caused an overdose as documented by [CONTACT_395852], for the purpose of this study we define that the administration of more than 3 times the total daily dose on any given treatment day will be reported as an overdose, even if not associated with adverse reactions. The Investigator shall provide in the SAE form information about symptoms, corrective treatment and outcome of overdose. Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lock and de-masking. Final statistical analysis on the study variables will be presented in detail in the SAP.  9.1. SAMPLE SIZE In order to evaluate the minimal effective daily dose of rhNGF eye drops, a Williams design has been chosen [15; 16]. For this study three treatment groups has been considered: rhNGF eye drops solution 20 µg/ml TID; rhNGF  eye drops solution 20 µg/ml BID plus vehicle eye drop solution SID; vehicle eye drop solution TID. To this purpose, the sample size has been determined applying the formula eported in the publication Chow et al., 2008 at page 301 [17].   The sample size calculation for the primary variable is based on the following assumptions:   The probability level (α) for one-sided test is set at 0.025 (see table 12.1.2 at page 298 in Chow et al., 2008) and the power level at approximately 90%.   DELTA, in change from baseline between treatments, of 5.[ADDRESS_497698] Deviation for DELTA of 10.78. Both DELTA parameters are derived from results of co-variance analysis obtained from study NGF0216 in the subset of hyposecretive patients (i.e. excluding “evaporative-only” patients).  According to this calculation, 87 patients per treatment group (for a total of 261 patients) are adequate to observe the planned difference assumed for the minimum effective daily dose. Assuming a drop-out of ⁓15%, a total of [ADDRESS_497699] 60 subjects with documented diagnosis of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome within the planned [ADDRESS_497700] on the initial study assumptions (Standard Deviation of 10.78 and DELTA of 5.3 mm) because the patients could have been enrolled based on the previous criteria on which sample size was based. Moreover, a similar prevalence of patients with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome has already been reported in the NGF0216 medical history (⁓25% of patient the FAS population).  Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

Randomized Population  The Randomized Population will consist of all patients in the Screened Population who were assigned a randomization number.  9.3. COMPLIANCE WITH IMP ADMINISTRATION The assessment of patients’ compliance to the IMP will be made by [CONTACT_395853] 1 Visit 1 baseline and the number of unused study medication vials returned at Week 4 Visit 3 End of treatment. The percentage Compliance will be evaluated according to the following formula: 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞=𝟏𝟎𝟎∗(Number of vials dispensed – Number of unused vials returned)𝟑∗(𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒅𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒐𝒏 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕)  𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐲𝐞=𝟏𝟎𝟎∗(Number of  drops administered to the eligible eye)𝟑∗(𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒅𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒐𝒏 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕)  Gross non compliance will be defined as compliance lower than 80% or greater than 120% and in case of gross non compliance the patient will be excluded from the Per Protocol. Since this definition does not warrant that the study eye treatment is compliant, if indicated the SAP will contain further definitions based upon the diary card information.

 Version No. 2.0 – Final 08/AUG/[ADDRESS_497709] to mutual agreement between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_243894]é farmaceutici s.p.a. The Sponsor agrees that the study results (including negative and inconclusive as well as positive results) can be made publicly available by [CONTACT_317919]; presenting results at scientific congresses; and posting information and results on internet-based public registers and databases. In any case, study results will be communicated in full to the FDA by [CONTACT_58251] a complete Clinical Study Report. As the Sponsor agrees that the study results can be published by [CONTACT_737](s), the Investigator agrees to submit any manuscript (abstract, publication, paper etc.) to the Sponsor before any public disclosure. This will be done in order to ensure that clinical trial results are reported in an objective, accurate and balanced manner. The Sponsor reviews proposed manuscripts prior to submission within a reasonable period of time (30-90 business days in relation with the complexity of the work). The Investigator(s) will also be provided by [CONTACT_395857], tables, figures etc undertaken for the purposes of the article, in order to take responsibility for the content of the publication(s). On an exceptional basis, the Sponsor may temporarily delay registration of certain data elements (e.g. compound, name, outcome, measures etc.) to seek necessary intellectual property protection. This is because early disclosure of such a data could, in some circumstances, prevent or negatively impact patentability.  Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.

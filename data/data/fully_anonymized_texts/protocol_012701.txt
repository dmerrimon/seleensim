1.0 Research Design  
 
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims  
 A. Objectives   
The objective of this study is to compare surgeons’ discernment of 4 balloons filled with differe nt materials when using their eyes and hands versus using the da Vinci 
robot. 
 
B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s) :  
We believe that so called “visual haptics” derived from the high definition 3D optics 
associated with robotic surgery will allow for non- inferior object discernment 
compared to actual haptics of touching objects with surgeons’ hands.  
 
1.2 Research Significance (Briefly describe the following in 500 words or less)    
Robotic surgery has emerged as a transformative technology in the field of medic ine, 
revolutionizing surgical procedures across various specialties. The integration of advanced 
robotic systems, such as the da Vinci Surgical Systems, has provided surgeons with enhanced 
precision, improved dexterity, and greater visualization during com plex surgical interventions. 
These advancements have been realized despi[INVESTIGATOR_817959].   
Robotic -assisted surgery is typi[INVESTIGATOR_817960] (ports) which are then connected to the robotic arms.  The robotic arms hold 
the specialized robotic instruments and the high -definition 3D camera.  After setting everything 
up, the surgeon sits at a console near the operating table and views t he magnified, high-
resolution 3D image of the surgical site. The surgeon's fingers are inserted into master controls 
on the console, which are designed to mimic the movements of the surgeon's hands. Figure [ADDRESS_1132792] widely used robotic system – th e da Vinci System (Intuitive Surgical, 
Sunnyvale CA)  versus traditional laparoscopy.  
Haptic feedback (i.e. the sense of touch) helps surgeons perceive the texture, resistance and 
consistency of various tissues and structures. This information helps surgeo ns maintain the 
optimal force during tissue manipulation. Ever since the first use of the da Vinci system in 1999, 
critics have bemoaned the lack of haptics as the Achilles heel of robotic surgery.   
 
Culligan  Comparison of surgeons’ haptics with and without robotics   v1 06.24.23  However, experienced robotic surgeons often report that they develop the sense of  “visual 
haptics” that allows them to discern various properties of different tissue types as though they 
could actually feel them simply through a combination of manipulation and visualization.   
To date, no studies have compared surgeons’ ability to discern the nature of objects with their 
hands to robotic surgeons’ ability to discern them while using only the robotic technology.  
 
1.3 Research Design and Methods  
 
A. Research Procedures    
This will be a non- randomized parallel group study in which a group of surgeons 
(Group A) will make determinations as to the material within each of four visually identical balloons that contain air, water, petroleum jelly or a firm substance similar to the consistency of a non- ripe banana (Figure 2)  using their hands and eyes while 
another group of experienced robotic surgeons (Group B) will do so using the da Vinci Xi System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA).  Only Board -certified surgeons 
will be recruited for the study. The study information wil l be obtained at Valley 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817961], Georgia.  
Surgeon demographics will be recorded on Case Report Form #1  
Before making their “hands on” determinations as to balloon contents, each surgeon 
will be aske d to first determine whether they can visually determine the balloon 
contents without any manipulation.  For the purposes of outcome measurement, only two possible outcomes will be considered – namely that the [ADDRESS_1132793] each “guess” for all surgeons in order to report 
any trends of mis -assortment that may occur.  
 
B. Duration for Study and Each Subject    
Each study participant will spend about [ADDRESS_1132794]. Patrick Culligan  
 
1.3 Preliminary Data  
Our balloon model was informally deemed plausible by [CONTACT_817965]. 
(Figure 1)  
 
 
   
 
 
 
Culligan  Comparison of surgeons’ haptics with and without robotics   v1 06.24.23  1.4 Sample Size Justific ation   
The probability of ordering all balloons correctly by [CONTACT_817966] 1/24 or .0417.  
The expectation is that group A will achieve 100% success.  If so, we will require 35 surgeons 
in Group A and 18 surgeons in Group B  to achieve 80% power to make the det ermination that 
Group B was (or was not) “non- inferior” at discerning balloons (alpha = 0.05).  
1.6 Study Variables  
 
A. Independent Variables, Interventions, or Predictor Variables   
  
Primary outcome: (y/n) whether balloons were sorted correctly  
 Secondary o utcome: Trends for any mis -assignments of balloons  
 
De-identified surgeon demographics will be compared between groups  
  
1.7 Data Collection  
 
A. Primary  Data Collection  
 
 Location : The Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817962]. (  
Permission  to conduct study at the Intuitive Surgical site  obtained from Myriam 
Curet, MD , Intuitive Surgical CMO.   
 Process of Data Collection :  Case Report Forms (see attached) will be filled out and 
collected by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Culligan   
 Timing and Frequency : One t ime only per surgeon.  Data collection will happen in 1 
or 2 days at the Intuitive Surgical site – dates TBD    
 Procedures for Audio/Visual Recording : N/A  
 Study Instruments : The balloon model  (Figure 2)  is made of posterboard to which 4 
balloons (Party Ci ty gold 5 inch) each containing 20 mL of material – either air, water, 
petroleum jelly, or w ater-absorbing crystals (LiquiLock, Oatey Inc) are affixed (Figure 
1)  The same model will be used for all data collection if possible, but in the event of 
balloon breakage or some other reason, identical replacement balloons may be created 
easily.  The surgeons will be allowed to manipulate the balloons with their hands (Group A) or the robotic instruments (Group B) as they see fit, but they must leave the poster board laying flat with the balloons still attached. Surgeon Demographics (de -
identified) and study data will be collected on Case Report forms 1 & 2. (Figures 3 & 4) 
 Ethnographic Studies, Interviews, Or Observation : Surgeons will be allowed to 
manipulate the  balloons as they see fit whether they are using their hands or the 
robotic instruments, but they will not be allowed to disconnect the balloons from the poster board.  The poster board must lay flat at all times.

4.4 Consent Procedures  
 
A. Consent Process  
 
 Location of Consent Process    
In lieu of signing traditional informed consent, each surgeon will be provided with a 
Study Information Sheet.  Their participation in the study will serve as implied informed consent.  
  
 Consent Discussion Duration 
5 minutes or less  
 
 Coercion or Undue Influenc e  
 N/A  
 Subject Understanding   
Their participation will imply their understanding  
 
B. Waiver or Alteration  of Consent Process  
 
 Waiver or Alteration  Details    
This study does not involve any patient care or any other risky situations.  In fact, this 
study ca rries the smallest possible risks to the study subjects.  At the same time, the 
surgeons who agree to be subjects are very busy people.  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_817964] a minimum will be critical for obtaining participation.    
 
Culligan  Comparison of surgeons’ haptics with and without robotics   v1 06.24.23   Destruction of Identifiers    
No Identifiers will be collected  (see Figure 3)  
 
 Use of Deception/Concealment    
N/A 
a. Minimal Risk Justification    
No patient care of any kind will be included in the study.  The only study activity will be manipulation of inanimate objects.  
 
b. Alternati ves   
Use of human or animal tissue is not practical, because the study design calls for uniformity of the model objects .  The materials within the balloons are similar to 
fluids that are present during surgical dissection.  
c. Subject Debriefing   
Each surgeo n will be told whether or not they ordered the balloons correctly right 
after they do so, and they will be asked to keep this information to themselves.  
 
C. Documentation of Consent  
 Documenting Consent   
N/A  
 Waiver of Documentation  of Consent (i.e., will not  obtain subject’s signature)  
Each subject will receive a Study Information Sheet  
 
 
B. Removing a Subject    
If a subject decides to cease participation we will shred their forms and choose a subsequent study subject.

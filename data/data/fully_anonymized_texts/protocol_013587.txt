Secti on 11.[ADDRESS_1022226] to the statistical design of the study:  
• Virologic endpoints assessing changes in cycle 
threshold (Ct) are now exploratory; these were 
previously planned as secondary analyses  
• Exploratory endpoints have been added to assess 
the proportion of patients with  ≥1 COVID -19-
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] /all-cause death or  ≥1 
COV ID-19-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] /emergency 
room visit/ all-cause  death  
• Exploratory endpoints assessing the cumulative 
incidence of various COVID -19-related 
medically -attended visits have been removed ; 
corresponding proportion -based endpoints have 
been  retained  
• Associated details (eg, study variables, primary 
and secondary efficacy analyses) have been 
updated to the reflect the planned statistical 
analysis  To clarify the planned

Hypothesis  
 • H0: There is no difference between patients treated with one or more dose regimens of

daily change from baseline in viral load from day 1 to day 7  
• H1: REGN10933+REGN10987 reduces time weighted average daily change from baseline  
in viral load (log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day 1 to day 7, relative to placebo  
Justification 
of Sample 
Size 
 The sample size is based on the primary virologic endpoint of the time -weighted average 
(TWA) daily change from baseline in viral load (log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day [ADDRESS_1022255] a posi tive RT -qPCR value at baseline. In the Phase 
2 portion of Study COV -2067, the mean (SD) was -0.73 (0.948) log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. For the 
primary hypothesis comparing each dose to placebo, approximately 57 patients per treatment 
group. With this sample size, the study has ~98% power to detect a difference of -0.73 log10 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL between any active treatment group and placebo. In order to enroll 400 seronegative 
patients, the study will randomize approximately 800 patients, assuming that 50% are 
seronegative.  
For comparisons between doses and regimens, the study plans to enroll [ADDRESS_1022256] 100 patients per group. For between -group comparisons, the 95% CI 
half-width between any two treatment groups with this sample size would be 0.27 log10 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. In order to enroll 700 seronegative patients, approximately 1400 patients will be 
randomized.  
Placebo IV and placebo SC arms will be pooled in the efficacy analyses of the viral load 
endpoints as the route of administration does not alter  the pharmacodynamic response of 
patients receiving placebo.  
Primary 
Efficacy 
Analysis   
The primary virologic efficacy variable is the time -weighted average change from baseline in 
viral load from day 1 to day 7, as measured by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR in NP swab samples. The primary 
analysis will be conducted in the Seronegative mFAS population.  
The analyse s will be based on the observed data with no imputation for missing data. Viral 
load values less than the lower limit of quantification of the PCR assay but with positive 
qualitative results will be set to half of lower limit of quantification of the PCR a ssay; values 
with nondetectable RNA will be set to 0 log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL if the reason for the negative value 
is not a failed test. Viral load values above the upper limit of quantification will be re -tested 
using the reflex test.  
The primary efficacy variabl e will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, ie, area under 
the curve for change from baseline at each time point from day [ADDRESS_1022257], adjusting for any irregular spacing of the timing when samples 
are taken (eg, if samples are missing).  
An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a fixed effect and 
baseline viral load and treatment by  [CONTACT_747178].  
Timing of 
Statistical 
Analy ses The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted as a first -step analysis using the first [ADDRESS_1022258] database lock.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1. Emergence of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19 
Coronaviru ses are a family of enveloped, single -stranded RNA viruses. In recent decades, two 
highly pathogenic strains of coronavirus were identified in humans: severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] (SARS -CoV) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507]  (MERS -
CoV). These viruses were found to cause severe, and sometimes fatal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (Cui, 
2019 ) (Fehr, 2015 ). 
In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in clusters of patients in Wuhan 
City, China. A novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus – severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_18960] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) – was id entified in these patients, and the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544] -
CoV -2 infection was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO, 2020 ) (Zhu, 2020 ). Millions of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022259] been confirmed 
worldwide, and the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_644500], worldwide outbreak has prompted the WHO to declare 
COVID -19 a pandemic and public health emergency of inte rnational concern.  
1.2. Clinical Outcomes in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103129] -19 
Patients with COVID -19 are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a variety of respi[INVESTIGATOR_14437], ranging 
from relatively mild symptoms to respi[INVESTIGATOR_42679] (Wu, 2020 ). Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138592], intensive care and/or supplemental oxygen intervention (eg, mechanical ventilation) is 
often required, and reported fatality rates are high.  
In a report from the Chinese Center for  Disease Control and Prevention that included 44,500 
confirmed infections, nearly 20% of patients presented with advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (14% 
with dyspnea, hypoxia, and >50% lung involvement on imaging; 5% with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
shock, or multiorg an failure) (Wu, 2020 ). Another analysis of patients with COVID -19 in China 
found that, among 1,099 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], 5% had been admitted to an intensive care unit 
(ICU), 2.3% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died. Among patients with 
advanced disease on admission (defined as pneumonia, hypoxemia, and tachypnea), these negative 
outcomes rose to 19%, 14.5%, and 8.1%, respectively (Guan, 2020 ). A report of 2634 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139096] -19 in the [LOCATION_002] identified similar clinical outcomes: 14.2% were 
admitted to an ICU, 12.2% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 21% died (Guan, 2020 ). 
Other reports have found that approximately 20% to 30% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 
and pneumonia require intensive care for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (Richardson, 2020 ). 
1.3. Outpatient Care as a Potential COVID -[ADDRESS_1022260] patients at risk of more serious illness and potentially lead to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visits, or other medically -attended visits (MAVs). These include 
age, pregnancy, as well as variety of comorbidities such as obesity and cardiovascular disease 
(Chen, 2020 ). An anti -viral therapeutic that could be administered to outpatients has the potential 
to significantly reduce COVID -19-related medically -attended visits, particularly among those with 
1 or more  baseline risk factors Currently, there is a great need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_747168] -19 disease progression.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.4. The Role of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) Protein in SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022261] of an RNA genome pac kaged in nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounded by [CONTACT_103213]. The envelope is comprised of membrane (M) protein and envelope (E) protein, 
which are involved in virus assembly, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein, which mediates entry into host cells. 
S proteins for m large trimeric projections, providing the hallmark crown -like appearance of 
coronaviruses. S protein trimers bind to a host receptor and, after priming by [CONTACT_103214], 
mediate host –virus membrane fusion (Huang, 2020 ). The S protein appears to be central to viral 
infectivity by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022262] receptor angiotensin -
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity, and in cell assays and animal models can utilize 
ACE2 as a functional receptor for host cell entry (Hoffmann, 2020 ) (Ou, 2020 ) (Walls, 2020 ). 
Blockade of host cell entry through the use of neutralizing antibodies against S protein is a viable 
mechanistic strategy shown to reduce viral infectivity of SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV (Jiang, 
2020 ). In light of the likely pi[INVESTIGATOR_361816] S protein in the pathogenesis of SARS -CoV -2 (Datta, 
2020 ), a number of efforts are underway to develop antibodies and vaccines that target the 
S protein of this novel coronavirus.  
1.5. REGN10933+REGN10987: Human Monoclonal Antibodies that 
Target SARS -CoV -2 S Protein  
Regene ron Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Regeneron) is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_747169], neutralizing 
monoclonal antibodies (mAb)s directed against the S protein of SARS -CoV -2, for the treatment 
and prevention of SARS -CoV -2 infection. REGN10933 and REGN10987 are human, IgG1 mA bs 
that bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS -CoV -2 S protein and block interaction 
with ACE2. REGN10933 and REGN10987 exhibit potent neutralization and can bind 
simultaneously to the S protein RBD. When co -administered as combination therapy,  
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment is anticipated to neutralize SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022263] multiple SARS -CoV -2 variants identified through clinica l isolates, including 
recently -emerging variants such as the D614G variant, B.1.1.7 variant (first identified in the [LOCATION_006]), 
and B.1.351 variant (first identified in South Africa) (Baum, 2020 ) (Korber, 2020 ) (Wang, 2021 ). 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy  (also referred to as casirivimab+imdevimab)  thus 
represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022264] received approvals or conditional 
authorizations  (EMA, 2021 ) (FDA, 2021 ) there remains a significant unmet medical need for 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1022265] patient populations and to bolster treatment supplies as caseloads continue 
to rise. The availability of multiple treat ment options, and the continued collection of data on 
conditionally authorized treatments, are critically important in the setting of a global pandemic.

CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
Treatment with REGN10933+REGN10987 is well tolerated and reduces SARS -CoV -2 viral load 
across multiple dose regimens compared to placebo.  
Information concerning statistical hypotheses can be found in Section  11.1. 
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
In an ongoing study in outpatients with COVID -19 (R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2067; hereafter COV -
2067), interim phase 1/2 and primary phase 2 a nalyses found that patients treated with 2400 mg or 
8000 mg of REGN10933+REGN10987 IV single dose had a greater reduction in viral load 
compared with those who received placebo. These virologic effects translated into clinical benefit, 
significantly reduci ng COVID -19-related MAVs in these patients (with MAV defined in the study 
as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit, urgent care visit, physician’s office visit, or telemedicine 
visit, with the primary reason for the visit being COVID -19). Notably, virologi c and clinical 
efficacy were similar among those treated with either [ADDRESS_1022267] already been reached at the 2400 mg dose (refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure for more information on these analyses).  
This r andomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, parallel group study ( R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -
[ZIP_CODE] ) will assess the virologic efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 at different single dose regimens in outpatients with SARS -CoV -2 
infection. The purpose of this study is to identify a lower dose regimen capable of demonstrating 
the same (or similar) virologic efficacy seen at the 2400 mg IV single dose level in outpatients 
with COVID -19. These data, taken together with data on the safet y profile of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 and any correlation between virologic and clinical efficacy at 1200 
mg, 2400 mg, and 8000 mg IV doses observed in Study COV -2067, will aid in identifying a dose 
regimen with the optimal risk -benefit profile in this patient population. Moreover, identifying 
lower doses that are capable of reducing viral load will bolster the ability to provide therapeutic 
doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 in the setting of a global pandemic, where supplies of 
therapeutic agents are increasingly li mited as caseloads rise.  
An additional aim of this study is to assess to virologic efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 given subcutaneously in outpatients with SARS -CoV -2. Currently, 
SC administration is being explored only  in the prophylaxis setting (R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2069). 
Availability of subcutaneously -administered single -dose REGN10933+REGN10987 in the 
treatment setting could potentially improve access for patients who are unable to access facilities 
capable of administe ring intravenous infusions.  
Since the primary endpoint of this study is virologic, the study will enroll patients with SARS -
CoV -[ADDRESS_1022268] of REGN10933+REGN10987 on SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022269] one or more risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_21337] -19.

CONFIDENTIAL  As of protocol amendment 1, patients will be f ollowed for safety monitoring for approximately 6 
months after study drug administration. This extended study duration will include approximately 
5 half -lives of REGN10933+REGN10987 (with a half -life of approximately 30 days) and allow 
an assessment of saf ety during the drug elimination period.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Initial phase 1 and phase 2 studies in outpatients with SARS -CoV -2 infection (Study COV -2067) 
assessed single IV dose administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 at 2400 mg (1200 mg per 
mAb)  and 8000 mg (4000 mg per mAb) . The original strategy in selecting these doses was to 
identify a target concentration in lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_747170] (ELF) that approximates the effective 
concentration required for 99% viral neutralization (EC 99)* of SARS -CoV -2 in vitro, and then 
identify doses anticipated to meet or exceed this concentration in lung ELF. Using observed EC 99 
estimates of 0.14 µg/mL (REGN10933) and 0.78 µg/mL (REGN10987), assuming drug 
concentration in lung ELF to be 0.15x that of serum (Magyarics, 2019 ), and accounting for 
uncertainties related to drug PK and mAb penetration into lung ELF, 20 µg/mL (per mAb) was 
selected as the initial target concentration in serum, and a 2400 mg dose was chosen with the 
assumption that ≥95% of patients would exceed the target concentration in serum for at least 28 
days. An 8000 mg dose also was evaluated, in the event that a higher dose was requ ired for 
efficacy.  
Data from the phase 1 and phase 2 studies confirmed that ≥95% of patients exceeded 20 µg/mL 
per mAb in serum for 28 days at the 2400 mg dose, and dose -proportional increases in exposure 
were observed at 8000 mg. Moreover, treatment with either 2400 mg or 8000 mg 
REGN10933+REGN10987 reduced viral load and led to positive trends in clinical outcomes, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_747179] -19-related MAVs at both dose levels 
(Weinreich, 2020 )(for more information, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure). Based on the flat 
dose response observed for the [ADDRESS_1022270] dose to be investigated in phase 
3 of Study COV -2067. A 1200 mg IV dose is also being investigated in that study and is expected 
to achieve approximately 50% of the concentrations observed for 2400 mg, assuming that the 
linear PK relationship between 2400 mg and 8000 mg is also observed at this lower dose.  
The purpose of the current study is to characterize the dose response relationship for 
REGN10933+REGN10987, as measured by [CONTACT_747180] -weighted viral load up to study day 
7. The mean total concentrations for the selected doses are anticipated to meet or exceed the target 
concentration in serum during this time period. Based on currently -available concentration data 
and assuming linear PK, the expected mean total drug concentrations in serum (sum of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987) on study day 7 for the selected IV doses of 300, 600, 1200, and 
2400 mg are 30.7, 61.3, 123, and 245 μg/mL, respective ly. Assuming a lung ELF -to-serum ratio 
of 0.15x, the mean total concentration of antibody is expected to exceed either EC [ADDRESS_1022271] 6 days for all IV doses selected. On Day 15, the expected mean concentrations are 21.3, 
42.6, 85.2, and 170 μg/mL, respectively.  
In addition to intravenously administered REGN10933+REGN10987, SC doses of 600 mg and 
1200 mg will also be evaluated. From study day 2 to study day 8, the expected mean total 
concentration in serum (sum of REGN10933 and REGN10987) is expected to range between 25.8 
to 52.6 μg/mL for the 600 mg SC dose and between 51.6 and 105 μg/mL for the 1200mg SC dose.

Investigator's Brochure.  
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
In Study COV -2067, virologic and clinical efficacy was observed for REGN10933+REGN10987 
in the overall population of patients that were SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022272] 1 pre -existing risk factor for severe 
COVID -19, were seronegative at baseline, or in those whose immune response was not sufficient ly 
strong to reduce viral load as evidenced by [CONTACT_747181]. Treatment with 
REGN10933+REGN10987 was able to compensate for the absent or insufficient immune response 
and was able to reduce the mean viral load and decrease the number of MAVs. O verall, these data 
provide promising evidence for the use of REGN10933+REGN10987 in outpatients with SARS -
CoV -2 infection.  
These positive efficacy results are balanced by [CONTACT_104234]. Nonclinical toxicology 
studies in nonhuman primates showed that REGN10933+REGN10987 was well -tolerated without 
adverse findings. Important identified risks, important potential risks, and other theoretical 
considerations are  described below.  
Important Identified Risks. As with other protein therapeutics, h ypersensitivity reactions, 
including acute infusion -related reactions (IV intravenous [IV] administration) or injection site 
reactions (SC subcutaneous [SC] administration), may develop immediately or within a few hours 
to days after study drug administrat ion. Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion -related 
reactions or injection site reactions, have been observed in patients who received 
REGN10988+REGN10933 during ongoing clinical trials.  
Important Potential Risks. The important potential risks of REGN10933+REGN10987 are the 
clinical consequences of immunogenicity and embryo -fetal toxicity.  
Protein therapeutics carry the potential risk of an immunogenic response in the form of ADA and 
NAb development following administration, with possible consequen ces on safety and efficacy. 
Therefore, blood samples for immunogenicity assessment will be collected during the studies.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the 
effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN109 33+REGN10987 combination therapy on the 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females are unknown. Human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and are present in breast milk; therefore, 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 co mbination therapy have the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a breastfed child . Given the high affinity and specificity of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, off -target pharmacological effects are not anticipated in either the 
mother or the fetus, and no off -target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 was observed in 
any of the human or monkey tissues evaluated ex vivo in tissue cross -reactivity studies. However, 
it is unknown whether the potential transfer of the combination of REGN [ZIP_CODE]+REGN10987 
therapy provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a breastfed child . 
There is currently limited clinical experience in the use of REGN10933, REGN10987, and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in female patients w ho are pregnant or 
                                        VV-RIM-00145951-1.0 Approved - 02 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  breastfeeding. The combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy should be used during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother 
and the fetus or breastfed child considering all ass ociated health factors. If a female patient is 
pregnant or were to become pregnant while receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 combination, 
the pregnancy should be followed until outcome and any safety issue observed get reported.  
Other Theoretical Considerations . Theoretical risks of administration of the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination include interference with the patient’s endogenous 
immune response to either SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022273] COVID -19. In this study, 
risk mitigation includes exclusio n criteria for certain vaccination scenarios (refer to Section  7.2.2 ). 
A reference to current CDC guidance is provided ( Section  8.10.1 ) to aid investigators on 
appropriate management of COVID -19 vaccination.  
Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed for some therapeutic s targeting 
exogen ous viral proteins. For antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], ADE is thought to occur when binding of 
antibody to the target viral protein enhances FcγR -mediated host cell entry of the virus (Iwasaki, 
2020 ). This could potentially lead to worsening of disease and, in the case of SARS, acute lung 
injury (Liu, 2019 ). REGN10933 and REGN10987 retain the Fc region, as this may play a role in 
protecting against viral infection (Yasui, 2014 ), there is no strong evidence of ADE in other 
coronavirus models (Kam, 2007 ) (Liu, 2019 ) (Luo, 2018 ). To date, Fc -containing mAbs developed 
by [CONTACT_103224] -CoV have demonstrated specificity to their exog enous 
targets with no significant unexpected safety findings in preclinical or clinical studies. All patients 
will have follow -up assessments up to day 169 (end of study; EOS). In addition, any SAEs reported 
after EOS will be recorded.  
Summary. Overall, th e anticipated benefit of REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in 
treatment of infection with SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022274] of clinical tri als.

6.1. Study Description and Duration  
Note: as of protocol amendment 2, study enrollment is closed.  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study to assess the dose 
response profile of single IV or single SC doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 in outpatients with 
SARS -CoV -2 infecti on. The schedule of events is provided in Table  1, and the study design is 
provided in Figure  1. 
Eligible patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 or 
placebo by [CONTACT_747177] (refer to Section  8.6 for more information on treatment allocation).  On 
the day of dosing, patients will have NP swabs taken for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022276] -dose blood collection (either at the end of intravenous 
infusion or at least 1 hour after subcutaneous administration). Patients will be monitored for at 
least 1 hour after study drug administration and then released from the study site, if medically 
appropriate.  
Subsequent assessments and sample collections may potentially occur through a variety of in -
person and remote methods. This may include (but is not limited to ) visits at the study site or place 
of infusion, home -based visits (defined as visits by [CONTACT_747183], at mobile units, and/or testing 
centers), or by [CONTACT_648]/telemedicine. Throughout the study, biological samples will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_747184] y at study locations where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) 
can be used.  
Information related to safety and COVID -19-related  medically -attended visits will be recorded 
during planned study visits. Patients will also be asked to notify study p ersonnel as soon as possible 
about any medically -attended visits. Note that the TEAEs (as defined in Section  10.1.1 ) that will 
be collected during th e study will differ according to different periods of the study schedule 
(Table  1). Refer to Section  10.1.1  for more information on reporting of TEAEs and treatment -

CONFIDENTIAL  The investig ator and/or Sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a p atient does not or cannot follow 
study procedures). An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patient who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked  to complete an early 
termination visit and follow up contact, as described in Section  9.1.2 . 
7.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patient prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced.

form for active and placebo treatments, so that they rem ain indistinguishable to both study 
personnel and patients.  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel (with the exception of the 
unblinded pharmacist at each site) will remain blinded to all randomization assignments 
throughout  the study. The Regeneron medical/study director, study monitor, and any other 
Regeneron and contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact [CONTACT_747186] p hases of the 
study.  
Selected individuals from the Sponsor not involved in the conduct of the study may have access 
to unblinded data as needed for safety review or other data review. Any team performing interim 
data reviews will be separate from the ongoi ng study team. No study personnel involved in the 
day-to-day conduct of the study will have access to any unblinded data before the database is 
locked for this study.  
Drug concentration, virology, and other biomarker results will not be communicated to the sites, 
and the Sponsor’s blinded operational team will not have access to results associated with patient 
identification until after the database is locked.  
8.8. Emergency  Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event and when a treatment decision is contingent on knowing the 
patient's treatment assignment.  
If unblinding  is requ ired: 
• Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment  
• Only the affected patients will be unblinded  
• Unblinding is performed using the IWRS, which will notify the Sponsor. The 
designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the st udy site will provide the treatment 
assignment to the investigator. If the study pharmacist(s)/designee is not available, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient  
• If the IWRS is unavailable, the investigator will ask the unblinded study 
pharmacist(s)/designee to perform manual unblinding. All manual unblinding 
procedure will be adequately documented, including the reason why the IWRS was not 
used 
• The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the p atient  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency and when a treatment decision is contingen t on knowing the patient's treatment

companies) responsible for study drug packaging. In o rder to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
The unblinded pharmacist will prepare the unblinded investigational product and dispense it in a 
blinded manner to the blinded study staff for administ ration to the patient.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC. Storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.9.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the  investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study. At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by [CONTACT_747187], all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed at the site with approval 
by [CONTACT_103238].  
8.9.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to accoun t for all opened and unopened study drug. These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication:  
• Dispensed to each patient  
• Returned from each patient (if applicable), and  
• Disposed of at the site or returned to the Sponsor or designee.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by [CONTACT_103239]; photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_103162].

CONFIDENTIAL  Safety Information in Newborns of Study Participants. The incidence and outcome of any 
SARS -CoV -2 infection will be collected for newborn infants of patients who were treated in the 
study and were pregnant at randomization or became pregnant at any time in the study. Note that 
this information is in addition to outcome reporting of all pregnancies ( Section  10.1.3 ). 
9.2.6.  Pregnancy Test for Women of Childbearing Potential  
Pregnancy testing may be satisfied by [CONTACT_103244] β -HCG.  Pregnancy 
tests are a requireme nt for WOCBP only and should be completed regardless of pregnancy status . 
Pregnancy test will be performed at the local laboratory.  
For WOCBP who have symptoms of COVID -19 at screening (see Section  7.2.1 ), negative 
pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to study drug administration. WOCBP who are 
asymptomatic at screening may receive study drug regardless of pregnancy status.  
WOCBP are defined as female s who are fertile following menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postme nopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months 
of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence  of a 
postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing is not required for women with documented hysterectomy or 
tubal ligation.  
Information about pregnancy will be recorded a s described in Section  10.1.3 . 
9.2.7.  Laboratory Testing  
Hematology and blood chemistry will be analyzed by a  central laboratory. Detailed instructions 
are provided in the laboratory manual.  
Blood Chemistry  
Tests will include:  
Sodium  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  Alkaline phosphatase   
Potassium  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  Creatinine  
Chloride  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)  
Carbon dioxide  Total bilirubin  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  
Glucose  Albumin    
Hematology

the nature and degree of the abnormality. When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated. If the abnormality fails to resolve or c annot be explained by [CONTACT_25037], the Medical/Study Director must 
be consulted.  
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under study, 
must be d etermined by [CONTACT_093].  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values are provided in Section  10.1.1 . 
9.2.8.  Drug Concentration Measurements and Samples  
Samples for assessment of drug concentration will be collected at the time points indicated in the 
schedule of events. For information concerning unused samples and exploratory research, refer to 
Section  9.2.9 . 
9.2.9.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Samples for immunogenicity assessment will be collected at the time points listed in the schedule 
of events . 
9.2.10.  Exploratory Pharmacodynamic/Biomarker Anal yses 
This section describes planned exploratory analyses, some of which may not be reported in the 
CSR.  
Note that any biological samples collected during the study which are not used for their planned 
purpose, or for which material remains after their plan ned analysis, may be used for assessment of 
immunogenicity if necessary.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Virology  
Viral Sequencing  
In support of public health initiatives to track SARS -CoV -2 genetic variants, as well as to monitor 
for possible viral resistance, viral genome sequencing may be perform ed on viral nucleic acid 
isolated from nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, and/or saliva samples, at baseline and in cases of 
a positive RT -qPCR result. Sequencing analyses will consist of the entire viral genome, including 
the full gene sequence that encodes  the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022299] -treatment samples to assess the emergence of 
sequence variants and to understand the potential relationship between genetic mutations and mAb 
functional activity. Viral sequencing may als o be done on placebo controls to determine whether 
any genetic mutations observed in the mAb treatment group are naturally emergent genetic 
variants.   
Viral variants suspected to confer decreased susceptibility to REGN10933 and/or REGN10987 
will be evaluated in nonclinical work separate from this protocol.  
The results of the viral sequencing may not be included in the clinical study report.

CONFIDENTIAL  Viral Infectivity  
To explore the effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on infectivity of SARS -CoV -2, we may use 
PFU, v iral culture or viral subgenomic mRNA RT -qPCR assays. In vitro SARS -CoV -2 infectivity 
of cultured cells may be explored using NP samples. Infectivity of cells grown in culture may be 
assessed by [CONTACT_103245]/or immunofluorescence assays. We may also use sub-genomic viral 
mRNA transcript assays, such as RT -qPCR or subgenomic mRNA sequencing, or other measures 
of in vivo infectivity potential. Viral sub -genomic mRNA is transcribed only in infected cells and 
is not packaged into virions, and therefore may be  an indicator of actively -infected cells. These 
data may be associated with RT -qPCR measuring viral load.  
The results of the viral infectivity assays may not be included in the clinical study report.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serological Immunoassays for Anti -SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1022300] SARS -CoV -2 on the response to 
REGN10933+REGN10987, serological immunoassays will be used to detect antibodies at 
baseline against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein and/or N  protein. Neutralization assays m ay also be 
used to evaluate the function of endogenous baseline anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibodies. Associations 
will be evaluated with virology and other clinical outcomes.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  COVID -19-Related Medically -Attended Visit Details  
A COVID -19-related medically -attended v isit will be defined as follows: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER visit, 
urgent care visit, physician’s office visit, or telemedicine visit, with the primary reason for the visit 
being COVID -19.  
Medically -attended visits related to COVID -19, as determined by [CONTACT_8647], will be recorded 
in the eCRF. During each indicated collection visit (refer to Table  1), all previously unrecorded 
COVID -19-related medically -attended visits and details will be recorded, beginning from the day 
of dosing up to and including the day of collection.  
Details will include at minimum:

10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
In this study, the following  TEAEs will be recorded:  
• Treatment -emergent AEs, up to day 29  
• Treatment -emergent AESIs (Section  10.1.3 ) as follows:  
− Grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions, up to day 4  
− Grade ≥3 injection -site reactions, up to day 4  
− Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions, up to day 29  
− Any TEAE that led to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747167], regardless of 
whether the visit is related to COVID -19, up to day 169  
• Treatment -emergent AEs (grade 3 or 4 only), from day 30 to day 169  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs, up to day [ADDRESS_1022301] the above TEAEs occurring during the observation period 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Note that the length of this period differs in ea ch study phase, owing to 
different final study visit days. Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the 
signing of the informed consent will be recorded as part of medical history. Abnormal laboratory 
values and vital signs observed at th e time of informed consent should also be recorded as medical 
history. Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug 
should also be recorded as TEAE, provided that it fulfills the above criteria.  
Throughout the study, the investigator will determine whether any TEAEs occurred by [CONTACT_747189]. These events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_941] p atient, or by 
[CONTACT_31597]. Patients should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The investigator must assess all TEAEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causalit y, in accordance with the definitions in Section  10.2. 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation wit h 
the investigator’s signature. The investigator should follow up on TEAEs until they have resolved 
or are considered clinically stable.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the primary 
sign or symptom as the AE term with additional details included in the narrative until the diagnosis 
becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a common diagnosis, 
report them as individual entries.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other di agnostic results or findings should be appraised by [CONTACT_25042]. Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign 
findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported  as 
AEs if they are symptomatic, require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the investigator’s 
clinical judgement. For events that are serious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181224], the reason must

CONFIDENTIAL  be reported as the serious adverse event (diagnosis  or symptom requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). A 
procedure is not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. Pre -
planned (prior to signing the informed consent form [ICF]) procedures, treatments requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for 
palliative or social care should not be reported as SAEs  (see Section  10.2 for definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of study) that the investigator 
assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All treatment -emergent SAEs , AESIs, and pregnancies are to be reported according to the 
procedures in Section  10.1.[ADDRESS_1022302] be reported with investigator’s 
assessment of the event’s seriousness, severity, and causa lity to the blinded study drug. A detailed 
narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome 
should be provided on the AE eCRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and 
resolution should be in cluded, when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and 
laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal 
events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed and in clude the 
results if available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented 
in a follow -up report. Source documents (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884], diagnostic reports, 
etc) will be summarized in the narrative on t he AE eCRF and retained at the study center and 
available upon request.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up. 
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
• Treatment -emergent  SAEs . 
• Treatment -emergent AESI (serious and nonserious), defined as :  
− Grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions  
− Grade ≥3 injection -site reactions  
− Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions  
− Any TEAE that led to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747167], regardless of 
whether the visit is relate d to COVID -19 
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the Sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female  study patient duri ng the study or existing at the 
                                        VV-RIM-00145951-1.0 Approved - 02 Mar 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1022303] be 
completed for each patient who becomes pregnant or is pregnant at the signing of 
consent.  
Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient and/or fetus and/or 
newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome for all 
pregnancies should be reported to the Sponsor , including testing results for SARS -
CoV -[ADDRESS_1022304] a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Seriou s Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an adverse event that had occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (admission after discharge) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
(any duration) or an emergency room visit for longer than 24  hours. Prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l stay that is longer than was originally 
anticipated for the event or is prolonged due to the development of a new adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_31598].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substanti al disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardi ze the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events (refer to Section  10.1.1  
Section  10.1.2 ).

An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the Sponsor’s 
product  or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_103250]. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  
Adverse events of special  interest for t his study are defined in Section  10.1.3 . 
10.2.4.  Infusion -Related Reactions, Injection -Site Reactions, and Hypersensitivity 
Reactions  
Infusion -related reacti ons are defined as any relevant adverse event  that occurs during intravenous  
infusion or up to day 4.  
Injection -site reactions are defined as any relevant adverse event that occurs during subcutaneous 
injection  or up to day 4.  
Hypersensitivity reactions are defined as any relevant adverse event that occurs during intravenous 
infusion or subcutaneous injection or up to study day 29.  
10.2.5.  Severity  
The severity of adverse events (including test findings classified as adverse events) will be graded 
using the curre nt version of the NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  
Treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, or AESIs not listed in the NCI -CTCAE will be graded according 
to the scale in Table  2. The grading systems for anaphylaxis, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity),

10.3. Safety Monitor ing 
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor in a timely f ashion. The Sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] 
(eg, Global Patient Safety ; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be 
performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative 
aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board and 
Investigators  
During th e study, the Sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, Institutional Review 
Board (IRBs), and the participating investigators of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs (Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions) occurring in other study centers or other studies of t he active study drug, as 
appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the Sponsor and/or CRO will comply 
with any additional local safety reporting requirements. All notifications to investigators will 
contain only blinded information.   
Upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of a S[LOCATION_003]R that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the IRB unless delegated to the Sponsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug is assessed against the Reference Safety Information section of 
the Investigator’s Brochure that is effective for expedited safety reporting.  
At the completion of the study, the Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and IRB as ap propriate.

CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section summarizes the statistical analyses for this study and provides the basis for the 
statistical analysis  plan (SAP) for the  study.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The statistical hypothesis for the primary virologic efficacy endpoint  is: 
• H0: There is no difference between patients treated with one or more dose regimens of 
REGN1 0933+REGN10987 and patients treated with placebo in time weighted 
average daily change from baseline in viral load from day 1 to day 7  
• H1: REGN10933+REGN10987 reduces time weighted average daily change from 
baseline in viral load (log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day  1 to day 7, relative to placebo  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The sample size is based on the primary virologic endpoint of the time -weighted average (TWA) 
daily change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day [ADDRESS_1022308] a positive RT -qPCR value at baseline. In the Phase 2 p ortion of Study 
COV -2067, the mean (SD) was -0.73 (0.948) log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL ( see the Investigator's Brochure). 
For the primary hypothesis comparing each dose to placebo, approxim ately 57 patients per 
treatment group. With this sample size, the study has ~98% power to detect a difference of -0.73 
log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  between any active  treatment group  and placebo . In order to enroll 400 
seronegative patients, the study will randomize approximately 800 patients, assuming that 50% 
are seronegative.  
For comparisons between doses and regimens, the study plans to enroll [ADDRESS_1022309] 100 p atients per group. For between -group comparisons, the 95% CI half -width  
between any two treatment groups  with this sample size would be 0.27 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. In order 
to enroll 700 seronegative patients, approximately 1400 patients will be randomized.  
Placebo IV and placebo SC arms will be pooled in the efficacy analyses of the viral load endpoints 
as the route of administration does not alter the pharmacodynamic response of patients receiving 
placebo . 
11.3. Analysis Sets  
11.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS].  The Seronegative Modified Full Analysis Set  
The Overall modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS)  includes all randomized patients with a positive 
central -lab determined SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result from NP swab samples at randomization 
and is based on the treatment received (as tre ated) . If a pre -treatment qualitative test is missing, 
then a qualitative  test that is within post -treatment plus 2 hours may be used.  
The Seronegative mFAS  is the subset of patients in the mFAS population who are seronegative 
at baseline. The Seronegative mFAS will be used for all efficacy and pharmacodynamic analyses.

CONFIDENTIAL  The Seronegative mFAS is the primary analysis population; secondary analyses will be condu cted 
in the Overall mFAS population.  
Note that since the primary objective of this study is to estimate the dose - and exposure -response 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 in reducing viral load, patients are included in the treatment actually 
received, not as randomi zed.  
In the Seronegative mFAS and mFAS population s, the placebo IV and placebo  SC arms will be 
pooled for all analyses of virologic endpoints. Active dose groups will not be pooled.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) includes all randomized pati ents who receive treatment with positive 
central -lab determined SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result from NP swab samples at randomization 
and is based on the treatment received (as treated).  
The PPS further excludes patients (1) who do not receive the full dose, (2 ) receive convalescent 
plasma therapy or SARS -CoV -2 antivirals, and (3) receive COVID -19 vaccination on or prior to 
the day 7 visit. Like the mFAS, the placebo IV and placebo  SC arms will be pooled.  Active dose 
groups will not be pooled.  If all the patients in the mFAS are fully dose d and there are no 
applicable protocol deviations regarding (2) and (3), the PPS is the Overall mFAS.  
11.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized patients who received any study d rug; it is 
based on the treatment received (as treated). Determination of “as treated” will be based on the 
actual study drug received on day 1. Demographic and baseline characteristics, treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables  will be analyzed using the SAF.  
In the SAF population, the placebo arms for the IV and SC routes of administration will be 
summarized separately.  
11.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The PK Analysis  Set (PKAS) includes all randomized patients who received any stu dy drug (SAF) 
and who ha ve at least 1 non -missing drug concentration measurement following study drug 
administration . Patients will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received.  
11.3.4.  Immunogenicity Analysis Sets  
The immunogenicity analysis set for a potential interim analysis is dependent on assay availability.  
The ADA Analysis Set  (AAS)  includes all treated patients who received any study drug and have 
at least [ADDRESS_1022310] dose of the study drug.  
The NAb Analysis Set (NAS) includes all patients who received any study drug and who are 
negative in the ADA Assay or with at least one non -missing result in the NAb assay after first dose 
of the study drug. Patients who are ADA negative are set to negative in the NAb Analysis Set.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received.

11.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570], 
and by [CONTACT_25048].  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary  Efficacy Analysis  
The primary virologic efficacy variable is the time -weighted average change from baseline in viral 
load from day 1 to day 7, as measured by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR in NP swab samples. The primary analysis 
will be conducted in the Seronegative mFAS popul ation.  
The analyses will be based on the observed data with no imputation for missing data. Viral load 
values less than the lower limit of quantification of the PCR assay but with positive qualitative 
results will be set to half of lower limit of quantifi cation of the PCR assay; values with 
nondetectable RNA will be set to 0 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL if the reason for the negative value is not a 
failed test. Viral load values above the upper limit of quantification will be re -tested using the 
reflex test.  
The prima ry efficacy variable will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, ie, area under the 
curve for change from baseline at each time point from day [ADDRESS_1022311] observation. The TWA esti mates the average over the 
                                        VV-RIM-00145951-1.0 Approved - 02 Mar 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1022312], adjusting for any irregular spacing of the timing when samples are taken 
(eg, if samples are missing).  
An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline 
viral lo ad and treatment  by [CONTACT_747192] . 
In addition, the least squares mean estimates for the TWA mean change from baseline in viral load 
will be presented  for each treatment group, as well as  for the difference between each 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment group and placebo as well as between active treatment  
groups. p-Values will be presented comparing the active arms to placebo. 95% confidence intervals 
will be reported between the active doses . Accompanying descriptive analyses will be provided at 
the individual time  points used to calculate the TWA.  To explore the dose response, other modeling 
approaches such as E max will be described in the SAP.  
For efficacy analys es, the placebo IV and placebo SC arms are pooled.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
A mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) will assess the time course of treatment 
effect in viral load, the change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) at each visit for both 
the Seronegative mFAS and the Overall mFAS. There will be terms for baseline, treatment, visit, 
treatment -by-baseline interaction, baseline -by-visit interaction, and treatment -by [CONTACT_23259]. 
Within -patient errors w ill be modeled with an unstructured, heterogeneous autoregressive (1), or 
compound symmetry covariance matrix in that order if a model does not converge. The least 
squares means estimates for the mean at each visit and mean change from baseline to each vis it as 
well as the difference of these estimates between each anti -spi[INVESTIGATOR_747173], p -value, and associated 95% 
confidence interval.  
In the Seronegative mFAS, the proportion o f patients who have PCR below the limit of detection 
(LOD), below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), or have qPCR levels >10 ^4, >10 ^5, 
>10^6, or >10 ^7 will be tabulated over time. The numbers of patients in each category will be 
tested using Fisher’ s Exact test. Corresponding p -values and confidence intervals will be 
presented.  
Analyses of the virologic endpoints with in the Overall mFAS population will also be performed 
in subsets defined by [CONTACT_747193] (>104 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, >105 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, > 106 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, 
>107 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL). The TWA, the time course of change, and other virologic endpoints will be 
summarized and/or analyzed within each of these categories.  
11.4.4.  Control of Multiplicity  
The overall type I error rate will be controlled for the primary hypothesis at the two -sided 0.05 
level by [CONTACT_2224] a step -down testing approach, starting at the top dose  (Table  4). Each test 
compares a specific treatment group to pooled placebo.  The highest dose will be tested first; if 
significant, the second highest dose will be tested; and so on. No multiplicity adjustments will be 
made for secondary endpoints, nor for comparison s between active doses.

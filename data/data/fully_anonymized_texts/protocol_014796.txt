dilution of INFLUENZA G1 mHA according to IPPI; 0.8 mL (extractable volume)
For each participant, every injection will be 1.0 mL in volume. Instructions on study vaccine preparation
(eg, dilution in formulation buffer) into the final dose that participants receive within each treatment group
are outlined in detail in the IPPI.
Preferably the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant upper arm is used to administer the injection. If an
injection cannot be given in either deltoid for the second dose of the vaccination due to a medical or other
contraindication (for example, tattooed upper arms rendering it difficult to assess site reactogenicity), use
alternative locations such as the hip, thigh, or buttocks (to be avoided in overweight participants). In this
case, IM injections in other locations than the upper arm for the second dose of the vaccination are not
considered protocol deviations.
An unblinded pharmacist, or other qualified staff member at the site with primary responsibility for study
vaccine preparation, who will not participate in any other study evaluation, will prepare the appropriate vial
and syringe, labeled with the participant’s identification number, and provide the blinded syringe to the
blinded vaccine administrator who will perform the injection.
IMMUNOGENICITY  EVALUATIONS
Immunogenicity assessments may include, but are not limited to, the humoral immunogenicity assays (as
available and applicable) summarized in the below Table.
Blood for humoral immune responses will be drawn from all participants. Influenza immunity in study
participants will be determined on baseline (Day 1) and post-vaccination blood samples as described in
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities. Both assay variability and pre-existing immunity will be taken into
consideration in the immunogenicity assessments. PaxGene samples will allow the performance of whole
blood transcript profiling. Nasosorption samples (using SAM)will be used for the development of mucosal
influenza-specific IgG and/or IgA ELISAs and the assessment of those responses in nasal secretion.
In addition to RT-PCR based diagnosis of influenza virus infection performed on nasal swab samples
(collected when ILI symptoms develop during the influenza season), blood samples collected at baseline,
between 2 and 4 days after symptom onset (ILI Days 3-5), and at 28 days after symptom onset (ILI Day 29)
from participants with a suspected ILI will also be assayed by [CONTACT_44898] (including but not limited to
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay as available and applicable) for influenza virus exposure
confirmation. Additionally, the nasal swab samples might be used to determine the presence of other

ILI Procedures
For the duration of the influenza season, participants will be followed-up to identify potential cases of
influenza virus infection. During the influenza season, participants should record any signs and symptoms
of ILI (such as cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feeling feverish, body aches and pains,
fatigue, or neck pain), including measurementofbody temperature, on a daily basis until symptoms have
resolved using a specific Flu-iiQTMquestionnaire and an ILI form.
If ILI symptoms develop during the influenza season, the following should take place:
 Participants should contact [CONTACT_160172].
 Participants should record signs and symptoms of the ILI daily using the Flu-iiQTMquestionnaire from
onset of symptoms until the day of symptom resolution, and record body temperature daily using an
ILI form provided by [CONTACT_160173].
 Participants should take a nasal sample at home on the day of symptom onset or the day thereafter (ILI
Days 1-2). The sample should be stored refrigerated and brought to the site by [CONTACT_78772]
4 days (preferably) after collection.
 Participants should go to their study site, ideally between 2 and 4 days after symptom onset (ILI Days
3-5), where
 the completed Flu-iiQTMquestionnaire and ILI form will be collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_6624];
 the participant nasal self-swab sample (taken on ILI Days 1-2) will be collected;
 an additional nasal swab will be taken by a qualified member of the site staff;
 the presence of influenza virus infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_160174]-PCR
diagnostics and/or rapid-PCR detection (eg, by [CONTACT_160175]®) on the nasal swab samples
mentioned above;
 a blood sample for seroconfirmation of influenza virus infection will be taken by a qualified
member of the site staff;
 and vital signs, including body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_160123], will be measured by a qualified member of the site staff. A clinical assessment,
including a targeted physical examination, will be completed by [CONTACT_11389], preferably by
a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or equivalent.

 For all medically attended ILIs, including those resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], additional information on
any other diagnostics (eg, chest x-rays, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], pulmonary function tests) or interventions during
the clinical course of ILI will be collected.
During the influenza season, participants will be contact[CONTACT_160176] 14±3 days (unless a planned visit has occurred or will occur within 14 days). These
calls will remind participants to complete the Flu-iiQTM  questionnaire and ILI form in the event of any
symptoms of ILI, and to contact [CONTACT_160177] a nasal sample at the time of symptom onset. These
calls will also check for any SAEs, and associated concomitant medications since the previous visit or
telephone contact.
The presence of influenza virus will be assessed by [CONTACT_160178]-PCR diagnostics on the nasal swab samples,
which may include viral load and influenza subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. In addition, blood samples from participants with a
suspected ILI will also be assayed by [CONTACT_160179] (including but not limited to HAI assay as
available and applicable) for influenza virus exposure confirmation. The blood samples may additionally
be used to evaluate immune responses during the ILI.
Every effort should be made to collect data on the clinical course of ILIs including information on
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],oxygenation status,supplemental oxygen requirements and specific drug treatments, as well
as other concurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_160125].
For participants who experience symptoms suggesting ILI, RT-PCR assay of the nasal swabs taken after
symptom onset will be used to determine whether the infection was caused by [CONTACT_160180]. For
participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160126], confirmation of influenza virus infection using RT-PCR
may be performed at the local (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) laboratory.
Any ILI and complications related to ILIs will be reported as an AE if it occurs between the time of any
vaccination through the following [ADDRESS_185834] symptoms of the
following AEs via the participant diary:
 Solicited injection site AEs: erythema (measured using the ruler supplied), swelling (measured using
the ruler supplied), and pain/tenderness.

Oral temperature should be measured at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the evening,
using the thermometer supplied. Temperature 7 days after each vaccination may be collected earlier on the
Day 8 or Day 64 to coincide with the clinic visit.
Adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, that are related to study
procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from the time a
signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early withdrawal.
Solicited AEs, collected through a diary, will be recorded for each vaccination from the moment of
vaccination until [ADDRESS_185835]-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs with
the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after previous study vaccination), which are
ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination, should be recorded on the electronic case report form
(eCRF) AE page.
All SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from further study vaccination (regardless of the causal
relationship) are to be reported from the moment of first vaccination until completion of the participant’s
last study-related procedure, which may include contact [CONTACT_160181]-up. The sponsor will evaluate any
safety information that is spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_160182].
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Determination
With [ADDRESS_185836]
vaccination would be associated with a 95% confidence that the true rate is less than 11.3%. Across active
regimens (N=150), the observation of [ADDRESS_185837] vaccination would be associated
with a 95% confidence that the true rate is less than 2.0%.
Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:
 Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will include all participants with at least one vaccination
documented.
 Per-protocol Immunogenicity (PPI): The PPI [INVESTIGATOR_160127] a participant experiences a major protocol deviation expected to impact the immunogenicity
outcomes.
Primary Endpoints
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively per study
group, with special attention for SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study vaccine.
All safety analyses will be made on the FAS.

No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean and 95%
confidence interval, or median and quartile range [Q1-Q3], as appropriate) will be calculated for continuous
immunological parameters at all time points and for changes from baseline. Graphical representations of
immunological parameters will be made as applicable. Frequency tabulations will be calculated for discrete
(qualitative) immunological parameters as applicable. The immunogenicity analyses will be performed on
the PPI [CONTACT_55866]. An additional analysis might be done for the FAS.
Planned Analyses
The primary analysis will occur when all participants have completed the [ADDRESS_185838]-Dose 2 visit
and immunogenicity data required per the sponsor’s assessment. This analysis may allow to evaluate
persistence of immune responses.
No study modifications are planned as a result of primary or additional analyses. The exact scope of each
analysis will be defined based on the availability of immunogenicity data and findings from previous
analyses. Additional interim analyses may be performed during the study for the purpose of informing
future vaccine development-related decisions in a timely manner, or upon health authority request. If
required, these unplanned interim analyses may replace or be combined with planned analyses, depending
on the timing.
The final analysis will occur when the last participant has completed the final visit of the schedule of
assessment (Day 365±30 days) or discontinued earlier. Final analyses will allow for determination of the
durability of the immune response and analyze any additional safety and immunological data collected after
the additional analysis.

Safety Data Supporting Dose Selection for the INFLUENZA G1 mHA Protein
To date, INFLUENZA G1 mHA has not been tested in humans. Based on previous clinical
experience in other vaccine programs by [CONTACT_456], it is anticipated that the vaccine maybe well
tolerated. The dose levels of  and  of INFLUENZA G1 mHA were chosen based on
the safety and immunogenicity profile of recombinant RSV preF proteins given at doses of 150 µg
in approximately 8,499 participants aged 60 years and older in other studies up to 27 October 2021
by [CONTACT_456] (sponsor internal data).
2.1. Study Rationale
Influenza is a worldwide public health problem, responsible for significant morbidity and
mortality, as well as a significant resource burden on countries. In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_114044], about 3 to
5 million cases of severe influenza illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths are estimated to
occur worldwide ( WHO  2018 ). In the [LOCATION_002] (US), more than 200,000 patients are
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153620] a result of seasonal influenza-associated illnesses each year ( CDC October 2021 ),

Sta
tus: Approved,  Date: 02 March 2023and about 90% of influenza-associated deaths occur among adults aged 65 years and older
(CDC 2010 ).
Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness is generally variable and current seasonal vaccines do not
cover all circulating strains in a matched, and even fewer in a mismatched season. Furthermore,
seasonal vaccines must be adapted to current circulating strains (often yearly) based on World
Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and by [CONTACT_150991]. The vaccine with superior

clinical influenza ( Diazgranados 2014 ). Overall, these data support the importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_160128], such as the elderly.
One of the reasons for the limited efficacy provided by [CONTACT_160185]. Improving breadth by [CONTACT_160186]. A desired profile of a universal influenza vaccine includes: (1) inducing high
titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and antibodies with additional Fc-mediated
functionality such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) directed against
epi[INVESTIGATOR_160129]; (2) inducing durable immune responses; (3) protecting
against all human influenza strains; (4) to be safe and well tolerated.
There are different types of bnAbs. Some that bind and, to a certain extent, neutralize all influenza
viruses are fairly rare in the human population. In addition, antibodies have been found which bind
a subset of HA molecules within influenza A. Binding of these antibodies aligns with the [ADDRESS_185842] all circulating influenza viruses, the final universal
influenza vaccine should include 3 HA-based antigens: one for responses against influenza A
Group 1 viruses (eg, H1), one against influenza A Group 2 (eg, H3) and one against influenza B.
The sponsor has chosen to first advance the antigen for Group [ADDRESS_185843] this
Phase 1/2a FIH safety and reactogenicity study in healthy participants (study
VAC21148FLZ1001). The mini-HA antigen will be used as a soluble, purified, recombinant
protein (INFLUENZA G1 mHA). To maximize the magnitude of the antibody titers, the protein
antigen will be adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH) 3).
The study is designed to determine a regimen for further clinical development in adults based on
safety and immunogenicity data. The selected regimen should have a favorable safety profile and
induce immune responses with desired magnitude and functionality, as supported by [CONTACT_160187] 3, Objectives and Endpoints.

Nonclinical Safety
Biodis tribution
For recombinant protein vaccines (such as the INFLUENZA G1 mHA), pharmacokinetics studies
(including biodistribution studies) are not normally needed ( WHO 2005 ).
Toxicology
The nonclinical safety of the vaccine components (INFLUENZA G1 mHA andAl(OH) 3 adjuvant)
has been tested in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant, IM repeat-dose toxicity and local
tolerance study in rabbits. Full human doses of the various vaccine components and combinations
thereof were tested using a N+1 dosing regimen compared to the intended clinical study. The
effects observed were the expected physiological/immunological responses to the injection of a
vaccine and no adverse vaccine-related findings were noted in this study.
Per WHO Guidelines on Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines ( WHO 2005), genotoxicity and
carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. The components of the study vaccine are not
expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.

Risks Related to INFLUENZA G1 mHA
This study will be the FIH study for INFLUENZA G1 mHA. No clinical data are available to date.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding INFLUENZA G1 mHA, refer to
the latest version of the IB.
General Risks Related to Vaccination
In general, IM injection may cause local itching, warmth, pain, tenderness, erythema/redness,
induration, swelling, arm discomfort, or bruising of the skin. Participants may exhibit general signs
and symptoms associated with IM injection of a vaccine and/or placebo, including fever, chills,
rash, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, headache, dizziness, arthralgia, general itching, and fatigue. These
side effects will be monitored, but are generally short-term (typi[INVESTIGATOR_160130] 2 to 3 days) and do
not require treatment.
Syncope can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be
accompanied by [CONTACT_130361]. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury. If syncope develops,
participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting
and fast breathing.
Participants may have an allergic reaction to vaccination. An allergic reaction may cause a rash,
urticaria or even anaphylaxis. Severe reactions are rare. Participants with a history of severe
allergic reaction, anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]
(specifically the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_130232]) will be excluded from the study.
After each vaccination, participants will remain at the study site for at least [ADDRESS_185848] reported an

injection site, at an estimated rate of 0.03% to 0.83% ( Baylor 2002; Bergfors 2003 ; Bergfors 2014 ;
Netterlid 2004 ).Two studies examining infant exposure to aluminum from both diet and vaccines
concluded that aluminum adjuvants at the levels included in vaccines are well below the calculated
safe body burden( Keith 2002 ; Mitkus 2011 ). A 2017 review found that current data do not support
a causal relationship between aluminum-containing vaccines and a variety of autoimmune
disorders ( Ameratunga 2017 ).
Pregnancy and Birth Control
The effect of the study vaccine on a fetus or nursing baby [CONTACT_111175].
Female participants of childbearing potential will be required to agree to practice an acceptable
effective method of contraception and agree to remain on such a method of contraception from
providing consent until 3 months after receiving study vaccine (see Section 5.1). Participants who
are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. Participants who become pregnant
during the study may not receive further study vaccine, but will remain in the study and will
continue to undergo all procedures for surveillance and all safety follow-up as outlined in the
protocol for all participants (see Section 7.1 Discontinuation of Study Vaccine). Follow-up
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy will be required.
Because the effect on sperm is unknown, male participants must inform the study-site personnel if
their partner becomes pregnant during the study. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of
the pregnancy will be requested upon the consent provided by [CONTACT_3969].
Participants with Immunosuppression/Reduced Immune Response
Participants with abnormal function of the immune system will be excluded from the study.
Limited evidence indicates that inactivated vaccines (or non-replicating viral vaccines) generally
have the same safety profile in immunocompromised patients as in immunocompetent individuals.
However, the magnitude, breadth, and persistence of the immune response to vaccination may be
reduced or absent in immunocompromised persons.
Risks from Blood Draws
Blood drawing may cause pain, tenderness, bruising, bleeding, dizziness, vaso-vagal response,
syncope, and rarely, infection at the site where the blood is taken. Participants with
contraindications to IM injections and blood draws (eg, bleeding disorders) will be excluded.
Risks from Genetic Testing
Genetic testing can be used to provide information about how susceptible participants are to certain
diseases, as well as to provide other unique personal identifiable information. Used
inappropriately, this information could be discriminatory (for example, by [CONTACT_111176]).
The results will be coded to protect participant identity. The results are for exploratory and future
research purposes only and will not be provided to the participant.

Concomitant Vaccination
Concomitant vaccination might have an influence on both the safety profile and immunogenicity
of the studyvaccine. Likewise, the studyvaccine might have an influence on both the safety profile
and immunogenicity of any concomitant vaccination. As a result, licensed live attenuated vaccines
should be given at least 28 days before or after vaccination. Other licensed (not live) vaccines (eg,
influenza, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, coronavirus disease 2019) should be given at
least [ADDRESS_185849] study vaccination until the end of the study. If a vaccine
is indicated in a postexposure setting (eg, rabies or tetanus), it must take priority over the study
vaccine.
Unknown Risks
There may be other risks that are not known. If any significant new risks are identified, the
investigators and participants will be informed.
2.3.2 Benefits Related to Study Vaccination
Participants may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination, including the monitoring
of influenza-like illness if it arises; others may benefit from the knowledge that they may aid in
the development of a universal influenza vaccine.
The clinical benefits of the study vaccine have yet to be established. Currently, there are no
effective universal vaccines for influenza and no efficacy can be concluded from current data. The
overall benefit and risk balance for individual participants thus cannot be ascertained. Participants
must be informed that this vaccine has not yet been proven to be effective, and it should be assumed
that it is not the case until clinical studies are conducted that demonstrate its effectiveness.
2.3.3 Benefit-Risk Assessment Related to Study Vaccination
Based on the available data and proposed safety measures, the overall benefit-risk assessment for
this clinical study is considered acceptable for the following reasons:
 Only participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (specified in
Section 5, Study Population) will be allowed to participate in this study. The eligibility criteria
include adequate provisions to minimize the risk and protect the well-being of participants in
the study.
 Safety will be closely monitored throughout the study:
 In general, safety evaluations will be performed at scheduled visits during the study, as
described in Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities.

 Several safety measures are included in this protocol to minimize the potential risk to
participants, including the following:
 Sentinel participants will be evaluated for safety before extending enrollment in each cohort.
The blinded 48-hour post-vaccination safety data in these sentinel participants will be
reviewed by [CONTACT_458](s) (PIs) and sponsor’s study responsible physician
(SRP)/medical officer. Randomization of additional participants will be paused until this 48-
hour sentinel safety evaluation is completed.
 For both cohorts, an internal data review committee (DRC) will review blindeda7-day post-
first dose safety in participants in the sentinel subset and safety ramp-up subset. Additional
participants will only be enrolled following a favorable decision by [CONTACT_16009]. For both
cohorts, the DRC will also review blindedb 7-day post-second dose safety in participants in
the sentinel subset and safety ramp-up subset. Participants in the high-dose protein
(INFLUENZA G1 mHA  groups will only be given the second dose following a
favorable decision by [CONTACT_160190] (INFLUENZA G1 mHA
 There are pre-specified rules for all participants, that would result in pausing of further
vaccinations if predefined conditions occur, preventing exposure of new participants to study
vaccine until the DRC reviews all safety data (see Committee Structure in Section 10.3,
Appendix 3, Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations).

The rationale behind the selection of the doses is described in Section 4.3, Justification for Dose.
Regimen Selection
In Cohort 1 , initial safety and immunogenicity assessment of a 2-dose regimen of INFLUENZA
G1 mHA (  with or without Al(OH) 3 adjuvant, will be performed.
In Cohort 2 , safety and immunogenicity of high-dose (  INFLUENZA G1 mHA (with and
without Al(OH) 3 adjuvant) administered in a 2-dose or single-dose regimen will be assessed.
The vaccination regimens are with administration of study vaccination (active or placebo) on Day
1 and Day 57 (8-week interval). The interval is based on data from other studies by [CONTACT_160199] 8-week interval regimen
compared to studies with a 4-week interval regimen ( Milligan 2016 ). A longer (eg, 12-week
interval) regimen was not considered for the current study because this would be impractical for
an influenza vaccine.
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Intervention Groups
A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical
endpoints that may occur in the absence of active intervention. Randomization will be used to
minimize bias in the assignment of participants to intervention groups, to increase the likelihood
that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are
evenly balanced across intervention groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons
across intervention groups. Blinded intervention will be used to reduce potential bias during data
collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.
Biomarker Collection and Limited Genetic Testing
It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to interindividual
differences in response to vaccination. Limited genetic testing (eg, gene expression profiling)may
help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes and may help to identify population
subgroups that respond differently to vaccination. The goal of the gene expression profiling
component is to collect RNA to allow the identification ofgenetic factors that may influence the
safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of INFLUENZA G1 mHA.
Biomarker samples will be collected to evaluate the immunogenicity of INFLUENZA G1 mHA
or help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes or may help to identify population
subgroups that respond differently to vaccination. The goal of the biomarker analyses is to evaluate

participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Only participants who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits,
and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled.
The primary ethical concern is that this study will be performed in healthy adult participants who
will receive no benefit from participation in the study, except for compensation for the time and
inconveniences that may arise from participation in the study. Refer to Section 2.3 , Benefit-risk
Assessmentfor details on potential and known benefits and risks, and for the safety measures taken
to minimize risk to participants.
The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood to be
collected over this time period from the population in this study based upon the US Department of
Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections, and US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) guidelines of 550 mL in any 8-week period ( OHRP 1998 ; FDA 1998 ).
4.3. Justification for Dose
The  dose was selected as the initial dose for INFLUENZA G1 mHA as this is in line with
the Influenza A Group 1 HA dose in the licensed Flublok vaccine, which contains  of each
HA and is well tolerated ( Cox 2015 ). Furthermore, data from other programs by [CONTACT_160200] (sponsor internal data). However, it is anticipated that doses
higher than this will be required to achieve optimal immune responses, due to the inherent lower
immunogenicity of the HA stem domain compared to the head domain of the molecule( Tan 2019 ).
Therefore, the  dose was selected as it represents an approximately 0.[ADDRESS_185867] of a mixture of
3 different proteins (covering Influenza A hemagglutinin Group 1, Group 2 and Influenza B), a
dose of  per protein in the regimen approaches a practical limit for this vaccine. The dose
levels of  and  ofINFLUENZA G1 mHA to be used were also chosen as the initial
dose based on the safety and immunogenicity profile of recombinant RSV preF proteins given at
doses of [ADDRESS_185868] widely
used adjuvant, Al(OH) 3 has been chosen for this study. The Al(OH) 3 adjuvant with an aluminum
content of 0.75 mg/dose was chosen to be well within the FDA recommendation of maximal
0.[ADDRESS_185869]

6. STUDY VACCINE
6.1. Study Vaccine(s) Administered
Participants will be vaccinated at the study site according to the schedule detailed in Section 4.1,
Overall Design ( Table 1 ). For description of the vaccinations, see below.
INFLUENZA G1 mHA, adjuvant and diluent will be manufactured and provided under the
responsibility of the sponsor. Refer to the IB for a list of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
The placebo for this study will be supplied by [CONTACT_3174] a commercially available injectable
solution of9 mg/mL Sodium Chloride.
Supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_160206]:
 INFLUENZA G1 mHA (JNJ-67920320): supplied at a concentration of 900 µg/mL in a single
use vial, dosed at  and  with or without Al(OH) 3 adjuvant. (Aluminum content at
0.75 mg/dose); 0.5 mL (extractable volume)
 Placebo: supplied as a sterile solution ofSodium Chloride 9 mg/mL in a single use vial; 10 mL
(filling volume)
 Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Al(OH) 3): supplied at a concentration of 3.75 mg/mL in a
single use vial for mixing according to the Investigational Product Preparation Instructions
(IPPI); 1.0 mL (extractable volume)
 Formulation buffer for INFLUENZA G1 mHA (Diluent Uniflu 1): supplied in a single use
vial for dilution of INFLUENZA G1 mHA according to IPPI; 0.8 mL (extractable volume)
For each participant, every injection will be 1.0 mL in volume. Instructions on study vaccine
preparation (eg, dilution in formulation buffer) into the final dose that participants receive within
each treatment group are outlined in detail in the IPPI.
Preferably the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant upper arm is used to administer the injection.
If an injection cannot be given in either deltoid for the second dose of the vaccination due to a
medical or other contraindication (for example, tattooed upper arms rendering it difficult to assess
site reactogenicity), use alternative locations such as the hip, thigh, or buttocks (to be avoided in
overweight participants). In this case, IM injections in other locations than the upper arm for the
second dose of the vaccination are not considered protocol deviations.
For information on vaccination windows, see Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures. If a
participant cannot be vaccinated within the allowed window or if the window is missed due to a
study pause (see Section 6.8, Study Pausing Rules), the decision regarding vaccination will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis, upon discussion between sponsor and investigator.

6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Preparation/Handling/Storage
All study vaccine must be stored in a secured location with no access for unauthorized personnel
and at controlled temperatures as indicated on the clinical labels. If study vaccine is exposed to
temperatures outside the specified temperature range, all relevant data will be sent to the sponsor
to determine if the affected supplies can be used or will be replaced. The affected study vaccine
must be quarantined and not used until further instruction from the sponsor is received.
Refer to the Site Investigational Product and Procedures Manual (SIPPM) and/or the IPPI [INVESTIGATOR_160133], handling, and storage and stability.
An unblinded pharmacist, or other qualified staff member at the site with primary responsibility
for study vaccine preparation, who will not participate in any other study evaluation, will prepare
the appropriate vial and syringe, labeled with the participant’s identification number, and provide
the blinded syringe to the blinded vaccine administrator who will perform the injection.
All study vaccines were manufactured and packaged in accordance with Current Good
Manufacturing Practice. All study vaccines will be packaged and labeled under the responsibility
of the sponsor. Study vaccine labels will contain information to meet the applicable regulatory
requirements.
No study vaccine can be repacked or relabeled without prior approval from the sponsor.
Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study vaccine received at the site is inventoried
and accounted for throughout the study.
The study vaccine administered to the participant must be documented on the intervention
accountability form. All study vaccine will be stored and disposed of according to the sponsor's
instructions. Study-site personnel must not combine contents of the study vaccine containers.
Study vaccine must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label, and
must be stored at the study site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate
environmental conditions. Unused study vaccine must be available for verification by [CONTACT_456]'s
study site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The return to the sponsor of unused study
vaccine will be documented on the intervention return form. When the study site is an authorized
destruction unit and study vaccine supplies are destroyed on-site, this must also be documented on
the intervention return form.

Study vaccine should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member
of the study-site personnel, or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. Study vaccine will be supplied only
to participants participating in the study. Returned study vaccine must not be dispensed again, even
to the same participant. Study vaccine may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_160207]. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study vaccine from, nor store it at, any
site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. Further guidance and information for
the final disposition of unused study vaccines are provided in the SIPPM.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Vaccine Allocation
Procedures  f or Randomization
Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the study vaccine groups based on a computer-
generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by [CONTACT_160208]. The randomization within each cohort will be performed in different steps. Allocation to
the sentinel subset, to the safety ramp-up subset, or to the main study subset will be monitored by
[CONTACT_160209] a participant is included in.
The interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique intervention code, which will
dictate the intervention assignment and matching study vaccine kit for the participant. The
requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when
contact[CONTACT_23790], and will then give the relevant participant details to uniquely identify the
participant.
If randomized participants are withdrawn from vaccination before the first dose of study vaccine
is administered, additional participants may be recruited to replace these participants at the
discretion of the sponsor. Any replacement participant will be assigned to the same group as the
original (discontinued) participant. The replacement participant’s randomization number will
equal the randomization number of the discontinued participant [PHONE_3548] (eg, participant 0001 would
be replaced by [CONTACT_3445] 1001). These additional participants should also be randomized through
IWRS.
In Cohort 1, a total of 60 participants will be enrolled in a staggered approach ( Figure 2 ). Initially,
5 sentinel participants will be randomized; 2 participants to Groups 1 and 2 and 1 participant to
Group 3 (placebo). Randomization of additional participants will be paused until a blinded 48-
hour sentinel safety evaluation of these 5 sentinel participants is completed. In the absence of any
clinically significant findings, upon decision by [CONTACT_976](s) and SRP, an additional 12 participants will
be randomized (5 additional participants inGroups 1 and2 and 2 additional participants in Group 3
[placebo]). DRC will review blinded safety data of the initial [ADDRESS_185887]
vaccination. DRC review will be held to review available safety data of initial participants enrolled
before these participants can receive the second vaccination. Further randomization in Cohort 1

In Cohort 2, a total of 110 participants will be enrolled in a staggered approach( Figure 2 ). Initially,
5 sentinel participants will be randomized; 1 participant in each of the 5 groups (Groups 4 to 8
[including 1 placebo]). Randomization of additional participants will be paused until a blinded 48-
hour sentinel safety evaluation of these 5 sentinel participants is completed. In the absence of any
clinically significant findings, upon decision by [CONTACT_976](s) and SRP, an additional 10 participants will
be randomized in parallel (2 additional participants in Groups 4 to 8 [including 2 placebo]). DRC
will review blinded safety data of the [ADDRESS_185889] vaccination, the remaining 95 participants in Cohort 2 will be randomized.
Refer to Section 4.1, Overall Design and Figure 2 .
Blinding
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained
within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an
individual participant.
Data that may potentially unblind the intervention assignment (ie, immunogenicity data, study
vaccine accountability data, study vaccine allocation, biomarker or other specific laboratory data)
will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the
potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating
the data in question from view by [CONTACT_473], clinical team, or others as appropriate until the
time of database lock and unblinding.
The participants, study-site personnel (including vaccine administrator) and investigator will be
blinded to study vaccine allocation throughout the study, except for the pharmacist or qualified
staff member with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing.
At the time of the primary analysis, the study will be unblinded for sponsor and external
partnerships personnel. Participants, clinical staff and study-site personnel will remain blinded to
the study vaccine allocation until the end of the study.
The investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the intervention. While the
responsibility to break the intervention code in emergency situations resides solely with the
investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_160210], before breaking the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_160211] [ADDRESS_185890] be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding

personnel not essential to the safety review.
If other rare, unforeseen circumstances arise that may necessitate unblinding of selected sponsor
personnel, these will be assessed and documented on a case-by-case basis. The data should be kept
blinded to any personnel not essential to the review or investigation.
6.4. Study Vaccine Compliance
Study vaccines will be administered intramuscularly by [CONTACT_160212]-site personnel at
the study site. Details of each administration will be recorded in the eCRF (includingdate and time
of injection and location used for injection). For blinding procedures, see Section 6.3, Measures to

6.8. Study Pausing Rules
If a study vaccination is considered to raise significant safety concerns (and a specific set of
pausing criteria have been met), further vaccination of participants may be paused after medical
review as described below. The concerned data will then be reviewed by [CONTACT_16009], after which the
DRC will recommend whether the pause can be lifted or not, or whether other steps are needed.
1. The occurrence of any of the following events maylead to a pause in further study vaccination.
This list is only applicable for concerned AEs that occur up to [ADDRESS_185895] vaccination throughout the study. Death of a
participant, considered related to study vaccine or if the causal relationship to the study
vaccine cannot be excluded; OR
Note:All cases of death will be sent for DRC information. Upon their review, DRC may then
de
cide whether a study pause is required.
2. One or more participants experience an SAE, a Grade 4 (solicited or unsolicited) AE, or a
persistent (upon repeat testing) Grade 4 laboratory abnormalitythat is determined to be related
to study vaccine; OR
3. One or more participants experience anaphylaxis or generalized urticaria within 24 hours of
vaccination, clearly not attributable to other causes than vaccination with study vaccine; OR
4. Three or more participants experience a Grade 3 unsolicited AE of the same type (as per
medical judgment of the sponsor), that is determined to be related to study vaccine, that
persists for 72 hours or longer; OR one participant from sentinel cohort experiences a Grade
3 unsolicited AE that is determined to be related to study vaccine; OR
5. Three or more participants experience a persistent (upon repeat testing) Grade 3 laboratory
abnormality related to the same laboratory parameter and considered related to study vaccine;
OR One participant from sentinel cohort experiences a persistent (upon retesting) Grade 3
laboratory abnormality that is determined to be related to study vaccine; OR
6. Three or more participants experience a Grade 3 solicited AE of the same type, determined to
be related to study vaccine, and persisting as Grade 3 for longer than 3 consecutive days (ie,

Sta
tus: Approved,  Date: 02 March 2023the day of occurrence of the AE is counted as Day 1); OR one participant from sentinel cohort
experiences a Grade 3 solicited systemic AE that is determined to be related to study vaccine.
For number 2 and number 5: to assess abnormal laboratory values, the test must be repeated at
least once, within 48 hours of the site becoming aware of the abnormal value.
For number 4, number 5 and number 6: after each DRC review of similar AEs, the Committee will
indicate the conditions under which it requires further notification and review of the subsequent
similar AEs.
To enable prompt response to a situation that could trigger pausing rules, the investigator should
notify the sponsor’s medical officer or designee (AND transmit SAE form [if applicable] in a
secure manner electronically or by [CONTACT_6972] [fax] to the sponsor), immediately and no later than
24 hours after becoming aware of any related AE of Grade 3 or above AND update the eCRF with
relevant information on the same day the AE information is collected. A thorough analysis of all
Grade 3 (or above) cases will be carried out by [CONTACT_456]’s medical officer or designee,
irrespective of whether the criteria for pausing the study are met. Based on the pausing criteria, the
sponsor’s medical officer or designee then decides whether a study pause is warranted. All sites
will be notified immediately in case of a study pause. The sponsor’s medical officer or designee is
responsible for the immediate notification of DRC members and coordination of a DRC meeting
in case of a study pause.
Vaccinations for an individual participant may be suspended for safety concerns other than those
described in the pausing criteria, at the discretion of the investigator if he/she feels the participant’s
safety may be threatened. The sponsor’s medical officer or designee or the investigator(s) (upon
consultation with the sponsor’s medical officer or designee) may initiate DRC review for any
single event or combination of multiple events which, in their professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], could
jeopardize the safety of the participants or the reliability of the data.
Vaccinations for the study may be suspended for safety concerns other than those described above,
or before pausing rules are met, if, in the judgment of the DRC, participant safety may be
threatened.
Resumption of vaccinations will start only upon receipt of written recommendations by [CONTACT_16009].
The clinical site(s) will be allowed to resume activities upon receipt of a written notification from
the sponsor. The communications from the DRC  will be forwarded by [CONTACT_160213]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) and by [CONTACT_160214], according to local standards and regulations.

from participation in the study will be offered a single exit visit for safety follow-up (prior to
formal withdrawal of consent). They have the right to refuse.
Withdrawal of Consent
A participant declining to return for scheduled visits does not necessarily constitute withdrawal of
consent. Alternate follow-up mechanisms that the participant agreed to when signing the consent
form apply as local regulations permit.
7.2.1. Withdrawal From the Use of Research Samples
Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Research
The participant may withdraw consent for use of samples for research (refer to Long-Term
Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research in in Section 10.3, Appendix 3, Regulatory,
Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations). In such a case, samples will be destroyed after they
are no longer needed for the clinical study. Details of the sample retention for research are
presented in the main ICF.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if the participant repeatedly fails to return for
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. A participant cannot be deemed
lost to follow-up until all reasonable efforts made by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel to contact [CONTACT_160216]. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to

available and applicable) summarized in Table [ADDRESS_185906] influenza infection, immunological assessments supporting
the secondary and exploratory endpoints will be evaluated for their utility as potential surrogates
of protection, to be applied to and further characterized in follow-up studies, such as challenge
studies or Phase 2b proof-of-concept studies.
Blood for humoral immune responses will be drawn from all participants. Influenza immunity in
study participants will be determined on baseline (Day 1) and post-vaccination blood samples as
described in Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities. Both assay variability and pre-existing immunity
will be taken into consideration in the immunogenicity assessments.
PaxGene tubes and proteome stabilization samples will be collected according to Section 1.3,
Schedule of Activities. PaxGene samples will allow the performance of whole blood transcript
profiling.
Nasosorption samples (using SAM), collected at the timepoints indicated in Section 1.3, Schedule
of Activities, will be used for the development of mucosal influenza-specific IgG and/or IgA
ELISAs and the assessment of those responses in nasal secretions.
In addition to RT-PCR based diagnosis of influenza virus infection performed on nasal swab
samples (collected when ILI symptoms develop during the influenza season), blood samples
collected at baseline, between 2 and 4 days after symptom onset (ILI Days 3-5), and at 28 days
after symptom onset (ILI Day 29) from participants with a suspected ILI will also be assayed by

[CONTACT_6972] (fax). Telephone reporting should be the exception and the reporter should be asked to
complete the appropriate form(s) first.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading
verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited AEs are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are predefined local
(at the injection site) and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned and
which are noted by [CONTACT_160226].
After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
[ADDRESS_185915]-vaccination. All participants will be
provided with a diary and instructions on how to complete the diary (see Overview in Section 8,
Study Assessments and Procedures). The site staff will verbatim transcribe the information
provided by [CONTACT_160227]. Review of diary entries with
participants and grading of symptoms must be done by a qualified and delegated site staff member
under the oversight of the investigator or a delegated physician. After review of the diary entries
with the participant, the investigator or qualified delegate, will complete their own assessment and
document it in the relevant sections of the eCRF. Once a solicited sign or symptom from a diary
is considered to be of severity Grade 1 or above, it will be recorded as a solicited AE.
SolicitedInjection Site Advers e Events
Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness,
erythema, and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily for [ADDRESS_185916]-vaccination (day of
vaccination and the subsequent 7 days). The extent (largest diameter) of any erythema and swelling
should be measured (using the ruler supplied) and recorded daily. The case definitions for solicited
injection site events can be found in Section 11, References ( Gidudu 2012 ; Kohl 2007 ).
Solicited Sys temic Advers e Events
Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer provided
for home use. Participants should record the temperature in the diary in the evening of the day of
vaccination, and then daily for the next 7 days approximately at the same time each day. If more

Fe
ver is defined as endogenous elevation of body temperature ≥38° C (100.4°F) , as recorded in at
least one measurement ( Marcy 2004 ).
Participants will also be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis
for [ADDRESS_185918]-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days), for the following
events: fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned.
8.3.3. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements
and evaluations as medically indicated to elucidate the nature and causality of the AE, SAE, or
PQC as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations,
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
Adverse events and the special reporting situation of pregnancy will be followed by [CONTACT_160228] 10.4, Appendix 4, Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures
for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities.
The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where
required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The investigator (or
sponsor where required) must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the
protocol unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. A S[LOCATION_003]R will be reported to
regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will receive a blinded
S[LOCATION_003]R summary, unless otherwise specified.
8.3.5. Pregnancy
All initial reports of pregnancy in female participants or partners of male participants must be
reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel immediately, but no later than 24 hours of their
knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy
outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic
pregnancy) are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any
participant who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study vaccine, but
remain on study for follow-up with assessments of safety and immunogenicity (see Section 7.1
Discontinuation of Study Vaccine).
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the
infant will be required.

8.4. Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of INFLUENZA G1 mHA  greater than the assigned dose will be
considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend specific interventions for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:
 Contact [CONTACT_456]’s medical officer immediately.
 Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE (ie, the participant will remain at the study site
for
 at least [ADDRESS_185919]-dose will be made).
 Document the quantity of the excess dose of the overdosing in the eCRF.
8.5. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics
Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not
evaluated in this study.
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_35522]. A general
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the immunogenicity and safety data is
outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses
No formal statistical hypothesis for safety or immunogenicity will be tested.
9.2. Sample Size Determination
The study will evaluate whether INFLUENZA G1 mHA, with or without Al(OH) 3 adjuvant, is
safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adults aged ≥18 to ≤[ADDRESS_185920]
vaccination would be associated with a 95% confidence that the true rate is less than 11.3%. Across

This is the first study in humans and standard deviation of selected immunological assays is not
yet known in this population. Immunogenicity will be based on the estimation ofgeometric mean
titer (GMT) ratios at each timepoint versus baseline and their corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
Assuming that approximately 12% of participants might be excluded from Per-protocol
Immunogenicity (PPI) due to dropout or major protocol deviation impacting immunogenicity, we
will have [ADDRESS_185923] deviations for ELISA
on the log10 scale (two-sided alpha = 0.05).

 If
 a participant misses one or more active dose(s) of the selected regimen but
continues the planned visit schedule, samples after the missed active dose(s)
will not be considered.
The analysis of all secondary and exploratory immunogenicity endpoints will be
based on the PPI [CONTACT_55866]. Depending on the number of samples excluded, a post-hoc
exploratory analysis might be performed, including the excluded samples. To
visualize excluded samples, participant profiles from several assays might be
repeated, indicating the excluded samples.
Va
ccine assignment will follow the as-treated principle.
9.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock for primary analyses (at the latest) and it will
include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this
section. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important
endpoints including primary and key secondary endpoints. A separate analysis plan will be created
to support DRC meetings and this document will be finalized prior to the data extraction for the
first DRC meeting to review 7-day safety data post-first study vaccination from Cohort 1
participants.
The safety and immunogenicity analysis will include the timepoints described in Section 1.3,
Schedule of Activities.
9.4.1. General Considerations
Analysis populations are defined in Section 9.3, Populations for Analyses.
Planned analyses are defined in Section 9.5, Planned Analyses.
9.4.2. Primary Endpoint(s)
Safety Endpoints
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively
per study group, with special attention for SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, and AEs leading to
discontinuation of study vaccine. Safety will also be assessed throughout the study through routine
vital signs and physical examination as well as through clinical safety laboratory assessments. All
safety analyses will be made on the FAS.
Adverse Events
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by [CONTACT_130420] (MedDRA). All reported AEs will be included in the
analysis. For each AE, the percentage of participants who experience at least 1 occurrence of the
given event will be summarized by [CONTACT_65237].

Immunogenicity Endpoints
No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean
and 95% CI, or median and quartile range [Q1-Q3], as appropriate) will be calculated for
continuous immunological parameters at all time points and for changes from baseline. Graphical
representations of immunological parameters will be made as applicable. Frequency tabulations
will be calculated for discrete (qualitative) immunological parameters as applicable. The
immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the PPI [CONTACT_55866]. An additional analysis might be done
for the FAS.
9.4.4. Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s)
Detailed statistical methodology will be described in the SAP.
9.5. Planned Analyses
The primary analysis will occur when all participants have completed the [ADDRESS_185925]-Dose 2 visit and immunogenicity data required per the sponsor’s assessment. This analysis
may allow to evaluate persistence of immune responses.
No study modifications are planned as a result of primary or additional analyses. The exact scope
of each analysis will be defined based on the availability of immunogenicity data and findings
from previous analyses. Additional interim analyses may be performed during the study for the
purpose of informing future vaccine development-related decisions in a timely manner, or upon
health authority request. If required, these unplanned interim analyses may replace or be combined
with planned analyses, depending on the timing.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE
Data Review Committee
An internal DRC, consisting of members that are not directly involved in the study conduct, data
management, or statistical analysis, will be established for this study, and will monitor data to
ensure the safety and well-being of the participants enrolled. The DRC will review data as
indicated in Section 4.1, Overall Design. When appropriate, the conclusions of the DRC will be
communicated to the investigators, the IRB/IEC, and the national regulatory authorities.
The DRC will specifically review safety data (solicited and unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and available
laboratory assessments) 7-day post-first and post-second dose in each cohort (participants in the
sentinel and safety ramp-up subset).
In addition, ad hoc review may be performed further to the occurrence of any AE/SAE leading to
a study pausing situation as outlined in Section 6.8, Study Pausing Rules, or at request of the

concern.
The DRC will review blinded data first, but is entitled to and has the right to require submission
of unblinded data if deemed necessary.
It will also be possible for the DRC to review unblinded immunogenicity data during the course
of the study if this is deemed necessary for future vaccine development-related decisions. If this is
the case, a biomarker representative (not involved in the conduct of the study) will be part of the
DRC.
The DRC will include medical experts in vaccines and at least one statistician. The DRC can
include members from both inside and outside of the sponsor, but will not include any study team
personnel or people otherwise directly involved in the study conduct, data management, or
statistical analysis for the study. The DRC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be
documented in its charter.

The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required
by [CONTACT_2371]. The disclosure of the final study results will be performed after the end of study in order
to ensure the statistical analyses are relevant.
DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified
investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and
study-site personnel before the study, and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456]. Written
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study-site personnel before
the start of the study.
The sponsor will review eCRF for accuracy and completeness during on-site and/or remote

The study data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_3449]-site personnel from the source documents onto an
eCRF, if applicable. Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor.
Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the eCRF. Any
suchworksheets will become part of the participant's source documents. Data must be entered into
eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
All participative measurements (eg, pain scale information or other questionnaires) will be
completed by [CONTACT_66890].
If necessary, queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to an eCRF are needed after
the initial entry into the eCRF, this can be done in either of the following ways:
 Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own
initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by [CONTACT_66832]).
 Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by [CONTACT_70449]-
site personnel.
SOURCE DOCUMENTS
At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly
recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following:
participant identification, eligibility, and study identification; study discussion and date of signed
informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and efficacy parameters as required by [CONTACT_70465]; record of all AEs and follow-up of AEs; concomitant medication; intervention
receipt/dispensing/return records; study vaccine administration information; and date of study
completion and reason for early discontinuation of study vaccine or withdrawal from the study, if
applicable.
The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable.
Participant- and investigator-completed scales and assessments designated by [CONTACT_456] (ie,
diary, Flu-iiQTMquestionnaire, ILI form) will be recorded and will be considered source data. The
participant’s diary used to collect information regarding solicited signs and symptoms after
vaccination will be considered source data.

An eSource system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70363] (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the clinical
study-specific data fields as determined by [CONTACT_760]. This data is electronically extracted for
use by [CONTACT_456]. If eSource is utilized, references made to the eCRF in the protocol include the
eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found in the
eCRF.
MONITORING
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site
monitoring) to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will
record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the
monitor will compare data entered into the eCRF with the source documents (eg,
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/physician’s office medical records); a sample may be reviewed. The nature and
location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data
required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are
accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786]-site contact. If electronic records are maintained
at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study-site personnel.
Direct access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying
that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will
be discussed with the study-site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the
relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a
suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study
conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these
remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the
study at the site.
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by [CONTACT_70467].
ON-SITE AUDITS
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study
records, including source documents, for inspection. Participant privacy must, however, be

Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS
Adverse Event
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal
(investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal
relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal
(investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per ICH)
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test
abnormalities.
Note: For time period of sponsor’s AE collection, see All Adverse Events under Section 8.3.1,
Ti
me Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information.
Any ILI and complications related to ILIs will be reported as an AE if it occurs between the time
of any vaccination through the following 28 days. An ILI and complications related to ILIs that
occur outside of this period does not require AE reporting unless ongoing at the time of subsequent
vaccination.
Serious Adverse Event
An SAE based on ICH and European Union (EU)Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product
 Is Medically Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160144]21148 Uniflu Vaccine Clinical Protocol VAC21148FLZ1001 Amendment 2

NFIDENTIAL –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 91
Sta
tus: Approved,  Date: 02 March 2023require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These
should usually be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship
between the study vaccine and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis), the event must be reported
as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study
endpoint (eg, all-cause mortality).
Any ILI and complications related to ILIs fulfilling the criteria of an SAE will be reported as such
during the entire study period from the first vaccination.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product
reference safety information. For INFLUENZA G1 mHA, the expectedness of an AE will be
determined by [CONTACT_70471].
ATTRIBUTION DEFINITIONS
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study vaccine is determined by [CONTACT_093]. The following selection
should be used to assess all AEs.
Related
There is a reasonable causal relationship between study treatment administration and the AE.
Not Related
There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study treatment administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to support a causal relationship.
By [CONTACT_108], all solicited AEs at the injection site will be considered related to the study vaccine
administration.
SEVERITY CRITERIA
All AEsand laboratory data will be coded for severity using a modified version of the FDA grading
table, based on version of September 2007 ( FDA 2007 ), included in Section 10.5 Appendix 5,
Toxicity Grading Scale.
For AEs not identified in the grading table, the following guidelines will be applied:

Sta
tus: Approved,  Date: 02 March 202310.7. Appendix 7: Study Conduct During a Pandemic
GUIDANCE ON STUDY  CONDUCT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on
the conduct of this clinical study due to, for example, isolation or quarantine of participants and
study-site personnel; travel restrictions/limited access to public places, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; study
site personnel being reassigned to critical tasks.
The sponsor is providing options for study-related participant management in the event of
disruption to the conduct of the study. This guidance does not supersede any local or government
requirements or the clinical judgment of the investigator to protect the health and well-being of
participants and site staff. If, at any time, a participant’s travel to the study site is considered to be
dangerous, study participation may be interrupted, and study follow-up conducted. If it becomes
necessary to discontinue participation in the study, the procedures outlined in the protocol for
discontinuing study intervention will be followed.
If, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, scheduled visits cannot be conducted in person at the
study site, they will be performed to the extent possible remotely/virtually or delayed until such
time that on-site visits can be resumed. At each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect
safety data. Key immunogenicity endpoint assessments should be performed if required and as
feasible. Participants will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill any physical
examination requirement.
Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments for participants on study
intervention, including follow up. Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be
permitted after consultation with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed
assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical trial management system for protocol deviations.
Discontinuations of study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with
the prefix “COVID-19-related” in the CRF.
If a participant has tested positive for COVID-19, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_456]’s
responsible medical officer to discuss plans for administration of study intervention, performing
study assessments, and follow-up. Modifications made to the study conduct as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic should be summarized in the clinical study report.

Screening and Randomization
 Enrollment of new participants may continue based on the investigator’s assessment ofrisks
versus benefits, depending on the situation at a particular site, and the ability to monitor
participant safety.
Site Visits
 When site visits are not possible due to local/national guidelines, sites should collect the
assessments via telephone visits or home-based visits, if the participant allows. The actual
visit date and the type of visit (ie, telephone or home-based visit) should be captured in the
eCRF according to the eCRF completion guidelines. Procedures that cannot be performed
during a home-based visit (eg, blood samples, and physical examination), should be excluded.
Vaccine Administration
 When planning for vaccination visits, local/national or institutional guidelines will be
followed. The study vaccine must be administered by a blinded qualified individual at the
study site. If this is not possible, a solution may be considered in consultation with the sponsor
and taking into consideration participant safety.
Informed Consent Form
 Consenting and re-consenting of participants for the measures taken (including also remote
consenting by [CONTACT_111199]) will be performed as applicable and according to
local guidance for informed consent applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The process
is to be documented in the source documents.
Source Data Verification/Monitoring
 In case on-site monitoring visits are not possible, the site monitor may contact [CONTACT_160237] (in accordance with site and local
requirements). Additional on-site monitoring visits may be needed in the future to catch up on
source data verification.
Site Audits
 During the COVID-[ADDRESS_185956]/engagement from the investigator and study site personnel would not be conducted in
order to comply with national, local, and/or organizational social distancing restrictions.
Additional quality assurance activities such as remote audits or focused review of study-
related documents may take place with limited impact/engagement if possible.

1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title:  Residential MapTrek 
Grant Number:   UL1TR002537 
Study Description:  The overarching goal of our project is to develop an inexpensive 
and scalable tool to increase volume of physical activity in our 
target population, older adults living in a residential facility. 
MapTrek is a web-based application that allows participants to 
take a virtual walk in interesting locations around the world 
while tracking their progress against the progress of other older 
adults living in a retirement community. Steps are counted using 
a commercially available accelerometer (e.g., Fitbit), and 
participants see their progress overlaid on Google Maps. The 
overarching goal of our project is to develop an inexpensive and 
scalable tool to increase volume of physical activity in our 
target population, older adults living in a residential facility.  
 
All participants will be provided with a Fitbit activity monitor 
and instructed to wear it 24 hours/day (except for 
bathing/swimming time) on their wrist for 12 weeks. 
Participants will participate in four team based walking races, 
each two weeks long. Participants will view their team progress 
on TV monitors placed in various locations at the Oaknoll 
facility. The monitors will present aggregated team data and 
will not report any individual data that could link back to the 
individual participant.  
 
At the end of the 8 week active intervention, research team 
members will meet with participants at Oaknoll to administer an 
exit/process evaluation survey. The exit survey will ask about 
psychosocial predictors of physical activity as well as 
participants thoughts and opi[INVESTIGATOR_73739]. This 
survey should take approximate 10-[ADDRESS_80483] as a control 
condition since this is a single-arm study.

for improving physical activity levels of 
older adults living in a residential facility.

Description of Sites/Facilities 
Enrolling Participants:  One retirement community  
Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:  All participants will then be provided with a Fitbit activity monitor 
and instructed to wear it 24 hours/day (except for bathing/swimming 
time) for the next [ADDRESS_80485] bands that hold the Fitbit 
monitor; black white and teal.  
  
After baseline data collection, the research team will hold a kick-off 
event for the participants. The research team will give a brief 
presentation describing the study again. Participants will be 
informed of their team by a research team member and will be 
provided a wrist band that corresponds to their team color (black, 
white or teal). At that point, participants will receive written 
instructions ("game rules") on how to play the MapTrek intervention 
(our virtual walking race platform).  
 
As part of the MapTrek game, participants will be asked to wear their 
Fitbit activity monitor every day for [ADDRESS_80486] eight 
weeks, participants will participate in four team based walking races, 
each two weeks long. Participants will view their team progress on 
TV monitors placed in various locations at the Oaknoll facility. The 
Oaknoll leadership has given us approval to do this at their facility 
(see letter of support). The monitors will present aggregated team 
data and will not report any individual data that could link back to 
the individual participant. After the 8-week active intervention, we 
will take MapTrek away and will ask participants to wear the Fitbit 
for an additional 4 weeks. This will be done to determine the effects 
of MapTrek had on physical activity compared to a control where 
participants only wear the Fitbit.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.[ADDRESS_80490] physically active adult population. It is 
estimated that nearly 90% of older adults [ADDRESS_80491] sedentary, and that replacing sitting with even light intensity walking 
can be beneficial.  
 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND 
Older adults (aged 60 and older) are a growing population, with projections to reach 83.[ADDRESS_80492] double the population in 2012 (Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014).Increasing age 
is associated with declines in many physiological systems(Sakuma & Yamaguchi, [ZIP_CODE]) and 
increased risk for several non-communicable chronic health conditions(World Health 
Organization, 2009). Older adults often experience declines in balance, loss of muscle mass, 
reductions in muscle strength and endurance, and decreased cognitive function(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_73740]., 
2018; Sakuma & Yamaguchi, 2012; Salthouse, 2003; Warburton, Nicol, & Bredin, 2006) 
Collectively, these age-related declines can negatively impact olde r adult’s physical function and 
quality of life(Taylor, 2014).  
 
Physical activity is an important modifiable behavior demonstrated to reduce the risk for several 
age-related chronic diseases while improving physical function.(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_73740]., 2018) Maintaining 
a physically active lifestyle is important for maintaining independence(Taylor, 2014), improving 
health-related quality of life(Choi, Lee, Lee, & Jung, 2017), and increasing performance in 
activities of daily (Dionigi, 2007; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_73740]., 2018). Previous studies have demonstrated 
favorable financial impacts of physical activity-based wellness programs targeted to older 
adults.  
 
Older adults are the most sedentary and least physically active adult population. Older adults 
spend an average of 9.4 hours per day engaged in sedentary behavior(Harvey, Chastin, & 
Skelton, 2014). The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend older adults to 
achieve a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-to vigorous (MVPA), multicomponent physical 
activity per week which includes balance training, aerobic and muscle strengthening 
activities(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_73740]., 2018). Moreover, older adult who cannot meet the guidelines are 
encouraged to do any amount of physical activity, to move more and sit less, in order to gain 
some heal th benefits(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_73740]., 2018). However, it is estimated that nearly 90% of older adults 
65 years of age or older do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity.(Shepherd, 
2011) Evidence suggests great health benefits can be achieved for older adults who are the most 
Residential MapTrek Version 1.[ADDRESS_80493] 2019

Retirement communities and residential living facilities can be important settings to consider 
when delivering physical activity interventions to older adults. Evidence suggests that older 
adults living in these facilities may have an increased number of chronic diseases, are frailer, 
more inactive, and perform worse on physical function tests. (Kang, White, Hayes, & Snow, 
2016; Mihalko & Wickley, 2003; Wert, Talkowski, Brach, & VanSwearingen, 2010) Retirement 
communities and residential living facilities can be an important setting to consider when 
delivering physical activity interventions to older adults.  
 
Rosenberg et al. (2012) found that facility-dwelling older adults found a walking intervention to 
be feasible and effective for improving participants’ daily steps, cognitive function. 
neighborhood barriers (i.e., hills, crime, traffic, unsafe crossing, or lack of places to walk) and 
satisfactions with walking opportunities (i.e., satisfaction with walking and exercise 
opportunities at their site, local area, and access to safe walking routes). However, a major 
limitation from this study was that participants used a pedometer to self-report their daily 
physical activity. With improvements in technology and the increasing use of wearable activity 
monitors, researchers can increase the quality of reliability of these study designs. 
 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS 
The physical risks include possible fatigue, and/or injury from participating in physical activity. 
There is a potential of loss of confidentiality of data. The intervention will promote engagement 
in low to moderate intensity physical activity which poses a low risk for injury.

4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
Little physical activity research has been done within retirement communities, even though this is an 
optimal environment to deliver multilevel interventions (Jancey et al., 2017). Limitations with studies 
done in retirement communities include using a self-report measure of physical activity (Gallagher, 
Clarke, & Carr, 2016). Furthermore, studies were either not grounded in behavior change theory 
(Thompson, Kuhle, Koepp, McCrady-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Levine, 2014), or participants were not able to monitor 
their physical activity each day, receiving real-time feedback (Kerr et al., 2018). Similarly, there have 
been few mHealth physical activity interventions conducted with older adults. Of these studies, 
limitations include not clarifying if behavior change theory was used to drive the intervention design 
(Jonkman et al., 2018), and self-report measure of physical activity were used (Kim & Glanz, 2013; 
Muller, Khoo, & Morris, 2016). Finally, to our knowledge little research has been done on gamification of 
wearable activity monitors (Gremaud et al., 2018), specifically among older adults living in retirement 
communities. 
  
Our team has developed a mHealth intervention called MapTrek (Gremaud et al., 2018). MapTrek is a 
mobile-phone based walking game, grounded in behavioral theory that places participants into virtual 
walking races for the purpose of encouraging more daily physical activity throughout the day. MapTrek 
was designed to be fun, engaging and interactive.  In a recent trial, we found MapTrek to be feasible and 
efficacious at increasing physical activity among healthy sedentary office workers (Gremaud et al., 
2018). Participants were randomized to a MapTrek intervention or a Fitbit control group. Participants in 
the MapTrek group took an average of 1,455 more steps/day than the control group. At the start of the 
intervention, MapTrek participants immediately increased their steps by 2,183 steps/day beyond the 
control group. After the intervention started, both groups started to decrease their average steps/day 
back to baseline values. The MapTrek group decayed significantly faster at 44.8 steps/day compared to 
the control group at 24.3 steps/day. Conversely, 70.9% of participants reported MapTrek increased their 
perceived level of support to be physically active, 77.7% felt motivated to be more active, 70.2% 
reported MapTrek was a fun, and 93.1% of participants reported MapTrek was easy to play (Gremaud et 
al., 2018). While these outcomes suggest MapTrek was effective for middle-aged adults in the 
community, we have not yet tested this approach among older adults.  We believe MapTrek could be 
adapted for use and effective for increasing physical activity levels of older adults living in retirement 
communities. With the large and growing number of inactive older adults in the U.S., it is crucial that we 
identify effective and scalable approaches for promoting physical activity among older adults.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION 
6.1.[ADDRESS_80508] two weeks were used to collected baseline data, where participants wore their Fitbit, 
but did not receive access to the MapTrek intervention. During the baseline period a kick-off event was 
held to answer participant’s questions, and to give participants their team colored wrist bands. 
Participants were placed into one of three teams, and stayed on these teams for the duration of the 
intervention. Three teams were used to help foster competition in the event that one team was walking 
significantly more or less steps than the others. 
After the two-week baseline period, participants received access to MapTrek and competed in four, two 
week-long races. Four two-week races were used so that teams had the opportunity to walk meaningful 
distances along each route (e.g., walking on the Grand Canyon Trail). The teams were assigned a new 
virtual walking route every two weeks. The team with the most steps at the end of two weeks were the 
winners. 
  
We made environmental change to Oaknoll. Participants were encouraged to walk by [CONTACT_73755]. A small Raspberry Pi [INVESTIGATOR_73744]. The Raspberry Pi [CONTACT_832] a credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or 
TV to be used as a normal desktop. Two other Raspberry Pi [INVESTIGATOR_73745]. As participants walked by, their Fitbit data synced to the Raspberry Pi. The 
Raspberry Pi [INVESTIGATOR_73746] (a) participants did not have to manually sync their Fitbit 
and (b) participants who did not have a computer or smartphone could still participate. Every two weeks 
during the intervention a new walking route was revealed. The teams will be competing against each 
other, and their total number of steps will be used to move their character on the map. The map routes 
were Seattle to San Diego (1,936 miles), through Arizona, Colorado, and Utah (2,194 miles), from New 
York through Key West to Pensacola, FL (2,422 miles), and from Vancouver to Minnesota down the

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 17Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_73747] (2,540 mils). We made sure each route was long enough in case every 
team member walked ~5 miles/day. 
  
Three TV monitors were placed in public areas which displayed the virtual walking map, google maps 
view of the walking route, team leaderboard, and daily news. The daily news displayed messages each 
day that were developed based on Social Cognitive Theory (Appendix H). These behavior-change 
techniques addressed specific barriers to physical activity that older adults face such as health concerns, 
motivation and beliefs, low self-efficacy, access difficulties, and social support. 
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING 
The TV monitors displaying MapTrek will stay on during the entire 8-week intervention. The daily news 
will be updated once per day at 7:00AM CST.

height (in.) and weight (lb.). Body-mass index (BMI) will be calculated using the formula weight (lb.) / 
[height (in.)]2. 
  
Aim 1: Physical activity . At the beginning of the study, participants were given a Fitbit Zip activity 
monitor to wear on the wrist for [ADDRESS_80517] lower wear-time compliance. The Fitbit Zip is 
a small (35.6 x 28.9 x 9.6 mm) commercially-available triaxial accelerometer-based physical activity 
monitor that estimates steps taken per day. The Fitbit (One or Zip) worn on the hip has been 
demonstrated as a valid and reliable measure of average steps/day among community dwelling older 
adults compared to the ActiGraph GT3X+ (ICC=0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97) (Paul et al., 2015). Through the 
Fitbit application programming interface, the research team will be able to access each participant’s 
physical activity data minute-by-minute each day the activity monitor is worn. Participants were 
instructed to wear the monitor during all waking hours (except time spent swimming or bathing) for 
thirteen consecutive weeks. 
  
Aim 2: Psychosocial outcomes.  This will be measured with the Self-Efficacy for Exercise (SEE) scale, a 13-
item questionnaire designed to assess the participant’s self-efficacy related to their ability to continue 
exercising in the face of barriers 
  
Outcome expectations will be measured with the Outcome Expectations for Exercise (OEE) Scale. The 
OEE is a valid and reliable 9-item scale that assess the participant’s outcome expectations and benefits 
associated with exercise.  
  
Social isolation will be assessed with the Friendship Scale (FS). The FS is a 6-item scale that assesses six 
dimension contributing to social isolation. 
  
Aim 3: Satisfaction and adherence. To assess the acceptability of the intervention, we will measure 
participant adherence and satisfaction. Acceptability is important to assess because we want to be able 
to determine if older adults thought MapTrek was a fun game for increasing physical activity. 
Specifically, we will be able to determine which intervention features they thought were helpful. 
Adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_73760], completion, and compliance rates. 
Enrollment rate will be assessed by [CONTACT_73761], and completion rate will be assessed by [CONTACT_73762] 1.[ADDRESS_80518] 2019
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.[ADDRESS_80519] week after the active intervention. The process evaluation was used to assess the participant’s 
satisfaction with the game features. Participants were asked what they most liked about the game, what 
barriers prevented them from playing the game, and what improvements they would recommend. This 
information will be used when developi[INVESTIGATOR_73748]. Focus groups (6-8 participants) will be held the third 
week of the follow-up timepoint.

intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related. 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.

to the study design. The medical director will determine whether the AE was related (reasonable 
possibility event was caused by [CONTACT_73764]) or unrelated (not reasonable possibility) to the 
participant's study participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS 
It is possible that participants could report musculoskeletal complications and/or cardiopulmonary 
complications that have been associated with vigorous bouts of physical activity. However, the 
intervention will not prescribe vigorous intensity activity, rather walking at a low to moderate intensity 
will be encouraged.  
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
Our team will continually be monitoring participant's progress in the study. Participants will be advised 
to contact [CONTACT_73765]. Our team will 
be checking our email and voicemail daily.

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): We hypothesize that participants will increase their average steps/day from 
baseline to the initial adoption of the active intervention, there will be a significant difference in average 
steps/day from baseline to the last week of the active intervention, there will be a significant difference in 
average steps/day from baseline to the follow-up phase post-active intervention, participants will 
experience a decrease in average steps/day each day from the start of the 8-week intervention to the 
end. two to week eight. 
  
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): We hypothesize participants will increase their feelings of social support, 
self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, and decrease their feeling of social isolation from baseline to 
post-active intervention. We hypothesize this will be an acceptable multilevel mHealth intervention 
among older adults living in a retirement community.

We will used mixed-effect models to Repeated measures ANOVA. 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 
Student’s T Test will be used to test the mean scores for social support, self-efficacy, and outcome 
expectations, and social isolation from baseline to post-intervention. A simple linear regression will be 
used to examine the linear relationship between changes in psychosocial outcomes and changes in 
physical activity.  
  
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, SD, frequency) and qualitative analysis will be used to analyze 
acceptability outcomes from the process evaluation.

1) Objectives  
• Aim #1a:  To compare the parent/family experience of care and distress at [ADDRESS_803897] model of care and 
the VPTC model of care.  
o Null Hypothesis: Measures of parent/family experience of care and 
measures of distress will be similar between the two models of care.  
• Aim #1b: To compare the frequency of potentially avoidable transfers (PAT) and transfers in a non- pediatric trauma center under the current standard model of care 
and the VPTC model of care.  
o Null hypothesis: Frequency of PATs and transfers will be similar between the two models of care.  
• Aim #2: To compare 30- day healthcare utilization between injured children cared 
for under the current standard model of care and the VPTC model of care.  
o Null Hypothesis: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], primary and 
specialty care visits will be similar between the two models of care.  
• Aim #3:  To compare the out -of-pocket costs and financial burdens experienced 
by [CONTACT_3654]/families at [ADDRESS_803898] model of care a nd the VPTC model of care.  
o Null Hypothesis: Out -of-pocket costs and financial burdens for 
parent/families will be similar between the two models of care.  
 
2) Background 
The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS -COT) has been 
committed to improving the care provided to injured patients since 1922. An essential component of their efforts has been the creation of minimum standards for trauma facilities and a tiered trauma care system. As detailed in the ACS -COT published 
guidelines, Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient ,
[ADDRESS_803899] level of care to all injured patients. The ACS -COT Trauma Center Verification 
process has been instrumental in improving outcomes among injured children and adults, and has become the national model of trauma care coordination as well as the prototype for trauma care on an international level.

  Template Revision: January 17, [ADDRESS_803900] of care  has created disparities in access for patients injured in 
geographically isolated locations. When children living in remote communities are 
injured and present to a non- pediatric trauma center emergency department (ED), they 
are transferred to the regionalized Level I pediatric trauma center.[ADDRESS_803901] advocated for the use of telemedicine so that the Level I pediatric trauma center expertise can be transmitted to the receiving EDs where a majority of pediatric trauma patients initially present.
9-12 This newer system of 
care has been commonly referred to as the “Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center” (VPTC) and is increasingly used by [CONTACT_606828][INVESTIGATOR_606818].
12,[ADDRESS_803902]. While this newer model of  care enables 
participation of parents/families in the initial trauma care, there is conflicting and limited literature comparing this model to the current standard of care as it relates to 
parent/family -experience and distress, healthcare utilization, and  financial impact on 
parents/families.

6) Procedures Involved  
Systems Level Intervention  
To compare our parent, family, community and provider informed outcomes 
between the current standard of care and the VPTC, we will use a prospective stepped-
wedge trial design,[ADDRESS_803905] study design where

Page 5 of 11   HRP -503-PTOTOCOL TEMPLATE- General  
  Template Revision: January 17, [ADDRESS_803906] been concurrently randomized to two different models of care. In addition, the stepped-wedge design has an important statistical power advantage over a parallel -groups cluster -randomized trial. The latter 
design suffers a loss of statistical power that arises from within -cluster correlation (ICC), 
even when ICC is as modest as 5%, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_606820] -of-care outcomes.

7) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality  
☒ I understand that if this study involves the use of   the UC Davis Health 
Electronic Health Record (EMR/EPIC) also contains the clinical data for Marshall Medical Center (MMC). I understand that MMC patient data cannot be accessed for research purposes and that I must take the necessary steps to ensure that M MC data is not accessed, used, or 
disclosed for UC Davis Health research purposes. 
☐ I undersand that i f this study involves use of UC Davis students’ 
educational records (including records in the PI’s own possession such as course exams/assignments), I must consult with the Registrar’s office to 
see if all requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) are satisfied.   
This study is evaluating a systems-level intervention; a system- level intervention means 
that we are doing an intervention on how we deliver healthcare. In other words, our 
intervention is a test of change to the healthcare system. Because we are doing a systems 
level intervention, we need to evaluate outcomes on all  the eligible patient transfer 
consultations. Our outcomes include transfers and potentially avoidable transfers. We therefore need to know if all the transfers, among our eligible patients were "avoidable or potentially avoidable" or not. The outcome data (and our research study) would be not useful if we can only gather data the patients who were consented. It is not feasible to get consent from every patient's parent.  
Doing a systems intervention and only evaluating the outcomes on the patients who 
return a HIPAA authorization would make the study not valid. It is therefore not possible 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center  
Page 7 of 11   HRP -503-PTOTOCOL TEMPLATE- General  
  Template Revision: January 17, 202 0 to do the research without the waiver, because a systems intervention study requires 
evaluating the outcomes on all the patients involved in order to be valid. 
In summary, rationale for the waiver of HIPAA and waiver of consent for the data 
abstraction include: (1) The use or disclosure of protected health care information 
involves no more than minimal risk; (2) the research could not practicably be conducted 
without the waiver or alteration; and (3) the research could not practicably be conducted 
without access to and use of the PHI.  
All study personnel involved in this proposed project have received Human Subjects 
Protection and HIPAA education. 
Data Analysis Plan/Statistical Procedures:  
Regression analyses will be conducted within a generalized linear mixed model framework for multilevel data (patients nested within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]), with random effects for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_606824]-unit heterogeneity.
65-67 A within -site time -varying binary indicator (VPTC vs. standard 
of care) will be included in the model to permit estimating the key contrasts of interest. For linear -normal mixed models (e.g., experience of care and distress), 
effect sizes will be adjusted  mean differences; for binary and count outcomes 
fitted with logistic and Poisson regression models, respectively, effect sizes will be adjusted odds and rate ratios, respectively. For outcomes assessed at both 3-days and 30-days after injury, we anticipat e estimating time point- specific 
contrasts of the VPTC vs. standard of care groups. To do this, models will also include a binary indicator for time point (3 day vs. 30 day) as well as interactions of time point with the time -varying treatment group indicator. Additional 
independent variables will include a parsimonious and pre- specified set of patient -
level effects to account for study design effects and to improve the precision of estimated effects, accounting for known sources of heterogeneity.
66,68,69 To 
account for confounding by [CONTACT_606831]-wedge design,62 we will 
compute each patient’s date at enrollment in the study and use fractional polynomial modeling to determine the order of polynomial (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) to specify the calendar date of enrollment effects, to account for temporal effects .

  Template Revision: January 17, 202 0 11) Risks to Subjects  
There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality; however, for all data, only 
study personnel will have access to these materials. All data will be destroyed 7 years after completion of the study. 
Because this specific  intervention has never been tested at UC Davis  (though 
telemedicine has been used in these emergency departments for many years for 
other pediatric patients) , it is possible that there are unforeseen risks to the 
intervention. This is why monitoring the implementation outcomes are important —the study team will be closely observing the implementation for any 
unforeseen risks and will take immediate action if an y risks are identified. Based 
on prior studies that have used this technology, it is highly unlikely that this intervention will cause any risk. 
 
12) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Patients who receive a telemedicine consultation may find benefit.  
 
13) Multi -Site Research  
N/A  
14) Community -Based Participatory Research  
In preparation for the original proposal for this study, we conducted three meetings with 
community advisory boards, which laid the foundation for the study design and 
evaluation . For the resubmission of that proposal, we reconvened with members from 
each of these boards to focus more on parent/family- centered measures. Our team of 
clinical investigators, consortium hospi[INVESTIGATOR_606825] , as well as our two broadly 
representative community advisory boards, are confident that these two models of care can be effectively compared, and that the results will provide important solutions to problems facing families wanting to improve specialized trauma care for children. As highlighted in the PCORI Research Prioritization Topic Brief entitled, “Rural Trauma Care,” impr oving rural trauma care is a “high- impact target.”
[ADDRESS_803912] an injured child immediately transferred to the regional Level I pediatric trauma center, so delaying or avoiding the transfer of an injured child to a better equipped and staffed facility could result in increased parent/family distress, healthcare utilization, and out -of-
pocket costs. Hence, a rigorous comparison of the two prevailing models of care is needed to inform the choice between them.

As described above, doing a systems intervention and only evaluating the outcomes 
on the patients who return a HIPAA authorization would make the study not valid. It is therefore not possible to do the research without the waiver, because a systems intervention study requires evaluating the outcomes on all the patients involved in order to be valid. The  rationale for the waiver of HIPAA and waiver of 
consent include: (1) The use or disclosure of protected health care information involves no more than minimal risk; (2) the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration; and (3) the research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.

 1.0 PROTOCOL  
 
Study Design Overview: This is a Phase III Clinical Trial.  Our overall  goals are to evaluate the 
effectiveness of nonoperative and operative interventions in patients with adult symptomatic lumbar 
scoliosis (ASLS) and to identify important clinical and radiographic determinants of change in patient -
reported HRQOL. To accomplish t hese goals, a 5 -year cooperative, multi -center longitudinal randomized 
study with a concurrent observational cohort is proposed.  
 
Specific Aim #1: Compare the outcomes of surgery and nonoperative treatment in patients aged 40 
to 80 with ASLS defined as a l umbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement of 30° or more, and 
either of the following: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 20 or more; or Scoliosis Research 
Society Quality of Life (SRS -QOL) instrument score of 4.0 or less, in the domains of pain, f unction 
and/or appearance.  
Null Hypothesis: Nonoperative and operative treatment groups will have similar outcomes at follow -
up. 
 
Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the impact of patient factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status, 
education) and comorbidities [ment al health, body mass index (BMI) and bone mineral density 
(BMD)] on adverse events and treatment outcomes for both the non -operative and operative arms. 
Incorporate these variables into a prediction model to help identify those patients most likely to 
benefit from either a surgical or non -operative approach.  
Hypothesis: Age, gender, socioeconomic status, education, and comorbi dities will have an impact on 
the final result at [ADDRESS_310418] to average 20 patients per year, to reach a targeted 
enrollment of 300 patien ts over 3 years.  
As summarized in the flow chart shown in Figure 1 eligible patients at each site will be informed 
about the study and will be able to participate in one of two ways. Those agreeing to randomization will be 
randomized to operative or non -operative care, while those willing to participate in the study but not 
accepting random treatment assignment will be followed in a prospective observational cohort. The primary 
outcome measure will be longitudinal change in disease -specific quality of life  as measured by [CONTACT_255560] -Quality of Life  (SRS -QOL) s ubscore . 
We plan to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_310419] 90% 
participation and about 30% randomization,  resulting in a total of about [ADDRESS_310420] alone.   
 
 
1.1 Eligible Par ticipants: This is a study of patients  
 aged 40 to 80 years with  
 ASLS defined as  
o lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and  
o either of the following :  
 Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥ 20 or  
 SRS-QOL score ≤ 4.0 in the domains of pain, function and/or appearance.   
 If assigned to surgical intervention  (by [CONTACT_255561]), the intervention plan 
would include, at a minimum, the Cobb levels of the Thoracolumbar/lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Adult Symptomatic Lumbar Scoliosis (ASLS) NIH RO1 AR055176 -01A2  
 
Version 12 ; Protocol amended  1/23/[ADDRESS_310421] providers would not recommend major 
surgical procedures of this nature for these patients in this age group due to the increased risk of 
perioperative morbidity and mortality. Eligibility fo r participation is not restricted based on gender, ethnicity 
or principle language.  
Excluded from participation are patients with any of the following factors:  
 Substantial cardiac, pulmonary, renal or metabolic disease that, in the judgment of the surgical  
team, would preclude performing an operative procedure without undue risk of morbidity and 
mortality  
 Concomitant high -grade spondylolisthesis (Grade 3)   
 Prior thoracic or multiple level lumbar laminectomy or decompression [single  or two  level lumbar 
decompression (e.g., herniated disc) will not be an exclusion]  
 Prior thoracic or lumbar fusion  
 Osteoporosis evidence by a dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) T -score < -3.0 at the 
femoral neck for patients considered to be at risk ( post-menopausal  females , males > [ADDRESS_310422] organ transplantation, etc.).  Patients 
may be randomized prior to obtaining DEXA results.  Non-Surgical  patients may initiate non-
surgical  treatments prior to completion of DE XA (if required) as non-surgical  treatments will not 
affect DEXA results BUT DEXA must be completed and results entered within [ADDRESS_310423] are provided.   
 Neuromuscular scoliosis (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902], cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s Disease, post -
polio syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth  disease)  
 Congenital scoliosis in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Congenital anomalies of the cervical or thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_255541].   
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_255542], infection or connective tissue disorder  
 Cognitively impaired or unable/unwilling to comply with follow -up 
 Pregnancy or planning on conceiving during time of study involvement  
 Ankylosing Spondylitis  
 Past history of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty of the thoracic or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_255543] (ASLS) NIH RO1 AR055176 -01A2

1.2 Identification and Enrollment : Site investigators and/or research coordinators will identify potential 
study participants based on patient history, physical exam, radiographs and HRQOL scores. See Section 19 
Administrative Forms:  Screening Checklist. Patients meeting inclusion/exclus ion criteria will be offered 
study participation.  Potential patients will view a short video regarding study participation.     
Eligible patients not consenting to study participation will be entered into the electronic database in a 
de-identified manner.  Age, gender, inclusion criteria and reason for declining participation will be 
documented.  
  
1.3 Randomization and Observational Cohort Assignments: Patients consenting to randomization will 
be randomized 1:1 to the non -operative or operative interventio n arms. A permuted randomized block 
approach1 with blocks of size 4, 6 and 8 and stratified by [CONTACT_3725], age group (2 levels: 40 -59 years of age, 60 -
80 years of age), gender and Cobb angle -based severity (2 levels: 30 -54°, 55 -100°) will be used to ensure 
representative treatment assignment across these d emographic and disease -specific categories with 
approximately balanced assignment totals at interim intervals as well. Based on preliminary data, we 
anticipate that 57% of participants will be in the younger age category and 43% in the older age category.  
Patient loss to follow -up can affect the randomization balance and quality. When a patient is lost to 
follow -up prior to treatment or because of an administrative error, such as qualifying a patient for inclusion in Not eligible for enrollment  Patients seeki ng treatment

Version 12 ; Protocol amended  1/23/[ADDRESS_310424], study inclusio n criteria were not met or exclusion criteria were initially missed, these 
patients will be removed from the study along with all study data. The guidelines for removing a patient from 
the study will follow the ICH guidelines; subjects who fail to satisfy an entry criterion will be excluded from 
the analysis under the following circumstances:  
1. the entry criterion was measured prior to randomization;  
2. the detection of the relevant eligibility violations can be made completely objectively;  
3. all subjects recei ve equal scrutiny for eligibility violations; and  
4. all detected violations of the particular entry criterion are excluded.  
The study management plan is explicitly designed to minimize these events. Specifically, there will 
be electronic registration by [CONTACT_20226] e coordinator with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria assessment on the 
enrollment form and review of registration by [CONTACT_21124] (PM) at Washington University.   
In the observational cohort, the choice of nonoperative vs. operative care will be made by [CONTACT_255563]’s recommendation and presentation of existing data regarding nonoperative and 
operative care based on the following parameters:  Patients with clinical symptoms of pain and functional 
limitations that are well controlled with non -operative care will be encouraged to pursue nonoperative care. 
Patients who have not demonstrated access or utilization to previous nonoperative care for their symptoms 
will be directed to non -operative care as an initial treatment . Enrollments into the observational arms will be 
closed when each arm’s sample size is reached in order to achieve equal numbers of patients in each arm 
at the conclusion of the study.  
 
1.4 Study Interventions: Regardless of study cohort participation (ra ndomized or observational), 
interventions will not be implemented until the PM has confirmed appropriate enrollment. Nonoperative 
interventions will then be implemented as soon as possible. Due to the length and complexity of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255544], a vailable dates for elective operative procedures may range from [ADDRESS_310425] be completed 
within 6 months prior to intervention. Standardized protocol guidelines for nonoperative and operative 
treatment, as detailed below, will be followed by [CONTACT_255564].    
 
 1.4.1 Non -operative Techniques: To standardize non -operative  treatments, sites will utilize one physician 
from their center with experience and expertise in non -operative management of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255545] 
(physiatrist, rheumatologist, or internist). For patients who live far from the enrolling center, referr al to a local 
physiatrist will be made with a letter of introduction and a review of the proposed treatment plan from the 
study physician. A copy of the non -operative guidelines will be provided to all supervising nonoperative 
physicians.  
   The strategy f or non -operative care for all non -operative patients will include:  
1. Physical Therapy : Physical therapy will consist of treatment guided by [CONTACT_45332] a combination 
of:  core stabilization, resistance training, directional preference, movement based, manual 
therapy, treatment -based group classification, aquatic therapy.  Modalities will consist of 
strengthening arms and legs, improving aerobic conditioning, improving strength of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255546]. Physical therapy will include a combination of the following: water aerobics and/or 
reasonable forms of aerobic conditions. Strengthening of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255547]. Modalities for spi[INVESTIGATOR_255548], massage and transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS) units.   
2. Injection Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : Injections including epi[INVESTIGATOR_255549] a significant component of radicular pain. Patients with back pain from 
facet joints will be offered facet blocks and medial branch ablation. This care pathway  will be 
ordered by [CONTACT_255565], and enacted by  a specialist in injection therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For leg 
pain, if a specific lumbar nerve root appears to be involved, a selective nerve root injection will 
Adult Symptomatic Lumbar Scoliosis (ASLS) NIH RO1 AR055176 -01A2  
 
Version 12 ; Protocol amended  1/23/15  Page 5 
 be considered. If leg pain is diffuse and involves both lower extremities, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_255550].  
3. Pain Management : Medications including non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
narcotic analgesics will be used as appropriate. Medications will be started with non -steroidal 
and/or mild narcotics and only increased if necessary.  
4. Complemen tary and Alternative Approaches : Patients in this study may access alternative 
healthcare resources including massage, acupuncture, acupressure and behavioral programs in 
an effort to improve pain and function. Alternative modalities will be made available  to patients 
on a referral basis and the use of these modalities will be recorded for all patients. Weight loss 
will be strongly encouraged for body mass index (BMI) >27.  
 
 At each follow -up visit, patients will document the extent to which they have util ized these 4 
modalities.   
 
1.4.2 Operative Techniques:  Operative treatments have been standardized across all study  centers. Each 
center and surgeon will follow these guidelines. Therefore, surgical interventions should be completed at the 
study center so  the kinds of operative treatment the patients receive will be relatively uniform from center to 
center and from surgeon to surgeon.    
1. Extent of fusion: All spi[INVESTIGATOR_255551] a minimum the Cobb levels of the 
curve. Additionally , the surgical reconstruction should include a balanced (neutral in rotation and 
stable, meaning centered on the center sacral line) vertebral segment at each end. All 
degenerative, rotated or listhetic segments will be included in the reconstruction.  
2. Anterior release and inter -body grafting of the lumbar and thoracolumbar curves may be 
considered when the curve is rigid (i.e., does not reduce by 50% on push, side bending films, or 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_255552]).   
3. Pedicle subtraction and Smith -Petersen osteotomy can  be performed as an alternate to anterior 
release for coronal or sagittal correction in rigid deformities.   
4. All symptomatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_255553].  
5. Iliac bone graft and/or local bone will be used for fusion. This may be supplemented with bone 
growth factors and allograft.  
6. Segmental instrumentation (pedicle screw, hook, and rod) will be utilized for all reconstructions. 
A universal goal will be to achieve at least 1.[ADDRESS_310426]. Only rigid instrumentation systems will be implanted.  No 
Dynamic Stabilization Devices will be used.  No artificial disc replacements will be u sed in the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
7. Anterior structural support will frequently/usually be considered at L4 -L5 and L5 -S1, either as an 
anterior lumbar inter -body fusion (ALIF), posterior lumbar inter -body fusion (PLIF) or 
transforaminal lumbar inter -body fusion ( TLIF) approach in patients being fused to the sacrum.  
8. With fusion to the sacrum, 4 -point sacropelvic fixation  will be utilized in all circumstances, either 
in the form of four sacral screws or two sacral screws and two iliac screws.   
9.   Decompression/laminectomies will be warranted for segments with substantial spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], 
       both centrally and in the lateral recesses and in some cases in the foramen, when those  
       stenotic segments are judged to be substantially stenot ic and contributing to the patient’s            
       symptoms.  
10.   Surgeon judgment will be trusted on the fractional curve below.  Most lumbar scoliosis consists of 
a curve that more or less goes from T10 to L3 or L4 with another curve that goes the o ther way 
between L3 or L4 and the sacrum.  It will be expected that in most cases both these curves will be 
addressed and fused and instrumented.  There may be some exceptions.  There may be some 
cases in which the fractional curve is not included and ther e may be some cases in which the 
main curve is not included and only the fractional curve is included.  If both curves are not

 1.5.1 Data Collection and Forms :  (Please note, all Case Report Forms are located in Section 26).  
This is a five year study (with 2 year extension) in which all patients will have a minimum of 2 year 
follow up.  Additional 3, 4, 5 & 6  year follow up will depend upon when patient entered the study.    
If enrolled Year 1, participation in the study will be for 6 years.  
If enrolled Year 2, participation in the study will be for 5 years.  
If enrolled Year 3, participation in the study will be for 4 years.  
If enrolled Year 4, participation in the study will be for 3 years.  
If enrolled Year 5, participation in the study wil l be for 2 years.  
 
Patient Baseline Information:  Baseline covariates  will include: age, gender, medical history , socioeconomic 
status, and education level. In addition, we will capture patient symptoms, characterizing the percent of back 
pain and leg pain  through numerical rating scales (NRS).   
 
HRQOL:  Two HRQOL questionnaires will be collected (SRS -QOL, ODI) at baseline and specified follow -up 
intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42, [ADDRESS_310434] -intervention). In addition, the SF 12 
will be completed at baseline and annually .  All questionnaires will be administered by [CONTACT_255571].  
 SRS-QOL:  The SRS -QOL is a disease -specific instrument for the measurement of health status in 
patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262]. Age -gender norms exist for the non -deformity adult population. The SRS -
QOL questionnaire has been fully validated in adult spi[INVESTIGATOR_255555] y patients. It is reproducible, reliable, 
and sensitive to change. The questionnaire has four domains: pain, function, self -image and mental 
health. Domain values and subscore ( a summary over the 4 domains ) are reported as an average 
score for each domain (1-5). A score of 5 implies no pathology and a score of 1 implies maximum 
pathology. There are 2 satisfaction questions scored in similar fashion: [ADDRESS_310435] -treatment to 
assess patient feelings regarding QOL improvement and to document satisfaction.  
 Oswestry Disability Index:  The ODI is a disease -specific measure of disability associated with back 
pain. The instrument is a [ADDRESS_310436] been established for 
defining a clinically significant difference in scores. The ODI scoring is on a 0 -100 point scale (0 implies 
no pathology and 100 implies the maximum pathology).  
 Short Form -12: The SF -12 is a self -administered, generic HRQOL measure derived from the Rand 
Health Insurance Long Form. The SF -12 is validated for the U.S. with age and gender normal values. 
This instrume nt provides mental and physical component scales (MCS, PCS) for translating health 
status and changes in health status between cohorts of patients with distinct disorders. Previous 
studies in adult scoliosis have used the SF -[ADDRESS_310437] 
been validated.  
 
Progress & Satisfaction questionnaire.   This is a brief, four item questionnaire for the patient to document 
satisfaction with treatment and tr eatment assignment.  This questionnaire will be completed at  the time of the 
office visit or by [CONTACT_2319].   The questionnaire is also completed at the time of crossover and prior to any revision 
surgery.  
 
Functional Treadmill test:   All patients will have a standardized functional treadmill test performed at baseline 
and [ADDRESS_310438] is performed routinely at Washington University and has been published 
in The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery . (See Appendix for d etails ).  
If a Non-Surgical  patient crosses over to the Surgical arm and tentative surgery date is prior to [ADDRESS_310439] will be delayed until the patient is 2 year s/p CROSSOVER surgical 
procedure.

MOOP Version12, Protocol amended 1/23/[ADDRESS_310440].  Patient and site (physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) will 
be reimbursed for all three treadmill tests.    
 
MD Clinical and Radiographic Assessment : The physician and/or research coordinator will complete clinical 
assessments capturing pertinent neurologic and/or physical findings and comorbidities at baseline and clinical 
follow -up appointments (required at 3, 12, 24, 36 , 48 & [ADDRESS_310441] -intervention with capability to compete 
as needed at all study intervals). Baseline clinical assessment will include recording of comorbidities, BMI and 
bone mineral density (BMD). Baseline BMD (femoral neck t score) will be  captured by [CONTACT_722] X -ray 
absorptiometry, or DEXA, which is most widely used and accepted as an accurate, economic and noninvasive 
predictor of BMD for postmenopausal females, males 60 years or older, or any patient in which it is clinically 
indicated  (e.g.  steroid dependent, post organ transplantation, etc.)  DEXA machines have a standard 
reference (called NHANES III ) that can be used for all machines, regardless of manufacturer. BMD obtained 
via qualitative CT, peripheral DEXA scan or ultrasound is not acceptable. Since degenerative spi[INVESTIGATOR_255556] t scores  will be recorded. Waivers will be 
provided for patients meeting inclusion criteria who have had bilateral total hip replacements only if t score of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_255557].   
 
Specified radiographic parameters (coronal and sagittal balance; coronal and sagittal Cobb 
measurements) based on long cassette radiographs will be captured at baseline and clinical follow -up 
appointments  (3 months for operative arm only and at 12, 24, 36 , 48 & [ADDRESS_310442] -intervention for both 
arms).   Fusion mass will be assessed by [CONTACT_255572] L5 -S1 (if fused to 
the sacrum) at two years post intervention for patie nts treated surgically, if considered standard care at the 
participating centers.            
 
Medical History & Medication Log :  This is a source document to capture baseline medical problems.  It will be 
reviewed at each clinical follow -up to ensure accura te capture and reporting of any adverse events.  Data 
collected on this source document will be used to complete Monitored Events and MD Clinical Assessment 
CRFs.    
 
Surgical Summary : For patients managed operatively, a surgical summary will be completed by [CONTACT_255573]. Data captured will include, but not be limited to:  blood loss, length of surgery, surgical 
approach, and vertebral levels involved. Equally important will be the reporting of any intra -operative adverse 
events, as well perioperative adverse events occurring prior to discharge. Procedural codes (CPT codes) will 
also be reported.  
 
Patient Intervention Follow -Up: All participants will complete a comprehensive description of the nonoperative 
modalities used, and the frequency of use will be detailed (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42 , 48, 60 & [ADDRESS_310443] -intervention). These assessments will be part of the standard questionnaires given at each study 
follow -up. Patient diaries will be used as memory aids but will not be used for primary data collection. Any 
adverse events stemming from nonoperative or operative treatments will be recorded along with changes in 
health history.  
 
Monitored Events : Sites will complete a Monitored Events Case Report Form (CRF) at each clinical follow -up 
appointment to report:  Serious or Unexpected but reasonably related adverse events (AEs), Crossover to the 
other intervention, or exiting the study.   In addition, sites will complete this form as  applicable with each patient

Due Diligence Report :  This report will be run by [CONTACT_255574].   The report will calculate differences in previously reported HRQOL value.  Any patient 
with a decrease of -0.5 in the SRS domains or an increase of 10 or more points in the ODI score warrant 
further investigation.

The primary outcome variable will be the change in SRS-QOL  subscore  because the literature supports 
this questionnaire as a more disease -specific tool for assessment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255558].  The concurrent validity 
of the SRS -QOL function domain compared favorably to the SF -12 PCS (r=0.73) and t he ODI (r=0.87), as did 
the SRS -QOL mental health domain compared to the SF -12 MCS (r=0.87).  Thus, the SRS -QOL is especially 
suited to our study population and research questions. Changes in ODI and SF -12 will also be assessed as 
they are  frequently used measures of QOL and will facilitate comparison of our findings with those of others.  
 
1.5.2 Data Collection Procedures: Site research coordinators will identify , consent and enroll eligible 
participants in the study. After obtaining patie nt consent, the site coordinator will electronically register 
participants through a secure Web site. Registration information will include demographic information and 
documentation of inclusion criteria to minimize inappropriate enrollment. Randomization software will generate 
an intervention assignment upon completion of registration for patients agreeing to randomization. Site 
coordinators will notify the PM of patient enrollment via alpha pager. Site coordinators will provide 
questionnaire packages at s tudy entry (all patients), at [ADDRESS_310444] -
treatment clinical visit. In addition, questionnaire packets will be mailed to participants at 6, 9, 15, 18, 21, 30 , 
42 & [ADDRESS_310445] 2 years , every 6 months years 3 & 4 and annually thereafter.   
Radiogr aphic images will also be electronically uploaded to the database for measurement, future 
retrieval and review. An independent, blinded, experienced orthopedic spi[INVESTIGATOR_255559] -up visits.   The surgeon will be blinded to patient, site and 
surgeon identification and he will not enroll or treat any study participants, thus eliminating the potential threat 
for bias if sites measured their own patient films.  In addition, the blinded surgeon wi ll assess fusion mass on 
participants receiving surgical treatment by [CONTACT_255575] (standing AP and lateral, right and 
left oblique views of the surgical site, and, if fused to the sacrum, a Ferguson AP L5 -S1).  Results will be 
recorded on  the Radiographic Assessment form and entered into the database.  In addition, Clinical 
Assessment forms will be completed at baseline and annual follow -up visits to document physical and medical 
findings, including adverse events and complications.  
Data c apture will occur via REDCap, a secure Web -based data input interface available in each 
participating center’s research facility . This Web -based secure data capture, data storage and data 
transmission system is maintained by [CONTACT_2370]. To impro ve data accuracy, double data entry will 
be implemented. Immediate data clarifications will be generated at the time of data entry for missing 
responses, out -of-range responses, and/or inconsistencies in responses that break established validity rules. 
The REDCap application is fully HIPAA -(Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act) compliant and will 
have thorough testing and validation processes in place. Baseline data will be entered within 24 hours of 
enrollment, before study  interventions are activated. Follow -up data will be entered within 1 week of a patient’s 
visit.  
 Site coordinators and PIs will receive a monthly Upcoming Events Report via email. This report will be 
generated by [CONTACT_255576] b e due for a clinic visit in the upcoming [ADDRESS_310446] due follow -up will be 
sent to the site coordinator and PI.   
Patients will be encouraged to return to the primary center for examination, radiographs and 
questionnaires at the designated intervals. If the patient is unable to return to the center, they will be

MOOP Version12, Protocol amended 1/23/15  Page 11 
 encouraged to complete questionnaires and radiographic studies locally and mail them to the primary center at 
the intervals required by [CONTACT_4690].  
Acceptable windows for data collection are as follows:  
 Baseline data must be completed prior to intervention initiation, specifically:  
 Site and patient completed forms, functional treadmill test completed within 6 months prior 
intervention initiation,  
 Radiographs (standing AP and lateral entire spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) compl eted within 6 months prior to 
intervention and  
 DEXA scan  of femoral neck*  (if applicable) completed within 24 months prior to enrollment and 
prior to intervention* * UNLESS patient meets any of the following criteria, in which DEXA must 
be completed 12 mon ths prior to intervention:  
o Taking an FDA approved drug for the treatment of osteoporosis  
o History of fracture in the past year  
o Has taken Prednisone on a long term basis  
o Most recent DEXA scan t score was -2.5 or worse.  
*Waivers will be provided for patients meeting inclusion criteria who have had bilateral total hip 
replacements only if t score of spi[INVESTIGATOR_255557].   
* *Patients enrolled in the NON surgical arm may initiate non-surgical  treatment  measures but 
must have DEXA completed (if required)  within [ADDRESS_310447] intervention.  
 Interim questionnaires/assessments  will be mailed and posted to database +/ - 30 days of scheduled 
event (6, 9, 15, 18, 21, [ADDRESS_310448] intervention).   
 One year follow -up must be completed11 months to [ADDRESS_310449] intervention .  Patient s 
who reach the 4 year milestone prior to end of current grant funding (Aug. 30, 2016 ) will be asked to sign a  
revise d informed consent to include 5 year clinical visit  and 72 month interim mailing  if applicable ).   
 
1.5.3 Patient Compliance: To enhance patient compliance and participation, the site coordinators will mail 
interim questionnaires to all study participants at 6, 9, 15, 18, 21, 30 , 42, & [ADDRESS_310450] -intervention clinical 
appointment visits (3, 12, 24, 36 , 48 & 60 months). Furthermore, participants wi ll be reimbursed for time and 
travel associated with completion of HRQOLs questionnaires, treadmill tests, radiographic and clinical exams.  
In the event that subjects do not return for a scheduled follow -up visit, or fail to return mailed 
questionnaires i n a timely manner (within four weeks of mailing), site coordinators will contact [CONTACT_255577]/or e -mail. After two failed attempts, site coordinators will send a U.S. Postal Service certified 
letter to the subject’s last known address. Addres s change service will be requested with all mailings. If 
certified mailings are returned undeliverable with no forwarding address, site coordinators will notify the PM, 
who will then conduct Internet searches and fee -based searches, such as ChoicePoint, to  locate missing 
subjects.  
Any patient deciding not to return to &/or continue treatment at the study will continue to be followed by 
[CONTACT_255578], if the patient is willing.  A monitored events report will be completed to document this 
change in pati ent and treatment status  (Discontinued treatment/Follow up continued ).  Sites will mail QOLs to 
patients at interim and clinical follow up intervals.  Site will follow up with patient if Due Diligence Report 
reaches contact [CONTACT_255579], to clarify any questionable patient information, &/or follow up on any questionnaires 
not returned.  Site will ask patient to mail x -rays at annual milestones, as outlined in the protocol.  Follow up 
MD assessments will only document treatments actually prescribed/recommended the Study PI (not MD from 
outside institutions).

MOOP Version12, Protocol amended 1/23/[ADDRESS_310451] Manag er (PM) . In addition to confirming appropriate participant study enrollment the PM will be 
responsible for tracking and monitoring productivity at all centers to further ensure complete and accurate data. 
It will be the responsibility of this individual to  strive for 100% follow -up in both nonoperative and operative 
arms of the study.  
The PM will have 24 hour/day access to the data collected and stored on study patients. The PM will 
query the database on a daily basis to monitor each site’s productivity (e nrollment and follow -up). Likewise, the 
sites will have access to the PM via alpha pager.   
Responsibilities of PM : 
 Develop an operations manual.  
 Provide detailed training of site coordinators upon study initiation at start -up meetings and throughout 
the remainder of the study via conference calls and site visits. Conference calls with the PM and site 
coordinators will be held weekly until all sites are actively participating and comfortable with the study 
protocol, with decreasing frequency as study needs dictate.  
 Visit each site at the time of, or soon after, the first subject has been enrolled to ensure completeness 
of protocol procedures.  
 Conduct monitoring visits to the sites once per year during active enrollment.  
 Ensure the appropriate inclusion/exc lusion of each patient in the study.  
 Maintain a list of study participants (site, cohort and intervention arm).  
 Maintain a list of eligible participants who decline study participation and reason for decline.   
 Track and ensure complete data entry on all patients. Contact [CONTACT_255580].  
 Create and provide monthly site reports for upcoming study events due (clinical visits and questionnaire 
mailings).  
 Review each Protocol Variances with Lead Investigator.  Action plans for each variance will be 
determined based on the individual variance.   
 Perform random checks of critical parameters on films measured by [CONTACT_255581].  
Discrepanci es >10 degrees in Cobb measurements or 10mm in linear measurements will be resolved 
through discussions with PM and independent observer.  Measurements will include:    
o Major Cobb angle of the lumbar curve  
o Sagittal Cobb angle from T12 to the sacrum  
o Sagitta l Cobb angle from T5 to T12  
o Sagittal Cobb angle from T10 to L2  
o C7 plumb relative to the sacrum (coronal balance) on standing long cassette radiographs  
o C7 plumb relative to the sacrum (sagittal balance) on standing long cassette radiographs  
 Troubleshoot pot ential site issues through, but not limited to:  
o Tracking frequency and type of data clarifications generated,  
o Tracking unresolved data clarifications,  
o Tracking data collection and entry within appropriate interval windows.

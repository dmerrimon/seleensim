reason, the study center staff must record the AE as the reason for discontinuation. All 
dosed patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, will be 
seen for an Early Termination  (ET) Visit. Patient s refusing to come in to the study center 
for an ET Visit or who cannot be reached must be requested in writing to come in to the 
study center  and to return any unused IMP. A copy of the letter will be kept by [CONTACT_792486]. The reason for premature discontinuation from the 
study will be reflected on the study termination page of the CRF . 
8.3.4 Replacement Procedures  
Patients may withdraw consent at any time for any reason without prejudice to future 
treatment. In the event of study withdrawal, the ET procedures should occur as a final assessment.  
The investigators or Medical Monitor may withdraw a patient from treatment for any reason (treatment withdrawal) at any time, and all planned study assessments should then be offered for t he duration of the trial to ensure appropriate medical care is provided to 
the patient. Patients who develop a new significant medical condition at any point during the trial may be withdrawn.  
Patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study will be rep laced , but their patient 
number will not be reassigned.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient  
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatmen t. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example) , symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A) . 

Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1092489] dose of IMP 
is to be considered an AE. 
Examples of AEs are as follows: 
•Changes in the general condition of the patient
•Symptoms offered by [CONTACT_44742]
•Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_29355]
•All diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any changes in severity or
frequency of preexisting disease
•All clinically relevant abnormalities  in laboratory values or clinically relevant
physical findings that occur during the study
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1092490] be recorded on the appropriate 
AE reporting page of the patient ’s CRF . Causal relationship must be assessed by 
[CONTACT_16134]: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the IMP caused the event? 
Yes:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and AE , ie: 
−There is a reasonable temporal relationship  between the  IMP and the event,
and/or
−The event is unlikely to be  attribut ed to underlying/concurrent disease, other
drugs, or other factors , and/ or
−Positive d echallenge an d/or rechallenge exist .
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and AE, ie:  
−There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the IMP and the ev ent,
or
−The patient  did not take the  IMP, or
−The event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other
drugs, or 
other factors , or
Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 29 
Study AG10 -201 Protocol  Amendment 2 Date 25 May 2018  −The event is commonly occurring in the study population independent of drug
exposure.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Severity Assessment  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_792475] b-Investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE  by 
[CONTACT_44745] a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient ’s CRF . 
Severity, which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient  outcome or AE- required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality . Severity will be assess ed according to the 
following scale:  
Mild: A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention.   The event does not 
generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate:  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participan t. 
Severe: A type of adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose 
•Results in death
•Is life threatening
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
•Results in  a congenital anomaly  or birth defect
Important medical events  that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the out comes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 30 
Study AG10 -201 Protocol  Amendment 2 Date 25 May 2018  Emergency room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637943]. 
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (eg, elective procedures for preexisting conditions that did 
not worsen) are excluded from SAE reporting. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Eve nts and Serious Adverse Events  
Any untoward event that is reported from the time that the patient  signs the ICF until the 
Follow-up visit after the last dose of IMP must be collected . Thus, any untoward medical 
occurrences or unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms, or diseases that occur in the 
pretreatment, in  treatment, or posttreatment period are to be considered AEs (and SAEs  if 
appropriate), and consequently recorded and reported as such.  
Patients are to be queried regarding any AEs  or SAEs at the time of each vital sign 
assessment, as well as at each visit, according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section  8.5.1). Patient s will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading 
question such as, “How do you feel?” Study center  personnel will then record all 
pertinent information in t he patient ’s CRF.   
All AEs  and SAEs reported by [CONTACT_102]  (or patient  representative) or observed or 
otherwise identified by [CONTACT_978]  (or other study center  personnel) at a defined study visit or 
during any communication with the patient  (or patient repres entative) occurring outside a 
defined study visit (from the time the patient  signs the ICF to the Follow-up visit after the 
last dose of IMP) must be documented. 
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient ’s CRF 
whether or not they are considered causally related to the IMP. 
For every AE, the PI (or appropriately trained designee) must 
•Provide an assessment of the severity, causal relationship to the IMP, and seriousness
of the event (ie, whether it is an SAE)
•Document all actions taken with regard to the IMP
•Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE
•Document resolution of the AE
Additional information regarding the expedited reporting required for SAEs is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 31 
Study AG10 -201 Protocol  Amendment 2 Date 25 May 2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study  
Study center  personnel must report every pregnancy (including the pregnancy of a male 
patient ’s partner) from the time the patient  signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_1092491] report 
the event to the Sponsor on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and email  it to the 
SAE/P regnancy email address  , even if no AE has occurred.  
The pregnancy must be followed to term and the outcome reported by [CONTACT_12550] a 
follow- up Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE 
(eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460] ), a separate SAE Form for Clinical 
Trials must be completed (in addition to the P regnancy  Form) as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  indicated . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Events of 
Special Interest  
The Sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAEs that meet 
specific criteria. Therefore, the Sponsor m ust be notified immediately regarding any SAE 
that occurs after informed consent is obtained. 
Within [ADDRESS_1092492] report the event to the Sponsor on the SAE Form f or Clinical 
Trials . The Sponsor’s Study Physician may also be notified by [CONTACT_756]. 
If, during follow-up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
The study center staff must transmit the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to the SAE email 
. Even if an initial report is made by [CONTACT_756], the study center 
staff must still complete the SAE Form for Clinical Trials  with all available details , and 
fax the form  within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Supplemental information shall be submitted as soon as available and may include 
laboratory results, radiology reports, progress notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134373], holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates.  
The PI (or appropriately trained designee) is expected to take all therapeutic measures 
necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the patient ’s CRF. 
The study c enter  staff must follow all SAEs until resolution or until the SAE is deemed 
stable. The Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_242303].

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 in subjects with multiple system atrophy 
(MSA), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or pure autonomic failure (PAF) experiencing 
sympt omatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( symptomatic nOH ) compared 
with placebo at  Week  4, as measured by [CONTACT_535738] (OHSA)  Question 1 (OHSA#1) 
score.  
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 by [CONTACT_535739] (OHDAS). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 using the Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGI -C). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 in preventing incidence of falls. 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855, including adverse events 
(AEs) and changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram 
(ECG), Columbia Suicide Severity Ra ting Scale (C -SSRS)  and laboratory tests. 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
Study Design:   
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with primary 
autonomic failures (MSA, PD, or PAF) and symptomatic nOH  after 4 weeks of treatment.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Given the challenges  presented by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_697239] make, the S creening visit  (V1) must be conducted in 
clinic  for all subjects . Tools and systems are available to sites and subjects to  support 
remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shippi[INVESTIGATOR_535717], 
standardized HIPA A/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses ).  
 
Due to the potential for resurgence of COVID-[ADDRESS_697240] either in clinic or remote unscheduled visit(s) for subject safety or unexpected subject medical needs outside of the 
regular visit schedule. In this case, unscheduled visits are not considered protocol 
deviations and the Investigator is not required to obtain pre-approval from the Sponsor. Data collected during these visits may include any protocol- specified assessments 
which will be captured in the clinical database.   
For subjects that have previ ously completed the Screening visit  at the time regulatory and 
ethics approval for  is received , sites must reconsent the subject using the 
most recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote study vi sits, if that visit modality is selected  by [CONTACT_535740]. For 
those subjects who are already randomized  to study treatment and active in the study at the 
time regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and 
subject  should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the 
Randomization Visit.  
Symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is defined as: 
• A sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg  (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg  (diastolic) 
within 3 minutes of standing or tilted -up to ≥60
o elevation from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251].

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   • A score of at least a 4 on the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment 
Question #1 
The study consists of 3 periods: (i ) 4-week screening, (ii) 4 -week random ized treatment, 
and (iii) 2 -week follow up. The schematic representation is as shown below: 
  
After  signing the informed consent, the subject will enter a screening period of up to 
[ADDRESS_697241]’s disease will be characterized and documented by [CONTACT_3786]. 
The subject will receive an assessment of th eir physical condition, including safety and 
laboratory evaluations and related aspects of their disease states according to the Schedule 
of Study Procedures ( Table 1). The presence of symptomatic nOH  symptoms and reported 
sensation of dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out 
(OHSA#1 ) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_389224] a tilt- table test. This tilt -table  test 
serves 2 purposes: (i) determination of the systolic/diastolic BP (DBP) changes, and 
(ii) training the subjects to recognize the sensations associated with OHSA#1. 
Eligible subjects will undergo training of accurate scoring of their sensation of dizziness, 
lightheade dness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out as outlined by [CONTACT_535741]#1. 
Following the screening period, the subject will proceed to Visit 2  to further confirm the 
additional eligibility criteria prior to  randomization. This includes the completion of the 
Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire ( OHQ) in which a minimum score of 4 points in 
OHSA#[ADDRESS_697242] s meeting all applicable inclusion criteria and none of the 
applicable exclusion criteria , including confirm ation of relevant criteria by [CONTACT_535742] (ESC) , will be randomized to receive either TD -9855 or 
matching placebo  for the next 4 weeks.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 7 of 143 
 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Following randomization and completion of study assessments , the subject  will receive a  
  dose of TD -9855 (or matching placebo) once daily (QD) for the remaining  
double- blind treatment period.  
Weekly assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Table 1).  Refer to  the f ootnotes in Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1 ) for a 
description of all assessments.  Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_697243] 1 of the following rules: 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
No dose reduction is permitted at any time.  
Safety assessments will include a physical examination, neurological examination, vital 
signs ( body temperature, HR and BP), body weight, ECGs , safety laboratory  tests 
(hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis), C- SSRS, and AEs . 
Safety will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_82571] , see 
separate charter.  
Subjects will be requested to refrain from making any significant dietary changes 
throughout the duration of the study. Subjects should be reminded to maintain an adequate 
fluid intake during their scheduled visits. 
Subjects completing the 4 -week double- blind treatment period will be eligible to enroll and 
continue receiving study medication  in Study 0170. The final study visit for those subjects 
who do not complete the 4-week double-blind treatment period or who choose not to 
continue into Study 0170 will be the follow- up visit (V7). This visit must be completed two 
weeks from the date of the last dose . 
Enrollment Steering Committee  (ESC)  
The Investigator must obtain approval from the ESC prior to randomizing the subject in the 
study.   The ESC is a committee of independent neurologists that will make a 
predetermination of the subject’s appropriateness for study inclusion by [CONTACT_535743]. The ESC will review both the medical history 
to support  the diagnosis (MSA, PD, or PAF), and confirm the presence of symptomatic

include confirmation that the subject maintains a sustained  fall in blood pressure to a 
level  that is consistent with cerebral hypoperfusion. The ESC will consult with the 
Investigator to address any outstanding questions. The ESC review is recommended to be 
completed within 48 hours and the Investigator  will be informed in writing (e.g., by e -mail) 
of the decision. Following ESC approval of the subject, the Investigator will determine 
eligibility based up on the protocol Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for randomization. In  
cases where the ESC determines subject ineligibility based on tilt- table  test findings that are 
not consistent with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, the decision will be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_535744]. A dedicated charter has been implemented to address the mode 
of operations of the ESC to ensure the protection of the study integrity. The communication from the ESC, documenting review and approval of the subject, will serve as E SC 
documentation for inclusion into the study.

Analysis : 
Analyses conducted based on the FAS  will be based on the assigned randomized 
treatments.  
The safety analysis set will be defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_697256] counts and percentage of subjects in corresponding categories. 
The primary efficacy evaluation is the change from baseline of OHSA#1 at Week  4. 
Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose measurement. Mixed model for r epeated m easures 
(MMRM) will be used to compare treatment differences. The model will include fixed 
effect class terms of treatment, baseline disease type (MSA, PD, PAF), week, and 
continuous covariate of baseline OHSA#[ADDRESS_697257] -square means and 95% confidence intervals on the differences between TD -9855 and 
placebo will be calculated and presented.  
Missing data in the MMRM analysis is assumed as missing at random (MAR) and will not be imputed for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint will be conducted using multiple imputation. The primary analysis will be repeated on a set of pre-specified subgroups and presented in graphical format. 
If the  treatment effect of the primary efficacy endpoint has been demonstrated, t he 
following secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested via statistical testing procedure, to be 
described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), that will protect the family -wise Type I 
error rate at 2 -sided significance level of 5 % until a failure to reject the null hypothesis 
occurs.   No statistical significance will be claimed after a failure to reject the null 
hypothesis has occurred.

To help ensure subject safety, subjects will be closely monitored during this study. Except for 
the Screening visit  (V1) which must be conducted in the clinic, s tudy visits can  be conducted 
in the Investigator ’s autonomic disorders clinic or appropriately qualified research facility , or 
remotely  using a telemedicine platform, under the supervision of qualified site personnel with 
help from a home health care provider .   
The schedule of procedures requires subjects to be closely monitored on a regular basis during the dosing and follow-up periods. If any subject should incur any unexpected and untoward event during the testing procedure, the Investigator is instructed to provide the 
subject immediate and appropriate  care as needed  including unscheduled in clinic or remote 
visits .  
A summary of known and potential risks to human subjects is provided in the IB in the 
Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigators.

2.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 in subjects with multiple system atrophy 
(MSA), Parkinson’s disease ( PD), or pure autonomic failure (PAF) experiencing 
symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( symptomatic nOH ) compared 
with place bo at Week  4, as measured by [CONTACT_535738] (OHSA)  Question 1 (OHSA#1) 
score.  
2.2. Secondary and Exploratory Objectives  
The secon dary objectives of the study are as follows: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of  TD-9855 by [CONTACT_535739] (OHDAS). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 using the Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGI -C). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 on incidence of falls.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855, including adverse events 
(AEs) and changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram 
(ECG), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) , and laboratory tests.

3.1. Overview  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with primary 
autonomic failures (MSA, PD, or PAF) and symptomatic nOH after [ADDRESS_697272] 
make, the Screening visit (V1) must be conducted in clinic for all subjects. Tools and systems are available t o sites and subjects to support remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shippi[INVESTIGATOR_535722], standardized HIPAA/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses).  
 
Due to the potential for resurgence of COVID-[ADDRESS_697273] either in clinic or remote unscheduled visit(s) for subject safety or unexpected subject medical needs outside of the 
regular visit schedule. In this case, unscheduled visits are not considered protocol deviations 
and the Investigator is not required to obtain pre-approval from the Sponsor. Data collected during these visits may include any protocol- specified assessments which will be captured in 
the clinical database.  
For subjects that have previously completed the Screening visit at the time regulatory and ethics approval for is received, sites must reconsent the subject using the most 
recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote study visits, if that visit modality is selected by [CONTACT_535740]. For those subjects who are already randomized to study treatment and active in the study at the time 
regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and subject  
should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the Randomization 
Visit.

• A sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg (diastolic) 
within 3 minutes of standing or tilted -up to ≥60o elevation from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
• A score of at least a 4 on the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment Question #1 
The study consists of 3 periods: (i) 4- week screening, (ii) 4 -week randomized treatment, and 
(iii) 2 -week follow up. The schematic representation is as shown below: 
  
After signing the informed consent, the subject will enter a screening period of up to [ADDRESS_697274]’s disease will be characterized and documented by [CONTACT_737]. 
The subject will receive an assessment of their physical condition, including safety and 
laboratory evaluations and related aspects of their disease states according to the Schedule of 
Study Procedures ( Table 1). The presence of symptomatic nOH symptoms and reported 
sensation of dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out (OHSA#1) 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_389224] a tilt- table test. This tilt- table test serves 2 purposes: 
(i) determination of the systolic/diastolic BP (DBP) changes, and (ii) training the subjects to 
recognize the sensations associated with OHSA#1.  
Eligible subjects will undergo training of accurate scoring of their sensation of dizziness, lighthea dedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out as outlined by [CONTACT_535741]#1. 
Following the screening period, the subject will proceed to Visit 2 to further confirm the 
additional eligibility criteria prior to randomization. This includes the completion of the 
Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) in which a minimum score of 4 points in OHSA#1 is required. Subjects meeting all applicable inclusion criteria and none of the 
applicable exclusion criteria, including confirmation of relevant criteria by [CONTACT_535742] (ESC), will be randomized to receive either TD -9855 or 
matching placebo for the next 4 weeks.

double - blind treatment period.  
Weekly assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Table 1). Refer to the footnotes in Schedule of Study Procedures for a description of all 
assessments.  Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_697275] 1 of the following rules: 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
No dose reduction is permitted at any time.  
Safety assessments will include a physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs (body temperature, HR and BP), body weight, ECGs, safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), C-SSRS, and AEs. 
Safety will be periodically  reviewed by [CONTACT_82571], see 
separate charter.  
Subjects will be requested to refrain from making any significant dietary changes throughout 
the duration of the study. Subjects should be reminded to maintain an adequate fluid i ntake 
during their scheduled visits. 
Subjects completing the 4 -week double- blind treatment period will be eligible to enroll and 
continue receiving study medication in Study 0170. The final study visit for those subjects 
who do not complete the 4-week double -blind treatment period or who choose not to continue 
into Study 0170 will be the follow-up visit (V7). This visit must be completed two weeks from the date of the last dose.

3.5. Minimization of Bias 
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Treatments will be assigned 
centrally using a randomization and t rial supply management (RTSM) system.  
All persons involved in this study, i.e. , physicians, nurses, participants, and site monitors, will 
remain blinded at all times, except in the event of a medical emergency as outlined in Section  3.5.1. 
3.5.1. Blinding  
TD-[ADDRESS_697276]’s treatment assignment will only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is 
essential for the further clinical management o f the subject on this study. Unblinding at the 
study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. In case of an 
emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a 
subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination. Any Investigator unblinding will be documented within the appropriate case report form ( CRF ) and will be captured in the RTSM 
system.  
Sponsor Drug Safety pe rsonnel may independently unblind cases for expedited reporting of 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). With these exceptions, sponsor 
personnel involved in the conduct of the study, data cleaning, or data analysis will remain 
blinded t o subject treatment assignments until the database has been locked for final analysis.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 44 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   3.5.2. Treatment Assignment  
Once the subject has been determined to be eligible to receive study treatment, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_535723] . Except for cases of emergency unblinding as described above, investigational 
site staff will remain blinded to treatment assignments until all subjects have completed the study and the database has been locked.  
Further details regarding the randomization procedure and dose assignment will be outlined 
in the RTSM system manual.  
3.5.3. Enrollment Steering Committee  
The Investigator must obtain approval from the ESC prior to randomizing the subject in the 
study. The ESC is a committee of independent neurologists that will make a predetermination of the subject’s appropriateness for study inclusion by [CONTACT_535750]. The ESC will review  both the medical history to support the diagnosis 
(MSA, PD, or PAF), and confirm the presence of symptomatic nOH based on the results of the tilt- table  test. Review of the tilt- table  test results may include confirmation that the 
subject maintains a sustained drop in blood pressure to a level that is consistent with cerebral 
hypoperfusion. The ESC will consult with the Investigator to address any o utstanding 
questions. The ESC review is recommended to be completed within 48 hours and the 
Investigator will be informed in writing ( e.g., e-mail) of the decision. Following ESC 
approval of the subject, the Investigator will determine eligibility based up on the protocol 
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for randomization.  
In cases where the ESC determines subject ineligibility based on tilt- table  test findings that 
are not consistent with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, the decision will be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_535744]. A dedicated charter has been implemented to address the mode of operations of the ESC to ensure the protection of the study integrity. The communication 
from the ESC, documenting review and approval of the subject, will serve as ESC 
documentation for inclusion into the study.

during the study and for at least 30 days after the completion of study drug dosing.  A highly 
effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., <1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  
Such methods include: 
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomized partner provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
trial participant of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success  
• sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstin ence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  
NOTE:  Birth control methods which may not be considered highly effective:
 
• progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action 
• male or female condom with or without spermicide 
• cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide

6.4. Description of Study Procedures  
Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedures. After providing full informed consent, subjects will undergo a medical screen to determine their eligibility for participation based on the criteria outlined in this protocol.  
The site should make every effort to perform procedures at the scheduled times, and 
information  should be recorded in the source documents and on the CRFs . All subject  
reported outcomes for subjects with PD should be completed in an ON state, and within 1-4 hours of taking the PD medications. 
Additional safety tests, such as vital signs (BP, HR , RR, and body temperature), physical 
exam ination s, ECGs, and laboratory safety assessments , may be obtained during the course 
of the study on the basis of newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring.  
6.4.1. Demographic and Baseline Assessments  
Demographic information to be collected will include: year of birth, sex, race, and ethnici ty. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed at screening and on Day [ADDRESS_697297] will be asked to provide relevant medical history (including medication history; 
see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
6.4.2. Tilt-Table Test  
A tilt- table  test is used to evaluate the cause of unexplained fainting (syncope).  A tilt- table  
attempts to trigger signs and symptoms like  lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, or 
feeling like blacking out while HR  and BP  are being monitored.  If the subject  has symptoms 
while in the upright position on the tilt- table , the part of the nervous system that controls BP  
and HR  suddenly lowers for a short time, less blood flows to the brain, and could possibly 

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020

along with the characteristic circulatory pattern of  the indication mentioned above, namely 
the induction of reflex hypotension/bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic 
tachycardia syndrome, or psychogenic pseudosyncope. The tilt- table  test will be applied until 
a sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg  (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg  (diastolic) is observed in 
≤3 minutes of being tilted -up to ≥60o from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], ideally between 60o to 65o. The 
tilt-table test should be performed following at least 12-hours of withdrawal from vasoactive medications. The tilt- table test  should be performed at least [ADDRESS_697298]’s orthostasis.  The follow-up tilt- table  test should be 
performed at a minimum of one hour after the initial test, and at least 7  days prior to 
randomization. Assessments will be performed as specified in Schedule of Study Procedures (Table 1).   
6.4.3. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
The MoCA is a global cognitive screening test with favorable psychometric properties  that 
has been shown to be more sensitive to executive impa irment than the Mini- Mental State 
Examination. It screens 8 domains including: visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. Assessments will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Study Pr ocedures ( Table 1 ). An example of the 
instrument is provided in Appendix 2.  
6.4.4. Valsalva Maneuver 
The Valsalva maneuver is a breathing technique that can be used to help diagnose a problem with the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Changes in intrathoracic pressure produce 
autonomically modulated transient changes in HR and BP. The Valsalva maneuver will be 
performe d as specified in the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1 ) only for subjects with 
PAF to confirm diagnosis.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire  
The Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) is a 2 -component scale made up of a 
6-item symptom assessment scale referred to as OHSA and a 4 -item daily activity scale 
referred to as the Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activities Scale (OHDAS ). The items are 
scored on an 11-point scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no symptoms/no interference and

[IP_ADDRESS]. Incidence of Falls – Subject D iary 
Falls in subjects  with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are common and 
potentially catastrophic. They can lead to serious injuries including hip fractures or head 
trauma; furthermore, fear of falling can limit mobility and physical activ ity. Thus, incidence 
of subject- reported falls is  being captured in a diary. Assessments will be performed as 
specified in  the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1).  An example of the instrument is

6.8.2. Subject Discontinuation 
Any subject (or his or her legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to 
participate  in the study at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from 
the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study 
may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with 
his or her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be completed . If a subject withdraws before completing the study, 
the reason for withdrawal is to be documented on the CRF. 
The sponsor will be notified of all subject withdrawals.  
Reasons for which the Investigator  may withdraw a subject from the study or a subject may 
choose to terminate participation before completion of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
• Adverse Event  
• Physician Decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol Violation  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720]

7.1. Definitions 
The definitions below are based on International Council for Harmonization  (ICH) guideline 
E2A, “Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting.” 
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical trial subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
• AEs may be new events . 
• AEs may be preexisting events that increase in frequency, severity, or  change in 
nature or seriousness during or as a consequence of participation in clinical studies. 
• AEs may be pre - or posttreatment complications that occur as a result of a 
protocol-mandated procedure (such as a biopsy). 
• AEs may be clinically significant c hanges from baseline in physical examination, 
laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation ( e.g., laboratory results, x- ray 
findings). 
• AEs may result from an overdose of the study medication .  
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  
An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an informed 
consent form that do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277022]/or convenience admissions) 
• Overdose of either study medication  or concomitant medication without any signs 
or symptoms, unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535730]. 
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study, the sponsor will be notified according to the procedures for SAE reporting as outlined in Section  7.4.3. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and 
any fetal or neonatal sequelae will be obtained and documented.  

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020 
TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 70 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation.  “Life  threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63995] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238420]: “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency 
department. A scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not 
worsened during participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208350]/surgical procedure, 
scheduled treatments, or routine c heck -ups do not meet this criterion. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE. 
• Disability - A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
medication  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life  
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such events are as follows: 
− Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm 
− Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
− Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
7.1.3. Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an AE  and not an AE in itself. Deaths of unknown cause 
for which the Investigator cannot identify a cause of death will be captured as death of unknown cause or death not otherwise specified. 
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs while the subject is participating in the study.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study 
medication  at the time of the event; dosing may have been given as treatment 
cycles or interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE but may have 
contributed to the event.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.1.4. Adverse Event of Special Interest  
• At each study visit, the Investigator (or designee) will specifically query for any 
AESI s. The following events are considered AESIs for this study: 
− Supi[INVESTIGATOR_142642] 
− Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, 
cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure)  
− Convulsion 
• All AESIs must be reported to Sponsor Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24-hour s of awareness by [CONTACT_21438]/h er designee.  
The AESI Report Form must be completed in accordance with the AESI Report Form 
Completion Guidelines. If all information on the AESI Report Form is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up AESI reports will be completed and submitted.  
To report an AESI, complete and send the AESI Report Form to the following:

7.2. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (such as c hemistry , hematology, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (such as ECGs, x- rays, or vital signs) that are associated with signs 
and/or symptoms or are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator 
must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE  (or SAE ), as described 
in Section  7.1.1 (Adverse Event) and Section  7.1.2  (Serious Adverse Event). 
If there are any AE questions, the Investigator  is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_535763].  
7.3. Assessment of Adver se Events  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_535764] , including the dates of 
onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study medication , outcome, and action taken 
with study medication .

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.3.1. Severity  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe nausea).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” wh ich is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The severity of AEs will be 
assessed according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  The AE is noticeable to the s ubject  and/or the Investigator but does not 
interfere with routine activity.  
• Moderate:  The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic 
therapy or rest.  
• Severe:  The AE significantly limits the subject’s  ability to perform routine 
activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795].  
7.3.2. Causal Relationship to Study Medication  
The Investigator ’s assessment of causality is based on clinical judgment regarding the 
reasonable possibility that the study medication  caused the event and may include 
consideration of some or all of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, comorbid conditions, other medications , and environmental factors. 
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE.  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with 
known actions or toxicity of the study medication . 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788]  (“de- challenge”) or recurred or worsened upon re-exposure to 
the study medication  (“re-challenge”).  
The causal relationship between the study medication  and the AE will be described using one 
of the following categories: 
• Not Related:  Evidence exists that the AE  has an etiology other than the study 
medication  (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication).  
• Related:  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of the study medication . It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535731]. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon re- challenge. It should be emphasized that ineffective 
treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of AE  
reporting.

7.4.1. Adverse E vent Reporting  
Timely, accurate, an d complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical 
trials is crucial for the protection of subjects  and is mandated by [CONTACT_17513].  The 
sponsor has established standard operating procedures (SOPs) in compliance with regulatory 
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information. All clinical 
trials sponsored by [CONTACT_535765]. 
7.4.2. Adverse E vent and Serious A dverse E vent Recording  
All AEs, regardless o f seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to study medication, will 
be recorded from signing informed consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact 
[CONTACT_98212] a follow -up telephone call). The AEs will be recorded on the AE page of the 
CRF. The SAEs, regardless of relationship to study medication  will be recorded from signing 
informed consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact [CONTACT_98212] a follow-up telephone call).  Additionally, Investigator s may report SAEs assessed as related to study 
medication  through [ADDRESS_697310] study visit (or last subject contact [CONTACT_98212] 
a follow-up telephone call). All SAEs will be recorded on both the SAE /AESI  Report Form 
and the AE page of the CRF and should include the following:  
Description of event:  
• Signs and symptoms due to a common etiology should be reported as a single diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion would be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].”  
• A diagnosis or description must be as specific and as complete as possible (e.g., “lower extremity edema” instead of “edema”).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535732] ( e.g., if a 
subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277026], the AE  term 
should be recorded as cholecystitis, and not as the procedure, cholecystectomy).  
• “Death” should not be used as an AE  term unless the cause of death is unknown. 
For events with a fatal outcome, the cause of death should be the AE  term ( e.g., if 
a subject died of an acute myocardial infarction, the AE  term should be recorded 
as “Myocardial Infarction” and the event outcome as fatal).    
Relationship to study medication : The Investigator  will make an assessment of the causal 
relationship of the study medication  to the AE using the guidelines in Section  7.3.2.  
Severity: The severity of the AE will be assessed using the g uidelines in Section  7.3.1 . 
Outcome: The outcome of AEs will be recorded.  
Therapeutic measures: Measures taken for the treatment or management of the AEs will be 
recorded.

8.1. General Considerations  
All data for each subject will be listed as collected. All statistical summaries and analys es 
will be performed using  
Continuous data will be summarized using an 8-point descriptive summary (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, interquartile range [25% quartile, 75% quartile], minimum, and 
maximum) unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) or table shell. Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
For analysis, Day [ADDRESS_697312] study medication  dose. The preceding 
day is Day –1. 
Baseline is the last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) obtained before start of study 
medication  dosing, unless otherwise specified in the SAP. Baseline for endpoints that have 
more than one component is calculated from the individual component baselines, whether or 
not they were assessed during the same visit.  
Any changes to the data summaries and analyses outlined in this section will be described in the applicable SAP. Any changes to the definition of the endpoints will also be included in a protocol amendment. 
8.2. Sample Size and Power  
A total of approximately  will be randomized in a  
 
   
The primary  analysis will occur when all subjects  in the Full  analysis set  (FAS)  have 
completed the primary  endpoint assessment (OHSA#1 at Week  4) and the database has been 
cleaned and locked . A total sample size of  will have an overall power of 90% to 
detect a treatment difference of 1. 5 in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 
OHSA#1, assuming a common standard deviation of 3.0 for both treatment groups at a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
Assuming a 10% dropout rate by [CONTACT_10585]  4, it is anticipated that the study will randomize 
approximately   in order to achieve  in the FAS .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Evaluation 
The primary efficacy evaluation is the change from baseline of OHSA #1 at Week  4. Baseline 
is defined as Day 1 pre- dose measurement. Mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM) 
will be used to compa re treatment differences. The model will include fixed effect class terms 
of treatment, baseline disease type (MSA, PD, PAF), week, and continuous covariate of 
baseline OHSA #[ADDRESS_697313], with an unstructured covariance structure 
using the FAS. If the model doesn’t converge, compound symmetry or other covariance 
structures will be used as alternative covariance structure.  
Least -square means and 95% confidence intervals on the differences between TD -9855 and 
placebo will be calculated and presented.  
Missing data in the MM RM analysis is assumed as missing at random ( MAR ) and will not be 
imputed for the analysis of the primary endpoint. S ensitivity analys es of the primary endpoint 
will be conducted using multiple imputation.  
The primary analysis will be repeated on a set of prespecified  subgroups and presented in 
graphical format .

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Evaluations 
The secondary efficacy endpoints involving assessment of change from baseline, such as 
OHSA composite score and OHDAS  composite score , will be analyzed in a similar fashion 
as the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in OHSA#1.   
The PGI -C will be  summarized as number and percentage for subjects with ‘no change or 
better’ and ‘worse than no change’ at Week  4. Incidence of falls will be summarized as 
number and percentage of subjects with at least [ADDRESS_697314] of the primary efficacy endpoint has been demonstrated  at a 2-sided 
statistical significance level of 5% , secondary efficacy endpoints ( Section  8.5.1) will be tested 
using the same statistical significance level.  The secondary endpoints will be tested 
sequentially via a prospectively defined order  to be described in the SAP, until a failure to 
reject the null hypothesis occurs.  No statistical significance will be claimed after a failure to 
reject the null hypothesis has occurred. 
For all supportive analyses including sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint 
and exploratory endpoints, nominal p-values and 95% confidence intervals with no adjustment for multiplicity  will be presented .

not be included in summaries. Categorical data collected at unscheduled  times ( e.g., ECG 
finding categories) will not be included in summaries by [CONTACT_535769].  
Safety anal yses will be performed using the safety analysis set.   Unless specified otherwise 
there will be no imputation of missing data  in safety summaries . Subjects without post 
baseline measurement (e.g. ECG or vital signs ) for a given  time point will be excluded from 
the summary statistic  (e.g., denominator of the summary statistic)  for that time point.

authorized representative) and will maintain the original in the subject’s record file.  
9.4. Data Recording and Quality Assurance  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used. 
A CRF (approved by [CONTACT_456]) is required and should be completed (in English) for each 
randomized subject. The Investigator has  ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, 
authenticity, completeness, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms. The Investigator must review and sign the CRFs to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are correct.  
Electronic data capture (EDC) technology will be used for this study. All clinical information requested in this protocol will be recorded on the electronic CRFs  approved by [CONTACT_456], 
or via other data collection methods, e.g. , electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOA), 
electronic laboratory data transfer. Study site personnel will enter (in English) study data into the CRFs for each subject that is screened . Training on systems used by [CONTACT_8786] (e.g. 
EDC, eCOA) or study subjects (e.g. eCOA) will be completed and documented before access to the EDC system is given.  
In the event of a CRF data change ( e.g., correction of an error or addition of new 
information), corrections will be made to the CRF. Corrections to the CRFs, including the reason for change, will be automatically documented through the EDC system’s audit trail. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing all CRFs, verifying them for accuracy, and 
approving them via an electronic signature. The Investigator is designated as the signatory 
coordinating Investigator. An electronic copy of the CRF casebooks and eCOA s will be sent to the site for retention 
with other study documents after full completion of the study, i.e., after database lock.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, authentic, complete, and up- to-date 
records for each subject. The Investigator is also responsible for ensuring the availability of 
any original source documentation relat ed to the study (including any films, tracings, 
computer discs, tapes, and worksheets). In most cases the source is the subject’s medical record. Data collected on the CRFs must match the source documents.  
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document 
should be available at the Investigator ’s site and clearly identify those data that will be 
recorded in the CRF and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
9.5. Document Retention  
Until otherwise notified by [CONTACT_456] , an investigative site must retain in a controlled 
manner all study documents required by [CONTACT_535774]. The 
investigative site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of 
the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_535735] ( e.g., subject charts) and any original source documents that are electroni c, as 
required by [CONTACT_5279].

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   The Investigator must consult the sponsor representative before disposal of any study records 
and must notify the sponsor of any change in the location or disposition of the study files. 
If an Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_98185], custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the 
responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_98228]. 
9.6. Confidentiality  
The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that, for evaluation of study results, the subject’s confidential medical informatio n obtained 
during the study may be shared with the study sponsor, the study sponsor’s affiliated 
companies, the study sponsor’s designated service providers, regulatory agencies, and the IRB or IEC. The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for obtaining written permission to 
use confidential medical information in accordance with country- specific regulations (such as 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ) from each subject or, if 
appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use confidential medical information is withdrawn, the Investigator  is responsible for documenting that no 
further data from the subject will be collected.  
Subject medical information obtained during this study is confidential, and disclosure to unauthorized third parties is prohibited. The pertinent sections of data protection laws will be 
complied with in full. Study records containing subject information will only be identified by 
[CONTACT_98220], subject initials, date of birth, and study number, and not by [CONTACT_423]’s full name, except the subject consent form, which is archived at the study center only. The subject’s name [CONTACT_277058]. 
During the course of the study, a confidential subject identification list will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_535775].  
Before and during the conduct of the study, no study- related details may be disclosed, 
i.e., placed on the internet, published, or otherwise publicized, or provided to a third party 
without prior written permission from the sponsor. The policy for publication of data after completion of the study is described in Section  9.9 (Publication). 
9.7. Access to Data and Documents  
Upon receipt of the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare. 
Study data recorded on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data. All original 
recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records generated by [CONTACT_535776] , repres entatives of the sponsor, the IRB/IEC/REB, and applicable regulatory 
authorities, and they may be used for submission to regulatory authorities. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated), consistent with local medical practice. The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects 
(or their legally authorized representatives) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   9.8. Quality Control: Study Monitoring and Auditing  
Qualified individuals designated by [CONTACT_535777]. The Investi gator  agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical data and supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_154986]. 
Members of the sponsor’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or designees may conduct an 
audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The Inves tigator  
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Inspections and audits are typi[INVESTIGATOR_277029], documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies , including IRB/IEC representatives 
may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator 
should notify the sponsor immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have 
access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, laboratory and all data (including original 
source documentation), and all study files are available, if requested.  
Noncompliance with the protocol, ICH, GCP, or local regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_39595], institution, institution staff, or representatives of the sponsor will lead to prompt 
action by [CONTACT_171361]. Continued noncompliance may result in 
termination of the Investigator ’s involvement in the study. The IRB/IEC/REB and relevant 
regulatory authority will be informed. 
9.9. Publication  
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and presentation at seminars or 
conferences. The sponsor will retain the ownership of the data collected in this study. The Investigator will provide any proposed manuscript or abstract to the sponsor before submission for publication or presentation of any results or data obtained in this study. 
Additional details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations ba sed on the data from this study will be described in the Clinical Study 
Agreement between the sponsor and the Investigator .

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   APPENDIX 9. OVERVIEW OF DECENTRALIZATION PLAN  
This appendix provides information for those sites who choose to conduct remote study visits 
for at least one of their subjects .  Detailed instructions for the conduct of both in clinic and 
remote study visits can be found in the Study Procedures Manual, which must be used in conjunction with the protocol. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_535737].   Procedures to protect subject safety , subject 
privacy,  and data integrity will be followed by [CONTACT_214148] (clinic and home health personnel) involved in study conduct. 
 
Rationale for Decentralized Platform:   
Considering the frailty of the sy mptomatic  nOH subject  population, the risk of future 
exposure to COVID -[ADDRESS_697319] protocol required visits as either in clinic or remote visits.    
 
Selection of Visit  Modality:   
The Screening visit for all subjects must be conducted in  clinic,  regardless of which visit 
modality selection an Investiga tor and subject make.     
All sites  must conduct all study visits for Study [ADDRESS_697320] all visits either in the clinic, or remotely.    
Tools and systems are available to sites and subjects to support remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shippi[INVESTIGATOR_535717], standardized HIPAA/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses).   
For those sites who opt to use remote visits (the decentralized platform) for study conduct, all required regulatory and ethics committee or IRB approvals wi ll be obtained before utilization 
of remote study visits under the decentralized platform.    
Sites will use the most recent approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain 
subject consent for remote study visits.
 
Due to the potential for resurgenc e of COVID -[ADDRESS_697321] exceptions to the selected typed of study visit modality due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 related circumstances.  Approved exceptions will be recorded as CO VID-19 related protocol deviations.    

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020 
TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 141 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.    
 
Before a change in visit type from  in clinic  to remote is made, the Investigator will submit an 
exemption  request  to the Sponsor via the established  process.  Theravance (or their designee) 
will review and respond to these exemption requests as per established processes and 
timelines.   Requests for and approval of exemptions in visit modality will be documented and 
retained in study records at the Investigator site.  
Once an Investigator  and subject have elected a visit type (in clinic  or remote) the expectation 
is for all post- Screening visits for that  subject  to be conducted via the same modality, except 
as described above.   
For subjects that have previously completed the Screening visit at the time regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, sites must reconsent the subject using the most 
recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote 
study visits, if that visit modality is selected by [CONTACT_535740]. For those 
subjects who are already randomized to study treatment and active in the study at the time 
regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and subject  
should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the Randomization 
Visit.  
Conduct of the Study and the Decentralized Platform:  
All sites will follow the protocol Schedule o f Procedures (see Table 1 of the protocol) for 
study visit scheduling and protocol required procedures (either in clinic or remote).   Refer to 
the Study Procedures Manual for detailed instructions for conducting subject assessments in clinic and remotely.  These instructions have been provided to ensure the method and conduct 
of each assessment is consistent across sites and subjects for both in  clinic and remote visits.  
 
Training and m echanisms will be available to sites and subjects to support remote visits.   
Sites will continue to follow their established processes and procedures for the conduct of in-clinic  study visits.   
Study operations support for  remote visits:  
 
Tools and systems are provided by [CONTACT_535778]:
 
• A courier service has been engaged to ship investigational study drug and other 
study supplies to the subject (or designee).  

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020 
TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 142 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   • A standardized HIPA A/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform will be provided 
so that site personnel can participate in remote visits that are conducted in the 
subject’s home (or designated location), utilizing Home Health Providers.  
• A Home Health Provider (H HP) service has been employed.     
• Medically qualified and trained HHP staff  employed  will visit the subject’s home 
(or designated location) and will work with  Site Staff (SS) to conduct each remote 
study visit from the privacy of the subject’s home or designated location (such as a caregiver’s home).    
• During these remote visits, in coordination with Site Staff, the HHPs  will use the 
Rater Station to facilitate collection of  patient  reported outcomes, will collect 
blood samples for safety labs and PK testing, will collect ECGs, and will measure 
the subject’s vital signs.  
• All data collected during the remote visits will be transferred to the Investigator 
and the study site via established processes  (either electronically or on paper).  
Data signifying where t he visit was conducted (in clinic or remote), how the data were 
collected, and who collected data remotely will be recorded in subject source documents and 
in the clinical study database.  
A Home Health Provider Delegation Log will be used to record the nam es of HHP 
professionals who assist Site Staff with the conduct of the remote visits.  This separate 
delegation log will distinguish between those individuals who are part of the site staff 
(recorded on Site Delegation Log) and those who are employed by [CONTACT_535779].   
Logistics Arrangements for Remote Visits:  
For remote study visits, the home health personnel conducting the visit will be notified by [CONTACT_27470] -based study staff of each upcoming scheduled visit for the study subject(s).  The clinic -
based staff will coordinate with the home health personnel to ensure access to all necessary 
subject source documents, required equipment, and procedural instructions to complete the 
remote assessment.  
Clinic -based staff will participate in the remote study visit(s) via the established telemedicine 
platform available for the study.    
Home health personnel will transfer the source documents completed during the remote visit to the Investigator’s site via established processes .  Home health personnel will transfer  via 
established secure means the data collected in electronic format to the appropriate data repository for inclusion in the clinical database.

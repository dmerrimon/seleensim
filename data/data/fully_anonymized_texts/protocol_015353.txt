Confidential Page 11 of 53 1 INTRODUCTION 
Bexagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibito r of human sodium-glucose linked transporter 
2 (SGLT2). The clinical pharmacology of bexa gliflozin is largely consistent with the 
expected consequences of SGLT2 inhibition. The primary pharmacodynamic effect is a 
glucosuria that increases with glomerular f iltration rate and plasma  glucose concentration. 
Effects secondary to diuresis, possible natriure sis, and caloric wasti ng, including reductions 
in blood pressure and body weight, have been obse rved. Consistent with clinical observations 
that individuals genetically de ficient for SGLT2 are euglycemic and normotensive to slightly 
hypotensive, inhibition of SGLT2 function does not appear to c onfer a risk of hypoglycemia 
or of significant hypotension. Mild hemoconcentr ation associated with volume depletion 
attributed to the diuretic effect  has been observed. Slight elev ations in blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) and creatinine, and corresponding infe rred decreases in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), have typi[INVESTIGATOR_631119] a nd metabolic shifts favor ing protein catabolism. 
Moderate reductions in plasma urate and small increases in LDL cholesterol concentration 
that appear to be class effect s have yet to be explained. 
Bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, are blue caplet-shaped film-coated tablets with a gastroretentive 
mechanism based on mucoadhesion. Peak plasma bexagliflozin concentrations are observed 
3 to 5 h after dosing and thereafter decline in  a biphasic manner with mean elimination half-
life values ranging from 7.8 to 9.7 h. Bexa gliflozin is extensively metabolized, 
predominantly to a 3’- O-glucuronide, but also to a mixt ure of additional glucuronides and 
oxidation products. .  
The relative contributions of different organs  to metabolism of bexa gliflozin are not known. 
Cytochrome P450 oxidases are found in intestin e, kidney and liver, w ith the latter usually 
considered the most important site for xenobi otic oxidation. Glucuronid ation is principally 
carried out in the kidney and liver. Because high amounts of [14C]-bexagliflozin have been 
observed in the kidney in rats and renal reci rculation of the compounds appears likely, a 
significant renal contributi on cannot be excluded.  
 Metabolism represents the primary pathway fo r the clearance of bexagliflozin accounting for 
> 60% of the administered drug and is primar ily via glucuronidati on (hepatic and extra-
hepatic) by [CONTACT_631131] (UGT1A 9) to form a major inactive 
metabolite (EGT0002149), which accounted for 32.2%  of systemic exposure of the parent 
drug. Less than 2.0% of the administered bexagliflozin dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and most of the radioactivity excreted in urine was associated with 
EGT0002149, accounting for 30.1% of the administered dose.  No glucuronides were found in feces, but the possibility of action of microbial glucuronid ases could not be excluded.  
(THR-1442-C-410).  
ICH guidelines recommend that th e consequences of diminished hepatic function for the 
metabolism of new molecular entities be studi ed if hepatic metabolism and/or excretion 
accounts for > 20% of the absorbed agent (Industry, 2003). Because bexagliflozin is 
extensively metabolized and th e sites of metabolism are unknown, the sponsor has chosen to

Confidential Page 12 of 53 undertake an investigation of the pharmacokinetics  of bexagliflozin in subjects with differing 
degrees of liver dysfunction.   
1.1 Summary of Nonclinica l Data for Bexagliflozin 
Bexagliflozin is highly (97%) bound to protein in human plasma. The degree of binding is 
minimally reduced in plasma from subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment. It is a 
high solubility, low permeability class III BCS agent and is not a significant inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isozymes and tran sporters relevant for drug-drug interactions. 
It is a substrate for P-gp but does not affect  the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a drug with a 
narrow therapeutic window that is strongly affected by P-gp inhibition. 
The potential adverse effects of bexagliflozi n have been evaluated in standard safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, repeated-dose toxicity  and reproductive toxicity studies. Based 
on findings in rats and monkeys, the potential  limiting adverse effects in human subjects 
have been predicted to involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and to manifest as diarrhea and 
gastric irritation. Animals given high daily dos es of bexagliflozin have also experienced 
adverse effects involving th e respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], liver, kidney, heart and bone marrow. 
Chronic toxicity studies have produced si milar toxicity profiles with additional 
microvacuolation of renal cortical cells in  monkeys. This microscopic pathology occurred 
without clinical chemistry corre lates, and the effects generall y reversed during the recovery 
phase.  
In rats, bexagliflozin did not a ffect fertility or reproductive performance by [CONTACT_631132] [ADDRESS_842201] embryo/fetal viability, gr owth or development 
at dose levels up to 200 mg kg
-1 day-1 (in rats) or 150 mg kg-1 day-1 (in rabbits). Maternal 
toxicity was observed at ≥ [ADDRESS_842202] 
neuromuscular development or reproductive system development in F 1 rats. Based on these 
results, bexagliflozin administered during pr egnancy and the nursing period was considered 
non-toxic for offspring.  
In a juvenile toxicity study, bexagliflozin up to 100 mg kg-1 day-1 was administered to rats 
from postnatal days 21 through 49 an d produced > 300 × the expected C max and > 600 × the 
expected AUC of the intended dose of 20 mg in  adult humans. The 4-week daily dosing was 
well tolerated with the main fi ndings related to effects on ki dney and bone, including renal 
pelvic dilatation, a narro wer mean femur width in males and a wider mean femur width and 
narrower mean tibia width in females. 
Studies of rodents dosed daily with bexagliflo zin for approximately 2 years (mice) or 1.5 – 2 
years (rats) did not produce evidence of an  oncogenic effect. Ther e was no statistically 
significant increase in the incidence of any tumo r type in any tissue for either sex. Based on 
the expected AUC of the intended human dose of 20 mg in the extended release tablet 
formulation, the exposure provided safety margins ranging from 149 × (males) to 202 × 
(females) for mice and from 52 × (males) to 88 × (females) for rats. The duration of the rat

1.2  Summary of Clinical  Data for Bexagliflozin 
CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM  
Following administration of bexagliflozin extend ed release tablets, time to reach maximum 
observed concentration (T max) has typi[INVESTIGATOR_631120] [ADDRESS_842204] has been observed, with a 
delayed T max of 5 h following dosing in the fed state compared to 3.5 h following dosing in 
the fasted state. Following dosing in the fed state, the C max has been found to be 31% greater 
than the C max following dosing in the fasted state, without substantial change in AUC. In 
light of the perceived wide safe ty margins, the increase in C max has not been considered to 
represent a meaningful hazard a nd dosing in either prandial state has been thought likely to 
elicit similar pharmacological effects and to pose comparable risks.  
The principal metabolites in humans are simila r to those found in monkeys and dominated by 
[CONTACT_631133], for which the AUC has been < 35% relative to parent 
compound in most studies. All metabolites were reduced in abundance relative to the parent 
species following administration of the sustained release formulation.  
All of the glucuronides have ne gligible pharmacologic activity in vitro,  and are present in 
monkeys, in approximately the same proportion as in humans. The total contribution of 
metabolites to the pharmacology of  bexagliflozin is estimated to be less than 1% based on in 
vitro  activity measurements and the pr oportion of metabolites in plasma.  
Following oral administration of radiolabel ed bexagliflozin, 91.6% of the ingested 
radioactivity was recovered, 51.1% as fecal ex cretion and 40.5% as urinary excretion. In 
urine, bexagliflozin accounted for 1.5% of the dose;  most of the radioactivity was excreted as 
the 3’- O-glucuronide (EGT0002149). The largest fraction of the radioactivity in feces was 
due to bexagliflozin, accounting for about 28.7% of the administ ered dose. Disposition of 
radiolabel could be accounted for by [CONTACT_631134] 0.27% of the input 
radioactivity could not be id entified, approximately equall y divided between one species 
each in urine and feces.  
The PK of bexagliflozin and its principal meta bolites was determined in subjects with T2DM 
and renal impairment. Absorption of bexaglif lozin was not affected by [CONTACT_631135]. Reduced clearance due to renal impa irment resulted in systemic exposure that 
increased as the glomerular filtration rate (G FR) decreases. Increase s in AUC of 34% and 
54% were observed in subjects with mode rate and severe impairment, respectively, 
compared to the AUC measured in subjects w ith normal renal function. Exposure to the main 
metabolite, the glucuronide EGT0002149, increased up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment. Given the moderate increas e in exposure and wide safety margins for 
bexagliflozin, dose adjustment for individuals wi th mild to moderate renal impairment has 
not been expected to be necessary.

Confidential Page 14 of 53 Bexagliflozin exposure has been moderately a ffected by [CONTACT_3252]-administration of the commonly 
co-prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents metfor min, glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_350837]. An increase 
in glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_631121]-administrati on with bexagliflozin has been observed 
although the increase has not been deemed c linically significant.  Administration of 
bexagliflozin 30 minutes after injection of exenatide, a gl ucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
agonist, results in delayed absorption and an approximately 50% increase in systemic 
exposure to bexagliflozin. A decrease in e xposure has been observed following co-
administration with rifampin, an inducer of xe nobiotic metabolism. Although bexagliflozin is 
a P-gp substrate, the pharmacokinetics of the P-gp substrate digoxin ha ve been unaffected by 
[CONTACT_3252]-administration of the extended release formul ation to healthy subjects. Adjustment of the 
bexagliflozin dose to compensate for drug-drug in teractions is not expected to be necessary 
in general. 
PHARMACODYNAMICS AND EFFICACY OF BEXAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS  
Dose-titration studies have shown that the primary pharmacodynamic effect, urinary glucose 
excretion (UGE), can be described in both health y and diabetic subjects  by a simple logistic 
equation. The median effective dose (ED 50) is estimated to be 3.6 mg in healthy subjects and 
1.2 mg in diabetic subjects. From this, a 20 mg  dose is expected to  produce 85% or 94% of 
the theoretical maximum UGE in healthy or diabetic subjects, respectively. After a single dose of bexagliflozin, diabetic subjects have e xhibited significant gluc osuria and experienced 
meaningful reductions in fasting plasma glucos e (FPG). Healthy and diabetic subjects have 
also experienced a moderate diuretic eff ect. The dose-related glucosurias observed in 
Japanese and American populations ha ve been similar in magnitude.  
Although bexagliflozin is a potent glucosuric  agent, hypoglycemia and hypotension have not 
been observed in the setting of monothera py. All reports of hypoglycemia and hypotension 
have occurred in the context of additional anti -diabetic or anti-hypertensive agents. Insulin 
and insulin secretagogues of th e sulfonylurea class have been  frequently implicated in 
bexagliflozin-associated hypoglycemia.  
SAFETY INFORMATION FROM HUMAN EXPOSURE  
 Bexagliflozin has been well tolerated whether ad ministered as immediate release capsules or 
extended release tablets. The proportion of s ubjects who have experienced any treatment-
emergent adverse event (AE) has been comp arable between active and placebo arms. The 
most frequently occurring AEs (> 5%) have been urinary tract inf ections and hypoglycemia. 
For both types of event, the rate has been hi gher in the combined placebo group than in the 
combined bexagliflozin groups (of all strengths).  Similarly, taking all completed studies into 
consideration, a higher percenta ge of subjects in the place bo or comparator groups have 
experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) th an subjects in the be xagliflozin treatment 
groups, taking all dosage levels combined. Neither death nor se rious adverse event has been 
observed in any of the phase [ADDRESS_842206] occurred in 
multiple phase 2 and 3 studies, particularly in  a large, ongoing cardiovascular safety study.

Confidential Page 16 of 53 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Approximately 16 subjects (eight with modera te hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh total score 
7-9] and eight healthy, matched controls) will be enrolled.  
The Child-Pugh grading system will be used to assess the severity and prognosis of hepatic 
disease. Male or female subjects with hepati c impairment conforming to the Child-Pugh 
classification of B (Child-Pugh total score 7-9) based on the Child-Pugh scoring method 
described in Appendix [ADDRESS_842209] (healthy subject) with similar age (±10 years), weight (±10%), sex, 
and smoking status will be enrolled.  
Each subject will take a single bexagliflozin tablet, 20 mg, with 240 mL of water in the 
morning (approximately 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.) afte r an overnight fast. Food will be withheld for 
at least 2 h postdose. Water will be allowed as  desired except for one hour before and after 
drug administration.  
Blood samples for determining the plasma concentr ations of bexagliflozi n will be collected at 
predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 h postdose. 
Urine samples for PD analysis will be collected  predose and in the following intervals after 
dosing: 0–12, 12–24, 24–36, and 36–48 h. 
Plasma concentrations of bexagliflozin will be determined by [CONTACT_631128]-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. 
The unbound fraction of bexagliflozin will be dete rmined at 24 h postdose (or earlier if the 
24 h postdose sample has a concentration be low the limit of quantitation) and at the 
maximum plasma concentration for each subject by [CONTACT_70447].   
Clinical laboratory tests and safety monitori ng will be conducted during the treatment period 
and at the follow-up visit. The study event table is provided in Appendix 1 . 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
3.2.1 Rationale for Study Design 
Pharmacokinetic studies are used to identify special subgroups of patients for whom an 
alternative dosing regimen may be indicat ed for efficacy and/or safety reasons. Liver	
dysfunction	of	all	types,	from	tr ansient	injury	to	acute	liver	 failure,	are	common	in	adult	
populations.	 Through a variety of oxidative and conjuga tive metabolic pathways, the liver is 
involved in the clearance of many drugs. In a ddition, the liver directly excretes xenobiotic 
compounds and their metabolites into  bile. Because the liver produ ces the majority of protein 
in plasma, hepatic failure can also affect pl asma protein binding, which can influence the 
distribution or eliminati on of protein-bound drugs.

Confidential Page 17 of 53 In this study, the PK, PD and safety profile produced by a single oral dose of bexagliflozin 
tablets, 20 mg, will be compared between pati ents with moderate hepatic impairment and 
demographically matched subjects  with normal hepatic function. 	
3.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Bexagliflozin produces a dose-dependent and saturable UGE in healthy volunteers and 
diabetic subjects. A population PD model has predicted that bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, 
produced 85% and 94% of the maximal UGE in h ealthy and diabetic subjects, respectively. 
Bexagliflozin has consistently demonstrated wi de safety margins in clinical and nonclinical 
studies. . 
A single-dose study is considered sufficient since previous studie s show bexagliflozin exhibit 
linear and time-independent pha rmacokinetics (THR100-CLR-002).

6.7 Adverse Events Assessments 
Adverse Event (AE ): Any untoward medical occurrence in clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or dis ease temporally associat ed with the use of 
an investigational product, whet her or not it is considered re lated to the investigational 
product. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death, 
Bexagliflozin tablets  Theracos Sub, LLC 
Clinical Trial Protocol: THR-1442-C-[ADDRESS_842234] 2018 
   
 
Confidential Page 29 of 53 • is life-threatening (NOTE: The term "life-threatening" in th e definition of "serious" refers 
to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event and does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might ha ve caused death if it were more severe.), 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296], 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• is an important medical event. 
 An important medical event is an event that ma y not be immediately li fe-threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631125]. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Non-serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" adverse 
event. 
Immediately Reportable Adverse Event (IRAE):  Any serious adverse event or any 
adverse event that necessitates discon tinuation of investigational product. 
Clinical Laboratory Changes:  It is the investigator’s responsi bility to review the results of 
all laboratory tests as they become available.  For each abnormal laboratory test result, the 
investigator needs to ascertain if this is a c linically significant change from baseline for that 
individual subject. This determ ination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the 
first time an abnormal value is observed. The i nvestigator may repeat the laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. If this laboratory 
value is determined to be a clinically significant change from baseline for that subject, this is 
considered an AE. 
Hypoglycemia will be defined as any fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value ≤70 mg dL
-1 and 
documented as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Any clinical significant increase in hepatic en zymes and specifically ALT or AST > or = 3x 
ULN (for healthy control subjects), or AST or ALT >or = to 3x the subject’s baseline values, 
whichever is greater will be considered a clinical laboratory adverse event. 
An increase in creatinine from baseline by 0.5 mg dL-1 or more will be reported as a 
laboratory adverse event. 
Severity:  Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on the 
CRF. The intensity of an adverse ex perience is defined as follows: 
1 = Mild: discomfort noticed, but  no disruption to  daily activity 
2 = Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity

Clinical Trial Protocol: THR-1442-C-[ADDRESS_842235] 2018 
   
 
Confidential Page 30 of 53 3 = Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity 
Investigational Product Causality:  The site and database sh ould ask for the causality 
relative to the study compound. Relationship of an  adverse event to dosing will be assessed 
as follows: 
Definite: There is a reasonabl e causal relationship between th e investigational product and 
the AE when the event responds to withdrawal of the investigational product (dechallenge), 
and recurs with administration of th e investigational pr oduct (rechallenge). 
Probable: There is a reasonabl e causal relationship between the investigational product and 
the AE. The event responds to dechal lenge. Rechallenge is not required. 
Possible: There is a reasonabl e causal relationship between th e investigational product and 
the AE. Dechallenge is lacking or unclear. 
Not Likely: There is a temporal  relationship to investigatio nal product administration, but 
there is not a reasonable cau sal relationship between the i nvestigational product and the 
event. 
Unrelated: There is no temporal or caus al relationship to in vestigational product 
administration. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_842236] clinical admission day. The investigator 
will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events. To avoid bias in collecting information about adverse events, the investig ator should ask subjects the 
following question: "How have you felt since yo u were last checked?" All adverse events 
(serious and non-serious) reported by [CONTACT_631141]. 
In addition, the study Medical Monitor or the de signated Sponsor personnel must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_631142]. Special atten tion should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631126]. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_842237] (including

6.7.3 Follow-up of  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up of Non-serious Adverse Events 
Non-serious adverse events that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_631143]. All non-serious events that are ongoing at the 
time will be recorded as ongoing on the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up of Post-Study Serious Adverse Events

investigator should continue to report any si gnificant follow-up information to Theracos until 
the event has been resolved. 
Any new SAEs reported by [CONTACT_631145], and are determined by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator to be  reasonably associated with the use of 
the investigational pr oduct, should be reported to the Me dical Monitor or the sponsor’s 
designated personnel. These may include SA Es that are captured on follow-up telephone 
contact [CONTACT_272323] (i.e., up to last scheduled 
contact). The investigator should follow subjects with  SAEs identified after the last 
scheduled contact [CONTACT_631146], or the subjec t is lost to follow-up. The 
investigator should continue to report any si gnificant follow-up information to the Sponsor 
until the event has been resolved. This study requ ires that subjects be actively monitored for 
SAEs for  at least 14 days after discharge from the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity 
Any clinical significant increase in hepatic en zymes and specifically ALT or AST > or = 3x 
ULN (for healthy control subjects), or AST or ALT >or = to 3x the subject’s baseline values, 
whichever is greater,  requires immediate repeat test within 48 to 72 h to confirm the hepatic 
enzyme elevation. The event should be reported as an adverse event within the CRF if the 
enzyme elevation is confirmed or worseni ng. Potential contributors to hepatic enzyme 
elevation should be evaluated by [CONTACT_093] . The investigator is encouraged to consult 
with the Medical Monitor re garding ongoing diagnostic workup.

Confidential Page 32 of 53 [IP_ADDRESS] Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia will be recorded under 5 categories: 
• Critical hypoglycemia: An event requiring a ssistance of another person to actively 
administer carbohydrate, gluca gons, or other resuscitative ac tions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_272210]. Plasma glucose 
measurements may not be available during su ch an event, but neurological recovery 
attributable to the restora tion of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. All such 
events should be recorded as se rious adverse events in the CRF. 
• Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: An ev ent during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg dL
 -1 (3.9 mmol L-1). 
• Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: An event not  accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_78237] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg dL-1 
(3.9 mmol L- 1). 
• Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: An even t during which symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination but that was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg dL
-1 (3.9 mmol L- 1). 
• Relative hypoglycemia: An event during whic h the person reports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_443189], and interprets t hose as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with 
a measured plasma glucose concentration > 70 mg dL-1 (3.9 mmol L- 1). 
 
If a subject experiences symptomatic hypoglyc emia, confirmed by [CONTACT_2929]-of-care glucose 
monitoring at the time of sympto ms with a blood sugar level ≤ 70 mg dL-1 (3.9 mmol L- 1), 
the subject should be treated with 15 to 20 grams of oral glucose or simple carbohydrate 
(glucose tablets, raisins, orange juice, gl ucose-containing soda, or soft sugar candies). 
If a subject with symptomatic hypoglycemia is unable to self-administer glucose tablets, 
candies, or glucose-containing solutions, then the appropriate study st aff should administer 
50% IV Dextrose as soon as possible. If IV  Dextrose is unable to be administered, an

natural log of [ADDRESS_842267], the adjusted r2 value reported by [CONTACT_631148]®WinNonlin® must be ≥ 0.7.  
AUC 0-t, AUC 0-24 and AUC 0-∞ will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal linear 
interpolation method, using actual elapsed time values. If the actual collection time is 
unknown, the nominal collection time may be us ed for the purposes of PK parameter 
estimation. For the purpose of calculating AUC, all missing values will be treated as missing 
in the PK analysis and excluded from analysis except when they occur at predose, in which 
case they will be set to zero. All values that are below the limit of quantitation (BLOQ) prior 
to T max will be set to zero. BLOQ values that occur after T max will be considered missing. 
When ≥ 2 consecutive plasma concentrations that are BLOQ are encountered after T max, 
these and all subsequent values wi ll be excluded from the analysis.  
AUC 0-∞ will be calculated according to the following equation: 
AUC 0-∞= AUC last + (C last / λz), where C last is the last temporal quantifiable plasma 
concentration corresponding to T last.

(ANOVA) with a fixed effect co rresponding to the hepatic function group will be fitted to the 
natural logarithmic transformation of the PK parameters (C max, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞). The 
90% confidence intervals will be constructed for the ratio of geometric means of PK 
parameters (total and unbound C max, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞). The apparent clearance relative to 
the unbound drug concentration (Cl u/F) will be calculated as Cl u/F = Dose/AUC u. 
 Descriptive statistics of plasma concentra tion-time data will be summarized by [CONTACT_631129]. 
The PK parameters C

normalized by [CONTACT_631150], including UGE t1-t2 over specified time interval, and total 
24-hour, 48-hour UGE, will be determined. UGE t1-t2 (mg) will be derived from urine volume 
(Vt1-t2, mL) × glucose concentration (mg dL-1) / 100. UGE and nUGE will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_631151] p using descriptive statistics. 
Reported predose values for PD data that are below the defined limit will be set to zero. Any

This also applies to those subjects who fail to  complete the trial. The reason a subject is 
withdrawn must be recorded in the case report form. 
Entries made in the CRF must be verifiable against source documents. Source documents are 
defined as all medical records, medical notes , laboratory results, ECG traces and any 
additional document other than the CRF that has original subject information contained 
within it. 
All CRFs and source documents should be completed following GCPs and the CRO’s 
standard operating procedures. 
10.8 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
It is important to conduct the study according to the protocol. Protocol de viations will not be 
prospectively granted by [CONTACT_456]. If deviatio ns occur, such as a visit or sampling window 
being missed, the investigator must decide whet her to proceed, for example, whether or not 
to complete the visit or sample collection outside of the protocol-defined window. The 
sponsor’s medical monitor must be notified immediately when prot ocol deviations are 
discovered so that a decision about whether to keep the subject in the study can be made. 
Only when an emergency occurs that requires a departure from the protocol for an individual 
subject will there be such a departure without  the sponsor’s pre-approval. The nature and 
reasons for the protocol deviat ion will be recorded in the su bject’s CRF, and the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272216]. 
Protocol violations must be re ported in the final study report.

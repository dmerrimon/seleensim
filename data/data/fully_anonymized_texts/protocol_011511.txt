Title of study:   Phase I/II Trial of Avelumab In C ombination With Chemoradiation  In The Treatment Of Stage 
II/III Resectable Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Canc er.  
Study Phase: I/II 
Background: 
Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is pa rt of the standard of care for patients with stage II and III 
resectable esophageal and gastro esophageal junction (E/GEJ) cancer. This approach is based on 
the results of a large randomi zed clinical trial (CROSS) that d emonstrated superior survival in 
patients receiving neoadjuvant che moradiotherapy followed by [CONTACT_441526].  Pathological complete res ponse at the time of resection is 
strongly linked to better surviva l.  However, with current stra tegies pathological complete 
response is achieved only in a m inority (29%) of patients.  Rem aining patients, especially those 
with positive lymph nodes at the time of the resection, are at significant risk for recurrences.  
Five-year survival rate for th ese patients is only 37%, and ove rall survival is as low as [ADDRESS_560337] present with distant metastas es outside of th e radiation field.  This is not surprising since 
the accepted treatment paradigm for this diseas e does not targe t possible disseminated 
microscopic systemic disease.  H ence, novel strategies are need ed to improve outcomes of these 
patients.  We propose conducting a p hase I/II clinical trial ev aluating a role of immune 
checkpoint inhibitor in combinati on with chemoradiotherapy and post-operatively in the 
management of resectable esophageal cancer. 
Study Rationale:    
1. A number of preclinical and clin ical studies demonstrated synergism between radiation 
and immunotherapy, suggesting th at combining these approaches c an enhance anti-tumor 
activity and increase treatment efficacy. 
2. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrat ed promising act ivity in a subset of 
patients with metastatic esophage al and gastric cancers. Moving these agents into 
neoadjuvant setting may increase the cure rate of this disease compared to the standard 
approach. 
3. Current neoadjuvant therapy does  not target any potential mi croscopic disease outside of 
the radiation field since chemo therapy serves primarily as a ra diation sensitizer. 
Immunotherapy treatment will ta rget both local and systemic dis ease. 
Hypothesis: 
We hypothesize that co-administra tion of avelumab with chemorad iation will be well tolerated 
and will increase pathological complete response rate in resect ed tumor specimens. We 
hypothesize that avelumab treatment will also decrease the rate s of disease recurrence.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.[ADDRESS_560355] common site for esophageal cancers, and these tumors frequently involve 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).  There are two major histologi cal subtypes of esophageal 
cancer: squamous carcinoma and a denocarcinoma.  Although the in cidence of squamous cell 
esophageal cancer has been declining, esophageal adenocarcinoma  has one of the fastest growing 
incidence among solid tumors in t he Western world.  Esophageal adenocarcinoma is more 
common in males, but over the last few decades its rates among women have been increasing as 
well 1.  Tobacco and alcohol abuse are ma jor risk factors for esophageal SCC, while obesity and 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) predispose to the develo pment of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma.  The majority of p atients are diagnosed with at  least stage II disease, which 
requires multimodality therapy.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_441495], about 50% of patients ult imately developed recurrent di sease 2.  Further treatment 
strategies are needed to improve  recurrence free survival in th is patient population since 
metastatic esophageal cancer is universally fatal with current treatment options.   
1.[ADDRESS_560356] approach in the treatment o f resectable stage II or higher 
esophageal cancer.  This method is  based on the results of a la rge randomized clinical trial 
(CROSS) that demonstrated superior  survival in patients receivi ng neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy followed by [CONTACT_441528] 2,3.  In this trial, subjects with trimodality arm were treated concurrent chemoradiation that 
consisted of weekly radiosensit izing carboplatin (AUC 2) and pa clitaxel (50 mg/m2) for 5 weeks 
along with daily radiation for a total dose of 41 Gray (Gy) in 23 fractions 3. This treatment was 
well tolerated.  Over 90% of patien ts received all scheduled treatments, and there was no 
increase in postoperative compli cations.  Neoadju vant therapy r esulted in higher rates of R0 
resection and lower rates of l ymph node involvement in resected specimen compared to the 
control arm.  Pathologi cal complete response was see in 29% of patients (23% for 
adenocarcinomas and 49% for S CC) 3.  Pathological complete response at the time of resection 
is strongly linked to better survival.  CROSS trial demonstrated superior survival in patients

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
16(65) treated with trimodality thera py.  However, with current strate gies pathological complete 
response is achieved in a minority of patients.  The remaining patients, especially those with 
positive lymph nodes at the time of the resection, are at signi ficant risk for recurrences.  Five-
year survival rate for these patients is only 37%, and overall survival is as low as [ADDRESS_560357]-operative sett ings.  In a similar patient population 
with resectable gastric cancer treated with peri-operative chem otherapy, less than 50% of 
patients were able to receive a ll planned post-operative treatm ents 7.  In May 2021, adjuvant 
nivolumab was approved in adjuvant setting, This approval was b ased on the results from 
randomized phase [ADDRESS_560358] pronounced in patients with S CC.  \These results suggest that 
novel strategies that involve immunotherapy are warranted to im prove outcomes in patients with 
upper gastrointestinal (UGI) malignancies.   
1.3 Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Gastroesophageal Cancers 
Programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that is expressed in about 40% of UGI tumors.  PDL1 is one of th e ligands for programmed death 1 (PD-1), which is an 
inhibitory receptor that belongs  to the CD28-B7 family. Binding  to PD1 results in down 
regulation of the T cell immune response allowing PDL1 positive  tumors to evade immune 
mediated cell death.  PDL1 expression has been shown to be asso ciated with greater depth of 
muscle invasion, the presence of  lymph node metastasis, and overall worse prognosis
8,9.  A 
number of immunotherapy agents have demonstrated  activity again st metastatic 
gastroesophageal cancers.  Nivolum ab, an antibody that blocks PD1 receptor, is not approved in 
combination with chemotherapy for patients with untreated advan ced gastric, esophageal and 
GEJ adenocarcinoma based on the results of phase 3 trial Checkm ate 649 11.  Pembrolizumab 
(another anti PD1 antibody) is approved in combination with che motherapy in the 1st line 
treatment of advanced esophageal  cancer based on the results of phase [ADDRESS_560359] recently, nivolumab was 
approved in the adjuvant setting after resection of esophageal and GEJ cancers treated with 
preoperative chemoradiation and who had residual disease at the  time of resection 16. 
1.4 Avelumab 
 Pharmacology and Pre-Clinical Data 
Avelumab is a full human antibody of the immunoglobulin G 1 iso type that specifically targets 
and blocks programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for pr ogram death 1 (PD-1) receptor. 
The nonclinical pharmac ology studies have shown that avelumab functionally enhances T cell 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
17(65) activation in vitro and significan tly inhibits the growth of PD -L1 expressing tumors in vivo 
resulting in the restoration of  cytotoxic T cell response. Avelumab binds to human PD-L1 with a 
high affinity of 0.[ADDRESS_560360] shown that by [CONTACT_28738]-L1, 
avelumab effectively enhances T cell activation as measured by [CONTACT_13204] (IL)-2 or interferon-
gamma (IFN-ᵞ production.  In addition, as a fully human IgG1 antibody, avelumab has the 
potential to trigger the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytot oxicity (ADCC) against target 
cells expressing PD-L1.  In pre-cl inical studies, avelumab has demonstrated anti-tumor activity 
against murine MC38 colon carcinoma tumors that are characteriz ed by a high level of PD-L1 
expression. The combination of ave lumab with commonly used canc er treatments, such as 
cytotoxic agents and radiation th erapy, resulted in an improved anti-tumor activity.  Radiation 
therapy in particular was found to be a highly synergistic with  avelumab; this treated resulted in 
complete regression of establish ed tumors probably through generating anti-tumor immune 
memory. 
 Clinical Experience with Avelumab  
There are a number of ongoing Phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_560361] gastroesophageal cancer. In t his early trial avelumab treatment 
resulted in 15% RR in patients who have progressed on standard chemotherapy 15. Avelumab is 
currently being investigated in a randomized trial in similar setting, as well as for its role as 
maintenance therapy in metasta tic disease.  The safety for avel umab is based on [ADDRESS_560362] of the observed adverse events (AEs) were either in line with 
those expected in subjects with a dvanced solid tumors or with c lass effects of monoclonal 
antibodies (MoAbs) blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis.  In addition, infusion-related reactions 
including drug hypersensitivity reactions and immune-mediated a dverse reactions have been 
identified as important risks for  avelumab.  Respective risk mi tigation measures have been 
implemented in all ongoing clinical studies with avelumab. 
1.5 Rationale for Adding Avelumab to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation. 
A number of preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated syner gism between radiation and 
immunotherapy, suggesting that combining these approaches can e nhance anti-tumor activity 
and increase treatment efficacy 17-19. Local radiotherapy is thought to induce an 
immunostimulatory form of cell death via activation of multiple pro-inflammatory pathways 
and induction of changes in tumor microenvironment 19.  Although radiation induces 
chemokines that promote recruitment of effector CD8 cell and T-helper CD4 cells, it has also 
been shown to induce local upregulation of the PD-L1, which blo cks antitumor immunity 18,20,21 .  
In esophageal cancers, neoadjuvant chemoradiation has been shown to upregulate PDL1 expression by [CONTACT_46431] 50% compared to pre-treatment baseline 
22. In preclinical models, 
combination of radiation with immune checkpoint inhibitors demo nstrated impressive 
synergism 17,21.  In clinical practice, treatment  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_441496]–macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor has b een shown to increase the incide nce of abscopal events in 
patients with melanoma 23.  There a number of ongoing clini cal trials evaluating synergi sm 
between in radiation and immunotherapy in other disease types, including lung cancer,

18(65) melanoma, and other solid tumors (clinicatrials.gov).  Hence, g iven the fact that a number of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising activi ty in a subset of patients with 
metastatic esophageal and gastric cancers, moving these agents into neoadjuvant setting and 
combining with chemoradiation ma y increase the cure rate of thi s disease 24.  This approach 
takes advantage of the discussed synergism between immunotherap y and radiati on.  In addition, 
immunotherapy treatment will targ et both local and systemic dis ease, which is not addressed 
with the current t reatment paradigm.  
 
1.6 Benefit/Risk and Ethical Assessment 
Based on current clinical experien ce with immunotherapy in meta static setting, we hypothesize 
that adding avelumab to the neoa djuvant therapy can increase cu re rate in some patients with this 
disease.  Although increased toxic ities may be seen when avelum ab is combined with 
chemoradiation, we anticipate tha t overall the proposed regimen  will be tolerable and will 
provide additional efficacy f or a patient population with signi ficant recurrence ra tes using current 
treatment strategies. This clin ical trial is designed to avoid compromises to standard neoadjuvant 
therapy in the studied patient population.  In addition, a run- in phase is built in to ensure there is 
appropriate safety evaluation o f the proposed treatment. No new  safety signal were seen during 
evaluation of toxicities after the first 6 patients enrolled in  this trial.  If this study has promising 
results, future trials may also explore the use of this approach in larger randomized trials .

19(65) 3. STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
The study is a two-part phase 1/[ADDRESS_560363] of 3 parts: a 21 day screening period, t reatment procedures (neoadjuvant 
therapy, resection and adjuvant therapy), active surveillance for a year after the completion of 
adjuvant therapy.  After the final planned active surveillance visit at [ADDRESS_560364] 
review every 6 months during the following 3 years.   
3.2 Part 1: Run-In Phase 
Six patients will be enrolled in the run-in phase. The goal of this part is to establish safety and 
tolerability of avelumab when used  in combination with chemorad iation.    Safety evaluation will 
last until the first post-operative clinic visit at about 2-[ADDRESS_560365] s during the run-in phase will be 
allowed to proceed with adjuvant avelumab therapy while DLT evaluations on other subjects are 
ongoing.  If 2 or more patients e xperience dose-limiting toxici ties (DLT) associated with the 
proposed treatments, further acc rual of the subjects will be halted and trial will be suspended.  
Trial may be reopened in the fut ure with appropriate schedule a nd dose modifications of the 
proposed treatment.  
 Definitions of Dose-Limiting Toxicities  
For the purposes of this trial DLT will be defined as an adverse event (AE) that occurs after 
avelumab administration during preoperative period that is clin ically significant and/or 
unacceptable, and is judged to be a related to the avelumab tre atment by [CONTACT_093].  DLT 
evaluations will occur only during the first part of the trial.   Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0 will be used in DLT definition. 
Definition of DLTs: 
 Any complication directly relat ed to neoadjuvant therapy with avelumab that results in 
the delay in surgical resection, such that resection occurs mor e than [ADDRESS_560366] 
chemoradiation completion. 
 Any complications from neoadjuvant therapy that precludes surgi cal resection. Disease 
progression that prevents surgical resection is not considered a DLT. Medical 
comorbidities that are not related to neoadjuvant therapy in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], but which preclude safe surgical resection, are not considered a DLT.

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
20(65)  Any grade 3 immune mediated event (with the exception of esopha gitis) that fails to 
resolve with treatment interrup tion and systemic steroid admini stration (if needed) prior 
to surgical resection. 
 Any grade 4 treatment related non-hematologic to xicities excluding alopecia. 
 Any avelumab related toxicity tha t prevents completion of at least 2 of the 3 planned 
doses in neoadjuvant setting.  
3.3 Part 2: Expansion Cohort 
The second part of the trial w ill enroll [ADDRESS_560367] the com pletion of adjuvant therapy, active 
surveillance will be continued per discre tion of the treating physician.  Surveillance tests after 1 
year will not be mandated by [CONTACT_138773].  Survival data and d isease status will be collected 
from either patients or treati ng physicians every 6 months for up to 3 years after the study 
completion.   
3.5 Rationale for Study Design and Doses 
The study will use previously established doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel when used in 
combination with radiation in neoadjuvant setting for the treat ment of E/GEJ cancer. This 
treatment paradigm was estab lished based on the on randomized p hase III trial evaluating this 
approach 3.  Avelumab will be administere d at its standard dose of 10 mg/ kg IV every [ADDRESS_560368] (fif th) chemotherapy infusion. The 
schedule of avelumab administration was chosen to optimize the synergism between 
chemoradiation and immunotherapy, but also to avoid any comprom ise to the standard of care 
chemoradiation administered to this patient population.  A total of 3 months (6 treatments every 
2 weeks) of adjuvant avelumab wi ll be administered post-operatively.  Additional avelumab 
treatments were built into the pro tocol to maximize potential b enefits of avelumab on systemic 
recurrences.  Three months durat ion was chosen to mimic perioperative gastric cancer treatment 
standards, where [ADDRESS_560369]-opera tive chemotherapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_441497] 7. Similar to this approach, w ith the proposed treatment 
schema patients will receive a total of 18 weeks of avelumab.

5. TREATMENTS 
All patients will receive weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel whi le undergoing radiation therapy.  
Chemotherapy will be started on day 1 of radiation and will be given every 7 days. A total of 5 
planned weekly chemotherapy tre atments will be administered dur ing the course of the study.  
Radiation will be administered Monday – Friday until the planne d course is completed.  
Avelumab will be given every two weeks starting on the same day  as the last chemotherapy 
infusion (day 29).  If the last dos e of chemotherapy is omitted  due to cytopenias, avelumab will 
still be administered as origin ally planned.  Avelumab will be continued after radiation is 
completed. A total of [ADDRESS_560375]-operat ively.  
5.1 Chemotherapy Administration 
Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and Carboplatin (AUC 2) will be given via intravenous infusion  on days 1, 
8, 15, [ADDRESS_560376] of care proce dures and institutiona l guidelines will be followed 
during the administration of these  agents. Detailed information  about carboplatin and paclitaxel 
can be obtained from drug package inserts. 
Patients who start treatment wit h paclitaxel are at risk for hy persensitivity reaction (HSR).  All 
patients should be premedicated pr ior to paclitaxel administrat ion in order to prevent severe 
HSRs.  Premedication regimen will consist of dexamethasone 12 a nd 6 hours before treatment, 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
24(65) diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 minutes prior t o chemotherapy, and ranitidine 
50 mg IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Oral dexamethasone d oses will be 20 mg before 
day 1 treatment, 12 mg before day 8 treatment, and 8 mg before day 15 treatment.  Patients who 
do not take dexamethasone at home will receive IV dexamethasone  before paclitaxel infusion: [ADDRESS_560377] 3 paclitaxel infusions with the above 
premedication regimen will be asked to stop further premedication with dexamethasone during subsequent treatments since thei r risk for subsequent significa nt HSR is very low 
25. This change 
in premedication is done to prev ent any potential counteractivi ty of the steroids with 
immunotherapy. These patients will continue to receive diphenhydramine and ranitidine.  Dexamethasone can be reinstituted as needed if HSR were to deve lop.  Subjects can continue 
with the study protocol even if d examethasone is required for premedication prior to 
chemotherapy infusion.  
5.2 Avelumab Administration 
 Dosing and Administration of Avelumab 
Avelumab 10mg/kg will be administered intravenously every [ADDRESS_560378]’s weight changes more than 10% compared to prior treatment or baseline.  
A new baseline weight will be obtained prior to the first post-operative avelumab dose administration.  In order to mi tigate infusion related reaction s, a premedication with an 
antihistamine and with paracetamo l (acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_560379] 4 
infusions of avelumab is mandato ry (for example, 25-50 mg diphe nhydramine (IV or oral) and 
500-650 mg acetaminophen.  Premedication should be administered  for subsequent avelumab 
infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. This 
may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelin es, as appropriate.   
Avelumab will be diluted in Sodium Chloride 0.9% 250mL and infu sed IV over 60 minutes (-
10/+20 minutes) via a 0.2 micron in line filter. Immediately fo llowing the infusion of avelumab, 
it is recommended (but not ma ndatory) to conduct a normal salin e flush using the same tubing 
and 25-100 mL normal saline infused at the same rate to clear the infusion set of residual drug. 
Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for im mediate access to an intensive 
care unit or equivalent environment and administration of thera py for anaphylaxis, such as the 
ability to implement immediate resuscitation measures.  Steroid s (dexamethasone 10 mg), 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1,000 dilution), antihistamines, bronchodilators , or equivalents, and oxygen 
should be available for immediate access along with equipment f or assisted ventilation.  
Following the avelumab infusion, p atients must be observed for [ADDRESS_560380] infusion for 
potential infusion related reactions. 
 Packaging, Labeling, Storing and Preparation 
Avelumab is provided by [CONTACT_441531] a form of a sterile, clea r, colorless and non-pyrogenic 
solution for intravenous infusion.  It will be presented in Type I glass vials filled with 10 mL of 
liquid (200 mg/vial), closed with  a rubber septum and sealed wi th an aluminum flip off seal.

acetate buffered solution at pH 5.[ADDRESS_560381] be stored under refrigeration at 
(2ºC-8ºC) in an environment with temperature control devices.  Temperatures must be recorded 
on a daily basis.  Vials must not b e stored at room temperature , frozen or shaken vigorously. 
Vials must be warmed up to room t emperature by [CONTACT_441532] 30 (+20) 
minutes before preparing each dose.  Avelumab infusion solution  should be prepared by [CONTACT_441533] 0.9% Sodium Chloride (Norma l Saline) (or in 0.45% Sodium Chloride, only if the first option 
is not applicable). The verifie d avelumab concentration range i n the infusion solution is 0.016 
mg/mL to 8 mg/mL.  Any unused portion of the solution should be discarded in biohazard waste disposal with final disposal by [CONTACT_441534]. 
 Avelumab Product Accountability 
Avelumab must not be used for any purpose other than this clini cal trial.  The administration of 
trial drug to subjects who have not been enrolled is considered  a protocol deviation.  
Rigorous drug accountability will be  maintained at all times an d will include (at minimum) the 
following information: record of product receipt, perpetual inv entory (including batch/lot 
number and quantity), subject dos ing and utilization, and disposal.  All clinical study drug 
provided by [CONTACT_441535] r trial completion with require d documentation.   
5.3 Radiation Therapy 
The radiation will be administered concurrently with the chemot herapy.  Both 3-D conformal 
radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) will be allowed.  The 
IMRT may be delivered with either conventional IMRT, Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) or helical IMRT (tomotherapy).  
 Dose Specification 
The planned total dose will be 41.4 Gray (Gy) in 23 fractions at 1.80 Gy/day.  Patients will be 
treated 5 days/week; patients wi ll receive the 41.4 Gy over an approximately 4-1/2-week period.  
The daily prescription dose will be to the selected isodose cur ve, 95% of which must encompass 
the entire planning target volume (PTV).   
 Volume Definitions 
Gross tumor volume (GTV) will include all FDG avid regions by P ET/CT or areas of 
involvement identified by [CONTACT_441536] (whichever is larger).  Cli nical tumor volume (CTV) 
consists of a minimum of [ADDRESS_560382] a ≥ 1 cm CTV in all 
dimensions, and the involved nodal region can be included at th e physician’s discretion. CTVs 
may be edited off of uninvolved normal tissues. 
 
Clinical Study Protocol

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
26(65) PTV will provide a margin around the CTV to compensate for vari ability in treatment setup, 
breathing, or motion during treatment.  A margin around the CTV will define the PTV.  The PTV 
volume must include a minimum of 0.3 cm and a maximum of 2 cm a round the CTV. Margins 
can be adjusted as necessary to avoid excessive normal organ ex posure, as defined in section 
5.2.5.  Use of cross-sectional imaging based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) may further limit PTV volume. 
 Treatment Planning 
A PET and CT scan (preferably a PET/CT) for diagnosis and volum etric treatment planning is 
required.  Planning and treatment w ill be performed with the patient in supi[INVESTIGATOR_441499].  Treatment will be given free breathing or at b reath hold with gating per the 
treating physician’s discretion. Three mm or smaller CT slices will be obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the mid-abdomen as part of the PET/CT.  A 4D CT simulation may be obtained to evaluate internal target motion and create an internal target volume (ITV) for better definition of 
PTV margins.  All plans will be limited to the dose constraints  as described below.  
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], liver, lung, and heart will be contoured in th eir entirety.  The lungs, heart, spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232], and liver will be the considered the primary dose-limitin g structures.  When planning the 
beam arrangement to the PTV, the lungs, heart, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and  liver should be out of the field to 
the greatest extent possible.  T he dose per fraction to the lun gs, heart, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_441500] [ADDRESS_560383] extent possible.  If tolerance dose to any of 
the normal organs is exceeded i n a treatment plan, alternate be am arrangements should be used. 
Maximum dose to the PTV should not exceed the prescription dose  by >10 %. The maximum 
point dose to critical normal stru ctures outside the PTV including the unspecified tissue should 
not exceed the prescription dose. The treating physician must c arefully consider the tolerance 
dose/volume to each critical normal structure and unspecified t issue. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Critical structures 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_441501] < 0.[ADDRESS_560384] receiv ing ≥ 40.0 Gy.   
 Heart:  Heart mean dose of < 25 Gy.  
 Liver:  mean liver dose not to exceed 25 Gy. 
 Lung:  the volume(V) of lung outsi de of the PTV that receives 20 Gy will be limited to < 
30% (V 20 < 30%). Mean lung dose < 18 Gy. 
 Kidney:  combined kidneys V 20<33%, each individual kidney V 20 <50%. 
 Quality Control 
Dose heterogeneity:  Maximum dose to PTV should not exceed the prescription dose by > 10%. 
The maximum point dose to critical normal structures outside th e PTV including the unspecified 
tissue should not exceed the prescription dose.  The treating p hysician must carefully consider 
the tolerance dose/volume to each  critical normal structure and  unspecified tissue.

Administration of anti-cancer age nts other than those specified in the protocol is not allowed 
during study enrolment.  
 Immunosuppressive Agents 
The use of immunosuppressive agent s is prohibited during the treatment with avelumab and until 
surgical resection, including immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids.  Subjects will 
be allowed to use topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra-articular, intranasal and inhalational corticosteroids (with 
minimal systemic absorption).  Physiologic replacement doses of  systemic corticosteroids are 
permitted at doses of ≤ 10 mg of daily prednisone (or equivalent). A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., for contrast dye allergy  or to prevent taxane related 
hypersensitivity reaction) or for treatment of non-autoimmune c onditions (e.g., delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.  However, it is preferable 
that steroid premedication is re duced or omitted by [CONTACT_5875] 22 of treatment if no hypersensitivity 
reaction with taxanes has been observed during prior weeks.

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
33(65) 7. TOXICITY MANAGEMENT 
7.1 General Toxicity Management Guidelines  
These guidelines are applicable for toxicity management during the study duration with the 
exception of the DLT evaluati on period in part 1. Any toxicity observed during the course of the 
study should be managed by [CONTACT_441539]/ or dose reduction of the drug if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_737] . In general, any Grade [ADDRESS_560392] any clinical 
correlate, and resolve within 7 da ys with adequate medical management. 
7.2 Hematologic Toxicity 
During the pre-operative phase, if on days 8, 15, 22, 29 ANC is  < 1000 and PLT < 50, 
chemotherapy should not be admin istered and delayed by [CONTACT_185883] . On day 29, which is the last 
treatment, chemotherapy can be  administered if ANC is ≥ 750.  S ince bone marrow toxicity is 
not specifically associated with avelumab, avelumab can be admi nistered even with the above 
labs.  However, avelumab should be  held for grade [ADDRESS_560393]  dose of chemotherapy is not given 
because of hematologic toxicit y and avelumab needs to be delaye d, avelumab can be started as 
soon as there is adequate bone marrow recovery.  
7.3 Non-Hematologic Toxicity During Chemoradiation 
Any Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological treatment related toxicity (exc ept for alopecia or esophagitis) 
during chemoradiation should resu lt in dose delays of chemother apy and appropriate supportive 
measures should be instituted until toxicity resolves to Grade ≤ 2.  Radiation should continue as 
planned unless toxicities are t hought to be speci fically radiat ion related and would not resolve 
without radiation interruption i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_73829].   
Intravenous therapy and radiation can continue with ongoing gra de [ADDRESS_560394] ice standards.  In some instan ces, medical support with intravenous 
hydration and parenteral nutri tion may be necessary for support in order to complete the planned 
neoadjuvant treatment.  In the eve nt of grade 4 treatment induced esophagitis all of the treatment 
should be held until esophagit is resolves to grade ≤ 3.  
If radiation has to be interrupted for toxicity, additional rad iation days may be added at the end 
of the treatment.  Chemotherapy w ill be added as needed to match weekly radiation schedule. 
Avelumab may potentially be sta rted after day 29, but its start  date must coincide with the last 
chemotherapy infusion or be give n on the day chemotherapy was p lanned (if chemotherapy was 
held for hematologic toxic ities as deta iled above).

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
34(65) 7.4 Immune-Mediated Toxicities of Avelumab 
Avelumab treatment may result in  toxicities related to the acti vation of immune system and its 
off-target effects.  These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may be se en after the first dose or as late 
as weeks after the last  dose of avelumab.   
Dose reduction of avelumab is not allowed.  Dose delays or trea tment discontinuation may be 
necessary depending on the grade and timing of the AE.  If AEs require more than [ADDRESS_560395] dose of 
chemotherapy.  
Any Grade 3 avelumab attributed A Es require treatment discontin uation with avelumab 
except for any of the following :  
 Transient (≤ 6 hours) Grade 3 flu-l ike symptoms or fever, which is controlled with 
medical management. 
 Transient (≤ 24 hours) Grade 3 fa tigue, local reactions, headac he, nausea, emesis that 
resolves to Grade ≤ 1.  
 Single laboratory values out of nor mal range (excluding Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_560396] 
increase) that are unlikely related to study treatment accordin g to the Investigator, do not 
have any clinical correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤ 1 within 7 days with adequate medical 
management. Asymptomatic eleva tion of amylase or lipase do not require drug 
interruption or discontinuation, even if these lab abnormalitie s are thought to be related to 
avelumab. 
 Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or ra sh localized at sites of 
known or suspected tumor. 
 Change in ECOG PS to ≥ 3 that does not resolve to ≤ 2 within 14  days (infusions should 
not be given if the ECOG PS is ≥ 3 on the day of study drug adm inistration). 
 Grade 3 esophagitis during neoadjuvant therapy does not necessitate treatment 
discontinuation. 
Any Grade 2 avelumab attributed AEs  should be managed as follow s: 
 If a Grade 2 AE resolves to Gra de ≤ [ADDRESS_560397] lumab administration, 
treatment may continue. 
 If a Grade 2 AE does not resolve to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_560398] should permanen tly discontinue treatment wit h avelumab (except for 
hormone insufficiencies that ca n be managed by [CONTACT_441540]; for these hormone 
insufficiencies, up to 2 subsequent doses may be omitted). This is not applicable to 
esophagitis during neoadjuvant phase of the treatment.

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
35(65)  Upon the second occurrence of the s ame Grade 2 AE (except for h ormone insufficiencies 
that can be managed by [CONTACT_441541] t therapy) in the same subject , treatment with 
avelumab has to be permanently discontinued. This is not applicable to esophagitis during neoadjuvant phase of  the treatment.  
 No treatment interruptions/disco ntinuation is needed for asymptomatic elevation of 
amylase or lipase. 
For any additional immune mediate d toxicities tha t are not list ed in Table 1 below, treatment 
should be held for any AE of Grade 2 or higher until resolution  down to grade 1 or 0. Treatment 
should be discontinued permanently  if toxicities remain at grad e 2 or above for over 2 weeks 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_441502] (including ste roids if needed).

microscopic examination of the primary tumor and any lymph node s sampled after surgery 
following neoadjuvant therapy.  Par ticipants with invalid/missi ng pCR assessments will be 
defined as non-responders.  In patients not achieving pCR, measurement of residual disease will 
be performed. 
 Assessment of Treatment Effect 
Response of tumor to previous che motherapy and/or radiation therapy will be reported.  Several 
systems for tumor response have been advocated, and a modified Ryan scheme is suggested by [CONTACT_244596]/AJCC, which has been shown to provide good interobserver reproducibility and provide prognostic significance in rectal cancer

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
47(65) 9.[ADDRESS_560417]. Deming’s laboratory. Twenty FFPE slides 
will be needed for the proposed correlates. 
 PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
PD-L1 staining has been the best studied of all immune biomarke rs in the setting of checkpoint 
blockade.  The presence of PD-L1 has been associated with an en hanced treatment benefit rate to 
checkpoint blockade in many settings.  Standardized protocols h ave now been developed for 
anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry ( IHC).  Pre-treatment PD-L1 sta ining will be performed on 
the pre-treatment biopsy tissue . This staining will be scored a s the percent of positive staining 
cells per high power field (hpf).  
 Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes a nd Examination of the Immune Co ntext 
Multiple investigations have now demonstrated a correlation bet ween the presence of tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and a favorable prognosis.  An increase in TILs 
is commonly being used as a surr ogate marker for the developmen t of an immune response in the 
setting of immune-based anti-can cer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As part of this  clinical trial, the presence of TILs 
and other immune cell populations will be determined, comparing  pretreatment biopsy tissue and 
the resection specimen following avelumab in combination with c hemoradiation.  
IHC studies will be performed on formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedd ed tumor tissue. IHC will be 
performed per standardized proto cols for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD45RO and potentially 
other biomarkers of response.  O mission of the primary antibody will be used as a negative 
control along with positive cont rol tissue.  Semi-automated quantitative brightfield assessment of 
expression will be performed using the Vectra imaging system (P erkinElmer) and inForm 
analysis software system.  A scanning protocol will be generated based on the tissue size and 
location of the cancer within the  sample.  Biomarker quantifica tion will be calculated as a 
continuous variable (mean optical density) and also as quartiles (ex. 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+).   
 Versican Proteolysis 
Versican (VCAN) is a tumor matrix  proteoglycan with known immun oregulatory properties that 
when cleaved by [CONTACT_17873]-TS proteases releases an immunostimulatory  fragment, versikine. 
Tumors displaying a VCAN proteolysis predominant phenotype (low  staining for VCAN and 
intense staining for versikine) have been shown to have a great er CD8+ T cell infiltration.  In 
these investigations VCAN proteolysis will be examined as an im mune biomarker. IHC will be 
performed for the total (intact) VCAN and versikine. Biomarker quantification will be performed 
in quartiles (0, 1+, 2+, or 3+). The VCAN proteolysis predomina nt phenotype will be classified 
as VCAN <2+ and versikine > 2+.

 Pretreatment Specimen Collection 
A total of 10 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) slides fr om the diagnostic biopsy will be 
collected and transferred to the Deming Laboratory in the McArd le Laboratory for Cancer 
Research. These samples will be coded prior to transfer and lab eled with the study number, 
subject ID and date.   
 Resection Specimen Collection 
The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center Biobank will be notified of all subjects 
undergoing resection as part of this protocol.  At the time of the operation, the tissue will be 
transferred to surgical pathology and residual tissue will be c ollected by [CONTACT_441544].  
Tissue will be then be coded and transferred to Deming Laborato ry staff for storage and future 
studies including but not limited to tissue culture, RNA, DNA a nd protein analyses.  Samples 
will be coded and labeled with the study number, subject ID and  date. In patients with complete 
pathologic response, tissue sect ions that include tumor bed/sca r (determined by a pathologist) 
will be submitted for correlative studies. 
 Peripheral Blood Collection 
Plasma and serum samples will be collected (50 ml per draw in a heparinized tube green top for 
plasma and 10 ml per draw in red top tube for serum) as per the  study calendar, These samples 
will then be coded and transferred to the Deming Laboratory for  storage and analysis. Samples 
will be labeled with the study number, subject ID and date.. Co llected samples will be used for 
exploratory studies evaluating potential circulating markers of  response.  These studies may 
include, but are not limited to, CD4/CD8 ratio determination, T CR subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cell free tumor 
DNA evaluation, and measuring serum circulating chemokines and cytokines.  The samples will also be banked for future studies.

The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study is 
familiar with the cont ent of this section. 
10.[ADDRESS_560419].  An undesirable medical condition can 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
49(65) be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electroc ardiogram).  In clinical studies, an 
AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at an y time during treatment and 
during the 30 day follow-up period. The term AE is used to incl ude both serious and non-serious 
AEs. 
 Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study pha se (i.e., screening, run-in, 
treatment, wash-out, follow-up), a t any dose of the study drugs that fulfills one or more of the 
following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life-threatening 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441506] (>24 
hours). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a plan ned procedure, such as feeding tube placement, 
esophageal stent placement or es ophagectomy, is not considered an SAE. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon medic al judgement, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surg ical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatmen t/procedures) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to EMD Serono or designee. 
10.[ADDRESS_560420] dose of trial drug and/or until ev ent resolution. All new AEs 
occurring during that period must  be recorded (if SAEs, they mu st be reported to the FDA and 
EMD Serono See section 11). In addition, all grades of adverse drug reactions (ADRs, AEs 
related to study medication) and any AE that results in treatme nt discontinuation will be recorded 
as study data on CRFs.  All study-related toxicities/SAE s must be followed until resolution, unless in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve.  
 The following variables will be collected for each AE: 
 AE (verbatim) 
 The date when the AE started and stopped 
 Changes in NCI CTCAE (version 5. 0) grade and the maximum CTC gr ade attained 
 Whether the AE is serious or not 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
50(65)  Investigator causality rating against the investigational combi nation (yes or no)  
 Action taken with regard to investigational combination agent 
 Outcome. 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs : 
 Date AE met criteria for serious AE 
 Date Investigator became aware of serious AE 
 AE is serious due to criteria listed in Section 9.1.2 
 Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Date of discharge 
 Probable cause of death (if applicable) 
 Date of death (if applicable) 
 Autopsy performed (if applicable) 
 Description of AE 
 Causality assessment in rela tion to Study procedure(s) 
 Causality assessment in rela tion to study drug combination 
 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms 
When collecting AEs, the record ing of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and th ere are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and  each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately. 
 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests 
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated labo ratory values and vital signs 
should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product. 
If deterioration in a laborator y value/vital sign is associated  with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be report ed as an AE and the associate d laboratory result/vital sign will 
be considered as additional info rmation.  Wherever possible the  reporting investigator will use 
the clinical, rather than the la boratory term (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant dete riorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s). Any new or aggravated clinically  relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE . 
 Disease Progression 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subje ct’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the investig ational product is being studied.   It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under st udy and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The 
development of new or progression of existing metastasis during the study should be considered 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
51(65) as disease progression and not a n AE.  Events, which are unequi vocally due to disease 
progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
 New Cancers 
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at least one of the serious criteria (see Section 10.1.2).  New  primary cancers are those that are 
not the primary reason for the administration of the study trea tment and have developed after the 
inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include m etastases of the original cancer.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the me tastasis itself should not be r eported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression. 
 Lack of Efficacy 
When there is deterioration in the condition for which the stud y treatment(s) is being used, there 
may be uncertainty as to whether  this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_441507] s that the study treatment cont ributed to the deterioration of the 
condition, or local regulations s tate to the contrary, the dete rioration should be considered to be a 
lack of efficacy and not an AE. 
 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol- defined 30-day post-study 
follow-up period after the admini stration of the last dose of s tudy treatment, must be reported to 
EMD Serono or designee within [ADDRESS_560421] 
describes the category of death: 
 Toxicity for study medication. 
 Radiological disease progression. 
 Clinical disease progression. 
 Other causes. 
Death should be reported in the following manner: 
 Death clearly the result of dis ease progression should be repor ted and should be 
documented in the eCRF, but it should not be reported as an SAE . 
 Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of t he disease under study, the 
AE causing the death must be repo rted to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours  
(see Section 11 for fu rther details).  The report should contai n a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of progression of  disease, if appropriate, and s hould assign main and 
contributory causes of death.

post-mortem results should be fo rwarded to EMD Serono within th e usual timeframes. 
11. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
11.1 Oversight and Monitoring Plan 
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is respon sible for the regular 
review and monitoring of all ongoi ng clinical research in the U WCCC. A summary of DSMC 
activities are as follows: 
 Reviews all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for subject safety, protocol 
compliance, and data integrity.  
 Reviews all Serious Adverse Events (SAE) requiring expedited re porting, as defined in the 
protocol, for all clinical trial s conducted at the UWCCC, and studies conducted at external 
sites for which the UWCCC acts as an oversight body.  
 Reviews all reports generated through the UWCCC DSMS elements ( Internal Audits, 
Quality Assurance Reviews, Response Reviews, Compliance Reviews , and Protocol 
Summary Reports) described in Section II of this document.  
 Notifies the protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_441508] C decisions and, if applicable, any requirements for 
corrective action related to data or safety issues.  
 Notifies the CRC of DSMC decisions and any correspondence from the DSMC to the 
protocol Principal Investigator.  
 Works in conjunction with the UW Health Sciences IRB in the rev iew of relevant safety 
information as well as protoco l deviations, non-compliance, and unanticipated problems 
reported by [CONTACT_15266].  
 Ensures that notification of S AEs requiring expedited reporting  is provided to external 
sites participating in multi-institutional clinical trials coor dinated by [CONTACT_135262].  
11.2 Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines 
UWCCC quality assurance and moni toring activities are determined by [CONTACT_441545]. All proto cols (including Intervention 
Trials, Non-Intervention Trials, Behavioral and Nutritional Stu dies, and trials conducted under a 
Training Grant) are evaluated by [CONTACT_15269]. UWCCC 
monitoring requirements for tria ls without an acceptable extern al DSMB are as follows: 
 Intermediate Monitoring 
Protocols subject to intermedia te monitoring generally include UW Institutional Phase I/II and 
Phase II Trials. These protocols  undergo review of subject safe ty at regularly scheduled DOT 
meetings where the results of ea ch subject’s treatment are disc ussed and the discussion is 
documented in the DOT meeting mi nutes. The discussion includes the number of subjects 
enrolled, significant toxicities , dose adjustments, and responses observed. Protocol Summary

11.6 Study Progress Review  
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC in the timeframe 
determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quarterly; semi-annu ally; or annua lly). The PSR 
provides a cumulative report of S AEs, as well as instances of n oncompliance, protocol 
deviations, and unanticipated pr oblems, toxicitie s and responses that have occurred on the 
protocol in the timeframe specifi ed. PSRs for those protocols s cheduled for review are reviewed 
at each DSMC meeting. Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to asses s whether significant 
benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study suspen sion or closure. This information 
is evaluated by [CONTACT_441548] q uality assurance activities (e.g., 
reports from Internal Audits, Qua lity Assurance Reviews) occurr ing since the prio r review of the 
protocol by [CONTACT_6802]. Additionally, the DSMC requires the study  team to submit external 
DSMB or DSMC reports if available and any other pertinent study -related information 
In the event that there is si gnificant risk warranting study su spension or closure, the DSMC will 
notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_441518] a ction is taken for  the protocol 
(e.g., suspension or closure). The D SMC ensures that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_441519] y or permanent 
suspension of a clinical trial to EMD Serono and other appropri ate agencies. DSMC findings and 
requirements for follow-up acti on are submitted to the CRC. 
12. EXPEDITED REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Depending on the nature, severit y, and attribution of the serio us adverse event an SAE report 
will be phoned in, submitted i n writing, or both according to T able [ADDRESS_560424] als o be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any funding

FDA Reporting Requirements for S erious Adverse Events (21 CRF P art 312) 
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the University of Wisconsin Carbone Canc er 
Center  and any other parties outlined in the protocol ANY Serious Adve rse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/int ervention (21 CFR 312.64). 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
1) Death. 
2) A life-threatening adverse event (the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe). 
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p rolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 hours. 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be  life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medi cal judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or su rgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes lis ted in this definition (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and

2. Amend the protocol 
3. Suspend the protocol 
All AEs found to be expected or non -serious will be included in the Annual Report to EMD 
Serono. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
14.1 Sample Size and Power Calculation 
 Part 1- Run-in Phase  
A total number of 6 subjects will be enrolled during the run-in  phase of the trial. A sample size 
of 6 is sufficient to estimate th e true dose limiting toxicity rate of the proposed 
avelumab/chemoradiation thera py with adequate accuracy. Specifi cally, the true dose limiting 
toxicity rate will be estimated with a standard error of 20%.Th e proposed treatment combination 
will be considered as safe if dose limiting toxicities are obse rved in at most [ADDRESS_560433] one 
patient for various toxicity rates. 
 
Table 7: Operating Characteristics of run-in phase – probabilities tha t the proposed 
avelumab/chemoradiation therapy will be considered as safe for various true dose 
limiting toxicity rates ranging between 0.[ADDRESS_560434] one  patient (treatment combination will be declared as safe) 0.97 0.89 0.78 0.66 0.53 0.42 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Avelumab   
Study Code UW17106 
Version 7, 07/05/2021  
60(65) For example, if the true DLT ra te is 10%, then the probability that the proposed t reatment will be 
declared as safe is 89 %. 
 Part 2 – Expansion Phase 
This is a Phase 2 portion of the trial, which will evaluate the  efficacy of the proposed 
avelumab/chemoradiation therapy in patients with stage II/III r esectable esophageal cancer. The 
primary endpoint for the phase II component is the pathological  complete response rate. A 
pathological complete response rate of 29% (95% CI: 23-37%) has  been reported for standard 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy 3.  A pathological complete res ponse rate of 20% or less, i.e., 
less than the lower 95% confid ence bound of the reported respon se rate for standard care, will be 
considered as unacceptably low fo r this patient population.  It is hypothesized that the co-
administration of avelumab with c hemoradiation will substantial ly increase pathological 
complete response rate to 40% or above. A single-stage design w ill be used to evaluate the 
pathological response rate.  The  null hypothesis that the patho logical complete response rate is at 
most 20% versus will be tested  against the alternative hypothes is that the rate it greater than 
20%.  With a sample size of 24 pa tients, an anticipated patholo gical response rate of 40% will be 
detected with 80% power at the one-sided 0.1 significance level . The following table shows the 
operating characteristics of t he two-state study design. 
 
Table 8: Operating characteristics of single-stage study design for expansion cohort.  
 True Patholo gical Complete Response Rate 
 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 
Probability that the proposed avelumab/chemoradiation therapy will be declared as effective (rejecting the null hypothesis that the pathological complete response rate is at most 20%) 0.23 0.44 0.64 0.81 0.91 0.97 
 
For example, if the true patholog ical complete response rate is  45%, then the probability of 
declaring the proposed avelumab/ chemoradiation therapy was effe ctive is 91%. 
14.2 Analysis Plan 
 General 
Descriptive statistics will prima rily be generated to summarize the data.  For continuous 
variable, descriptive statistics may include the number of subj ects reflected in the calculation 
(n), mean, standard deviation, m edian, minimum, and maximum; fr equencies and percentages 
may be displayed for categoric al data (e.g., toxicities, respon ses).  Data analysis will be 
performed using SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) version 9.4.

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
61(65) 
 Demographics 
All demographic variables (e.g ., gender, age, weight, etc.) wil l be summarized by [CONTACT_312589], i.e., in terms of means, standard devia tions, medians, and ranges for 
variables on a continuous scale, and in terms of frequency tables for variables on a categorical scale. 
 
 Primary Endpoints 
Part 1:  All patients who receiv e at least one dose of avelumab  will be evaluated for toxicity and 
tolerability. Toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of types and severities by [CONTACT_441554] A dverse Events (CTCAE) v 45.0. The number and severity 
of toxicity incidents will be ana lyzed descriptively in tabular  format. The 90% confidence 
interval for the dose limiting toxicity rate (DLT) will be cons tructed using the Wilson score 
method.  
 
Part 2: Pathologic compete response (pCR) is defined as an abse nce of any viable tumor at 
microscopic examination of the primary tumor and any lymph node s sampled after surgery 
following neoadjuvant therapy.  Par ticipants with invalid/missi ng pCR assessments will be 
defined as non-responders.  The number and frequency of patient s with a pCR will be 
summarized in tabular format.  T he pCR rate will be reported al ong with the corresponding 90% 
confidence interval which will be constructed using the Wilson score method.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints 
Disease free survival (DFS) will be defined as the number of da ys from the day of resection to 
the day a subject experiences an event of disease recurrence or  death, whichever comes first. If a 
subject has not experienced an ev ent of disease recurrence prog ression or death at the time of 
analysis, then the subject’s data will be censored at the date of the last available evaluation. DFS 
will be summarized using point estimates of the median time to progression and the associated 
95% confidence interval. The data  will be presented graphically  using Kaplan-Meier plots. 
Incidence of survival complications and the rate of R0 resection will be calculated and report along with the corresponding 95% c onfidence intervals which wil l be constructed using the 
Wilson score method.

for reporting as described for the SAEs . 
 Maternal Exposure 
If a patient becomes pregnant dur ing the course of the study, a ll treatments should be 
discontinued immediately. The out come of any conception occurri ng from the date of the first 
dose until [ADDRESS_560436] dose should be followed up and documented.

Version 7, 07/05/2021  
62(65) Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless the re is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_367386] a contraceptive 
medication. Congenital abnormalitie s/birth defects and spontane ous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriag e, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be fo llowed up and documented even 
if the patient was withdrawn from the study.   
 Paternal Exposure 
Male patients should refrain fro m fathering a child or donating  sperm during the study and for 30 
days after the completion of adjuvant therapy. Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not 
considered to be an adverse even t.  However, the outcome of all  pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective terminati on, ectopic pregnancy, normal bi rth or congenital abnormality) 
should if possible be followed up and documented.  The outcome of any conception occurring 
from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_560437] dose should be followed up and 
documented.

  8 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Patients with chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_54183] a continuum 
with less invasive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54184]. Established, non -surgical treatment options include, 
but are not limited to, oral medications, physical therapy, TENS, acupuncture, nerve blocks, 
radiofrequency ablation and other options based on clinical judgment. The surgical treatment options for these patients include surgery of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sympathectomy, intrathecal drug pumps, 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185] (SCS) systems
i. 
 An advantage of a SCS system is that it is a reversible and nondestructive treatment option. The 
main principle of SCS therapy is pain suppression via the delivery of electrical signals to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_54186]. An implantable pulse generator 
(IPG) is implanted under the skin, typi[INVESTIGATOR_54187], to generate mild electrical signals. The electrical signals typi[INVESTIGATOR_54188]. The IPG is programmed to deliver the electrical signals in a therape utic manner and 
is then activated by [CONTACT_54214]. SCS therapy treatment is deemed successful if there is a 50% reduction in pain as measured by a numeric rating 
scale or visual analog scale. The most common u se of SCS therapy is for failed back surgery 
syndrome (FBSS) that affects up to 40% of patients who undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_54189] v. 
 A candidate for SCS therapy is first tested by [CONTACT_54215] a trial procedure in which a temporary 
lead is implanted in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_54190] (EPG). A temporary trial typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] [ADDRESS_57944] increased safety, 
efficacy and longevity of the therapy. 
 
The Algovita® SCS System is similar in design and performance to newer SCS systems from other medical device companies. The FDA approved Algovita® system has many advanced features 
including the ability to better control the shape of the elect rical pulse. One such feature is a longer 
pulse width range than the other systems on the market. Pulse width determines how long an electrical pulse is activated. A longer pulse width is not associated with any safety concerns as 
determined by [CONTACT_1622]. The intent and justification for this study is to understand if a longer pulse 
width provides better outcomes to patients.  
 Although the effects of pulse width are mentioned in many SCS investigations, it has been the 
primary focus of very few studies. Several decades ago, research was conducted into the technical 
aspects of SCS, including PW. In a study of SCS, Jobling showed that different patients required 
widely varying amplitudes of stimulation and concluded that [ADDRESS_57945] been anecdotally 
described as achieving better pain -paresthesia overlap and comfort for the patient, thus potentially 
more effective at relieving painviii.  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL

The introduction and widespread adoption of rechargeable IPGs for SCS has diminished the 
importance of energy efficient programming to prolong time between revision surgeries and resulted in longer pulse width settings in these systems. Gould and Bradley reported in a 
retrospective analysis of patient -preferred programs that over 50% of the programs used PWs in 
excess of 450 μs
ix. Yearwood et al. showed that 10/19 patients had greater coverage, and 8/19 
patients displayed “caudal shift” of paresthesia coverage with increased PWx. A mathematical 
model of electrical field and neural activation in SCS has shown good agreement with clinical data 
that a longer PW is associated with increased paresthesia coverage and a shift of the paresthesia 
coverage caudallyxi. 
 
Investigation into the clinical and technical effects of PWs may be important in the continued effort 
to more fully understand the mechanisms of SCS. In other neurostimulation applications, varied 
PW has been shown to provide large and small fiber neural selectivity, where shorter PWs 
maximized the difference between large and small fiber thresholdsxii. With advances in SCS 
technology, particularly rechargeable IPGs, patients are now being offered a wider range of parameters to treat their pain. In particular, P W programming ranges of the Algovita® system can 
be programmed up to 1500 μsec).

10.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
At each evaluation, the investigator will determine whether any adverse events 
(AE’s) have occurred.  For the purpose of this protocol, an adverse event  is any 
undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject that can be attributed to the device or incision closure procedure.  In this study, patients should be encouraged to report AE’s spontaneously or in response to general, non -directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been 
since the last visit?”).  Any time during the study, the patient may volunteer information that resembles an AE.  If it is determined that an AE has occurred, the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete the AE Form of the CRF.  
 
The following categories of  adverse event severity are to be used:  
Mild  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
patient's usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and 
with no sequelae  
Moderate  Interferes with the patient's usual activity  
Severe  Any fatal or immediately life -threatening clinical experience that 
requires a subject to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54193].  This includes events that cause 
fetal distress, fetal death, congenital abnormality or malignancy or 
any permanently disabling event.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles 
to provide guid ance to physicians and other participants in medical research involving human subjects. Medical 
research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.  
2. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguar d the health of the people. The physician's knowledge and 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my patient will be my first co nsideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A 
physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of 
weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient."  
4. Medical  progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving human 
subjects.  
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human subject should take 
precedence over the interests of  science and society.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven 
prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedu res 
involve risks and burdens.  
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and protect their health 
and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need special protection. The particular needs of the 
economically and medically dis advantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those who 
cannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for 
those who will not benefit personally from the research and for t hose for whom the research is combined with 
care.  
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for research on human 
subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements. No national ethical, legal or 
regulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set 
forth in this Declaration.  
2. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  [ADDRESS_57973], the confidentiality of the patient's information and to minimize the 
impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequa tely informed of the aims, methods, 
sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated 
benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be info rmed of the 
right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's 
freely -given inf ormed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non -written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
DRAFT   CONFIDENTIAL  
  [ADDRESS_57974] obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally 
authorized representative.  
17. Research o n individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, 
should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary 
characteristic of the research population. The sp ecific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition 
that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration 
and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that consent t o remain in the research should 
be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
18. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the investigators 
are obliged to preserv e the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results should be published or 
otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest 
should be declared in the publication. Reports of  experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down 
in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
3. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
1. The physician may combine medical research with medical care , only to the extent that the research is justified 
by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical research is combined with medical 
care, additional standards apply to protect the patients who are research subjects.  
2. The benef its, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current 
prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in 
studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
3. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of access to the best proven 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by [CONTACT_1758].  
4. The physician should fu lly inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal 
of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the patient -physician relationship.  
5. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnos tic and therapeutic methods do not exist or have 
been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, must be free to use unproven or new 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -
establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be made the object of 
research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, 
where appropriate, p ublished. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

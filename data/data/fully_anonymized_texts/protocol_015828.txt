Project Title: BurntOut: Role-Play Simulation for Building Medical Student Resiliency
Institution: CLINICAL TOOLS, INC.
Grant Number: 5R44AA026474-03
Principal Investigator: [CONTACT_62876], Bradley
NCT [ADDRESS_779338] apply attitudes and actions that ameliorate the 
stresses identified, investigate external wellness resources if copi[INVESTIGATOR_591231], and anonymously  
communicate the challenges to the institution in order to foster institutional change.  
Physician burnout has downstream negative effects on patient care. Additionally, burnout and resiliency  
(the ability to recover quickly from stress and difficulties) are best addressed early in medical training 
so physicians can recognize poor copi[INVESTIGATOR_591232]. Specific health behavior topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as use of alcohol, are related to burnout; thus, addressing  
burnout decreases the risk of alcohol use in professionals. 
The specific aim of [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] is to assess impact of the intervention on burnout and related 
indices using standardized measures adapted to be relevant to the intervention and target audience.
Methodology
During Phase II of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project, individuals in 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] will use the simulation and complete online assessments. 
Subjects will be asked to use the simulation and fill out online surveys/instruments using personal 
computers with Internet connection. 
Demographic information will be obtained (sex, race, age, education). 
Use of the online simulation will involve engaging with scenarios presented in 3D imagery of typi[INVESTIGATOR_591233], making choices on how to respond to the challenges, 
experiencing a storyline typi[INVESTIGATOR_591234], and reviewing feedback on the choice made. They  
will also be presented lessons on developi[INVESTIGATOR_591235]. 
Summative Study Description: We will use a pre-/post-intervention parallel design with controls who 
also will have the opportunity to use the intervention if they choose to do so. We will recruit and enroll 
up to 80 medical students who are in US medical schools (DO and MD) for the two arms. The number 
of participants selected is based on a power analysis of our design and our experience of low dropout 
rate with this target audience; to reach a medium effect size we are aiming for a final sample size of 60 
medical students. 
Participants will 1) Complete the simulation experience: a simulation/story, educational case studies, 
and didactic material (taking around 2 hours over a period of around 2 weeks); and 2) Complete 
pre-/post- assessments (each taking around 1 hour) plus a follow-up survey after 2-4 weeks, and will be  
compensated for the assessments. 
The primary clinical endpoint will be burnout as measured by [CONTACT_591236], tailored to medical students and the content in the intervention, so that results are relevant to 
this specific study.
Secondary endpoints will be measured via the following assessments, all of which will be 
adapted/edited to be targeted to this group of users.
•Medical Student Quality of Life, 
•Patient Health Questionaire 2/Patient Health Questionaire 9 aka PHQ2 and PHQ9, which are 
depression screening questions, 
•Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, 
•Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test  aka AUDIT-C/AUDIT for alcohol use disorder and 
•NIDA Quick Screen -two drug question screening for drug use, 
Completion of online instruments will involve answering questions on their personal computers. For 
example, the assessments ask participants to self-rate their level of burnout symptoms, perception of 
the quality of their life, their level of resiliency, screening for alcohol and other substance use 
problems, screening for depression. Participation will take up to 4 hours (for use of the simulation plus 
assessments) over a 4-6 week period depending on the student’s pace through the scenarios and 
participation in the optional activities. 
Statistical Analysis
Study Population
Number, age, gender, ethnicity, and whether healthy volunteers. If patients, specify the disease or 
condition and indicate how potential subjects will be identified.
Students must be currently enrolled in a US based medical school. Women and minorities will be 
recruited according to their percentages in the medical student/faculty population.
Phase II Study Component Subjects Time
Evaluate Intervention with the Target Audience Up to 80 ≈ 4.[ADDRESS_779339] appropriate representation of both women and 
minorities. Women will comprise 50% of the sample. In 2017-2018 50.7% of medical school 
matriculates were female1. The Association of American Medical Colleges provides the following 
information for matriculation in medical school in 2017 of the 21,326 matriculants.
Race/Ethnicity % of matriculation (2017)*
American Indian or Alaskan Native 0.7
Asian 23.3
Race/Ethnicity % of matriculation (2017)*
Black or African-American 7.4
Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish Origin 9.9
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 0.1
White 50.4
Other 0.8
Multiple Race / Ethnicity 1.8
Unknown Race / Ethnicity 3.6
Non-US Citizen and Non-Permanent Resident 1.3
*Numbers total = ~ 100%
We will stratify our sample to match the US distribution of the current medical school population by 
[CONTACT_547], and by [CONTACT_55494].
Children
Children are defined by [CONTACT_591237] 18. The intervention is targeted for medical 
students and thus is only of use to adults aged 18 and over. According to the Association of American 
Medical Colleges (AAMC),2010-2016 https://www.aamc.org/download/321468/data/factstablea6.pdf), 
the minimum age of entering medical students was 20 (women) and 21 (men). Therefore, the target 
audience will be over the age of 21 and will not include children.
Recruitment Information
Recruitment
All participant medical students will be recruited via advertisements sent via e-mail listservs, and by 
[CONTACT_591238]. 
Consent Process
Subjects will be e-mailed all study materials (informed consent forms if need, explanatory materials 
otherwise) before the scheduled test or will be invited via email to fill out secure online forms on our 
website. The forms will include information about the purpose of the study as well as risks in 
participating and possible benefits. The forms will include information about the purpose of the study 
as well as risks in participating and possible benefits. The forms will include the contact [CONTACT_591239] [INVESTIGATOR_72616]. 
We will email or conduct a short phone or internet-based chat session with subjects in order to answer 
any questions, and confirm informed consent signatures have been witnessed prior to beginning 
participation in the study. Electronic signatures will be allowed where possible under [ADDRESS_779340]-protected file. Any results published from 
this research will not include any personal identifying information. We will assure the subjects that they  
can stop the interview or experience at any time.
Response to individual assessments that indicate a potential problem for a specific participant:  Drs. 
Tanner or Rossie will review all subjects’ assessment responses and directly contact [CONTACT_591240] (the PHQ9 depression assessment, substance use assessments – AUDIT and 
drug questions, Maslach Burnout Inventory, CD-RISK-2, Medical Student Quality of Life) are at a 
level that these instrument scoring indicates is of concern and in need of follow-up in total or for a 
significant question. Students will receive messages recommending the follow-up appropriate for their 
results, including education and relevant resources, recommendations for further evaluation or 
treatment, and encouragement. We will also provide local resource information, and offer to work with 
the subject to help assure that they receive appropriate care. HIPPA does not apply as this is a benign 
behavioral intervention and not intended to be a medical treatment delivered in a medical setting 
provided by a health care professional working as a health care professional. 
Benefits to subjects and/or society
The personal benefits include increased awareness of the risks of physician burn out and strategies to 
compensate for that for both students and faculty. The information is designed to provide an 
educational supplement to their medical school education. It is possible that students will enjoy using 
the prototype simulation. These benefits will easily outweigh the risks identified above.

Exclusion criteria:  
1. Diagnosis with a coagulation disorder other than Haemophilia  A 
2. Severe liver or kidney disease (alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate 
transaminase (AST) levels >5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine >120 
µmol/L)  
3. Concomitant treatment with any systemic immunosuppressive  drug 
4. Participation in another interventional clinical study currently or during the past [ADDRESS_368039], Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
Human -cl rhFVIII is a purified B -domain deleted FVIII glycoprotein that is synthesised  by 
a genetically  engineered human embryonic  kidney cell line (HEK  293F). Human -cl rhFVIII 
will be provided in single  use vials  containing  a nominal  potency of 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 
International Units (IU) each of freeze -dried recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) concentrate to be 
reconstituted in 2.5 mL of water for injection. Full vials are to be injected, preferably -  
except for recovery investigations.  
Human -cl rhFVIII should be used for intravenous injection only (maximally 4 mL/minute).  
Dose:  
Prophylactic treatment is recommended, but finally, it is the decision of the responsible 
treating physician whether patients will be treated prophylactically or on -demand. Patients 
may switch f rom on- demand to prophylactic treatment, or from prophylactic to  on-demand 
treatment during the course of the  study. 
Prophylactic treatment:  
Patients will be treated prophylactically with a recommended dose of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg 
body weight (BW).  
Starting prophylaxis with the first bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (BE) is highly recommended.  
The frequency of treatment will depend on the patient’s clinical situation. For example, 
prophylaxis may be initiated with every other day injections (in order to keep the FVI II 
trough level >1%), or with once weekly injections, followed by [CONTACT_301267], and every other day treatment. In cases of inadequate response, Human -cl rhFVIII 
administration  frequency or dose adjustments can be considered at Investigator’s  discretion. 
On-demand treatment:  
In case of any bleed, the patients can be treated on -demand. The dosage and duration of 
treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeds depend on the location and the extent of 
bleeding as well as on the clinical situation o f the patient. Dosage recommendations are 
given as follows:  
• Minor  haemorrhage:  20-30 IU FVIII/kg  BW to achieve  an intended target  peak  level 
of about 40% to 60%. Repeat dose every 8- 24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Moderate to major haemorrhage: 30- 40 IU FVI II/kg BW to achieve an intended 
target peak  level  of about  60% to 80%. Repeat  dose every  6-24 hours  until BE is 
resolved.

Coagulation FVIII  Date of Final Protocol:  
01-Feb-2018  
• Major to life -threatening haemorrhage: initial dose of 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW to 
achieve an intended target peak level of 100% to 120%. Repeat dose of 20- 50 IU 
FVIII/kg BW every 6 -12 hours until BE is  resolved.  
Surgical prophylaxis : 
The dosage and duration of treatment with Human- cl rhFVIII will depend on the type of 
surgery and the patient’s individual incremental recovery. Dosage recommendations are 
given as follows:  
• Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25 -30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 
3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat 
one dose every  12-24 hours  if needed.  Trough levels  should be maintained  at ≥ 30%.  
• Major surgeries: 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve 
an intended target peak  level  of approximately  100%. Repeat  if necessary  after 6-[ADDRESS_368041] 6 to 14 days until healing is complete and recurrence 
to regular prophylactic treatment is possible. Trough levels should be maintained at 
> 50%.  
Recovery investigation (optional) : 
Patients  will receive  40 IU FVIII/kg  BW for in vivo recovery  evaluation. Blood samples are 
taken at baseline, 15 minutes and 1 hour after the IMP  administration.  
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) (if applicable):  
Patients who develop a clinically significant and non- transient inhibitor will be offered to 
start ITI with the Investigational Med ical Product (IMP).  
The modified Bonn Protocol for inhibitor elimination is recommended:  
• Low responders (<5 Bethesda Units [BU]) should receive 50 -100 IU FVIII/kg BW 
daily  or every  second  day. In case the inhibitor  increases  to 5 BU or more,  the patient 
should switch to the high responder regimen.  
• High responders ( ≥5 BU) should receive 100 -150 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12 hours. 
Once the inhibitor is eliminated (<0.6 BU), the FVIII recovery is ≥ 66% of normal, and the 
half-life of FVIII is at least 6 hours, a continuous reduction of about 10% of the initial ITI 
dosage  shou ld be initiated,  until the patient  has reached  a prophylactic  treatment regimen  of 
30-50 IU FVIII/kg BW every other  day. 
Any other ITI approach is possible.  
All treatment details, including the needs of by[CONTACT_71363], and the further development 
of the inhibitor titre need to be documented.  
Batch Number(s):  
Several batches of Human -cl rhFVIII will be used.  
Duration of Treatment:  
The patients  should stay in the study for 100 exposure  days (EDs)  and for a maximum period 
of 5 years from  screening.  
In patients who develop FVIII inhibitors  and start ITI treatment,  the maximum length of ITI 
will be 36  months.

Immunogenicity:  
Inhibitor activity will be determined by [CONTACT_301268] (Nijmegen 
modification), using congenital FVIII -deficient human plasma spi[INVESTIGATOR_301230]- cl 
rhFVIII at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every  10-12 EDs or every  3 months  ± 2 weeks,  (whichever  comes  first)  from  ED 20 
to ED  100 
• At study completion  
• Any time in the case of a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_301231].  
In case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor re -testing using a second separ ately drawn 
sample should be performed.  
 
Secondary endpoints  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment: The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the prophylactic 
treatment will be assessed based on the frequency of spontaneous break -through bleeds 
under  prophylactic  treatment.  The dates and times  of study drug infusions,  details of dose(s) 
and product  batch  numbers  used for the prophylactic  treatment will be documented. Details 
of any BEs occurring under prophylactic treatment will be documented. Study drug 
consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total will be 
evaluated.  
Efficacy  of treatment  of bleeds:  The efficacy  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in the treatment of bleeds 
will be assessed  based  on an objective  haemostatic  efficacy  scale.  Details  of the bleed  (type, 
site and severity of the bleed, and the start and end date and time of the bleed), the amount 
of Human -cl rhFVIII needed and the number of injections necessary to stop the bleed will 
be documented.  
Efficacy  of surgical  prophylaxis : The efficacy  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in surgical  prophylaxis 
will be assessed based  on: 
• Overall efficacy assessment (taking the intra - and post -operative assessment into 
account)  after the end of the surgical  prophylactic  treatment phase,  done  together  by 
[CONTACT_301269].  
• Average and maximum expected estimated blood loss com pared to the actual 
estimated blood loss. 
In addition, the location, severity, and type of surgery will be documented. Expected and 
actual duration of surgical procedure and details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl 
rhFVIII (pre-, intra - and/or post -operatively) will be recorded. FVIII plasma levels (pre -,

products (except standard anaesthesia) along with a brief narrative describing the outco me 
of the intervention will be recorded.  
Safety:  
Vital signs : Blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_301232], [ADDRESS_368045] -treatment control is obligatory.  
Safety laboratory parameters: The following routine safety laboratory parameters will be 
tested at screening, and at 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) control visits: haematological parameters 
(red blood cell count, white  blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit,  platelet  count)  and 
clinical che mistry (ALT, AST, serum creatinine). Samples are analysed in the local 
laboratory.  
Tolerability: The occurrence of any adverse event (AE) will be monitored throughout the 
study.  
 
Additional analyses  
Recovery investigation (optional): A recovery investigati on is recommended to be 
performed. This can be done with the first Human -cl rhFVIII administration, or within the 
first three  months  after treatment  start with Human -cl rhFVIII , in any case in a non-bleeding 
patient.  A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg  BW will be administered  and the in vivo recovery will be 
calculated from the FVIII levels before infusion and the peak level obtained from the [ADDRESS_368046] -infusion samples. Recovery investigations are recommended to be 
repeated approximately every 6 months . 
FVIII gene mutation analysis (mandatory) . 
Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (optional): HLA -typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immune response gene profiling and FVIII 
ethnic haplotype. Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_301233] / predict development of FVIII inhibitors. Blood samples 
(EDTA) required for this analysis can be obtained at any time during the study.  
RNA  expression  analysis  (optional):  RNA  expression  analysis  will optionally be performed 
in order to provide an understanding of the transcript activity of the genes involved in 
immune responses that may be responsible for FVIII inhibitor formation in patients 
receiving exogenou s FVIII. RNA expression analysis will also be optionally performed on 
patients undergoing ITI to provide information on the transcript activity of genes involved 
in immune  tolerance.  The analysis will be carried  out using a customised  PAXgene  protocol 
in which RNA samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_301270].  
In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products (optional): Immunogenicity of Human -cl 
rhFVIII will optionally be assessed by [CONTACT_301271] (PBMC) 
(including a positive  control)  with Human -cl rhFVIII . The nature  of T cell response  will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_301272] (measured in a multiplex format) and T cell 
proliferation.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Haemophilia A is an inherited gender -related coagulation disorder in which affected males do 
not produce functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in sufficient quantities to achieve 
satisfactory haemostasis. Therefore, patients suffer from b leeding diathesis. Most bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (BEs) occur in joints and muscles. Without adequate treatment these repeated haemarthroses  and haematoma lead to long- term sequelae with severe disability. Other  bleeding 
sites, although less frequent but more severe, are the central nervous system, the urinary or 
gastrointestinal tract,  eyes and the retro -peritoneum.  Hence,  affected  patients  are at high risk to 
develop major  and life-threatening bleeds after surgi cal procedures, even  after minor  ones such 
as tooth extraction.  
The optimal effective treatment of the disorder is the replacement of FVIII by [CONTACT_301273]. However, the occurrence of inhibitory antibodies against the infused FVIII 
is a major clinical complication in the treatment of Haemophilia A. It is not known whether recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products carry an enhanced immunogenic risk and whether  there 
are differences between rFVIII products in their relative immunogenicity  (1). 
All commercially available recombinant rFVIII concentrates are exclusively produced in 
hamster cells, either in baby [CONTACT_301274] (BHK) cells (e.g. Kogenate FS) or in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (e.g. Advate, ReFacto). The intrinsic immunogenicity of current rFVIII products may be increased due to incorporation of non -human glycan structures during 
post-translational protein processing in mammalian cell lines.  
Human -cl rhFVIII is a B -domain deleted rhFVIII expressed in genetically modified human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. Using a human cell line for the expression of rFVIII ensures that non- human immunogenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_301239], in contrast to rFVIII expressed in 
hamster cells. For example, N -glycolylneuraminic acid, which is reported to be antigenic in 
man (2) and present  in recombinant  glycoproteins  expressed  by [CONTACT_301275] (3), was not detected 
in Human -cl rhFVIII. Furthermore, the antigenic carbohydrate epi[INVESTIGATOR_301240]α1,3Gal, which has 
been reported to be present in recombinant proteins such as full -length FVIII from BHK cells 
(4), is not present in Human -cl rhFVIII either. The use of a human cell -line for the expres sion 
of rFVIII is expected to provide a more genuine human glycosylation pattern than achieved with murine cell -lines. This may result in an improved function and reduced immunogenicity 
of the rFVIII expressed from human cell-lines.  
Clinical data on effica cy and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII in the targeted indications in 
previously treated patients (PTPs) are available. Since paediatric patients may respond differently to FVIII treatments than adults, European Medicines Agency (EMA) CHMP guidelines (5) specif y that paediatric studies should be conducted within the clinical 
investigation program  of FVIII  products. Moreover,  the clinical  development  strategy  for FVIII 
products in paediatric patients should follow a stepwise approach, in order to gain experience in older patients before investigations are initiated in younger patients. Study GENA -03 was 
assessing efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII 
in paediatric  patients  between  2 and 12 years.  With  the availability  of 6 months’  treatment  data 
from more than 20 previously treated children, and with having finished all baseline pharmacokinetic assessments, the present study has been designed to investigate the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII , in previously untreated patients 
(PUPs) with inherited severe Haemophilia  A.

A summary of findings from non -clinical as well as clinical investigations can be found in the 
Clinical Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.[ADDRESS_368067] important 
complication  in haemophilia  treatment.  Inhibitors  occur  in up to about  30% of PUPs  with severe 
haemophilia, usually within the first 50 exposure days (EDs) to a FVIII concentrate. As specified in the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma -Derived  Factor  VIII Products  (CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009)  (5), clinical  trials  in PUPs 
are required depending on the type of factor  VIII product  (e.g. novel  modified  proteins  to extend 
half-life).  
This clinical study is designed in compliance with the requirements set up in the CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) (5). At the time when this study in children is  planned 
to be started (in the course of the 4
th quarter 2012), pharmacokinetic, efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity data from further studies with Human -cl rhFVIII in PTPs will be available 
(including a children study, as required by [CONTACT_301276]).  
The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII, to assess the 
efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII during prophylactic treatment, in the treatment of bleeds, and in 
surgical  prophylaxis, and to assess the safety  and tolerability  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in PUPs  with 
severe Haemophilia A (FVIII coagulation activity [FVIII:C] <1%) over [ADDRESS_368068]  on-demand therapy. Also,  data can be 
collected on resources (e.g. drug cost, monitoring cost) related to ITI for patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a clinically  significant  and non-transient  inhibitor. As is known from  literature  ITI therapy is very 
expensive and cost may substantially vary depending on inhibitor status and choice of ITI strategy, further details on ITI therapy and its related cost are of considerable interest. This study can generate insight into resource use of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_301241].  
1.2 Dose  Rationale  
 
Human -cl rhFVIII will be provided in single use vials containing a nominal potency of 250, 
500, 1000 or 2000 International Units (IU) each of freeze -dried rFVIII concentrate to be 
reconstituted in 2.5 mL of water for injection (WFI). Full vials are to be injected, preferably - 
except for recovery investigations. Hum an-cl rhFVIII should be used for intravenous injection 
only (maximum infusion speed: 4 mL/minute).  
The dose and frequency of treatment of Haemophilia A depend on the individual patients’ needs. As the current study will be conducted in PUPs, who will most likely be infants or  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_368069] 
prophylactic  dosing specifications are made,  except  that the starting  dose should be 20-50 IU/kg 
BW. It is the Investigators’ clinical judgement that will guide dose and frequency adjustments 
based on individual patients’  needs.  
1.3 Benefit -Risk  Statement 
 
On the basis of data available for adult and children (PTPs), the half -life and the recovery of 
Human -cl rhFVIII  are similar  to other  already  licensed  rFVIII  preparations.  It can be concluded 
that Human -cl rhFVIII is efficacious in the prevention and in the treatment of BEs and during 
surgical prophylaxis in patients with inherited FVIII deficiency.  
Comparable to other rFVIII preparations, the following adverse drug reactions (ADR) may 
occur by [CONTACT_301277] -cl rhFVII I: 
1. Allergic or anaphylactic types of reactions. Observed symptoms may include fever, 
chills, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and – 
very rarely –  anaphylactic  shock.  
2. Development of antibodies (inhibitors) agains t FVIII.  
In conclusion, the hitherto existing clinical and pre -clinical data allow the conclusion that 
participating  in this study  does not represent  any additional  risk to the included patients  in terms 
of immunogenicity and safety.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Study  Endpoints  
 
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint -  Immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII 
Immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII is the primary endpoint. Inhibitor activity will be 
determined by [CONTACT_301268] (Nijmegen modification), using congenital FVIII - 
deficient human plasma, spi[INVESTIGATOR_301230] -cl rhFVIII, at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every 10- 12 EDs or every 3 months ±  2 weeks (whichever comes first) after ED 20 
until 100 EDs are  reached  
• Any time in the case of  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_301242] a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor retesting, using a second separately drawn 
sample, should be performed. A FVIII inhibitor is defined as “positive”, if the retesting confirms the positive result, otherwise the result is considered as be ing “negative”.  
3.1.2 Secondary  Endpoint(s)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  
 
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the prophylactic treatment will be investigated by 
[CONTACT_301278] -through bleeds under prophylactic trea tment 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total will be evaluated. The dates and times of study drug infusions, the details of dose(s), and the product batch numbers used for the prophylac tic treatment will be 
documented. 
Efficacy of treatment of bleeds  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the treatment of bleeds will be investigated by [CONTACT_2329] a 4 - 
point ordinal haemostatic efficacy scale (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Details of the bleed, the amou nt 
of Human -cl rhFVIII needed and the number of injections necessary to stop the bleed will be 
documented. 
Efficacy of surgical prophylaxis  
In surgical procedures, the following parameters will be documented:  
• Overall efficacy assessment (taking into account the intra-  and post -operative assessment) 
after the end of surgical  prophylactic  treatment phase,  done  together  by [CONTACT_301279] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  
• Average and maximum expected estimated blood loss, compared to the actual estimated 
blood loss  
• Details on surgical procedure (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]): location, severity, type, expected and actual  duration 
• Pre-, intra -, and post -operative FVIII plasma levels, if  appropriate  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
14  
  
• Details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl rhFVIII given pr e-, intra - and/or post - 
operatively including dates, times and batch numbers  
• Details on concomitantly administered drugs, including all blood and blood product 
transfusions, excluding standard anaesthetic  drugs  
• Details on all wound haematomas in terms of c apturing, analysing, and reporting these, 
including any need for surgical  evacuation  
• Outcome of the intervention, described by [CONTACT_3553] a brief  narrative.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  
 
Safety and tolerability  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_49126], standard laboratory 
parameters (red blood cells, white bleed cells, haemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, ALT, AST, 
creatinine), and by [CONTACT_12902] (AEs). 
 
3.1.3 Further Endpoint – R esource Use 
Following a review of economic literature in haemophilia the most relevant parameters (in 
terms of volume and cost) were selected for inclusion in the current study. The resource use parameters that will be collected
* and analysed are:  
• FVIII concentrates  
Prophylaxis  use or on-demand use, dose per kg body weight, the frequency of injection, 
duration of treatment, any change in treatment regimen, start date and stop  date.  
• Bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: location, severity and  duration. 
• Inhibitor status, any change in FVIII use, use of other haemostatic agents, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (including ward type) and its  duration.  
• ITI: ITI regimen details (regimen type, FVIII use, dose per kg body weight, the 
frequency of injection, start and stop date, other haemostatic agents, patients’ inhibitor 
levels.  
• CVAD: CVAD type, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (including ward type) and duration, surgical  
procedures, complications due to CVAD use and management of the  complication.  
• Surgery prophylaxis: dosage and duration of treatment with FVIII for surgery 
prophylaxis including details on the type of  surgery. 
* The majority of the aforementioned resource parameters are collected as part of 
primary and secondary end points within the study. The same data will also be used to 
analyse resource use.  
• Non-medical resource use: The indirect costs brought about as a result of health care 
resource use should also be considered. Such costs include productivity losses of the parents (caregiver) and their opportunity costs arising through foregone time related to the child’s  disease.  
The related resource use data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_301280] (employment, household tasks and ‘care’ time) in the patient diary.

3.2 Overall Study Design and  Plan  
 
This study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, multinational, open -label, non- controlled 
phase III study in 100 male PUPs (i.e. patients without any previous treatment with FVIII 
concentrates or other blood products containing FVIII) who are suffering from severe 
Haemophilia  A (FVIII:C  < 1%).  Around 40 centres worldwide  are planned  to participate  in this 
study.  
For each patient, the exposure to Human -cl rhFVIII, the efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the 
prevention and the treatment of bleeds, the frequency of break- through bleeds in case of 
prophylactic treatment, the efficacy in surgical prophylaxis, and the overall safety and tolerability of Human -cl rhFVIII will be thoroughly assessed. In the co urse of the follow -up 
visits (i.e. every 3- 4 EDs until ED 20, then every 10- 12 EDs until ED 100), scheduled to be 
performed after the Screening Visit, FVIII inhibitor levels will be assessed for each patient. If 
appropriate, these visits may be combined wi th the additional regular 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) 
follow -up visits, stipulating some supplementary investigations are performed.  
The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication will be checked and 
documented at each follow -up visit. A patient com pletes the study by [CONTACT_106461] [ADDRESS_368070] anned to start in the 4
th quarter of 2012 and continues until the 4th quarter of 
2018, except for those patients continuing Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy.

3.3 Discussion of Study  Design  
 
3.3.1 Study  Design  
The design of this study complies with the applicable European CHMP Guideline 
CHMP/BPWG/144533/2009 (5).  
Accordingly, a PUP study needs to be conducted for all novel factor VIII products, such as novel genetic constructs or modifications of the factor VIII  molecule, after availability of 
relevant PTP data, including data in pre -treated children.  
Corresponding studies have been initiated by [CONTACT_301281] 2009. With the presence 
of 6 months’ treatment data from more than 20 children PTPs, and with ha ving finished all 
baseline pharmacokinetic assessments, a clinical study in PUPs will now be initiated.  
Human -cl rhFVIII  is intended as replacement  therapy in patients  with Haemophilia  A. Efficacy 
of treatment in this indication can be clearly distinguishe d from inactive  therapy.  
3.3.2 Control  Group(s)  
Not applicable.  
3.3.3 Target Parameters  
The following measurements and assessments are requested to be carried out, grouped by [CONTACT_301282]:

4 STUDY  POPULATION  
4.1 Population Base  
 
Male patients (mainly new -borns or infants, although no age limitation is given) with severe 
Haemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%), without any previous FVIII concentrate treatment o r any 
previous treatment with other FVIII- containing blood products will be enrolled into the study.  
In total, [ADDRESS_368074] be fulfilled before study 
entry:  
1. Male patients  
2. Severe Haemophilia A (FVIII:C <  1%) 
3. No previous  treatment with FVIII concentrates or other  blood products  containing  FVIII 
4. Voluntarily given, fully informed written and signed consent given before any study-  
related procedures are conducted (obtained from the patient’s parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s))  
4.1.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Patients will not be included if any of the following exclusion criteria are met:  
1. Diagnosis of a coagulation disorder other than Haemophilia  A 
2. Severe liver or kidney disease (ALT or AST levels >5 times of upper limit of  normal  
(ULN), creatinine >120 μmol/L)  
3. Concomitant treatment with any systemic immunosuppressive  drug 
4. Participation in another interventional clinical study currently or during the past 
[ADDRESS_368075] be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
Vaccinations are permitted prior and during the study, and immunisat ions should be given as 
recommended by [CONTACT_301283]. However – once treatment with IMP has started –  
vaccinations are recommended to be done after the 20
th ED. Additionally, a subcutaneous 
administration on a day without FVIII administration is re commended.  
Patients  may only receive anti-fibrinolytics  if this is medically  indicated  / standard  of care,  e.g. 
in the course of tooth extractions or other  surgeries.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_368076] be administered (except for 
emergency situations).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_368077] within the study participation period 
will be assessed  as treatment failure s in the efficacy  analyses.  However,  there  are exceptions  to 
this rule. Patients will hence not be considered treatment failures in the efficacy analyses,  if: 
• the use of another FVIII concentrate was due to an emergency case (example: accident 
requiring tr eatment with FVIII without patient or intensive care unit [ICU] personnel) 
having access to Investigational Medicinal Product [IMP])  
• the IMP was not available for the patient  in time (example:  patient  experiences a severe 
bleed but does not have enough product available). 
The reason for a patient switching to another FVIII product should be clearly documented in 
the CRF (and patient diary, if appropriate).  
Patients may not receive immuno -modulating drugs (other than anti -retroviral chemotherapy), 
such as alpha- interferon, prednisone (equivalent to >10 mg/day), or similar drugs.  
For patients  who developed an inhibitor  and undergo an immune  tolerance  induction it is highly 
recommended not to be vaccinated during the  ITI. 
4.[ADDRESS_368078] be  avoided.  
The Investigator will obtain all the required withdrawal details and document the reason(s) for discontinuation in the CRF. Should the reason for removal of a subject be an AE, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorde d in the CRF, and the Investigator will make 
thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome. 
In case of a positive FVIII inhibitor but no ITI initiation, the subject has to be withdrawn from 
the study.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_368079](S)  
5.[ADDRESS_368080](s)  
 
Human -cl rhFVIII is a B -domain deleted, human cell -line derived recombinant FVIII 
concentrate for intravenous use and will be provided in single use vials containing a nominal 
potency  of 250, 500, [ADDRESS_368081] to treatment information. Thus, the IMP will be packed and labelled according  to local  regulations, together  with a pre-filled  syringe  containing 2.5 mL WFI (which 
will be transferred  to the product  vial),  1 disposable  syringe  (10 mL),  [ADDRESS_368082] has to be stored at 2 -8°C protected from light. The product must not be froz en. 
The Investigators must ensure that the investigational product is stored under appropriate conditions with restricted access. The Investigators will inform the patients’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of necessary storage conditions once the patients star t home treatment.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing  Schedule  
 
Prophylactic  treatment  is recommended,  but finally,  it is the decision of the responsible  treating 
physician whether patients will be treated prophylactically or on -demand. Patients may switch 
from  on-demand  to prophylactic  treatment,  or from  prophylactic  to on-demand  treatment during 
the course of the  study.  
Prophylactic  Treatment  
1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5 % to 2 %.  
In case prophylactic treatment is chosen, the patients will be treated with a recommended dose of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg body weight (BW). 
Starting the prophylaxis with the first BE is highly recommended. 
The frequency  of treatment will mainly  depend  on the  patient’s  clinical  situation.  For example, 
prophylaxis  may be initiated  with every -other -day injections  (in order  to keep  the FVIII trough 
level  >1%)  or with once  weekly  injections,  followed  by [CONTACT_301284],  and every 
other day treatment. In cases of inadequate response, Human -cl rhFVIII administration 
frequency or dose adjustments can be considered at Investigator’s  discretion.

On-demand Treatment  
In case of bleeds, the patients can be treated on- demand. The dosage and duration of treatment 
of spontaneous  or traumatic  bleeds  depend on the location  and the extent  of bleeding as well as 
on the clinical situation of the patient. Dosage recommendations are given as  follows:  
• Minor haemorrhage (superficial muscle or soft tissue and oral bleeds): 20 -30 IU 
FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak level of about 40% to 60%. Repeat 
dose every 8 -24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Moderate to major haemorrhage (haemorrhage into muscles, into oral cavity; haemarthrosis, known trauma): 30- 40 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target 
peak level of about 60% to 80%. Repeat dose every 6- 24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Major to life -threatening haemorrhage (intracranial, intra -abdominal, gastro -intestinal 
or intrathoracic bleeds, central nervous system bleeds, bleeding in retropharyngeal 
spaces or iliopsoas sheath, eyes/retina, fractures or head trauma): initial dose of 40 -60 
IU FVIII/kg  BW to achieve  an intended  target peak  level  of 100%  to 120%.  Repeat  dose 
of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg BW every 6 -12 hours until BE is  resolved.  
Surgical Prophylaxis  
The dosage  and duration  of treatment  with Human -cl rhFVIII  will depend on the type of surgery 
and the patient’s individual incremental recovery. Dosage recommendations are given as follows:  
• Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25 -30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 3 
hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat one 
dose every 12- 24 hours if needed. Trough levels should be maintained at  ≥30%.  
• Major surgeries: 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an 
intended  target  peak  level  of approximately 100%. Repeat  if necessary  after 6-[ADDRESS_368083] 6 to 14 days until healing is complete and recurrence to regular 
prophylactic treatment is possible. Trough levels should be maintained at  >50%.  
Recovery Investigation (Optional)  
A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg BW (labelled potency) will be administered on the occasion of the 
recovery investigations. For the calculation  of recovery, the actual potency (measured using 
both chromogenic  (CHR)  and one-stage  (OS)  assays)  of Human -cl rhFVIII  will be used.  In vivo 
recovery will be calculated from the FVIII plasma level before infusion and the peak level obtained from the [ADDRESS_368084] Human- cl rhFVIII administration, or within the firs t three months after 
treatment start with Human -cl rhFVIII, in any case in a non- bleeding patient. They are 
recommended being controlled every 6 months  thereafter.  
Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) (if applicable)  
Patients who develop a clinically significant and non- transient FVIII inhibitor will be offered 
to start ITI with the IMP. Inhibitors that `disappear´ without any clinical signs or symptoms, where no FVIII dosing increase was required, and that turn to <0.6 BU within a period of 6 months after firs t detection are regarded as “transient”.  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05

The modified Bonn Protocol for inhibitor elimination is recommended:  
• Low responders  (<5 Bethesda Units  [BU])  should receive 50-100 IU FVIII/kg  BW daily 
or every second day. In case the inhibitor i ncreases to 5 BU or more, the patient should 
switch to the high responder  regimen.  
• High responders ( ≥5 BU) should receive 100- 150 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12 hours. 
Once the inhibitor is eliminated (<0.6 BU), the FVIII recovery is ≥ 66% of normal (defined as 
1 IU FVIII/kg BW raises the plasma FVIII activity by 1.5%), and the half- life of FVIII is at 
least 6 hours, a continuous reduction of about 10% of the initial ITI dosage should be  initiated, 
until the patient has reached a prophylactic treatment regimen of 30- 50 IU FVIII/kg BW every 
other  day. 
Any other ITI approach using Human- cl rhFVIII as the selected FVIII concentrate is possible. 
All treatment details and the further development of the inhibitor titre need to be documented.  
Patients who do not start ITI within one year after inhibitor detection are withdrawn from the 
study.  
5.[ADDRESS_368085]  not be used. Human- cl rhFVIII  should 
be injected intravenously by [CONTACT_238678] (maximally 4 mL/min ute) by [CONTACT_301285].  
5.[ADDRESS_368086]  dispensed to each patient.  The inventory will 
be available to the Study Monitor in order to verify drug account ability in the course of the 
study. Patients’ parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  will be advised  to return  any empty  vials  and unused 
investigational product on the occasion of the study visits.  
Any unused investigational product not dispensed, or returned by [CONTACT_8130], will be counted 
and returned  to the Sponsor. In certain  cases,  unused supplies  might  have  to be destroyed  at the 
study site. However, this is only applicable  after drug accountability has been  verified  and fully 
re-conciliated, and after written approval from the Sponsor has been obtained.  
The Investigator will ensure that such a disposition does not expose patients to risks linked to 
the investigational  product. The Investigator and the Sponsor  will maintain records  of any such 
alternate disposition to permit accurate drug  accountability.

5.7.2 Assessment of Treatment  Compliance  
Patients will usually undergo at -home treatment (treatment will likely be administered by 
[CONTACT_3654]/guardians due to the expected young age of the patients or by [CONTACT_301286]). At the first visit, the Investigator will provide them with a sufficient amount of trial 
medication (in cooling boxes, if appropriate) and a diary. The Investigator will advise the parents/guardians  on how to fill in the diary. The diary  will include  detailed  written  instructions 
for all assessments to be made. Furthermore, the efficacy rating criteria and the criteria for assessing  the severity  of a bleed  will be explained. The Investigator  will emphasise  the necessity 
of a careful documentation of all treatment detai ls. The recording of at -home injections will 
include the date and time, dose, batch number, and reason for injection (i.e. prophylaxis, BE treatment). IMP is provided with tear- off labels that must be placed in the  diary.  
In case of treatment of BEs, the p atient’s parents/guardians will document the site and  severity 
of the bleed, the start and end dates and time, and carry out an efficacy assessment according to the explanation provided in the  diary.  
Study product administrations that are overseen by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator (e.g. treatment in relation 
to the recovery investigations or in case of severe BEs treated at the study site), are to be documented in the patient’s journal (by [CONTACT_737]), as well as in the patient's diary (by [CONTACT_7903]/guardians).  
In addition, the patient’s parents/guardians will record any concomitant medications taken 
during the study period in their diaries. 
For each follow -up visit at the study site, the parents/guardians must bring all diaries to be 
reviewed and validated by [CONTACT_20226] e personnel.

• In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products  (optional)  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_301243]:  optional, available pre-treatment samples will be analysed  from study 
patients who later on developed an inhibitor to FVIII and started ITI. In addition, 
samples available from an inhibitor negative control group will be tested: already available plasma samples from ~[ADDRESS_368088] the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on how to document details of treatment with Human -cl rhFVIII, bleeds, AEs and concomitant 
medication. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will receive a sufficient amount of study product for home  treatment (in cooling boxes, if appropriate)  and will be instructed  on how to store  and 
administer it. 
Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_301244];  however, it can be performed  at 
any point during the study. It is suggested that the sampling coincides with regular study visits whenever  possible.  
6.1.2 Procedures During the Follow -Up Part of the  Study  
Follow -Up Visits (until ED 20):  
The patients will visit the study site every [ADDRESS_368089] been reached. At these 
visits,  blood samples will be obtained for FVIII  inhibitor screen  and optionally  RNA expression 
analysis (after a wash -out period of at least 2, preferably 3 days after the previous IMP 
administration). Samples are analysed in the central  laboratories.  
At these visits, the patient diary will be reviewed (any IMP injection, any bleed) in order to transfer data into the CRF. The occurrence of AEs and changes in weight and concomitant medication will be checked and documented.  
Follow -Up Visits (after ED 20 until ED 100): 
After ED 20 has been  reached,  patients  will visit the study site every  10-12 EDs.  At these visits, 
blood samples will be obtained for FVIII inhibitor screen (after a wash -out period of at least  2, 
preferably 3 days after the previous IMP  administration).  
At these visits, the patient diary will be reviewed (any IMP injection, an y bleed) in order to 
transfer data into the CRF.  The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant  medication  will 
be checked and documented. Samples are analysed in the central  laboratory.  
Follow -Up Visits (every 3 months ± 2 weeks):  
If appropriate, the above -described follow -up visits may be combined with regular 3- monthly 
follow -up visits  (± 2 weeks),  stipulating some  supplementary  investigations  are performed:  the 
safety  laboratory parameters will be assessed  (samples are analysed  locally)  and vital signs  will 
be measured pre - and – in case IMP was injected –  30-[ADDRESS_368090] -injection and the 
patient’s BW will be  measured.  
Once every [ADDRESS_368091] year, the blood sampling (inhibitor screen, safely laboratory) after 3 and 9 
months is optional. After 6 and 12 months a sample is  mandatory.  
Additional Health Economic Evaluation:  
Parents / Caregivers will be asked to fill out a sh ort questionnaire as part of the patient diary 
that asks about their time commitments, and productivity loss.  
These questions  should be answered  by [CONTACT_301287]  (if applicable)  on a quarterly  basis,  finally 
covering the entire study  period.  
• Do you currentl y hold a paid job? 
• Did your child’s Haemophilia A oblige you to be off work at any time in the past three 
months?  
• Did other people take over and perform your usual household tasks in the past three months in connection with your child’s Haemophilia A?  
• How much of the time you cared for your child in the past 3 months was specifically 
related to Haemophilia A? Consider time related to product administration, receiving 
education on home treatment, time related to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186], physicians visits  etc. 
ITI Patient Follow -Up: 
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_301245], once it can be ruled out that the inhibitor is transient / not requiring ITI. Inhibitors that `disappear´ without  any clinical  signs  or symptoms,  where  no FVIII dosing increase was required,  and that 
turn to <0.[ADDRESS_368092] detection are regarded as  “transient”.  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_301235]. Depending on the development of the inhibitor level: a bi -weekly (later on monthly to 3 -monthly) inhibitor titre 
testing  is considered  appropriate.  Optional  epi[INVESTIGATOR_301246] (pre -ITI start), as close as possible after the peak in hibitor level, and after inhibitor 
eradication. These patients’ epi[INVESTIGATOR_301247] / prior to the first exposure to FVIII will also be analysed. Optional RNA expression analysis can be performed alongside the inhibitor te sting at initiation of ITI, [ADDRESS_368093]-injection.  For the half-life evaluation, the following 
sampling time points are recommended: baseline, [ADDRESS_368094] - 
injection. No wash- out period needs to be respected prior to blood sampling; no ITI injection 
should be skipped prior to or during the half -life evaluation (last blood sampling should be 
performed before the next regular ITI dose is  injected).

Patients will complete study participation after a complete success of the ITI (inhibitor- free, 
normalised recovery and half -life), and the start of re gular prophylactic treatment, or after a 
maximum ITI period of 36 months.  
Surgical Visits:  
Study subjects may undergo surgical interventions during the course of the study. Depending 
on the type of surgery, subjects may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301248] (in case of c ertain minor surgeries 
with low risk of post-operative  bleeding)  at the discretion  of the Investigator. Patient’s  BW will 
be recorded within 12 hours before the start of surgery. Estimations of blood loss and duration of surgery will be recorded. Details o f Human -cl rhFVIII dosing, concomitant treatment 
(including need for additional blood transfusions, excluding anaesthetic drugs), AEs (if any) and vital signs  will be documented throughout  the surgery. Details of surgery, actual  blood loss, 
efficacy assessment, presence of wound haematomas and narratives of outcomes will be recorded after the surgery. 
Completion Visit:  
For each patient, the study is completed once [ADDRESS_368095] been reached, or after a maximum of 5 years study participat ion - from screening.  
Patients undergoing an ITI complete the study after a successful elimination of the inhibitor (“complete success” criteria see above), but after a maximum ITI period of 36 months.  
At this visit,  blood samples will be obtained for FVII I inhibitor  screen  (after a wash -out period 
of at least 2, preferably 3 days after the previous IMP administration) and the safety panel. Samples for FVIII inhibitor screen are analysed in the central  laboratory.  
The vital signs and a physical examination will be performed. The patient’s BW will be measured. The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication are checked and documented. 
At this visit,  the patient  diary  will be reviewed  (any IMP injection, any bleed)  in order  to transfer 
data into the  CRF.  
6.[ADDRESS_368096] terminated the planned 
observation period/Completion Visit. The total study period is scheduled to comprise [ADDRESS_368097] quarter  2013 and is planned to continue  until the 4th quarter  of 2018. 
6.2.3 Premature Termination of the  Study  
Both the Investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. 
Should this be necessary, the required procedures will be arranged on an individual basis after 
review and consultation by [CONTACT_49249]. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the

interests.  
 
7 ASSESSMENTS AND  METHODS  
7.1 Background / Baseline  Information  
 
The following information will be captured upon enrolment:  
Demographics : sex, age, weigh t and height (calculated body mass index [BMI]), and ethnic 
origin, family history of haemophilia and family history of FVIII inhibitor development 
Medical history : obtained from existing medical charts and by [CONTACT_301288](s)/legal 
guardian(s) a nd by [CONTACT_746] a physical examination  
Previous and concomitant medication: obtained from existing medical charts and by 
[CONTACT_301288](s)/legal guardian(s)  
Analysis of FVIII gene mutations : blood samples collected by [CONTACT_301289] s 
performed by a central laboratory  
7.2 Efficacy/Immunogenicity  Assessments 
 
7.2.1 Assessments for Primary Endpoint  
The primary objective is to investigate the immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII.  
Inhibitor activity will be determined centrally by [CONTACT_301290] (Nijmegen 
modification), using congenital FVIII- deficient human plasma spi[INVESTIGATOR_301230] -cl rhFVIII 
at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every 10- 12 EDs or every 3 months ± 2 weeks (whichever comes first) after ED  20 
• At study completion  
• Any time in the case of a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_301231].  
In case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor re -testing using a second separately draw n 
sample should be performed centrally. The definitions for thresholds are ≥ 0.6 to < 5 BU for a "low titre" inhibitor and ≥5 BU for a "high- titre" inhibitor.  
Patients who develop a non- transient inhibitor will have an option to start on ITI treatment. 
Patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_301249].  Inhibitors 
that `disappear´ without any clinical signs or symptoms, where no FVIII dosing increase was required, and that turn to <0.[ADDRESS_368098] detection  are regarded 
as “transient”, and continue regular treatment within the study until they have reached ED 100 or a maximum period of 5  years..

7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary  Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prophylactic  treatment  
 
The following parameters will be  documented:  
• Dates and times of study product  injections  
• Details of dose(s) (in IU) and product batch  numbers  
• Details of BEs (if any) occurring under prophylactic  treatment  
Study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total (for 
patients on prophylactic treatment) will be evaluated.  
Efficacy Assessment of Prophylactic Treatment  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in prophylactic treatment will be evaluated based on the 
frequency of spontaneous  breakthrough bleeds per months under three times weekly or every 
other day prophylactic treatment and will be calculated and assessed as excellent, good, 
moderate or poor:  
Excellent :        Less than 0.75 spontaneous BEs per  month  
Good:  Between 0.75 and 1 spontaneous BEs per month 
Moderate : Between more than 1 and 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
Poor : More than 1.[ADDRESS_368099] prophylactic

any. 
The frequency of treatment will mainly depend on the patient’s clinical situation and may  vary 
from every other day to once weekly injections. In cases of inadequate response, Human- cl 
rhFVIII administration frequency or dose adjustments  can be considered at Investigator’s 
discretion.  
The number of BEs counted for prophylactic treatment efficacy assessment will comprise all 
BEs starting during the time periods for prophylactic treatment defined above, i.e. BEs 
occurring between start of s urgery until final assessment of the surgery will not be included in 
the prophylactic treatment assessment.

• Efficacy assessment at the end of the BE (definitions see below)  
• Deta ils of dose(s) and batch number used to treat BE (in  IU) 
• Dates and times of study product  injections  
* If the treatment  of a BE in one bleeding site is interrupted for more  than [ADDRESS_368101] to be recorded; if another – in addition to  the original –  bleeding site is  affected, 
the events will be recorded as separate BEs at any  time.  
All above listed parameters will be documented by [CONTACT_7903] (together with the Investigator 
in case of on- site treatments) in the patient's diary. Patients experiencing a major or life - 
threatening BE should preferably be treated at the study site.  
After the end of a BE the patient is intended to return to his regular prophylactic treatment 
regimen.  
Efficacy Assessment of Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_301251] a BE, the following efficacy assessment will be made by [CONTACT_102]’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) (toge ther with the Investigator in case of on -site treatment):  
Excellent : Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in  objective  signs  of  
bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single  infusion  
Good:  Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 
approximately 8 – 12 hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for 
complete  resolution  
Moderate : Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately [ADDRESS_368102] 
infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution  
None : No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more 
than 2 infusions for complete  resolution  
The assessment will be made at the end of a BE.

• Laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry: before and 24 hours after end of  surgery)  
• Details on concomitantly administered products including any blood/blood product 
transfusions but excluding drugs given for routine anaesthesia  
• Details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl rhFVIII given pre -, intra - and/or post -

• A brief narrative describing the outcome and efficacy of the  intervention  
• Overall  efficacy  assessment  at the end of surgical  prophylaxis  done  together  by [CONTACT_301291] (definitions see  below) 
Classification of Surgeries  
Surgeries are defined as major if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Requiring general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_301252]  
• Requiring opening into the great body cavities  
• In the course of which hazards of severe haemorrhage is  possible  
• Requiring haemostatic therapy for at least 6  days 
• Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder)  
• 3rd molar extraction or extraction of ≥3 teeth  
• Surgeries/conditions in which the patient's life is at stake  
The classification is made prospectively. All other surgeries are classified as minor.  
FVIII Plasma Level  
FVIII plasma level (both assays, local and central lab) will be documented at the following 
time-points:  
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after pre -operative injection of study  drug 
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after each intra -operative bolus dose (if any); not 
mandatory for minor BEs 
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after eac h post -operative dose (if any); in case of 
major surgery: mandatory for the first [ADDRESS_368103]- operative  doses  
Continuous infusion is not allowed in this study, only bolus injections are permitted.  
Estimation of Blood -Loss 
Prior to surgery, the surgeon will prov ide written estimates of the following: 
Volume (mL) of average expected blood loss for the planned surgical procedure, as it would 
be expected  for the same procedure  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis,  of the same sex, age, 
and stature.  
Volume (mL) of maximal expected blood loss for the planned surgical procedure as it would 
be expected  for the same procedure  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis,  of the same sex, age, 
and stature.  
Following the surgery, the actual blood loss will be estimated by [CONTACT_11065]. 
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_368104]-operative  administration is defined as any dose of Human- cl rhFVIII applied after the 
end of the surgery (“end of surgery” is defined as “last suture”), for at least 2 days (minor 
surgeries), or for at least 6 to 14 days (major surgeries), respectively, until healing is achieved and recurrence to the regular prophylactic t reatment regimen.  
Efficacy Assessment of Surgical Prophylaxis  
Efficacy will be assessed at the end of surgery by [CONTACT_301292] -operatively by [CONTACT_301293]:  
Intra -operatively (at the end of the surgery [= after last su ture]):  
• Excellent:  Intra -operative  blood loss was lower  than or equal  to the average expected  blood 
loss compared with the same type of procedure performed in a patient with normal 
haemostasis and of the same sex, age, and  stature.  
• Good: Intra -operative bl ood loss was higher than average expected blood loss but lower or 
equal to the maximal expected blood loss compared with the same type of procedure in a patient with normal haemostasis.  
• Moderate: Intra- operative blood loss was higher than maximal expected blood loss 
compared  with the same  type of procedure  performed  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis, 
but haemostasis was controlled.  
• None: Haemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor replacement 
regimen.  
Post-operatively:  
• Excellent : No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery. All post -operative bleeding (due to complications of surgery) was controlled with 
Human -cl rhFVIII, as anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
• Good: No post -operative bleed ing or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. 
Control of post -operative bleeding due to complications of surgery required increased 
dosing with Human -cl rhFVIII  or additional  infusions, not originally  anticipated  for the type 
of procedure. 
• Moderate : Some post -operative bleeding and oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery; control of post- operative bleeding required increased dosing with Human -cl 
rhFVIII or additional infusions, not originally anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
• None : Extensive  uncontrolled  post-operative  bleeding and oozing. Control  of post-operative 
bleeding required use of an alternate FVIII concentrate.  
An overall efficacy assessment taking both the intra-  and post -operative assessment into 
account will be done together by [CONTACT_301294].  
The conclusion of the post -operative phase of a major surgery is defined as follows: date of  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_368105] -operative Day 6, whichever occurs later.  
In the end of a surgical prophylactic treatment period the patient is intended to return to his 
regular prophylactic treatment regimen.  
7.3 Safety  Assessments  
 
7.3.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs  will be monitored and recorded throughout the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
 
Adverse event (AE) : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient receiving 
an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can the refore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP.  
Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintende d response to an IMP 
related to any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a causal relationship  between 
the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship  cannot  be ruled 
out. 
Other significant AEs : Any marked la boratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead to an 
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant additional concomitant therapy.  
Withdrawal  due to AE/ADR:  Is a patient  whose  treatment  with IMP is discontinued because of 
an AE or ADR. Any such events will be followed up by [CONTACT_301295]. All follow -up information 
collected will be made available to the  Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection  
 
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as 
“How have you been since the last visit / during the previous  study period?” In addition, the 
patient diaries (if applicable) will be checked by [CONTACT_301296].  
Any AE or ADR  which  occurs  during the study will be noted in detail  on the appropriate  pages 
of the CRF.  If the patient  reports  several  signs  or symptoms,  which  represent  a single  syndrome 
or diagnosis, the latter should be recorded in the CRF. The Investigator responsible will grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non -serious or 
serious) and causality, as defined below (Sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS] and 7.3.2). The Sponsor is 
responsible  to assess the expectedness of each ADR (expected  or unexpected), as defined  below 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In the event  of clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  findings, the tests will be repeated  and 
followe d-up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is  available.  
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later sta ge unless they 
represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
36  
  
The Investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action( s), as well as any other 
observations or comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the patients’ AEs or ADRs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
 
The intensity/severity of all AEs will be graded as follows:  
• mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the 
patient’s routine  activities;  
• moderate : an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s 
routine  activities;  
• severe : an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s routine 
activities.  
Grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement of the Inves tigator and will be decided on a 
case by [CONTACT_413].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  
 
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_301297]:  
• probable : reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relat ionship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily 
highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_301253]’s clinical  state.  
• possible : reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is 
uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administr ation of the IMP; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other  factors.  
• unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. A n event which may have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state 
or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_301254].  
• not related (unrelated) : events for which sufficient information exists to conclude that 
the aetiology is unrelated to the  IMP. 
• unclassified : reports  which  for one reason  or another  are not yet assessable,  e.g. because 
of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05

Classification of ADRs: 
ADRs will be classified by [CONTACT_301298]:  
• expected : an AE that is listed in the “Reference Safety Information” of the current 
edition of the Investigator's  Brochure. 
• unexpected : an AE that is not listed  in the current  edition  of the Investigator's  Brochure, 
or that differs because of greater severity or greater  specificity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome  
 
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows:  
1. recovered, resolved  
2. recovering, resolving  
3. not recovered, not  resolved  
4. recovered, resolved with  sequelae  
5. fatal 
6. unknown 
NOTE:  A patient’s  death  per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event  which  resulted  into 
patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within [ADDRESS_368106] of being considered treatment -related or 
not. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action(s) taken  
 
AEs requiring action or therapy must be tre ated with recognised standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well- being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by [CONTACT_301299]:  
In general  
- none  
- medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started  
- test performed  
- other (to be  specified)  
On IMP  
- none  
- product  withdrawn  
- dose reduced 
- dose increased

No. GENA -[ADDRESS_368107] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in  death,  
• is life-threatening,  
• requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is another important  medical  event.  
In addition, each FVIII inhibitor development is regarded as an SAE.  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient was — in the view 
of the reporting Investigator —  at immediate risk of death at the time of the e vent; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/reaction is serious in other 
situations: Important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately lif e-threatening or do not result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301255], should also be considered serious. 
In addition, although not classif ied under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that 
virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission.  
SAE reporting timelines  
All SAEs, whether suspected to be related to study treatment or not, are to be reported by [CONTACT_756], fax or e -mail immediately to the Clinical Project Manager or designee.  
Contact [CONTACT_301300].  
An Octapharma " Serious Adverse Event Report" must be completed and submitted within 24 
hours after recognition of the event.  
All SAEs should additionally be reported to:

Waiver from SAE reporting requirement:  
The following SAEs do not require reporting in expedited manner : 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301256] a (disease -related)  BE assessed  as unrelated  to IMP 
treatment.  
These exceptions/waivers  include  surgeries  that are elective  or planned, and prolongation of the 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301257], but not medical reasons. These 
should not be considered as SAEs. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_368108] to be taken at one time point, the blood sampling will be done in 
the fo llowing sequence:  
1. Haematology: RBC count, WBC count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count (EDTA  blood)  
2. Coagulation: FVIII plasma level and FVIII inhibitor control (citrated  plasma)  
3. Biochemistry: ALT, AST, serum creatinine  (serum)  
4. RNA expression analysis (optional) (whole blood, RNAse -free conditions)  
5. Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: gene mutation analysis (mandatory), HLA -typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immune 
response gene profiling, FVIII ethnic haplotype determination (optional), (EDTA blood)  
6. In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products (optional) (citrated  blood)  
It is essential that blood sampling after the injection of Human -cl rhFVIII is done from the 
other arm.  
Blood samples taken  for citrate  plasma  will be centrifuge d after collection  for 15 to 20 minutes 
at 1500 to 2000 g (about 3000 rpm). Aliquots of the supernatant are subsequently transferred 
into the tubes provided by [CONTACT_2237] (pre -labelled with date and time point of 
sampling, type of sample, patie nt identification and study number) and stored, respectively 
shipped under adequate  conditions.  
EDTA Blood  
A 1 mL sample (or less, as required by [CONTACT_12082]) of EDTA blood will be collected 
for the measurement of haematology parameters (RBC count, WBC count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count). All haematology tests are to be done at the local l aboratory. 
A further 5 mL sample will be collected for the FVIII gene mutation analysis and the optional further immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (HLA -typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immune response gene profiling and FVIII ethnic 
haplotype analysis). The immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_301258].

Citrated Plasma  
For the analysis of coagulation factor and inhibitor screen, both performed in the central 
laboratory in the US, a maximum of around 2 mL of citrated blood will be collected. After collection and centrifugation, the plasma will be aliquoted into cryo -resistant tubes. Samples 
will be stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped to t he central laboratory on dry- ice. 
For analysis performed  locally,  e.g. at screening  and pre-, intra,  and post-surgery, citrated  blood 
as required by [CONTACT_301301].  
From  patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_301259],  and agree to participate  in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_301260]-study, a further pre -ITI initiation 2 mL citrated blood sample (2 x 0,5 mL citrated plasma) 
is needed. After ITI initiation two further blood sampling time points are recommended: as close as possible after the peak inhibitor level, as well as after inhibitor eradication.  
Serum  
For the determination of clinical chemistry (ALT, AST, serum creatinine) a blood sample of about 0.5 mL (or less, as required by [CONTACT_12082]) will be collected. All tests are to be done at the local laboratory. 
Citrated blood  
If the (optional) analysis of immunogenicity of FVIII products ( in vitro T cell assay) is to be 
performed,  a blood sample of exactly  [ADDRESS_368109] arrive at the central laboratory within 24 hours after collection.  
Whole blood (RNAse -free conditions)  
If the RNA expression analysis is performed, about 1.0 mL of blood will be collected into an sterile (RNAase & DNase- free) syringe and directly transferred into a customised PAXGene 
tube (provided by [CONTACT_301302] -labelled with date and time point of  sampling, 
type of sample, patient identification and study number). Sample should be kept upright for a minimum of 2 hours at room temperature (18 –  25°C) following blood sampling (maximum 
time 72 h). Samples can be stored at - 20°C or –70°C and shipped to the central laboratory on 
dry ice. See Appendix 2 for a detailed sampling protocol.  
 
 
The “Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products conducted with the Paediatric Population” are followed during the conduct of GENA -05. The Committee 
recommends the below blood volume limits for sampling in neonates:  
Per individual, the  trial- related blood loss should not exceed 3 % of the total blood volume 
during a period of four weeks, and should not exceed 1% at any single time. The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 ml/kg body weight; 3% is 2.4 ml blood per kg body weight.  
Time -points and required blood volume needs for laboratory parameters are as follows (all 
optional blood samplings are greyed out):

† Performed if abnormal AST or ALT values persist for more than [ADDRESS_368116] 2 years after the completion of the study and until Octapharma’s 
written authorisation to destroy these  samples.  
7.3.4 Vital Signs and Physical  Examination  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temper ature) will be assessed at 
the following time -points: at screening, prior and – in case IMP was injected – 30-60 minutes 
after the end of the injection at 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) visits, and prior and – in case IMP was 
injected – 30-[ADDRESS_368117] study related safety reports:  
Any ADR (i.e., any AE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP) that occurs after the completion of the study should be reported by [CONTACT_737]. The usual procedure for reportin g post -marketing safety information should be followed, but relation to the clinical 
study should be stated on the report.  
If a patient dies within [ADDRESS_368118] IMP administration, this should be reported as well, without being considered treatme nt-related or not.  
Overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse, medication error and lack of efficacy:  
The following safety  relevant  information  should be reported  as an AE or, if the reaction  fulfils 
one of the criteria for seriousness, as a SAE.  
Drug overdose:  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
Interaction:  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product affects the activity of an IMP, i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be c learly identified as drug interaction.  
Misuse:  
Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside its described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label -use). The reaction 
must be clearly identified as misuse.  
Medication error:  
Medicati on error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by [CONTACT_151814], presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error.

7.4 Other  Assessments  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recovery investigation  (optional)  
 
A recovery investigation is recommended to be performed with the first Human -cl rhFVIII 
administration, or within the first three months after treatment start with Human -cl rhFVIII , in 
any case in a non -bleeding patient. A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg BW will be administered and the 
in vivo recovery will be calculated from the FVIII levels before infusion and the peak level 
obtained from the [ADDRESS_368119] -infusion samples . Recovery investigations are 
recommended to be repeated approximately every 6 months.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] RNA Expression Analysis  (Optional)  
RNA expression analysis will optionally be performed in order to provide an understanding of 
the transcript activity of the genes inv olved in immune responses that may be responsible for 
FVIII inhibitor  formation  in patients  receiving  exogenous  FVIII.  RNA expression  analysis  will 
also be optionally  performed  on patients  undergoing ITI to provide  information  on the transcript 
activity of genes involved in immune tolerance. The analysis will be carried out using a customised PAXgene protocol in which RNA samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_301305]. This customised approach has previously been used in both a paediatric and animal study where samples volumes are limited (6),(7). The full protocol for this sub -study can be found in 
Appendix 2. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Partly  Optional)  
Immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_301262]. It will include analysis of FVIII gene mutations, HLA- typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immune response gene profiling and FVIII ethnic haplotype analysi s. FVIII 
mutation analysis is a required assessment, whereas HLA -typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immune response gene 
profiling and FVIII ethnic haplotype are optional. Blood samples required for this analysis can be obtained at any time during the study, but it is recommended that they be obtained at the same time as the samples for scheduled study visits.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products  (optional)  
Immunogenicity  of Human- cl rhFVIII  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_301306] (PBMC) from the patients (including a positive control) with Human -cl rhFVIII. The 
nature of T cell response will be assessed by [CONTACT_301272] (measured in a multiplex format) and T cell proliferation. Cytokines analysed will include IL -2, TNFα, IFNγ, 
IL-5, IL -6, IL-10, and IL -17 (TGFβ may also be included in an ELISA  format).  
7.5 Appropriateness of Measurements  
 
All measurements used for the assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII are in compliance with the requirements set up in the CHMP “Guideline on 
the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma -derived factor VIII products” 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) (5).

the PROPH population is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of efficacy data on prophylaxis; the BLEED popula tion is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of 
efficacy data on bleedings and the SURG population is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of efficacy data on surgeries. To evaluate the robustness of the study results, efficacy analys es will also be done on basis of the respective PP population.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_368132] FVIII will be listed. The occurrence and 
cumulative incidence of inhibitors (inhibitor titre ≥ 0.6 and ≥ 5 BU respectively) will be 
presented  in total,  and as percentage of the analysis  population  with a 95% confidence  interval. 
If justified by [CONTACT_301321], the time period until the first inhibitor activity will be 
tabulated and displayed graphically by [CONTACT_3553] a Kaplan -Meier plot of survival without 
inhibitor versus cumulative EDs, and a logistic re gression analysis of incidence rates of FVIII 
inhibitor development will be performed (prognostic factors: family history, weight, mean dose/ED, age, gene mutation defect, number of EDs before inhibitor development, age at first treatment, intensity of tre atment). Number of EDs before inhibitor development will be 
tabulated  for each patient  who develops  FVIII inhibitors.  Incidence of FVIII inhibitors  will also 
be presented grouped by [CONTACT_301322], incl. results of the immunogenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_197330]- study, if data are  available.  
Date from patients participating in sub -studies – RNA- expression analysis and the In vitro  
immunogenicity of FVIII products - will be evaluated by [CONTACT_9086].  
9.2.3 Efficacy Analysis  Plan  
Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_9086].  
• On bleeding rates (efficacy of prophylaxis) overall and by [CONTACT_301323]  
• On efficacy assessments per bleed, basic bleed characteristics including severity, site 
and type 
• On efficacy assessments per  surgery  
• Recovery investigation (optional): a recovery investigation is recommended to be performed. This can be done with the first Human -cl rhFVI II administration, or within 
the first three  months  after treatment  start with Human- cl rhFVIII,  in any case in a non- 
bleeding  patient.  
The frequency  of bleeds,  the number  of infusions  needed  to treat a BE, the number  of EDs,  and 
study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg  per infusion, per BE, per month, per year)  per patient 
and in total will be evaluated.  Furthermore,  increased  and decreased  doses  of Human -cl rhFVIII 
used to treat individual BEs (frequency and relative magnitude of dose changes) will be evaluated, as well as changes in the doses per infusion and changes in the total dose used to treat subsequent BEs of the same type (e.g. elbow, knee, etc.) in the same  patient (frequency 
and relative magnitude of dose  changes).  
9.2.4 Safety Analysis  Plan

Routine laboratory parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry) will be listed for all patients, using indicators for values outside the associated reference ranges. Changes from baseline (screening) will be provided where  appropriate.  
9.2.5 Resource Use Analysi s Plan 
The statistical analysis of resource use parameters will be descriptive.  
Continuous characteristics (i.e. drug usage, duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], days lost at work, etc.) will be described in terms of mean/median/ standard deviation and range). Dic hotomous or 
categorical variables (i.e. number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56183], CVAD use, etc.) will be described by [CONTACT_301326].  
If applicable, results will also be presented per subgroup. 
Health economic modelling analysis with resource use parameters is planned at study closure.  
9.2.6 Handling of Missing Data  
In general, missing data will not be imputed: calculations pertaining to person- year 
computations will be based on observed values only. Only in case of missing BW, the last

must  be signed, with name  [CONTACT_301336] [CONTACT_102], before  the patient is exposed 
to any study -related procedure, including screening tests for  eligibility.  
For patients  not qualified  to give legal  consent,  written  consent  must  be obtained from  the legal 
parent(s)/guardian(s). If children are o ld enough to understand the risks and benefits of the 
study, they should also be informed and provide their written consent.  
The Investigator  will explain  that the patients  are completely  free to refuse  to enter  the study or 
to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without the need  to justify.  The Investigator  will complete  the informed  consent  section  of the CRF  for 
each patient  enrolled.  
Each patient will be informed that his/he r medical (source) records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_119645], a quality assurance auditor or a health authority inspector, in accordance with applicable regulations, and that these persons are bound by [CONTACT_174416].  
10.4 Protocol  Amendments  
 
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the Investigator (co- ordinating 
Investigator in multi -centre studies) and the Sponsor prior to its implementation. Any such  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018

amendments will be submitted to the IEC (s)/IRB) and/or competent authority responsible as 
required by [CONTACT_5279]. IEC(s)/IRB approval will at a minimum be requested for 
any change  to this protocol  which  could affect  the safety  of the patients,  the objective/design  of 
the study, any increase in dosage or duration of exposure to the IMP an increase in the number of patients treated, the addition of a new test or procedure, or the droppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a test intended to 
monitor safety.  
10.5 Confidentiality of Patients´ Data  
 
The Investigator will ensure  that the patient's  confidentiality is preserved.  On CRFs  or any other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor, the patients will not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by a unique patient number. Documents not for submission to the Sponsor,  i.e., the confidential 
patient  identification  code  list, original  consent  forms  and source records  will be maintained  by 
[CONTACT_30379].  
 
[ADDRESS_368135] and visit the Investigator periodically to review all study -related 
source  data/records,  verify  the adherence  to the protocol  and the completeness,  correctness and 
accuracy of all CRF entries compared to source data. The Investigat or will co -operate with the 
monitor to ensure that any discrepancies identified are  resolved. 
For this study, the first monitoring visit shall take place shortly after the inclusion of the first patient. Thereafter, monitoring frequency will depend on study progress.  
The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the clinical study. Source data will be available for all data in the CRFs, including all laboratory results.  
11.2 Audit and Inspection  
 
The Investigator will make all study -related source data and records available to a qualified 
quality assurance auditor mandated by [CONTACT_1034], or to IEC/IRB/regulatory inspectors, after reasonable notice. The main purpos es of an audit or inspection are to confirm that the rights 
and welfare of the patients have been adequately protected, and that all data relevant for the assessment of safety and effectiveness of the IMP have been reported to the Sponsor.  
 
12 REPORTING AND PUBLICATION  
12.1 Clinical Study  Report

Inhibitory antibody formation remains the greatest challenge in the management of severe 
haemophilia  A. The focus  of genetics studies  of inhibitor risk has been  on variations  / mutations 
in the inherited DNA sequences of the factor VIII (FVIII) gene (causative haemophilia mutation or FVIII wild type haplotype) and genes involved in the immune response (e.g. IL - 
10, TNF -α and CTLA -4). However, such DNA based technology only gives the baseline gene 
profile of the individual without taking into account the dynamic changes that will occur in actual gene expression around the time of exposure to a novel immunogenic stimulus. Quantitative assessment of transcribed messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) offers a way of measuring differential changes in gene activity in these circumstances. Although technology 
for assessment of mRNA expression has been available for some years, the arrival of next 
generation sequencing (RNA -Seq) offers the ability to perform high throughput analysis of 
gene transcript activity on small volumes of venous blood in the setting of an international clinical study. This technology offers the ability to sequence the gene transcript products of millions  of genes from  each clinical  sample.  This enables  an unbiased  assessment  of the genes 
involved in the immune  response  as well as other  potential  novel  biological  pathways  that may 
prove to be of key importance in the process of inhibitor  formation.  
 
This is the first clinical study to prospectively evaluate changes in gene expression around the time of exposure  to exogenous  FVIII  and during immune  tolerance induction. Measurement  of 
real-time changes in mRNA expression may give further insight into the complex dynamic 
proce sses and pathways involved with the aim of identifying “bio- signatures” that can predict 
those  at greatest  risk of inhibitor  formation  or failure  of immune  tolerance induction. Sampling 
of mRNA is feasible in a paediatric study as it only requires small volumes of venous whole blood. Due to instability in mRNA and changes in gene expression following phlebotomy, stabilisation is required at the point of collection (1,2,3). Modifications of commercially 
available stabilisation systems have been successfully trialled in both paediatric and animal studies demonstrating satisfactory mRNA yields whilst minimising required blood volumes (4,5).  
 
RNA Expression Analysis Sampling Schedule  
Formal written consent should be obtained at study entry for storage of whole blood (mRNA) samples for research purposes to investigate the mechanisms of inhibitor formation / immune tolerance.  
For a patient enrolled on this optional sub- study, peripheral venous blood samples will be 
collected on commencement of Human -cl rhFVIII treatment at the time points shown in table 
1. A screening sample (prior to first FVIII exposure) is necessary to proceed with follow up samples. If the screening sample is missed, do not collect subsequent follow up samples. However, these patients could still be enrolled in the ITI RNA -Seq study (see Table 2), 
with a new pre -ITI baseline sample and subsequent follow up samples.

RNA Expression Study Materials  
Investigation centres will be provided with centrally prepared customized PAXgene mRNA sampling tubes. The materials required for this study are as follows:  
1) Customized PAXgene mRNA sampling tube: sterile(RNAse / DNAse free) cryovial 
(4.5 mL volume) containing 2.76mL PAXgene reagent (ratio 1mL blood : 2.76mL 
reagent)  (provided)  
2) Sterile butterfly / winged infusion kit (not provided)  
3) Sterile 1mL syringe (not provided)  
4) Sterile gloves (not provided)  
5) Skin surface wipe (not  provided)  
 
RNA Expression Sampling Protocol  
1) Keep RNA expression sample tube at room temperature (18 –  25°C) prior to 
sampling. Do not re -use once  opened.  
2) Collect 1mL venous blood into a 1mL sterile  syringe using the local centre’s protocol 
for venepuncture, wearing sterile  gloves. 
3) Open PAXgene sample tube and directly transfer 1mL of venous blood following 
venepuncture into the PAXgene  tube. 
4) Close sample tube. 
5) Gently invert the customized PAXgene tube 8 to 10 times.  
6) Label sample with patient identifiable information / study number / and study time - 
point.  
RNA Expression Transportation and Storage Protocol  
1) Keep sample upright for 4- 6 hours at room temperature (18 – 25°C) following 
blood sampling, prior to freezing. Early freezing of samples will substantially 
decrease the RNA  yield. 
2) Freeze sample at –70°C in a wire rack (not a stryofoam tray as this may lead to sample tubes  cracking).  
Appendix 2  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 05 
01-Feb-2018  Amended Study Protocol No. GENA -05  
  
3) Transport frozen PAXgene stabilised RNA study samples to LabCorp (LabCorp 
Clinical Trials, Laboratory Services, [ADDRESS_368137], Ste. 100, Englewood, CO 
[ZIP_CODE], [LOCATION_003]) on dry ice. 
4) RNA Samples kept at - 70°C will be stable for a period of up to 60 months  (6). 
 
RNA Extraction and Transcriptosome Analysis

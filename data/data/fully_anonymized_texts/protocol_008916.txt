1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
Background:  Induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (ALL),  and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is associated with a high risk of invasive 
fungal infection due to Candida and Aspergillus  species.  Posaconazole, an oral broad spectrum 
azole, is currently approved for chemoprophylaxis during induction chemotherapy.  Posaconazole is 
available only as oral formulation and requires food intake for optimal absorption thus limiting its 
utility in patients unable to tolerate oral intake. Micafungin, an echinocandin with antifungal activity 
against Candida and Aspergillus  species is approved for the prevention of invasive fungal infections 
during neutropenia in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Micafungin is available as intravenous formulation and has an excellent safety profile. Micafungin has not been evaluated as prophylaxis against fungal infection in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for AML/ALL/MDS.  We hypothesize that micafungin would be a safe and effective alternative to 
posaconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections due to 
neutropenia after induction chemotherapy for AML/ ALL/MDS.  
Proposed Study design: This is a single-center, open- labeled, randomized, controlled trial. One 
hundred and fourteen patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or re -induction chemotherapy for first relapse of AML at MSKCC will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive micafungin 100mg IV daily or posaconazole 400 mg orally 2 times a day. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_503408]/ ALL/MDS or AML in first relapse. 
Prophylaxis will sta rt 24-[ADDRESS_648244] dose of chemotherapy and will be continued until 
neutrophil recovery (ANC>500/mm
3 on 2 consecutive days) or maximum of 4 weeks. If the patients 
develop suspected or proven fungal infection the study drug will be discontinued and patients will receive antifungal treatment with AmBisome according to the standards of care at MSKCC. The patients will be followed up through chart review for a total of 12 weeks to assess survival and if 
applicable outcome of fungal infection.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
Primary 
• To compare rates of clinical failure between patients who receive posaconazole and 
those who receive micafungin at 4 weeks from randomization.  
Clinical failure is defined as: 1) need for systemic antifungal therapy (AmBisome) for 
> 3 consecutive days for presumptive fungal infection, toxicity or intolerance of study 
medication or 2) death. 
Secondary  
• To compare the number of days on study drug between patients who receive posaconazole 
and patients who receive micafungin. The maximum number of days on study drug is 28 days 
(4 weeks).  
• To compare the incidence of possible, probable or proven IFI between patients who receive 
posaconazole and those who receive micafungin during treatment phase at 4 weeks from start 
of study drug.   
• To compare the incidence of possible, probable or proven IFI between patients who receive 
posaconazole and those who receive micafungin at 12 weeks from randomization. 
•To compare the rates of discontinuation of study medication for any reason between patients 
who receive posaconazole and those who receive micafungin.  
• To compare overall survival rates at 6 weeks (12 weeks) from randomization between the two 
treatment arms.  
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Of all hematologic malignancies, patients with AML appear to be at greatest risk for an IFI. In a large autopsy series [1], 42% of all IFIs were identified in patients with AML and 77% of all IFIs were believed to have contributed to the cause of death. Yet, in almost 75% of cases, the IFI was not diagnosed antemortem. Upon review of almost 12,[ADDRESS_648245] commonly seen in patients with AML (69% of all proven or probabl e IFIs identified) [2]. Even more striking was that 
greater than 12% of all patients with AML had a proven or probable IFI. Among the 3,012 patients with AML, the attributable mortality from Aspergillosis and Candidiasis was 35-40% [2].  Such infections were most commonly seen in patients receiving initial chemotherapy to treat active hematologic malignancies rather than in those having been treated with multiple rounds of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The true incidence of IFIs in AML is probably underestimated due to our inability to establish the diagnosis of by [CONTACT_497837] a “proven” or “probable” Mortality rates for candidiasis and aspergillosis in high risk patients such as those with 
AML and MDS range between 10-49% and 32-87% respectively [3 -4].    
Several trials have evaluated the utility of antifungal prophylaxis in patients undergoing induction 
chemotherapy. Winston et al conducted a prospective-randomized double blinded placebo-controlled study in 256 patients 124 of which received fluconazole and 132 of whom received placebo. Fluconazole prophylaxis prevented fungal colonization and superficial fungal infections caused by

most Candida species. Significantly fewer patients who received fluconazole experienced a proven 
fungal infection. There was no significant difference between the groups in the overall incidence of IFI, use of empi[INVESTIGATOR_503397] [5]. 
Based on these results, fluconazole prophylaxis has 
been used in patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia, even though 
advantages with respect to morbidity or mortality have not been proved and there was no consensus among 
clinicians regarding its use in these high -risk patients [6].   
Morgenstern et al conducted a prospective-randomized open labeled study in 445 neutropenic patients with leukemia 227of which received fluconazole 218 of whom received itraconazole. Itraconazole and fluconazole were equally effective in preventing IFI.  Itraconazole was more effective in  preventing aspergillosis. Fewer patients receiving itraconazole received empi[INVESTIGATOR_503398] B compared with patients receiving fluconazole. There was a higher incidence of 
withdrawal caused by [CONTACT_10167]- effects in patients receiving itraconazole [7].  
Although the use of itraconazole seemed to reduce the incidence of proven invasive fungal infections [8] it did 
not confer a significant survival benefit over fluconazole in large trials, and has been associated with greater 
toxicity [5, 9]. 
Mattiuzzi et al conducted a prospective-randomized open labeled study in 200 neutropenic patients 
with acute leukemia 92 of which received itraconazole IV and 108 of whom received Caspofungin.  Prophylaxis with caspofungin appeared to be as effective and tolerable as prophylaxis with IV itraconazole. No statistically significant differences in treatment- related adverse events were noted 
[10]. This study suggests that the echinocandins may be a suitable alternative to the azoles for 
prophylaxis in high risk patients with leukemia.  
Most recently, Cornely and colleagues conducted a randomized, multicenter, open-label, non-
inferiority study to assess the efficacy of posaconazole versus standard triazole therapy for prophylaxis of IFIs in 602 high-risk, neutropenic patients with AML/MDS in which [ADDRESS_648246] triazole therapy (fluconazole 400 mg orally daily or itraconazole 200 mg oral solution twice daily) with each chemotherapy cycle. The study agents were administered until patients were no longer neutropenic or until the occurrence of an IFI, up to 84 days after randomization. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of proven or probable IFI during the treatment phase (from randomization until [ADDRESS_648247] dose of study drug). Probable or proven IFIs occurred in 2% of posaconazole treated patients and 8% of fluconazole- or itraconazole- treated 
patients (P = 0.0009). All-cause mortality rates were lower in the posaconazole group than in the 
standard triazole therapy group (16% vs 22%, P  = 0.048).  In summary, posaconazole pr evented
 
invasive fungal infections more effectively than did either fluconazole or itraconazole and improved 
overall survival. There were more serious adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment in 
the posaconazole group [11].   A patient's ability to swallow is rarely compromised immediately after 
induction chemotherapy, but oral intake may decrease owing to mucositis later in the course of 
treatment. The study was therefore limited in its ability to provide data on the usefulness of azole 
prophylaxis in patients who have severe mucositis and are unable to eat or take oral medication.
Micafungin is an echinocandin with antifungal activity against Candida and Aspergillus  species and 
Pneumocystis carinii  [12-13]. Micafungin is given intravenously thus achieving reliable serum levels 
in patients unable to tolerate oral intake.  A randomized, double-blind study compared micafungin to fluconazole for prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in 882 neutropenic stem- cell transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [14]. Patients were treated with either fluconazole or micafungin during the period of 
neutropenia or up to a maximum of 42 days after transplant.  Successful prophylaxis (absence of a

proven, probable or suspected IFI) was documented in 80.7% of patients receiving micafungin 
compared to 73.7% of those receiving fluconazole (absolute difference 7%, 95% confidence interval 1.5-12.5%).  Overall, 4.2% of micafungin-treated patients died during the study period compared to 5.7% of fluconazole-treated (p=NS).  Micafungin is the first echinocandin approved for prophylaxis. 
A smaller study performed in Japan suggested that pre- emptive IFI treatment with micafungin was 
safe and effective [15].  A multinational, non- comparative study utilizing an open- label design 
examined the efficacy of micafungin alone or in combination with another systemic antifungal agent 
as primary or salvage therapy for proven or probable (pulmonary only) Aspergillus species infection in a wide variety of patient populations. Micafungin proved efficacious and safe in high-risk patients with IA, although patient numbers were small in the micafungin-only groups [16]. 
 
Based on its excellent safety profile and pharmacology, micafungin is promising as an alternative to 
posaconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in patients with AML/MDS.  We propose a randomized, open label, single center clinical trial to compare micafungin with posaconazole for prevention of invasive fungal infections during neutropenia in patients with AML/ MDS who are undergoing induction chemotherapy.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1. MICAFUNGIN  
5.1.1. Overview  
Micafungin (Mycamine®, Astellas) is an echinocandin antifungal with activity against a broad 
range of yeast and mold, including fluconazole-susceptible and fluconazole-resistant Candida, 
Aspergillus spp. including species resistant to amphotericin and others [17-20].  The primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of 1,3-ß-
D-glucan synthase, an enzyme utilized in the 
synthesis of 1,3-ß- D-glucan.  Glucancomprises 30–60% of the cell wall of Candida and a lesser 
percentage of the cell wall of Aspergillus  and is an excellent target for antifungal activity as 
mammalian cells lack cell walls.   There is little human toxicity attributed to the mechanism of action, because glucan polymers are not components of mammalian cells.  In time-kill studies, micafungin demonstrates fungicidal activity against C. albicans, C. krusei, C. 
parapsilosis , and
 C. glabrata at multiples of the MIC [19]. In animal studies, micafungin 
demonstrates dose- and concentration-dependent fungicidal activity in reducing tissue burdens of 
Candida in rabbits treated over an eight-fold dosage range and in the mouse thigh model of 
Candida infection.  The effect of echinocandins on tissue burden of Candida and Aspergillus  
differs: Candida may be completely eradicated from tissue, while Aspergillus tends to persist, 
perhaps because echinocandins work on the branch points and advancing tips of hyphae, while 
other cells of the hyphal structure may remain viable.  These differences in pharmacologic effects 
may indicate that echinocandins will be more effective for prophylaxis against, rather than treatment of, aspergillosis.  
5.1.2. Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin were assessed in healthy subjects and in adult and 
pediatric patient populations [21-23].  Micafungin is not appreciably absorbed when administered orally. In adults and children >2 years of age, steady- state plasma concentrations are achieved by 
[CONTACT_4475] 4 with repeated dosing. Pharmacokinetic
 parameters indicate dose proportionality for doses up 
to 50 mg (adults) and 1 mg/kg (children) [24].  Plasma concentrations of micafungin are well 
described by a linear 2-compartment model with first-order input. The volume of distribution is 
approximately 0.2 L/kg, and total protein binding of micafungin is at least 99%.  
5.1.3. Indications and usage 
Micafungin is FDA-approved for the: 
• Treatment of patients with candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, Candida peritonitis 
and abscesses.

Amended:
• Treatment of patients with esophageal candidiasis  
• Prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation.  
Micafungin is the first echinocandin approved for prophylaxis. 
5.1.4. Formulation and labeling 
Vials contain 50mg of sterile micafungin.  The diluent to be used for reconstitution and dilution is 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP (without a bacteriostatic agent). Alternatively, 5% Dextrose Infection, USP, may be used for reconstitution and dilution of micafungin.   
5mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP, should be added to a 50mg vial of micafungin to 
yield a preparation containing approximately 10mg/mL.  Reconstituted micafungin should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  To minimize excessive foaming, gently dissolve the micafungin powder by [CONTACT_503410].  The diluted solution should be protected from light and further diluted in 100ml normal saline for injection before administration.  It is not necessary to cover the infusion drip chamber or the tubing. 
5.1.5. Adverse effects  
• Micafungin has been studied in over [ADDRESS_648249] a safety profile comparable to fluconazole. 
• Clinically supported details regarding the safety profile of micafungin can be found at: 
http://www.mycamine.com/about/intro.php
 
Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients 
treated with mic afungin.  Elevations in BUN and creatinine have also been reported.  In controlled 
trials, the incidence of drug-related renal adverse events was 0.4% for micafungin and 0.5% for fluconazole.  Similarly, the incidence of transaminitis or hepatic dysfunction did not differ between micafungin and fluconazole.  Isolated cases of significant hemolysis have been reported in patients treated with micafungin.   In a study of micafungin among stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the only adverse events noted in >2% of patients were nausea (2.6%), diarrhea (3.1%) and hyperbilirubinemia (2.4%).   
Micafungin is pregnancy category C and is found in the milk of lactating, drug- treated rats.  No cases 
of micafungin overdosage have been reported.  Repeated daily doses of up to 8mg/kg (max 896mg) 
in adult patients have been administered in clinical trials with no reported dose- limiting toxicity.  
5.1.6. Drug-drug interactions  
Micafungin is metabolized to M-1 (catechol form) by [CONTACT_503411], with further metabolism to M -2 
(methoxy form) by [CONTACT_503412] -O-methyltransferase.  Hydroxylation by [CONTACT_503413] a major 
pathway for micafungin metabolism in vivo and micafungin is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in vitro.  Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination.  No dose adjustment of micafungin is required based on gender or race.

Eleven drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in healthy controls to evaluate the potential for 
micafungin to interact with other medications [22, 24].  In these studies, no interaction that altered the pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed.  Intravenous doses of micafungin 100 mg were unchanged
 during co-administration in healthy subjects.  
5.1.7. Dosage and administration of micafungin 
All patients will receive micafungin 100mg intravenously daily (see Section 9).  Each dose should be infused over 1 hour to minimize infusion-related histamine reactions.   
5.1.8. Dose adjustments  
No dose adjustments will be made during the course of the trial without an IRB-approved, protocol deviation. 
5.2. POSACONAZOLE  
5.2.1. Overview  
Posaconazole (NOXAFIL® Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ) is a triazole antifungal with a 
broad spectrum of antifungal activity including emerging fungi such as the zygomycetes.  Like the other triazole antifungals, posaconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14- alpha-
demethylase (3 –5). A reduction in this enzyme causes a decrease in fungal ergosterol synthesis, 
which is vital for the formation of fungal cell walls. The cell wall abnormalities result in either cell death or blunted cell growth.  Posaconazole has shown in vitro fungistatic and fungicidal activity against Candida species ( 2–5, 16–
21). Posaconazole has shown potent in vitro activity against Aspergillus  species (3–5, 22, 23 ). A 
global surveillance program evaluated the in vitro activity of the triazole antifungals a nd AmB 
against Aspergillus  species and other filamentous fungi. This surveillance program found that both 
posaconazole and voriconazole inhibited 94% of all Aspergillus  isolates tested. Another study found 
that posaconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin inhibited 98%, 95%, and 98% of Aspergillus  
isolates tested, respectively. Posaconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin are more potent than AmB against A. fumigatus . 
5.2.2. Pharmacokinetics  
Posaconazole is  available as a suspension for oral administration. The pharmacokinetic properties of 
posaconazole are listed on table 1.

Absorption  
 
Posaconazole is absorbed with a median Tmax of ~3 to 5 hours. Dose proportional increases in 
plasma exposure (AUC) to posaconazole were observed following single oral doses from 50 mg to 800 mg and following multiple-dose administration from 50 mg BID to 400 mg BID. No further increases in exposure were observed when the dose was increased from 400 mg BID to 600 mg BID in febrile neutropenic patients or those with refractory invasive fungal infections. Steady- state plasma 
concentrations are attained at 7 to 10 days following multiple-dose administration.   
Following single -dose administration of 200 mg, the mean AUC and Cmax of posaconazole are 
approximately 3 times higher when administered with a nonfat meal and approximately 4 times 
higher when administered with a high-fat meal (~50 gm fat) relative to the fasted state. Following single-dose administration of 400 mg, the mean AUC and Cmax of posaconazole are approximately 3 
times higher when administered with a liquid nutritional supplement (14 gm fat) relative to the fasted state. In order to assure attainment of adequate plasma concentrations, it is recommended to 
administer posaconazole with food or a nutritional supplement. 
 Courtney and colleagues conducted a randomized, open-label, crossover, single-dose study in [ADDRESS_648250] of food on the bioavailability of two formulations of posaconazole 
[25].  
 
Subjects were given posaconazole [ADDRESS_648251]. Drug exposure was greater, as shown by [CONTACT_503414] (AUC) of 37%, when posaconazole was given in suspension rather than tablet form. Mean AUC and maximum concentrations (C
max) were 
four times greater when posaconazole was administered with a high-fat meal than when it was administered after a fast. Drug exposure was 2.[ADDRESS_648252] of a nutritional supplement on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole 
[26]. Study 
participants received a single dose of posaconazole 400 mg oral suspension either along with 8 
ounces of a nutritional supplement (Boost Plus) or after fasting overnight. The C max and AUC values 
were higher in subjects who received posaconazole concomitantly with the nutritional supplement. The time to achieve C
max and the half-life were not different between groups. The authors concluded 
that the bioavailability of posaconazole is increased when given with a nutritional supplement. 
Based on these studies, it is recommended that posaconazole be administered with food or a 
nutritional supplement whenever possible [22, 27-29]. If a patient cannot be fed, posaconazole should be divided into multiple daily doses (every 6 hours), and the use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered.  Ezzet and colleagues con ducted a randomized, open-label, crossover study in 18 healthy men to 
determine the bioavailability of posaconazole when given without food [30]. Subjects were given the following doses of posaconazole suspension after fasting for 12 hours: 800 mg once a day (regimen A), 400 mg every 12 hours (regimen B), or 200 mg every 6 hours (regimen C). Subjects continued to fast for 48 hours after the dose was given. The study found that the bioavailability of posaconazole oral suspension increased by 98% when the dose was divided every 12 hours and increased by 220% when the dose was divided every 6 hours in fasting subjects. This was roughly equivalent to

posaconazole exposure after a nonfat meal. The authors concluded that divided daily dose 
administration (either every 12 or 6 hours) increases exposure to posaconazole under fasting conditions.
 
 
Distribution  
Posaconazole has an apparent volume of distribution of 1774 L, suggesting extensive extravascular 
distribution and penetration into the body tissues.  
 
Posaconazole is highly protein bound (>98%), predominantly to albumin.  
 
Metabolism  
Posaconazole primarily circulates as the parent compound in plasma. Of the circulating metabolites, the 
majority are glucuronide conjugates formed via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes). Posaconazole 
does not have any major circulating oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites. The excreted metabolites 
in urine and feces account for ~17% of the administered radiolabeled dose.  
5.2.3. Indications and usage  
 
Posaconazole (NO XAFIL® ) is approved by [CONTACT_503415]-versus-host disease and patients with hematological malignancies who are receiving chemotherapy. Posaconazole is also approved for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis including candidiasis Refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole [29].   
Dose and duration of therapy for each indication are summarized below:  
Indication   Dose and duration  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2.4. Formulation and labeling  
Posaconazole is supplied as a 40-mg/mL oral suspension in 4-ounce amber bottles (3). Each dose of 
posaconazole should be given with a full meal or liquid nutritional supplement to enhance absorption. If a patient cannot tolerate feedings, alternative antif ungals should be considered. 
 Prophylaxis of Invasive 
Fungal Infections  200 mg (5 mL) three times a day. The 
duration of therapy is based on recovery 
from neutropenia or immunosuppression. 
Oropharyngeal 
Candidiasis Loading dose of 100 mg (2.5 mL) twice a 
day on the first day, then 100 mg (2.5 
mL) once a day for 13 days. 
Oropharyngeal 
Candidiasis Refractory to 
itraconazole and/or 
fluconazole  400 mg (10 mL) twice a day. Duration of 
therapy should be based on the severity of 
the patient's underlying disease and 
clinical response.

5.2.5. Adverse events  
Raad and associates collected the overall long-term safety data of posaconazole in 428 patients with 
IFIs and 66 patients with fever and neutropenia [31-32]. Overall, treatment- related adverse effects 
were reported in 38% of patients. The most common adverse drug effects reported were nausea (8%) 
and vomiting (6%). Treatment-related prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) occurred in 1% of patients, and 2% of patients had elevated hepatic enzymes. Overall, the long- term safety of 
posaconazole of six months or longer revealed a favorable adverse-effect profile in seriously ill immunocompromised patients.  In clinical reports, the tolerability of posaconazole was acceptable and comparable to other triazoles. [11]
 Common adverse events included fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, 
headache, and fatigue.  Some of the less common but more notable events reported with posaconazole administration included hypokalemia, rash, anemia, thrombo -cytopenia, and QTc prolongation.
 
 
In clinical trials, there were infrequent cases of hepatic reactions (e.g., mild to moderate elevations in 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and/or c linical hepatitis).  Rarely, more severe 
hepatic reactions including cholestasis or hepatic failure including fatalities were reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic malignancies) during treatment with posaconazole. Liver function tests should be monitored at the start of and during the course of 
therapy.  
5.2.6. Drug interactions  
Posaconazole has been shown to interact with several medications, including drugs that suppress the 
immune system, and these reactions may be serious [29].  
Co-administration with sirolimus or ergot alkaloids is contraindicated. Co- administration with the 
CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], halofantrine, or quinidine, is also 
contraindicated since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, 
leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. 
Serious and rare fatal toxicity from cyclosporine has occurred when taken in combination with 
Posaconazole and therefore reduction of the dose of drugs like cyclosporine or tacrolimus and 
frequent monitoring of drug levels of these medications are necessary when taking them in 
combination with Posaconazole 
5.2.7. Dosage and administration 
All patients will receive posaconazole 400mg twice daily. Each dose will be administered with a 
carbonated beverage or high fat nutritional supplement as tolerated to maximize absorption.  
5.2.8. Dose adjustments  
No dose adjustments will be made during the course of the trial without an IRB-approved, protocol modification.

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN
 
7.1. Recruitment  
Candidates for the study will be identified at the outpatient Leukemia Clinic during the evaluation 
visit prior to admission or upon admission for induction Chemotherapy. The RSA and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]- PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_503399].  Patients may sign consent for the study during their outpatient visit or upon admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_503400].  An estimated 7 -10 patients per month are admitted to undergo induction 
or re-induction ch emotherapy. We estimate to accrue 2-3 patients per month. We estimate to 
complete the study in 4 years .

9.0  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
9.1 Treatment Plan  
 
After signing informed consent patients will be randomized to micafungin or posaconazole. The randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_503416].   Micafungin will start one day after completing induction chemotherapy and will be administered at approximately the same time each day of tr eatment. Micafungin will be administered as per MSKCC 
guidelines.   Posaconazole will start one day after completing induction chemotherapy and will be administered at approximately the same times each day of treatment.  Ten ml of Posaconazole solution (40mg/mL) will be administered orally twice daily with fatty snack or a nutritional supplement or a carbonated beverage (such as ginger ale).  
  The study drug will continue for maximum of 4 weeks or until an absolute neutrophil count of >500/mm
3 for 2 consecutive days, systemic antifungal therapy (AmBisome) for > [ADDRESS_648257].   If the patient develops clinically suspected or documented fungal infection the study drug will be discontinued and the patient will start antifungal therapy with AmBisome as per MSKCC guidelines. The evaluations to establish diagnosis of fungal infection are outlined in section 10.  
9.2 Toxicity  
The study drug will be discontinued if any of the following toxicities occur AND are thought by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_503401].    
• Hepatic toxicity: ALT or AST exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal or 3x above 
baseline.  
 
• Cutaneous toxicity: A skin rash can occasionally occur.  This ordinarily will not constitute grounds for discontinuation of study drug unless there is skin necrosis or ulceration or 
generalized exfoliative dermatitis.  
 
• Cardiac toxicity: If a significant arrhythmia or prolongation of QT occurs, study medication 
must be held, and the subject must undergo further assessment by a cardiologist to evaluate 
the significance of the findings. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503402], study drug can be resumed. Otherwise, the patient will be withdrawn from study treatment.   Routine EKG monitoring is not part of the standard of care for patients on 
posaconazole. EKGs will be obtained at the discretion of the treating physician when clinically indicated or when the patient requires additional medications known to cause QT 
prolongation alone or given concomitantly with posaconazole (for example quinolones or macrolides).

interruption of study drug interruption while the cause of toxicity is being investigated.  During study drug interruption patient will receive AmBisome 3mg/kg IV daily. If the same toxicity recurs after the patient resumes the study drug the primary end point of clinical failure is met and the study drug will be discontinued.  There will be no dose adjustment of study medications for toxicity. 
 
10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION
  
Day 1 through Week 4  
The following assessments will be performed bi-weekly on two non-consecutive days, preferably 
three days apart (e.g., Mondays and Thursdays). A flowchart of study procedures and assessments is provided in section 10. 
1. Administration of antifungal medications 
 
2. Vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, body weight, and pulse rate. Interim 
history and directed physical exam. The physical exam should focus on organs 
systems that are clinically relevant in the setting of invasive fungal infections. 
3.  Adverse event recording   
4. Blood tests

13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the US FDA 
Regulations, a patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to his/her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. The Investigator also has the right to 
withdraw patients from the study (see below). Should a patient (or a patient’s legally authorized 
representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as 
thoroughly as possible. 
 A complete final evaluation will be made at the time of the patient’s withdrawal with an explanation of why 
the patient is withdrawing, and an attempt should be made to perform a follow-up evaluation. 
 
Patients may be removed from study if one or more of the following events occur: 
 
• Significant noncompliance on the part of the patient 
• Refusal of the patient to continue treatment or observations 
• Unacceptable toxicity  
• Progressive disease that in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_503405] 
•  Decision by [CONTACT_309655]’s best medical interest 
• Unrelated medical illness or complication 
• Lost to follow-up.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
This is a single center randomized open label trial to compare micafungin to posaconazole for prevention of 
fungal infection in high risk patients treated for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome at MSKCC. 
Target accrual is 114 patients (57 patients per treatment arm. We anticipate accrual of approximately 2-3 
patients per month and hence accrual should be completed in 4 years . 
The primary objectives of the trial are to compare the rates of clinical failure between the two treatment arms. Clinical fai lure is defined as any of the following: systemic antifungal therapy for >3 days, drug 
discontinuation due to an adverse event or death. We will compare time from start of prophylaxis to need for systemic therapy in the two arms using a log- rank. 
On the basis of the prior multicenter, randomized prophylactic trial of posaconazole the rate of clinical failure for posaconazole is estimated at 40-50%. Patients who receive > 1 dose of study drug will be included in the 
intent to treat analyses. Randomized patie nts who receive ≤ [ADDRESS_648267] absolute differences of approximately 25% (e.g., 15% 
versus 40% in proportion of clinical failure in the two groups with approximately 80% power and a 
significance level of 5% using a two- tailed test.   A stratified chi-square test will used to compare the two 
groups (stage of disease ie newly diagnosed AML/ ALL/MDS or AML in first relapse.   Due to the low event 
rates for secondary endpoints such as proven infection, rate of discontinuation, and toxicity, rates will be estimated by [CONTACT_2939].  Comparisons between arms will be performed if numbers permit.. If many 
patients die before the landmark time a then a cumulative incidence function will be utilized to estimate the 
rates at 6 and 12 weeks. The number and proportion of clinically successful patients will be computed per 
treatment along with a 95% confidence interval.   Overall survival will be estimated v ia Kaplan -Meier 
methodology. All patients will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_648268].

Patients will be 1:1 randomized to the two arms. Randomization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_503422]/MDS or AML in first relapse.  
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
This is a single institution trial and all patients will be treated at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer 
Center. A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to this study. The responsibilities of the 
RSA include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of the protocol study team. The data manager will also monitor laboratory compliance throughout the study. Laboratory data will be tabulated and summarized based on MSKCC normal ranges.  The data collected for this study will be entered into the MSKCC Clinical Research Data Base (CRDB).  
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
Registration reports will be generated by [CONTACT_108546] a regular basis to monitor patient accruals and completeness of the registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action. Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has established standard procedures for 
data safety monitoring of clinical research (see Data and Safety Monitoring Plans).

16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_28129] (NCI) in September 2001. The plans address the new policies set forth by [CONTACT_108547] “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety 
Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html
. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Int ranet at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm
.  
 During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (i.e. NIH sponsored, in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed and 
the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation
.

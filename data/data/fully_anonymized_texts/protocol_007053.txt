Syndromes  
Primary  Objective:  Best overall  response  rate (CR + marrow  CR + PR + HI) of 
Selinexor  in patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes  refractory  
to hypomethylating  agents  
Secondary  • To  determine   response  duration   in  patients   with  MDS   who 
Objectives:  achieve  a response  of stable  disease,  HI, mCR,  PR, CR. 
• To describe  the frequency  of Stable  Disease  
• To describe  survival  of MDS  patients  receiving  Selinexor   after 
study  enrollment  
• To assess  the response  rate and response  duration  in therapy - 
related  MDS  
• To assess  tolerability   of chronic  Selinexor   therapy  in patients  
with Myelodysplastic   Syndromes  
• To determine  the pharmacodynamics  (PDn)  of Selinexor  
Study  Design  • Single -center,  non-randomized,  open -label,  single -arm phase  
II study  of oral Selinexor  
• 
Patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes  who are refractory

Pharmacodynamic  
Assessments: Pharmacodynamic  studies  will be obtained  to study  the effects  of 
Selinexor  on signalling  pathways  which  affect  cellular  growth  and 
differentiation.  
Efficacy Assessment Efficacy  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_844701][INVESTIGATOR_710666],  complete  blood  counts,  and transfusion  records.  
Hematologic  Improvement  will be assessed  continuously,  with the 
use of CBC  values  and transfusion  records.  At the time of bone  
marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_844670],  full efficacy  evaluations  will be 
performed,  taking  into account  blood  and bone  marrow  
parameters,  and responses  will be assessed  using  the 2006  
Modified   MDS  International   Working  Group  Response  Criteria.  
Safety  Variables  & 
Analysis:  The safety  and tolerability  of Selinexor  and ST will be evaluated  
by [CONTACT_844702],  physical  examinations,  and 
laboratory  safety  evaluations.   Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  V4.03  will be used  for grading  of AEs. 
Investigators  will provide  their assessment  of causality  as 1) 
unrelated,  2) possibly  related,  or 3) probably  or definitely  related  
for all AEs. 
Statistical  Analysis:  Primary  endpoint  evaluation  
 
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to investigate  the efficacy  of 
Selinexor  in patients  with MDS  refractory  to hypomethylating  
agents  (decitabine  and/or  5-azacytidine).  The standard  treatment  
in this setting  is supportive  care,  where  the response  rate is 
assumed  to be zero.  Therefore,  in this population,  a response  
rate of 25% would  be considered  promising,  whereas  a 5% 
response  rate would  not be considered  promising.  For purposes  
of assessing  the primary  endpoint,  response  categories  will 
include  CR, PR, marrow  CR (mCR),  or Hematologic  
Improvement.  Using  a Simon’s  two-stage  minimax  design,  this 
trial will accrue  a maximum  of [ADDRESS_1173891]-treatment  disease  assessment

CBC  with differential)  after 1 cycle  of therapy.  For patients  who 
come  off study  after completing  1 cycle  of therapy  and are unable  
to undergo  (or refuse)  a bone  marrow  procedure,  an assessment  
for Hematologic  Improvement  (based  on CBC  data)  will be 
performed  and described  and an attempt  will be made  to obtain  
follow -up CBC  data for the 8 weeks  mandated  to confirm  
Hematologic  Improvement  according  to the MDS  International  
Working  Group  response  criteria.  Patients  who come  off study  
after starting  study  drug because  of toxicity,  death,  or withdrawal  
of consent  prior to undergoing  a response  assessment  will not be 
replaced  and will be considered  a treatment  failure.  Patients  who 
enroll  on study  but do not receive  study  therapy  will be replaced.  
 
Analysis   of secondary  endpoints  
 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  include  response  duration,  as well 
as an assessment  of the incidence  of Stable  Disease,  given  the 
finding  that Stable  Disease  is associated  with a survival  benefit  in 
MDS  patients  receiving  up-front therapy  with 5-azacytidine.  The 
response  rate and response  duration  will also be described  for 
the generally  poor-risk therapy -related  MDS  patients  enrolled  on 
this study  (therapy -related  MDS  accruals  may approach  ~ 50%,  
as seen  in MSKCC  protocol  06-054).  
Survival  will be described  as a secondary  endpoint,  and will be 
calculated  from the time of study  entry.  Also,  since  Selinexor  may 
require  chronic  dosing  to maintain  its effect,  we will also describe  
the overall  tolerability  of chronic  Selinexor  dosing  by [CONTACT_844703] 1 dose  of Selinexor.  
Descriptive  statistics  will be used  to explore  the relationship  
between  therapeutic  response  or study  entry  disease  parameters,  
and the results  of the pharmacodynamics  studies.

3.[ADDRESS_1173892]  inactivate  their tumor  suppressor  proteins  (TSPs)  in order  to perpetuate  their 
neoplastic  phenotype.  TSPs  require  nuclear  localization  in order  to function.  Like most  proteins,  
TSPs  are shuttled  into the nucleus  by [CONTACT_844704],  and they are carried  out of 
the nucleus  by [CONTACT_844705].  Exportin  1 (XPO1),  also called  CRM1,  is one of seven  major  nuclear  
exporters  responsible  for carrying  ~220  cargo  proteins  out of the nucleus  into the cytoplasm.   Nearly  
all TSPs  are transported  out of the nucleus  exclusively  by [CONTACT_67990]1.  Furthermore,  XPO1  is 
overexpressed  by 2-4 fold in nearly  all cancer  cells,  and its levels  correlate  with poor prognosis  
and/or  chemotherapy  resistance.  Current  research  suggests  that cancer  cells have co-opted  XPO1  
in order  to neutralize  their TSPs.  
Selinexor  (KPT -330) is a small  molecule,  drug-like, orally  available  Selective  Inhibitor   of Nuclear  
Export  (SINE)  compound  that is a slowly  reversible  covalent  antagonist  of XPO1.   By [CONTACT_844706]1,  Selinexor  induces  the accumulation  of TSPs  in the cell nucleus,  leading  to activation  of their 
tumor  suppressing  function.   Cells  with marked   genomic  (DNA)  damage,  including  cancer  cells,  
undergo  apoptotic  cell death;  normal  cells,  with little or no genomic  damage,  undergo  transient,  
reversible  cell cycle  arrest.  Consistent  with its novel  mechanism  of broadly  inducing  TSP function,  
Selinexor  has shown  broad  anti-tumor  in preclinical  mouse  models  and spontaneous  canine  
cancers.  Selinexor  is currently  being  studied  in three  Phase  [ADDRESS_1173893]  of Selinexor  on patients  with MDS.  
3.1 Selinexor: Mechanism of Action and Preclinical Summary 
 
A brief summary  of key aspects  the preclinical  evaluation  of Selinexor  is presented  below.   Further  
detailed  information  is provided  in the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
Selinexor  is an orally  available,   irreversible,  potent  and Selective  Inhibitor  of Nuclear  Export  (SINE)  
that specifically  blocks  XPO1.   Selinexor  restores  many  of the TSP and other  growth  regulatory  
proteins  to the nucleus  where  they can carry  out their normal  functions.   It is selectively  cytotoxic  for 
cells with  genomic  damage,  i.e., for tumor  cells,  both in vitro and in vivo.  All cell types  exposed  to 
SINE  in vitro undergo  G1 ± G2 cell cycle  arrest,  followed  by a ‘genomic  fidelity’  review,  and cells with 
significant  genomic  (DNA)  damage  are induced  to undergo  apoptosis.   Normal  cells,  with minimal  or 
no DNA damage,  remain  in transient,  reversible  cell cycle  arrest  until the export  block  is relieved.  
Selinexor  and other  SINE  compounds  are not intrinsically  cytotoxic;  rather,  they can restore  the 
highly  effective  tumor  suppressing  pathways  that lead to selective  elimination  of genomically  
damaged  (i.e., neoplastic)  cells.   Tumors  of hematopoietic  lineage  are particularly  susceptible  to 
induction  of apoptosis  by [CONTACT_67990]1  inhibition;  normal  hematopoietic  cells and their functions  are largely  
spared.

Preclinical  Safety  
 
Sprague -Dawley  rats and cynomolgus  monkeys  were  chosen  as the toxicology  species  for the 
selinexor  nonclinical  safety  program.   In both species,  the primary  effects  of oral Selinexor  were  
dose-dependent  reductions  in food intake  and body weight  (or reductions  in body weight  gain),  with 
minimal  clinical  symptoms  (no or mild non-bloody  diarrhea),  associated  primarily  with 
gastrointestinal  atrophy.   Similar  effects  are observed  in mice  and dogs.   At high repeated  doses  of 
Selinexor  associated  with marked  weight  loss, there  were  changes  in cerebellar  granular  layer 
neurons  in both rats (≥300  mg/m2) and monkeys  (≥72 mg/m2), but only monkeys  showed  any CNS 
symptoms.  No central  nervous  system  (CNS) -related  adverse  side effects  were  observed  in the 
GLP,  rat and monkey  4-cycle  toxicity  studies.  A GLP,  rat neurofunctional  study  (Irwin  test) has also 
been  performed  at dose  levels  of 12, 60, or 300 mg/m2  (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg).   No behavioral  
changes  were  observed  at all doses  tested.  
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735],  GLP,  4-week  monkey  study,  there  was no evidence  of a direct  or indirect  effect  of 
Selinexor  on the morphology  and intervals  of the ECG  at up to 36 mg/m2  (3 mg/kg).   Based  on 
these  results,  QT prolongation  or other  cardiac  effect  does not appear  to be a safety  concern  for 
Selinexor.  
In summary,  dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)/mortality  in both rats and monkeys  is related  primarily  to 
marked  weight  loss with atrophy  of the gastrointestinal  (GI) tract and noncritical  effects  on other  
major  organs.  
Preclinical  Efficacy  
 
In vitro experiments  with continuous  (~72 hour)  exposure  to Selinexor  demonstrated  potent  pro- 
apoptotic  activity  across  a broad  panel  of tumor -derived  cell lines and patient  samples  in culture  
including  multiply -resistant  cancers,  with the majority  of IC50s  for cytotoxicity  <[ADDRESS_1173894],  normal  cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_844671] (or remained in) cell cycle arrest but were resistant to apop tosis-induction; cytotoxicity 
IC50s  were  typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  >[ADDRESS_1173895]  on normal  (nonmalignant)  
lymphocytes  or other  nontransformed  cells,  which  correlated  with the low incidence  in animals  of the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_844672]-cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844673],  
alopecia,  mucositis  and other  gastrointestinal  (GI) dysfunction.  
Selinexor  and other  SINE  analogs  have been  administered  in efficacy  studies  to mice  and dogs and 
in toxicology  studies  to rats and monkeys.  Efficacy  was demonstrated  in mouse  models of myeloma,  
mantle  cell lymphoma  (MCL),  and T-cell acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (T-ALL) xenografts.   Moreover,  
efficacy  including  significant  survival  advantages  was demonstrated  in acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  
[MV4 -11  (FLT3 -ITD)]  (Ranganathan  2012,  Etchin  2012)  and chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL)  
(TCL -1) leukemografts.   Efficacy  was also demonstrated  in solid tumor  xenografts  including   
prostate,  breast,  liver, glioblastoma,  kidney  and colon  cancers.

Karypoharm  Therapeutics,  Inc. (subsequently  referred  to as Karyopharm)  is currently  conducting  
three  open  label Phase  [ADDRESS_1173896] study  (KCP -330-001) is in patients  with advanced  
hematological  malignancies,  the second  (KCP -330-002) is in patients  with advanced  or metastatic  
solid tumor  malignancies  and the third (KCP -330-003),  a food effect  study,  is in patients  who have 
metastatic,  locally  advanced  or locally  recurrent  soft tissue  or bone  sarcomas.  All patients  entering  
these  single -agent  phase  [ADDRESS_1173897]  study  was initiated  in July 2013,  so preliminary  safety  or efficacy  data is not yet available.  
KCP-330-001 is a dose  escalation  study  in patients  with advanced  hematologic  malignancies.   KCP- 
330-002 is a dose  escalation  study  in patients  with advanced  metastatic  solid tumors.   Dose  
escalation  began  at 3mg/m2 given  at 10 doses  per cycle  (Monday/Wednesday/Friday  on weeks  1 
and 3; Monday/Wednesday  on weeks  2 and 4).  The dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  were  
anorexia/nausea  and fatigue  at 40mg/m2 (10 times  per 4-week  cycle)  in KCP-330-002 and the 
maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  was 30mg/m2. Based  on similar  adverse  events  in KCP-330-001, 
escalation  beyond  30mg/m2  (10 times  per cycle)  was not performed.  The recommended  phase  2 
dose  (RP2D)  for 10 times  per cycle  dosing  is 30mg/m2. Reduced  intensity  dosing  at twice  weekly  (8 
times  per cycle,  Days  1 & 3 of each  week)  has shown  improved  tolerability.   Dose  escalation  on this 
schedule  in KCP-330-002 is ongoing;  Dose  level 50mg/m2 cleared  DLT.   Escalation  on this twice - 
weekly  schedule  in KCP-330-001 is currently  proceeding  at 55mg/m2. In patients  with relapsed  AML,  
escalation  is currently  ongoing  at 50mg/m2 on the twice  weekly  schedule.

Advanced  Hematological  Malignancies  
This study  includes  patients  with relapsed  and refractory  hematologic  malignancies.  KPT-330 is 
orally  administered  in escalating  dose  levels  at 10 doses/cycle  (Schedules  1and  2) or 8 doses/cycle  
(Schedule  3) as follows:  
• Schedules  1 and 2: selinexor  is administrated  PO 3 times  a week  every  other  day for weeks  
1 and 3 (QoDx3/wk).  For weeks  2 and 4, drug is dosed  on days 1 and 3 of each  week  (BIW).  
One cycle  is 28 days or 10 doses.  At doses  > 12mg/m2,  a “run in” week  at 12 mg/m2  
QoDx3/wk  precedes  Cycle  1 (10 doses  per 4 weeks);  this 10-dose  regimen  with the run-in 
week  is designated  Schedule  2. 
 
• Schedule  3: selinexor  is administrated  PO on days 1 and 3 of each  week  (BIW).  One cycle  
is 28 days or 8 doses.  
 
There  are three  Arms  to this study:  Arm 1 includes  patients  with the relatively  indolent  hematologic  
malignancies  multiple  myeloma  (MM),  Waldenström’s  Macroglobulinemia  (WM), Non-Hodgkin’s  
Lymphoma  (NHL)  and chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL).  Arm 2 includes  patients  with acute  
myeloid  leukemia  (AML).  Because  of the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_844674],  Arm 2 began  dosing  at 
16.8mg/m2  after dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  clearance  in cohort  3 (12 mg/m2)  and initiation  of

16.8mg/m2  dosing  in Arm 1, i.e., in the indolent  hematologic  malignancy  patients.  Arm 3 includes  up 
to 12 patients  with refractory  PTCL  or CTCL  treated  at a dose  of 30mg/m2  on Schedule  3. No 
patients  have been  enrolled  in this Arm to date.  All patients  entered  study  with documented  disease  
progression  having  relapsed  following  all proven  and many  experimental  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Intrapatient   dose  
escalation  is permitted  once  patients  have cleared  the next higher  dose  cohort.  
Arm 1: As of 01-July-2013,  a total of 38 patients  on Arm 1 (17 MM, 2 WM, 15 NHL and 4 CLL)  have 
been  enrolled  at doses  ranging  from 3 to 30 mg/m2  on Schedule  1 and 2 (10 doses/cycle).  As of 01- 
July-2013,  [ADDRESS_1173898] been  enrolled  at 35 mg/m2  on Schedule  3. The maximum  tolerated  dose  
(MTD)  has not yet been  reached  in this Arm, and as of 11/11/13  (personal  communication  with John 
McCartney,  Karyopharm)  dose  level 40mg/m2 had not produced  DLT and dosing  is proceeding  at 
55mg/m2 on schedule  3 (BIW  dosing).  
Arm 2: As of 01-July-2013,  a total of 27 patients  on Arm 2 (AML)  have been  enrolled,  all refractory to  
standard  therapy  (median  number  of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  = 2; range  1-7), including  hypomethylating  
agents,  and treated  at doses  ranging  from 16.8 mg/m2  to 30 mg/m2  on Schedule  2 (13 doses/cycle)  
and at a dose  of 30 mg/m2  on Schedule  3. Three  patients  achieved  a complete  response  (CR)  
without  hematologic  recovery  and one patient  achieved  CR with recovery  of ANC and platelets.  No 
DLTs  were  observed  in these  cohorts  and MTD has not yet been  reached.  As of 01-July-2013,  no 
clinically  significant  cumulative  drug toxicities  have been  observed  in either  Arm1  or Arm 2, with 5 
patients  on study  for >6 months.  Currently,  dosing  is proceeding  at 50 mg/m2 on schedule  3 (BIW  
dosing).

Escalating  Doses  of the Selective  Inhibitor  of Nuclear  Export  (SINE)  KPT-330 in Patients  with 
Advanced  or Metastatic  Solid  Tumor  Malignancies  
This study  includes  patients  with advanced,  refractory  solid tumors.  Selinexor)  is orally  administered  
in escalating  dose  levels  at 10 or 13 doses/cycle  (Schedules  1 and 2) or 8 doses/cycle  (Schedule  3) 
as described  above  for study  KCP-330-001. 
As of 01-July-2013  68 patients  received  selinexor  across 7  dose  levels  (3 to 40 mg/m2)  on Schedule  
1 and two dose  levels  in Schedule  2 (35 and 40 mg/m2).  Dosing  at 50 mg/m2 on Schedule  3 (BIW)  
was completed  without  DLT as of 11/11/13  (11/11/13  personal  communication  with John McCartney,  
Karyopharm).  
No DLTs  were  observed  in the initial  six cohorts  at doses  ranging  from 3 to 30 mg/m2  on Schedule  
1/2. Two DLTs  were  observed  out of 3 patients  at 40 mg/m2:  one was Grade  3 anorexia  with 
dehydration  and fatigue,  the other  was Grade  3 fatigue  with Grade  1-2 anorexia.  Although  neither  of 
these  patients  with DLTs  received  optimal  supportive  care/medications  (such  as anti nausea,  
appetite  stimulators  and glucocorticoids),  given  the entire  clinical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103],  the decision  was made  to 
declare  30 mg/m2  the MTD for solid tumor  patients  treated  on Schedules  1/2, and both of these  
patients  with DLTs  had their doses  reduced  from 40 mg/m2  to 30 mg/m2.  A third patient  treated  at 
40 mg/m2  on Schedule  2 tolerated  therapy  well, but given  the other  patients,  her dose  was reduced

to 30mg/m2  as well. Twelve  (12) additional  patients  were  enrolled  at this dose  as part of the 
expansion  phase  on Schedule  2. 
Six patients  were  treated  at 35 mg/m2  on Schedule  3. One DLT of Grade  3 nausea/vomiting,  with 
fatigue  was observed  in patient  (043-101) with melanoma  who had concomitant  C. difficile  infection;  
this patient  also had a partial  response  on CT scan  after [ADDRESS_1173899] cleared  DLT assessment  in cycle  1 at 40 mg/m2  on Schedule  3 (July 25, 2013),  
and dose  escalation  to 50 mg/m2  is has opened.  Based  on the data to date,  the Phase  2 
recommended  starting  dose  was determined  as 35 mg/m2  on Schedule  3 and 18 patients  were  
enrolled  to the study  as part of the expansion  phase  on Schedule  3. Patients  who tolerate  35 mg/m2  
on Schedule  [ADDRESS_1173900] their doses  escalated  to 40 mg/m2  if requested  by [CONTACT_763523].  
Interim  KCP-330-002 study  results  were  presented  at the 2013  ASCO  annual  meeting  (Razak,  
2013).  
Preliminary  evidence  of clinical  activity  was appreciated  in study  KCP-330-002. One patient  (043- 
805) with K-ras mutant  colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  treated  with all approved  agents  (except  
regorafenib)  showed  a partial  response  (PR) by [CONTACT_393]  1.[ADDRESS_1173901] also shown  reduction  in tumor  mass,  CEA 
levels,  and/or  ascites,  on study  for >4 months  (043-001, 043-014, 043-016).  Patients  with cervical  
cancer  have shown  stable  disease  for ≥6 months  (043-002, 043-007).  Two patients  with squamous  
cell cancers  of the head  and neck region  have shown  stable  disease  (043-804, 043-013).  
 
 
Phase  1 safety  data for selinexor  
 
For the two ongoing  clinical  trials (KCP -330-001 and KCP-330-002),  a total of 97 patients  comprise

Blurry  vision  has been  reported  on this and the accompanying  study  KCP-330-002. The etiology  of 
the blurry  vision  is not known,  and no objective  ophthalmological  correlates  have been  observed.  
Dehydration  leading  to changes  in the refractive  index  in the lens may be involved.  Two of these  
cases have responded  to changes  in lens prescription,  and all of the cases have resolved  or are

Escalating  Doses  of the Selective  Inhibitor  of Nuclear  Export  (SINE)  KPT-330 in Patients  with 
Advanced  or Metastatic  Solid  Tumor  Malignancies  
The patients  (N=50)  compromising  the current  safety  population  were  treated  at escalated  protocol  
doses  of 3-40 mg/m2  on Schedule  1 or 2 and at 35-40 mg/m2  on Schedule  3. A summary  of the

Therefore,  the primary  side effects  of selinexor  in doses  up to 40 mg/m2 on Schedules  1 (10 doses  
per cycle)  and up to 50 mg/m2 3 on schedule  3 (BIW  or 8 doses  per cycle)  are reversible  anorexia,  
weight  loss and fatigue  which  responds  to aggressive  supportive  care measures.  These  side effects  
have been  considerably  more  prominent  in weeks  1 and 3 when  patients  receive  3 doses  (M/W/F)  
as compared  with weeks  2 and 4 when  patients  receive  2 doses  only (M/W).  These  observations  
have led to the current  amendment  for twice  weekly  dosing  schedule  in planned  phase  [ADDRESS_1173908]  supportive  care measures.

Clinical  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Detailed  pharmacokinetic  (PK) and pharmacodynamic  (PDn)  analyses  and serial  tumor  biopsies  
were  performed  in both studies  and suggested  a fairly proportional  increase  in Cmax  and AUC with 
increasing  dose,  with no accumulation  and without  affecting  half-life or clearance  of Selinexor.  At 30 
mg/m2, AUC 0-last. (4375  ng*h/mL)  was comparable  to the anti-tumor  exposure  observed  in mice  and 
dogs.   Tmax  (~3 h) and T1/2 (6-7 h) were  consistent  across  doses.   Significant  increase  (2-20x) in 
XPO1  messenger  ribonucleic  acid (mRNA)  levels  (PDn  marker)  in circulating  leukocytes  was 
observed  at all doses,  with higher  doses  demonstrating  higher  levels  of XPO1  mRNA  induction.  
Analysis  of tumor  biopsies  confirmed  nuclear  localization  of TSPs  (e.g., p53, FOXO3A,  IκB) and 
apoptosis  of cancer  cells following  selinexor  administration.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1173909] demonstrated  striking  anti-leukemic  activity  in acute  lymphoblastic  
leukemia  and acute  myelogenous  leukemia  for selinexor  and similar,  earlier  compounds  (Etchin,  
2013)  with little effect  on normal  hematopoetic  cells or myelosuppression.  In an ongoing  phase  1 
study,  the dose  of selinexor  was escalated  starting  at 3 mg/m2 in patients  with solid tumors,  multiple  
myeloma,  lymphoma,  and leukemia.  Activity  has been  noted  in a variety  of malignancies,  including  
multiple  myeloma,  lymphoma,  and leukemia.  
Therapy -related  MDS/AML  and poor risk de novo  MDS/AML  is characterized  by [CONTACT_844707]  p53 (20-30% as we have shown  in therapy -related  MDS/AML  and 5- 
10% in de novo  MDS/AML)(Shih,  2013).  We have also noted  that both p53 alleles  may be mutated

and/or  lost, but in this situation,  the related  TSP p73 can be engaged  (Mass  2011).  XPO1  blockade  
forces  p53 and p73 nuclear  retention  and, even in cells harboring  only one p53wt  allele,  activates  its 
downstream  cell cycle  regulatory  and apoptotic  functions  (Turner  2012).  However,  upregulated  
XPO1 can also promote  p53 “mislocalization”  and dysfunction  in cancer  cells even in the absence  of 
mutation  or allele  loss. 
NFkB  is also an important  pathway  in MDS/AML.  The NFkB  pathway  is activated  in MDS/AML  as it  
is in other  malignancies,  as a means  to enhance  proliferation.  Inhibition  of NFkB  by [CONTACT_844708],  and it’s use is being  explored  in AML 
(and MDS).  We and others  have shown  that inhibition  of NFkB  leads  to apoptosis  in MDS/AML  using  
sodium  salicylate  (Disalcid)  (Klampfer,  1999).  Upregulation   of NFkB  is associated  with  
chemotherapy  resistance  in AML (and MDS)  due to either  constitutive  activation  or chemotherapy - 
induced  upregulation,  Therefore,  inhibition  of NFkB  may be effective,  particularly for MDS  or AML 
which  can have constitutive  or induced  (during  chemotherapy  administration)  NFkB  upregulation,  
thereby  [CONTACT_844709].  Blockade  of XPO1  prevents  export  of I-қp from the 
nucleus,  and was shown  to induce  long term inhibition  of NF-қB activity  (Gupta  2010)  and therefore  
Selinexor  may induce  apoptosis  in MDS  or AML,  and/or  may sensitize  MDS/AML  to standard  
chemotherapy.  
The Wnt signaling  pathway  plays  a role in the maintenance  of hematopoetic  stem  cells.  Upregulated  
Wnt signaling  results  in accumulation  of nuclear  non-phosphorylated  beta catenenin,  leading  to 
activation  of MYC and CCND1  and is therefore  known  to be oncogenic.  Nuclear  non-phosphorylated  
beta catenin  was seen  in 18/44  (41%)  of MDS  BM biopsies  and was associated with higher  IPSS  
risk disease,  -7/del(7q)  (poor  risk) karyotypes,  and poor clinical  outcomes  (Xu, 2010).  The effects  of 
interrupted  XPO1  activity  on APC and nuclear  beta catenin  levels  is unclear,  especially  since  beta 
catenin  can also undergo  nuclear -cytoplasmic  shuttling  independent  of APC and XPO1.  However,  
Selienexor  treatment  was shown  to reduce  MYC levels  in myeloma  and HCC  cells.  
Other  clients  for XPO1  which  may be more  relevant  for AML include  FOXO3  and NPM1  as 
discussed  in section  1.1.2.  The effects  of selinexor  on these  TSPs  are being  evaluated  in an 
ongoing  study  of selinexor  in AML.  
Further  information  about  the preclinical  pharmacology  and toxicology  of selinexor  is presented  in 
the Investigator’s   Brochure.  
3.4. Rationale  for dose  and schedule  
 
In general,  selinexor  has been  well tolerated  across  in patients  with advanced  cancer.  Drug  related  
grade  1-2 nausea,  grade  1-2 vomiting  (intermittent,  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_844676]-emetics  or self- 
resolving),  grade  1-[ADDRESS_1173910] been  considerably  more  prominent  in weeks  1 and 3 when  
patients  receive  3 doses  (M/W/F)  as compared  with weeks  2 and 4 when  patients  receive  2 doses  
only (M/W).  
Based  on the observed  better  tolerability  in the twice  weekly  dosing  compared  with 3X/week  dosing,  
an alternative  twice  weekly  schedule  consisting  of 8 doses  / 4 week  cycle  was explored  (referred  to 
as “Schedule  3”).

In the solid tumor  phase  1 study,  six patients  were  treated  at 35 mg/m2 on Schedule  3.  One DLT of 
Grade  3 nausea/  vomiting,  with fatigue  was observed  in patient  (043-101) with melanoma  who had 
concomitant  C. difficile  infection;  this patient  also had a partial  response  on CT scan  after [ADDRESS_1173911] cleared  DLT assessment  in cycle  1 at 40 
mg/m2 on Schedule  3 (July 25, 2013),  and more  recently,  dose  escalation  to 50 mg/m2 has not 
resulted  in dose  limiting  toxicity.  .Based  on the data to date,  the Phase  2 recommended  starting  
dose  was determined  as 35 mg/m2 on Schedule  3 and 18 patients  were  enrolled  to the study  as part 
of the expansion  phase  on Schedule  3. 
In the phase  1 hematologic  malignancies  study,  as of 01-July-2013,  patients  were  enrolled  at doses  
of up to 40 mg/m2 on Schedule  3 without  DLT and dosing  is currently  proceeding  at 55 mg/m  2 
(indolent  hematologic  malignancies  arm) without  DLT.  In the AML arm, MTD was not reached  as of 
July 2013  at a dose  of 30 mg/m2 and 4 CRs were  seen  in AML patients  at doses  below  35 mg/m2 
BIW (CRs seen  at doses  of 16.8-23 mg/m2 on TIW alternating  with BIW schedule).  Dosing  for the 
AML arm (Arm  2) is currently  proceeding  at 50 mg/m2. 
It should  be noted  that no reports  of major  organ  dysfunction  have occurred  to date,  including  in the 
patients  with DLT.  In particular,  there  has been  no clinically  significant  renal,  liver, pancreatic,  
cardiac  or pulmonary  dysfunction.   Moreover,  there  have been  no reports  of central  or peripheral  
neurological  toxicities.   Therefore,  the primary  side effects  of selinexor  in doses  up to 40 mg/m2 on 
Schedules  1 (10 doses  per cycle)  and up to 50 mg/m2 3 (8 doses  per cycle)  are reversible  anorexia,  
weight  loss and fatigue.  
Data from phase  I studies  of selinexor  indicate  that prophylactic  antiemetic  and anti-anorexia  
therapy  imporves  the tolerance  of selinexor.  As a result,  all patients  will take two prophylactic  
medications  during  cycle  1 of Selinexor,  and these  medications  may be tapered  or discontinued  
during  cycle  2 or later in treatment.  See section  9.1.3  for details.  
Given  the improved  tolerability  of twice  weekly  dosing  compared  to three  times  per week  dosing,   
and the activity  in hematologic  malignancies  at and below  70 mg/m  2 per week,  selinexor  for 8 doses  
in a 4 week  cycle  (i.e., 280mg/m2 in 4 weeks)  was the initial  starting  schedule  for this study.  Impaired  
tolerance,  due primarily  to fatigue,  was noted  in the first two patients  enrolled  on this study,  which  is 
the first selinexor  study  in the MDS  population.  This impaired  tolerance  may be due to the advanced  
age of MDS  patients  combined  with the anemia  related  to the MDS.  Therefore,  the dosing  schedule  
was adjusted  to provide  a dosing  break.  Selinexor  will be dosed  twice  per week  for two weeks  
followed  by 1 week  of no therapy.  
Recent  analysis  of the existing  PK data from Phase  1 trials KCP-330-001 and KCP-330-002 
supports  the use of fixed rather  than BSA-based  dosing.  The 5th and 95th percentile  for BSA values  
encountered  to date in Phase  1 trials KCP-330-001 and KCP-330-002 are 1.5 and 2.3 m2, 
respectively  (N=331).  PK values  (Cmax and AUC(0-)) for a given  flat (fixed)  dose  of selinexor  were  
similar  across  this typi[INVESTIGATOR_844677],  indicating  that exposure  is not strongly  correlated  with BSA.  
Basedo  n the analysis  of this PK data,  the recommended  starting  dose  will be changed  to a flat dose  
of 60mg  (~35mg/m2)

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1173912] shown  that both hematologic  and 
solid tumor  cells are susceptible  to single -agent  cytotoxicity  by [CONTACT_159407],  consistent  with its 
restoration  of multiple  tumor  suppressor  gene  functions  and growth  regulatory  pathways  leading  to 
the death  of cancer  cells.  The ongoing  phase  1 study  has demonstrated  the safety  of the proposed  
phase  2 dose  (35 mg/m2) and activity  in hematologic  malignancies  including  MM, NHL and CLL. In a 
separate  arm of the Phase  1 study  heavily  pretreated  elderely  AML patients  were  treated  with 
selinexor  at doses  of 16.8 mg/m2 to 40 mg/m2. Three  patients  achieved  CR (2 with complete  
hematological  recovery  and one bone  marrow  CR without  hemetologic  recovery)  and several  
patients  had stable  diease.   Given  the novel  mechanism  of action,  the rationale  for XPO1  inhibition  
by [CONTACT_844710]/MDS,  and the phase  1 safety  and efficacy  data,  the risk benefit  assessment  
favors  further  development  of selinexor  in hematologic  malignancies,  including  MDS.

Primary  Objective:  
 
• To evaluate  the efficacy  (overall  response  rate: CR+marrow  CR + PR + HI) of 
Selinexor  in patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes  
SecondaryObjectives:  
 
• To determine  response  duration  in patients  with MDS  who achieve  a response  of stable  
disease,  HI, mCR,  PR, CR. 
• To describe  the frequency  of Stable  Disease  
• To describe  survival  of MDS  patients  receiving  selinexor  after study  enrollment  
• To assess  the response  rate and response  duration  in therapy -related  MDS  
• To assess  tolerability   of chronic  Selinexor   therapy   in patients   with Myelodysplastic  
Syndromes.  
• To study  the pharmacodynamics  (PDn)  of Selinexor.  
 
 
4.4 Intervention  
 
4.3.1.  Rationale  for the Study  Design  
 
Various  pathways  which  are aberrantly  suppressed  or activated  in myeloid  malignancies  are 
modulated  by [CONTACT_844711]1.  These  
pathways  modulate  the growth  of myeloid  malignancie  and/or  contribute  to resistance  to therapy  
(eg., NF-kβ). In in vitro studies,  selinexor  induces  apoptosis  in leukemia  cell lines and in primary  
(patient -derived)  AML cultures,  which  is correlated  to nuclear  retention  of tumor  suppressors  which

treatment  option,  and median  survival  is 4-6 months.  
4.3.2.  Study  Design  
 
Selinexor  will be taken  twice  per week  for 2 weeks,  followed  by 1 week  of no therapy.  Disease  
assessments will be performed  after cycle  1 and 2, then every  other  month  therafter  until CR or 
maximal  response  is achieved,  at time of disease  progression  or when  clinically  indicated,  using  the 
Modified   MDS  International   Working  Group  response  criteria.  Treatment  will be allowed  indefinitely,  
barring  disease  progression,  excessive  toxicity,  or withdrawal  of consent.  Pharmacodynamic  studies  
will be performed  at baseline,  cycle  1 day 14 (for first 10 patients),  after cycle  1, 2, and 4 to assess  
the biological  activity  of Selinexor.  A total of 20 adult patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes  will be 
enrolled  into this study.  After treatment  is stopped,  patients  will be followed  indefinitely  every  three  
months  for survival.  The study  will be conducted  at Memorial  Sloan -Ketteriing  Cancer  Center.  
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
Product:    Selinexor  (KPT -330) 
 
Classification : Cell biological  modifier:  Apoptosis -inducing  agent  
 
Mechanism  of action : Selinexor  is a Selective  Inhibitor  of Nuclear  Export  (SINE)  that specifically

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.1. Treatment Plan 
 
9.1.1.  Treatment Dose  and Schedule  
 
The starting  dose  of selinexor  will be 60mg  (PO)  2 times  a week  (+/- 1 day) with at least 36 hours  
between  doses.  Selinexor  will be given  for 2 weeks,  followed  by 1 week  of no therapy.  The 
scheduled  dosing  days should  be the same  days in each  week.   One cycle  is 21 days or 4 doses  
(plus 1 week  off). The drug administration  days will occur  on the same  days within  a cycle  (ie 
Tue/Thu)  but may be adjusted  as needed  from cycle  to cyle. Dosing  is not required  to start on Day 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -005 A(17)

26  
  
 
#1 of a given  cycle,  which  will coincide  with the patient’s  clinic  visit. Depending  on patient  preference  
for dosing  days,  and given  the need  to have results  from day #1 laboratory  evaluations,  dosing  can 
begin  on days 1, 2, or 3 of a given  cycle,  but preferentially  with consistency  from one cycle  to next. 
Patients  will be required  to keep a drug dosing  diary and symptom  diary.  Doses  should  be taken  at 
roughly  the same  time of day (morning,  afternoon,  or evening  hours),  ensuring there  is at least [ADDRESS_1173925]  and drug 
accountability  logs for verification  with the reasons.  The investigator  / designee  will try to ensure  
complete  compliance  with the dosing  schedule  by [CONTACT_844717].  
 
Dose  reductions  are allowed  as decribed  in section  9.2 (Table  1). 
 
Patients  who come  off study  after starting  study  drug because  of toxicity,  death,  or withdrawal  of 
consent  prior to undergoing  a response  assessment  will not be replaced  and will be considered  a 
treatment  failure.  Patients  who enroll  on study  but do not receive  study  therapy  will be replaced.  
9.1.2.  Treatment Duration  
 
Patients  may continue  on study  indefinitely  if they are experiencing  clinical  benefit,  barring  
progression  of disease,  excessive  toxicity,or  withdrawal  of consent.  After discontinuation  from 
treatment,  patients  will be followed  by [CONTACT_844718].  
 
 
 
9.2 Dosing Adjustments 
 
Toxicity  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE,  version  4.03;  the therapy  modifications  described  
below  are applied  according  to this severity  grading.  
If more  than one different  type of toxicity  occurs  concurrently,  the most  severe  grade  will determine  
the modification.  
Re-escalation  of the study  drug is allowed  as outlined  in the sections  that apply  for the specific  
toxicity.  If drug-related  toxicity  requires  a treatment  delay  of more  than [ADDRESS_1173926]  be documented,  including  the respective  reason.  
 
Based  on observations  from the ongoing  Phase  1 studies  in patients  with advanced  hematological  
and solid tumors,  we note that selinexor  shows  a reasonably  wide therapeutic  range,  with activities  
from ~10mg/m2  to ≥50mg/m2.   Therefore,  in order  to optimize  specific  anti-tumor  activity  and the

patient’s  tolerability,  we will allow  for dose  and/or  schedule  modifications  as described  below.  
Patients  should  also be treated  aggressively  with supportive  care to reduce  toxicities.  
9.2.1.  Dose  Modifications for Non-hematologic  Toxicity  Unrelated  to Selinexor  
 
For all ≥ Grade  3 non-hematologic  toxicitiies  that are NOT selinexor  related:  
 
• Hold selinexor  dose  until AEs resolves to ≤ Grade  1 or baseline  (maximum  28 days).  
Exceptions  to this include:  Patients  with grade  ≥[ADDRESS_1173927] 3 
days days without  improvement  of the nausea,  vomiting,  or diarrhea.  Optimal  supportive  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (see Supportive  Care  Guidelines,  Section  9.1.3).  
• If the AEs resolve  to ≤ Grade  1 or baseline  within  28 days,  restart  Selinexor  at the same  dose.  
• If the AEs do not resolve  to ≤ Grade  [ADDRESS_1173928]  of the 
patient  to remain  on study,  the patient  may continue  to receive  study  treatment  after the 28-day 
delay.  The rationale  for continuing  study  treatment  will be documented  in the patient’s  medica l 
record.  
 
9.2.2.  Dose  Modifications  for Hematologic  and Non-hematologic  Toxicities  Related  to 
Selinexor  
The criteria  for dose  modification  for toxicities  at least possibly  related  to selinexor  are outlined  
below  in Table  1. Supportive  care guidelines  for management  of selinexor -related  toxicities  and 
indications  for dose  modifications  are described  in Table  2.

not eligible  to enter  the study.  Refer  to dose  adjustment  guidelines  below  for renal  dysfunction  that 
develops  while  on study  and unrelated  to Selinexor.  
 
 
Dose Adjustment Guideline for renal dysfunction while on study 
 
Renal   Dysfunction  Recommended   Action  
Normal  to Moderate  
(GFR  ≥ 30 mL/min)  • Full dose  
Severe  
(GFR  < 30 mL/min)  • Reduce  Selinexor  by 30% for at least  two weeks  
• If reduced  dose  is well tolerated,  or GFR  increases  to 
>30mL/min,  then Selinexor  may be increased  to starting  dose  
after consultation  with the Principal  Investigator.  
 
 
9.2.4.  Selinexor Dose Adjustment in the Setting of Infection 
 
Patients  with active  uncontrolled  infections  should  have selinexor  treatment  withheld  until the 
infection  has clinically  resolved  or is controlled.  After the infection  is controlled,  treatment  may 
continue  at the original  dose.   Missed  doses  will not be replaced.  Patients  may continue  on 
antibiotics  for prolonged  periods  while  re-initiating  their selinexor  regimen  at the discretion  of the 
investigator  but the infection  must  be clinically  stabilized  prior to restarting  selinexor.  
 
For patients  with recurrent  epi[INVESTIGATOR_844680],  follow  the guidelines  
outlined  in the table above:  “Dose  adjustment  guidelines  for hematologic  selinexor -related  
toxicities”.  
 
 
9.2.5.  Conditions  Not Requiring  Selinexor  Dose  Reduction  
 
The following  conditions  are exceptions  to the above  guidelines.   Selinexor  does not need  to be held 
in the following  cases:  
• Grade  3 nausea,  vomiting  or diarrhea  (unless  persisting  > 3 days with adequate  treatment  of 
anti-emetics  or anti-diarrheals  
• Alopecia  of any grade  
• Weight  loss of less than 20% 
• Electrolytes  abnormalities  that are reversible  with oral supplements  or brief intravenous  
infusions.  
 
9.2.6.  Missed  or Vomited  Doses  
 
 
 
Missed  doses  during  the week  may be replaced  within  24 hours.  If the dose  was missed  for more  
than 24 hours,  the dose  will be skipped  and the next dose  will be taken  as per schedule.   Doses

dose.  
9.3.2.  Use of Blood  Products  
 
During  the administration  of Selinexor,  patients  may receive  red blood  cell (RBC)  or platelet  
transfusions  for disease  or selinexor -related  anemia  or thrombocytopenia,  if clinically  indicated,  and 
as per institutional  guidelines.   Also see guidelines  for managing  grade  3/4 thrombocytopenia  and 
bleeding  complications  in the table above  (“Dose  adjustment  guidelines  for hematologic  selinexor - 
related  toxicities ”). 
9.3.3.  Glucocorticoid  Therapy  
 
Glucocorticoids  ≤ 10 mg oral prednisone  (or equivalent)  per day are permitted  for non-malignant  
conditions  (i.e., asthma,  IBD, etc.) as needed.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_1173937]  receive  5-HT3 antagonists  
(ondansetron  8 mg or equivalent),  starting  before  the first dose  of selinexor  and continued  2-3 times  
daily thereafter,  as needed.  
9.3.5  Suppo rtive Care for Anorexia, Nausea/Vomiting, and Fatigue 
 
Supportive  measures  for optimal  medical  care should  be provided  to patients  during  participation  in 
this study.  Based  on clinical  observations  in over [ADDRESS_1173938] been  primarily  related  to anorexia  with poor caloric

and fluid intake,  fatigue,  and nausea.  .In addition  to required  5-HT3 prophylaxis  (see Section  9.3.4),  
anti-nausea/anti -emetic  therapy,  acid suppression  (proton -pump  inhibitors  [PPI] and/or  H2-blockers)  
and other  treatments  may be administered  as follows:  
• Appetite  stimulants : megesterol  acetate  at a dose  of 400-800 mg daily.  
 
• Nausea/vomiting  and anorexia : Management  as per the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  
Network®  [NCCN]  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines.  See Apendix  7 (NCCN  Guidelines  for use of anti- 
emetics)  and Appendix  8 NCCN  Guidelines  for management  of anorexia/cachexia).  
• Neurokinin -[ADDRESS_1173939]  (NK1R  antagonist) : Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_844681].  
 
Supportive  care guidelines  for managing  AEs are provided  in Section  9.2.2,  Table  . 
 
9.3.6  Dietary  and Concomitant  Medication  Restrictions  
 
Medications:  Although  acetaminophen  (paracetamol)  use in combination  with selinexor  was 
restricted  in previous  selinexor  studies  based  on theoretical  interactions   with 
GSH,  ongoing  clinical  safety  evaluations  on the use of these  drugs  together  have 
not shown  any significant  clinical  or laboratory  abnormalities  with doses  of 
acetaminophen  of up to 1 gm and selinexor  up to 55 mg/m  2 (approximately  80- 
100 mg). Therefore,  there  are no longer  any restrictions  on the use of 
acetaminophen  or acetaminophen -containing  products  in combination  with 
selinexor,  EXCEPT  on days on selinexor  dosing,  when  acetaminophen  must  not 
exceed  a total daily dose  of 1 gram.  
 
Diet: There  are no dietary  restrictions  on this study.  
 
 
 
9.4.  Prohibited  Concomitant  medications  
 
Concurrent 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  Concurrent  therapy  with glucocorticoids  is allowed,  as specified  in Section  9.3.3.  
 
Concurrent  therapy  with any other  approved  or investigative  anticancer  
therapeutic  is not allowed.  Other  investigational  agents  should  not be used  during  
the study.  Use of any immunosuppressive  agents  during  the study  must  be 
confirmed  by [CONTACT_46449].  
 
Medications:  Patients  should  not take glutathione  (GSH) -, S-adenosylmethionine  (SAM) -, or N- 
acetylcysteine  (NAC) -containing  products  during  their participation  in this study  
as these  products  may enhance  the metabolism  of selinexor.   Please  see Section  
20.5 (Appendix  5) for a list of representative  products.  Patients  must  report  all 
prescription  and non-prescription  medicines  to their physicians  during  this study.

Adverse Events Reporting 
 
Adverse  event  (AE) means  any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  or subject  administered  a 
pharmaceutical  product;  the untoward  medical  occurrence  does not necessarily  have a causal  
relationship  with this treatment.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign 
(including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use 
of a medicinal  (investigational)  product  whether  or not it is related  to the medicinal  product.  This 
includes  any newly  occurring  event,  or a previous  condition  that has increased  in severity  or 
frequency  since  the administration  of study  drug.  An abnormal  laboratory  value  will not be assessed  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

43  
  
 
as an AE unless  that value  leads  to discontinuation  or delay  in treatment,  dose  modification,  
therapeutic  intervention,  or is considered  by [CONTACT_844728] a clinically  significant  change  from 
baseline.  
 
 
 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of this study  will be assessed  using  the 2006  
Modified  MDS  International  Working  Group  response criteria  (Cheson  et al., 2006).  
Patients  will be eligible  for the primary  efficacy  endpoint  if they have undergone  at least one cycle  of 
therapy,  and are evaluable  for response.  Patients  will be evaluable  for Hematologic  Improvement  
with the availability  of CBC  parameters  and transfusion  records,  and will be evaluable  for all 
response  categories  if they undergo  at least one bone  marrow  procedure  (first planned  marrow  for 
response  assessments  is after dosing  is completed  for the first 21-day cycle).  
 
For the primary  endpoint,  overall  CR, marrow  CR, and PR, and HI responses  will be tabulated.  
 
According  to the 2006  Modified  MDS  International   Working  Group  response  criteria,  response  
categories  include  the following:  
 
 
Complete  Remission  (CR)  
Bone  marrow  evaluation:  Repeat  bone  marrow  showing   5% or less myeloblasts  with normal  
maturation  of all cell lines.   Persistent  dysplasia  will be allowed  but noted.  
 
Blood:   
Hgb > 11 g/dL (untransfused,  patient  not on erythropoietin)  
Neutrophils  > 1.0 x 109/L or more  (not on myeloid  growth  factor)  
Platelets  > 100 x 109/L or more  (not on thrombopoietic  factor)  
Blasts  0% 
CBC  values  must  last at least 1 month.  In some  circumstances,  protocol  therapy  may require  the 
initiation  of further  treatment  before  the 1 month  period.  Such  patients  can be included  in the 
response  criteria  into which  they fit at the time therapy  is started.   Transient  cytopenias  during  
repeated  chemotherapy  courses  should  not be considered  as interrupting  durability  of response,  
as long as they recover  to the improved  counts  of the pervious  course.  
 
Partial  Remission  (PR) 
All the CR criteria  except:  
Bone  marrow  evaluation:  Blasts  decreased  by 50% or more  over pretreatment,  but  still more  than 
5%. 
CBC  values  must  last at least 1 month  unless  interrupted  by [CONTACT_844729].  
 
Marrow  CR 
Bone  Marrow:  5% myeloblasts  or less and decreased  by 50% or greater  over pretreatment.  
Blood:  if criteria  for HI responses  are met (see criteria  below),  they will be noted  in addition  to 
marrow  CR 
 
Stable  Disease  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -005 A(17)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1173956] 2 months  
Failure  
Death  during  treatment  or disease  progression  characterized  by [CONTACT_844730],  or 
progression  to AML.  
Relapse  after CR or PR 
One or more  of the following:  
- Return  to pretreatment  bone  marrow  blast percentage  
- Decrement  of 50% or greater  from maximum  remission  / response  levels  in  granulocytes  
or platelets  
- Reduction  in hemoglobin  concentration  by [CONTACT_2669] 1.5 g/dL or new/recurrent  transfusion  
dependence  (in the absence  of another  explanation   such  as treatment  effect,  acute  
infection,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hemolysis,  etc.) 
 
Disease  Progression  
- For patient  with less than 5% blasts:  a 50% or more  increase  in blasts  to more  than 5% 
blasts  
- For patients  with 5% to 10% blasts:  a 50% or more  increase  to more  than 10% blasts.  
- For patients  with 10% to 20% blasts:  a 50% or more  increase  to more  than 20% blasts  
- For patients  with 20% to 30% blasts:  a 50% or more  increase  to more  than 30% blasts.  
- One or more  of the following:  50% or greater  decrement  from maximum  
remission/response  levels  in granulocytes  or platelets,  reduction  in hemoglobin  
concentration  by [CONTACT_2669] 2 g/dL,  or transfusion  dependence  (in absence  of another  
explanation  such  as acute  infection,  G.I. bleeding,  hemolysis  etc.) 
 
 
Hematologic  Improvement  (HI) 
 
Improvements  must  last at least 2 months  in the absence  of ongoing  cytotoxic  therapy.  When  
protocol  therapy  requires  the initiation  of further  treatment  before  the 2 month  period,  
patients  can be included  in the response  criteria  into which  they fit at the time therapy  is re- 
started.  
Hematologic  improvement  should  be described  by [CONTACT_844731],  positively  
affected  cell lines (eg, HI-E; HI-E + HI-N; HI-E + HI-P + HI-N) 
Hematologic  Improvement  response  categories  include  the following:  
 
• Erythroid  response  (HI-E) 
For patients  with pretreatment  hemoglobin  less than 11g/dL:  
- Hemoglobin  increase  by > 1.5 g/dL 
- Relevant  reduction  of units of RBC  transfusions  by [CONTACT_844732] 4 
RBC/8wk  compared  with the pretreatment  transfusion  number  in the pervious  8 wk. (*) 
 
(*) Only RBC  transfusions  given  for Hgb < 9.0 g/dL will count  in the RBC  transfusion  
response  evaluation.  
• Platelet  response  (HI-P) 
 
For patients  with a pretreatment  platelet  count  < 100 x 109/L: 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -005 A(17)  
Approval date: 25 -Jan-2021

An absolute  increase  of > 30 x 109/L or more  for patients   starting  with > 20 x 109/L platelets  
 
An increase from < 20 x 109/L to > 20 x 109/L, and by [CONTACT_120187] 100%.  
 
• Neutrophil  response  (HI-N) 
 
For patients  with pretreatment  neutrophil  count  < 1.0 x 109/L: At least a 100%  increase  and 
an absolute  increase   > 0.5 x 109/L. 
Progression/relapse  after HI 
 
One or more  of the following:  
 
- A 50% or greater  decrement  from maximum  response  levels  in granulocytes  or platelets  
- A reduction  in hemoglobin  concentration  by [CONTACT_2669] 1.5 g/dL 
- Transfusion  dependence  (in the absence  of other  explanation,  such  as hemolysis,  
hemorrhage,  etc). 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  may withdraw  from the study  at any time.   Patients  who discontinue  from the study  will be 
encouraged  to return  to the study  site to undergo  the evaluations  listed  for the End of Treatment  
Visit. 
At the discretion  of the Investigator,  the investigator  may remove  a patient  from the study  for the 
following  reasons:  
• Due to disease  progression  
 
• Noncompliance  with study  procedures  
 
• Need  of treatment  with medications  not allowed  by [CONTACT_23643]  
 
• Patient  no longer  consents  to participate  in the study  
 
• Intercurrent  illness  that interferes  with study  assessments  
 
• Incidence  or severity  of AEs in this study  indicates  a potential  health  hazard  to the patient  
• For the third occurrence  of the same  Grade  ≥3 non-hematological  toxicity  
• For the third epi[INVESTIGATOR_844691]  
• Investigator   discretion  
 
• Other  treatments  become  available  which  are more  appropriate  for the individual  patient  
 
 
To the extent  possible,  patients  must  strictly  follow  the standard  dosing  schedule.  Patients  who miss  
3 doses  or more  (out of 4 doses)  in a cycle  in the absence  of study drug related  toxicity  will be 
discontinued.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -005 A(17)  
Approval date: 25 -Jan-2021  
46  
  
 
If the reason  for withdrawal  is the occurrence  of an AE, the patient  will be followed  by [CONTACT_844733],  stabilize,  and according  to the Investigator’s  judgment  there  is 
no need  of further  follow -up.  The reason  for withdrawal  from the study  will be documented  in the 
case  report  form.  
 
 
 
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Primary  endpoint  evaluation  
 
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to investigate  the efficacy  of Selinexor  in patients  with MDS  
refractory  to hypomethylating  agents  (decitabine  and/or  5-azacytidine).  The standard  treatment  in 
this setting  is supportive  care,  where  the response  rate is assumed  to be zero.  Therefore,  in this 
population,  a response  rate of 25% would  be considered  promising,  whereas  a 5% response  rate 
would  not be considered  promising.  For purposes  of assessing  the primary  endpoint,  response  
categories  will include  CR, PR, marrow  CR (mCR),  or Hematologic  Improvement.  Using  a Simon’s  
two-stage  minimax  design,  this trial will accrue  a maximum  of [ADDRESS_1173957]- 
treatment  disease  assessment  (informative  bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_294563],  cytogenetics,  and CBC  
with differential).  For patients  who come  off study  after completing  at least [ADDRESS_1173958] cycle  of therapy  and are unable  to undergo  (or refuse)  a bone  marrow  procedure,  an 
assessment  for Hematologic  Improvement  (based  on CBC  data)  will be performed  and described  
and an attempt  will be made  to obtain  follow -up CBC  data for the 8 weeks  mandated  to confirm  
Hematologic  Improvement  according  to the MDS  International  Working  Group  response  criteria.  
Patients  who come  off study  after starting  study  drug because  of toxicity,  death,  or withdrawal  of 
consent  prior to undergoing  a response  assessment  will not be replaced  and will be considered  a 
treatment  failure.  Patients  who enroll  on study  but do not receive  study  therapy  will be replaced.  
 
Analysis  of secondary  endpoints  
 
1. Response  duration  will be caluated  among  patients  who achieve  a response  of HI, mCR,  PR 
or CR using  Kaplan -Meier  methodology.  Median  duration  of response  and the corresponding  
95% confidence  interval  will be estimated.  
2. The frequency  of stable  disease  will be tabulated  and exact  95% confidence  intervals  will be 
estimated.  
3. The response  rate and response  duration  will also be described  for the generally  poor-risk 
therapy -related  MDS  patients  enrolled  on this study  (therapy -related  MDS  accruals  may 
approach  ~ 50%,  as seen  in MSKCC  protocol  06-054).  The response  rate will be estimated  
along  with an exact  95% confidence  interval  to evaluate  the proportion  of patients  who have

CR, PR, mCR  or HI. Median   response  duration  and corresponding  95% confidence  intervals  
will be estimated.  
4. Overall  survival  from the time of study  enrollment  will be caluated  using  Kaplan -Meier  
methodology.  Overall  survival  curves  will be displayed  for the study  population  along  with 
selected  quantiles  and corresponding  95% confidence  intervals  of survival.  
5. Since  Selinexor  may require  chronic  dosing  to maintain  its effect,  the overall  tolerability  and 
safety  of chronic  Selinexor  dosing  will be described  on patients  throughout  all cycles  of 
treatment  who have received  at least 1 dose  of selinexor.  Tolerability  will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_844734]-grade  (1/2) 
toxicity.  Safety  will be calculated  by [CONTACT_844735]  11.0.  This will be calculated  overall  at each  treatment  cycle  and 
separately  by [CONTACT_844736]. Proportions  
and exact  95% confidence  intervals  will be calculated.  
6. Descriptive  statistics  will be used  to explore  the relationship  between  the results  of the 
pharmacodynamics  studies  and therapeutic  response  or study  entry  disease  parameters.  
The Wilcoxon  rank-sum statistic  or Fisher’s  exact  test may be used  to assess  these  
associations.  
 
 
Accrual  rates  and study  duration  
 
It is expected  that the study  will accrue  1-2 patients  per month,  resulting  in completion  of accrual  in 
10-20 months.  
 
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDUR ES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  a protocol  
specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
All participants  must  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration (PPR)  Office  
at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  PPR is available  Monday  through  Friday  from 
8:30am  – 5:30pm  at [PHONE_214].  Registrations  must  be submitted  via the PPR Electronic  
Registration  System  (http://ppr/ ).  The completed  signature  [CONTACT_28651]/RA  or

A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  extraction  and data entry,  data reporting,  
coordination  of the activities  of the protocol  study  team  and, and of the flow of regulatory  
paperwork.  Study  accrual  is estimated  to to take 1.[ADDRESS_1173959] regis tration.  
 
 
The data collected  for the study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (CRDB).  All routine  
blood  test results  required  per the protocol  will be captured  in CRDB  in addition  to baseline  
medical  conditions  and disease  information,  response  assessments,  off-study  
documentation,  and toxicity  grade  and attribution.  Source  documentation  will be available  to 
support  the computerized  patient  record.  
Lab toxicities  will be routinely  assessed  by [CONTACT_978]. The following  labs are considered  common  
toxicities  for the disease  under  study  and therefore  should  be considered  not clinically  
relevant  for data entry  purposes.  
• Total  WBC  Count  
 
The total WBC  count  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_844692].  However,  further  
reductions  in the WBC  count  are not clinically  relevant.  Reductions  in other  WBC  subsets  
may be clinically  meaningful  and will continued  to be entered  per MSK guidelines.  
MSKCC  will cross -reference  Karyopharm’s  IND and will be responsible  for all safety  
monitoring.  All SAEs  will be reported  to the MSKCC  IRB. The safety of the study  will be 
monitored  by [CONTACT_844737].  
 
 
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  by [CONTACT_362995] [INVESTIGATOR_498242].  Routine  data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  
 
 
Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study.  Recurrent  lapses  in data collection,  deviations  or violations  
will be disussed  with the study  team  and a corrective  plan will be generated.  
Accrual  goals  and factors  impacting  accrual  goals  will be discussed  at the weekly  New 
Patient/Protocol  Leukemia  meetings.  
 
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  was 
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plan addressed  the new 
policies  set forth by [CONTACT_362996]  "Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for data and safety  monitoring  of clinical  trials"  which  can be found  at

Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  has set up three  distinct  monitoring  processes  for 
our clinical  trials program.  There  are two sub-committees  of the Center's  Institutional  Review  
Board/Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB)  and Research  Council  (RC)  that have the responsibility  of 
data and safety  monitoring.  These  are joint sub-committees  with dual-reportin  
responsibilities.  The Data and Safety  Monitoring   Committee  (DSMC)  is the sub-committee  
responsible  for monitoring  all Phase  I, II, I/II, pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase  clinical  trials.  The Data and 
Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  is the sub-committee  responsible  for monitoring  Phase  III 
randomized  clinical  trials.  The Therapeutic  Response  Review  Committee  (TRRC)  is the sub- 
committee  of Research  Council  responsible  for the independent  therapeutic  response  review  
for participants  in IRB/PB  approved  clinical  trials where  therapeutic  efficacy  is a stated  
primary  objective,  typi[INVESTIGATOR_683126].  Formal  monitoring  of such  studies  is 
designed  to ensure  that the interests  of the participants  are being  scrutinized  on a regular  
basis,  and that the trial is progressing  in a satisfactory  manner.  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  convenes  once  per quarter  and 
monitors  the risk participants  are exposed  to, the progress  of the study,  the adequacy  of the 
data storage  and whether  sufficient  data are being  entered  into the CRDB.  The DSMC 
monitors  phase  I, II, I/II, pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase  trials that are not being  monitored  by [CONTACT_844738],  and which  meet  the NCI definition  of a Clinical  Trial.  This trial will qualify  
for monitoring  by [CONTACT_6802].  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be 
established  at the time of protocol  activation  
16.4 Regulatory  Documentation

Human  Subjects  Involvement  and Characteristics : All patients  at MSKCC  who meet  the all of 
the inclusion  and none  of the exclusion  criteria  will be eligible.  Both men and women  and 
members  of all ethnic  groups  are eligible  for this trial. Pregnant  and breast -feeding  women  
are excluded  from this study.  This protocol  does not include  children  because  the number  of 
children  is expected  to be limited  for the patient  population  expected  to be accrued  onto this 
study.  Also,  the majority  of children  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  
research  network.  This statement  is based  on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy  and Guidelines  
on the Inclusion  of Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  
Consent  process : All patients  at MSKCC  who meet  the inclusion  criteria  will be eligible.  
Participation  in the trial is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a statement  of 
informed  consent,  which  must  conform  to IRB guidelines.  The informed  consent  procedure  is 
described  in Section  18.0.  
Possible  Toxicities/Side -Effects : There  are risks associated  with treatment  as described  in 
Section  11.0;  however,  patients  screened  for enrollment  will be deemed  appropriate  for 
treatment  independent  of this study.  
Benefits : It is unknown  if selinexor  can benefit  patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes.  The 
goal of this study  is to assess if selinexor  has the potential  to demonstrate  objective  
response  in patients  with myelodysplastic  syndromes.  
Costs :  Patients  will be charged  for physician  visits,  routine  laboratory  tests,  and radiologic  
studies  required  for monitoring  their condition.  The cost of research -only pharmacodynamic  
studies  will be covered  by [CONTACT_209871].  
Alternatives : For patients  considering  this trial as second -line therapy,  standard  second -line 
treatments  would  include  supportive  care or another  study  drug in an alternate  clinical  trial, 
since  for patients  considering  this trial, there  are no standard  treatment  options.  
Confidentiality : Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40091].  Patients’  names  and any other  identifying  information  will 
not be used  in reports  or publications  resulting  from this study.  Other  authorized  agencies  
and appropriate  internal  personnel  (e.g. qualified  monitors  from MSKCC)  and external  
personnel  (Karyopharm,  the manufacturer  of selinexor),  its authorized  agents,  the FDA,  
and/or  other  governmental  agencies)  may review  patient  records  as required.  
Patient  safety : Patients  are monitored  by [CONTACT_390141].  In the case  of an adverse  reaction,  immediate  medical  attention  is 
available.  In the evenings  and weekends,  we have a 24-hour urgent  care facility  for 
outpatients.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_390110].  
Monitoring  of data to ensure  safety:  This study  is to be monitored  by [CONTACT_206954]. 
This incorporates  an independent  data and safety  monitoring  board  established  by 
[CONTACT_390142].  The analysis  of safety  will include  all 
patients.  Adverse  events,  including  all toxic effects  of treatment,  will be tabulated  individually,  
and summarized  by [CONTACT_206956].

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:

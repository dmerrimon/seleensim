equipment for healthcare workers (respi[INVESTIGATOR_379336]) and pave the way for the 
development of interventions or control measures specific to the dominant mode of transmission. 
Although typi[INVESTIGATOR_379337], large respi[INVESTIGATOR_379338], and contact1,2, the relative importance among these three routes is still under debate.1 The 
importance of this question is emphasized in the NIAID strategic plan for a universal influenza vaccine,3 
which identifies as a “key unanswered question the relative contribution of aerosols, droplets, and fomites 
as modes of transmission.”  
To answer this critical question the CDC  funded a project  called  “Evaluating Modes of Influenza 
Transmission using a Human Challenge Model” (hence forth referred to as EMIT -1; PI s: Jonathan Nguyen 
Van-Tam, Donald Milton , and Werner Bischoff ). EMIT -1 was designed as an experimental study of human -
human transmission from volunteers deliberately infected with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) 
well-characterized lab -grown influenza viruses. In EMIT -1, “donors” were nasally inoculated with a GMP  
A/H3N2 virus an d susceptible volunteers (“recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]”) were exposed to the donors through prescribed 
close living conditions. EMIT -1 failed to achieve the planned attack rate of influenza transmission, and this 
was largely hypothesized to be a result of the lack of signi ficant illness and low numbers of shedding of 
influenza virus with infection.4 In the wake of EMIT -1, a two -day international workshop “Influenza 
Transmission and the Built Environment: Understanding Modes of Transmission in a Sustainable Future” 
was held in March [ADDRESS_474835] “Evaluating Modes of Influenza Transmission using Innovative Technologies and 
Design in Controlled Environments” (hence forth referred to as EMIT -2; PD: Donald Milton) is in response 
to NIAID funding opportunity “Multidisciplinary Stud ies to Improve Understanding of Influenza 
Transmission” (RFA -AI-20-08). EMIT -[ADDRESS_474836], physical, and environmental factors that facilitate 
effic ient human -to-human influenza transmission. In these studies, healthy participants who are deemed 
to be susceptible to influenza (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) will be in contact [CONTACT_379430] (donors). These transmission studies are hence forth referred to as controlled human 
influenza virus infection transmission trial (CHIVITT) studies.  
This document represents the EMIT -2 CHIVITT Protocol.  The EMIT -2 Donor portion of this document is 
for the enrollment of persons naturally infected with influenza who will participate in a CHIVITT. Under 
the CHIVITT Protocol  portion of this document , EMIT -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (who have already been screened under 
the EMIT -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379339], UMB IRB HP -[ZIP_CODE]) will consent to be “exposed” to influenza from 
infected Donors. The EMIT -2 Donor enrollment and CHIVITT activities will be conducted during the winter 
(during the natural annual influenza season) of each designated year.  
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474837] ambient (environmental) 
sampling and culture device, a next -generation infectious exhaled breath aerosols (iEBA) sampler, an 
optimized virus collection and cell culture line, and a digital culture microarr ay. These four components 
will synergistically be working collaboratively together to achieve the goals of the EMIT -2 program. The 
hypothesis is that infectious aerosols are a major contributor to influenza transmission and that 
ventilation, air hygiene, a nd reduction of aerosol exposure will be associated with a reduction in both 
secondary influenza attack rates and disease severity.  

DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474838] to facilitate human -to-human influenza transmission and provide insights into correlates of 
protection in the setting of absent or low hemagg lutination inhibiting (HAI) antibodies using a controlled 
environment. The central hypothesis of EMIT -2 is that  inhalation of  infectious  aerosols (small size 
infectious particles  suspended in air ) is the dominant mode of influenza transmission. EMIT -[ADDRESS_474839] of planned interventions. For example, in one planned transmission experiment, under 
conditions with low ventilation and low air hygiene, half of the cohort of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379340] 15 minutes  while the remaining half of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379341] ; all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379342] -contact 
[CONTACT_289667] (e.g., play a board game for 2 hours) with  donor s who are infected with influenza. As a result, a 
secondary attack rate of influenza transmissions  of approximately 25%  is intended to occur  under low air -
hygiene conditions  with  a cumulative total of up to 60 hours of exposure of each recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] . The duration 
of exposure is chosen to match that used in previous trials ( Killingley  B et al., J. Infect. Dis. 2012: 205:35–
43 and Nguyen -Van-Tam  JS et al., PLoS Pathog.  2020 ;16:e1008704).4,5 Over the course of approximately 
5 influenza seasons, a number of controlled transmission experiments are to be conducted with variable 
air hygiene conditions. The scientific and engineering technologies and aims of the EMIT -2 program are

5 contingent upon successfully facilitating secondary influenza infections,  i.e., influenza transmissions from 
index cases (Donors) to exposed contacts (Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).  
 
2.3.1  EMIT -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379343] -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379339] (UMB IRB HP -[ZIP_CODE]) is a continuous (yearlong  with a duration of 
~5 years ) screening protocol to identify healthy “susceptible” adults, based on lack of potentially 
protective antibody, to serve as the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379344]. Persons who 
have consented to the EMIT -[ADDRESS_474840] agreed to be c ontacted during the winter 
seasons for whether they would agree to participate in a CHIVITT. Formal separate consent will 
be performed for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379345] a CHIVITT.  
2.3.2  EMIT -2 Donors  
This protocol will describe the EMIT -2 Donor recruitment process for the enrollment of persons 
naturally infected with influenza index cases who agree to participate in a CHIVITT. The 
recruitment process will be performed from among the community, beginnin g with case 
identification on the campuses of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) in association with 
the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) and the University of Maryland, College Park 
(UMCP). From these [ADDRESS_474841] of the CHIVITT, wherein we will estimate the relative 
contribution of aerosol inhalation (airborne), spray deposition (large droplet) , and touch (contact -fomite) 
transmission on the spread of influenza, by [CONTACT_379431] (SAR) of influenza 
among uninfected volunteers (Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) who closely interact with naturally influenza -infected index

6 cases (Donors). The close interactions are designed to mimic real -world potential exposures to influenza. 
To identify the dominant mode of transmission, various interventions will be employed. The exposure 
room environment can be tuned to a low ventilation  minimal filtration  environment or a high ventilation , 
filtration , and air disinfection  environment. The residential and common room environment may be 
supplemented with in -room air filtration and/or germicidal UV air disinfection to achieve high air hygiene 
conditions to block inhalation of infectious aerosols . Transmission via spray deposition may be blocked by 
[CONTACT_379432]. Touch (c ontact -fomite ) transmission may be blocked through strict hand 
hygiene and surface cleaning protocols. Aerosol  inhalation  transmission may be further reduced by [CONTACT_379433]. The determination of SAR in Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379346] a standardized 
procedure of collected respi[INVESTIGATOR_379347]. The monitoring and 
management of influenza illness will be conducted to en sure the welfare of all study participants.  
2.5 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.5.1  Potential Risks  
Influenza Illness  
Common  symptoms of common influenza illness includes: body aches or pains, chest congestion, 
chest tightness, chills, congested or stuffy nose, coughing, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, eyes 
sensitive to light, fatigue, feeling dizzy, fever, head congestion, he adache, lack of appetite, swollen 
lymph nodes, nausea, runny or drippi[INVESTIGATOR_4459], scratchy or itchy throat, shivering, sinus pressure, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_4460], sneezing, sore or painful eyes, sore or painful throat, stomach ache, 
sweating, teary or watery ey es. 
Moderate complications of influenza, which are unlikely to occur in healthy persons who 
participate in this study include: sinus infections and ear infections.  
Severe complications of influenza, which are also unlikely to occur in healthy persons w ho 
participate in this study include: pneumonia, severe dehydration, severe bronchitis, myocarditis, 
myocardial infarction, pericarditis, Guillain Barré Syndrome/Bell’s Palsy, transverse myelitis, 
encephalitis, worsening of chronic health conditions, admissio n to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
hypoxemia/respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], arrhythmia/cardiac arrest, and death.  
These known risks of complications associated with an influenza infection are to be mitigated by 
[CONTACT_379434] , including treatment with antiviral therapy  
(oseltamivir or baloxavir)  when indicated. More details of these measures are described in 
Sections 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6.  
Onward Transmission of Influenza Virus  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], through participating in this study, might acquire influenza infection and transmit 
onwards to contacts outside of the trial, who might include vulnerable individuals. To mitigate 
this risk, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379348] ,

vasovagal response subsides. Bruising at the blood draw site may occur but can be prevented or 
lessened by [CONTACT_119911] a few minute s after the blood is taken. 
Drawing blood may cause infection. The use of aseptic technique by [CONTACT_379435].  
Nose swabs or nose washes  
Obtaining nose fluid or a nose swab may cause brief discomfort of the nares, a gag reflex, bleeding 
of the nose, watery eyes, or coughing during the collection.  
Saliva Samples  
We will ask participants  to stop eating and drinking for about 30 minutes before giving a saliva 
sample, about ½ teaspoon, in a specimen cup or tube. Giving a saliva sample may be difficult if 
participants’ mouths are dry . To help with that, participants  may drink a small amount of water 5 
minutes before giving a sample.   
Exhaled breath sampling  
Exhaled breath sample collection is performed with a specialized apparatus which requires the 
participant to be seated in a humidified booth or tent with their face at opening (entrance) to the 
apparatus’ large funnel. Participants will be able to breath normally and cough spontaneously. 
Participants will be asked to vocalize (e.g., say ‘whoooooo’ , sing ‘Happy Birthday’, or yell a sports 
team cheer ) periodically during sample collection. The existing apparatus is called the Gesundheit -
II (G-II, U.S. Patent  No. 8250903) .  As newer devices become available through the Advanced 
Bioaerosol Technology Core, we may supplement or replace the G -II with newer sampling 
equipment that may not require a humidified  booth. A maximum of two [ADDRESS_474843] a 10 -minute break between samples.  
Breath  samples may also be collected by [CONTACT_379436] a spi[INVESTIGATOR_379349] (EasyOne®, NDD Medical Technologies,  Inc) for [ADDRESS_474844] for 1 minute at 5 -minute intervals during sample collecting via the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Participants will be asked to breath slowly and deeply (slow vital capacity maneuver) 
and may be asked to vocalize ( e.g.,  say ‘whoooooo’) while breathing through the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. A 
maximum of two 15 -minute samples will be collected per day via breathing through a 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  
Breath samples may additionally be collected with a device that resembles a handheld peak flow 
meter. Participants will be asked to blow through the device several  times, each time taking  deep 
breaths . They  may be asked to vocalize ( e.g.,  say ‘whoooooo’) while breathing through the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. These samples will take about [ADDRESS_474845].  
Total time breathing into a breath sampler will be limited to  a total of  1 hour per day  for the longer 
duration samples and 10 min for the 2-minute  samples . Sampling will be performed daily for the 
duration of participant by [CONTACT_379437] . Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379350].  
The G -II presents no breathing resistance. Rarely for some persons, they may feel slightly 
claustrophobic sitting in front of the G-II cone . Breathing into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_379351] -

8 like mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_111285] a nose clip may cause dry mouth and discomfort from the nose clip . Some 
people may experience dizziness or  lightheadedness  due to the slow vital capacity breathing  maneuver  
being  employed.  The breathing  maneuver  may  also stimulate  coughing.  There  is no noticeable  resistance  
to breathing  and the procedure  has been well tolerated  previously by [CONTACT_379438][INVESTIGATOR_4398].  The short duration of the sample collection helps mitigate this discomfort, and 
the participant  will be encouraged  to breath  slowly  to reduce  the risk of dizziness.  
Loss of Confidentiality  
Study participants will be asked to provide personal health information and other identifying 
information. To preserve protected health information (PHI) and confidentiality, identifying 
participant data will be kept in a locked, secured facility at the st udy site. All collected specimens 
will be coded, removing identifying information, prior to appropriate storage in a locked, secured, 
monitored facility, accessible only by [CONTACT_379439]. The coded specimens 
will be able to be link ed to identifying information which is only accessible to the clinical research 
staff. Specimens will be shared with EMIT -2 collaborating laboratories; collaborating lab 
personnel will not have access to identifying data.  
Video and Digital Photos  
Video footage or digital photos taken during the transmission experiments are to be analyzed and 
then either de -identified (by [CONTACT_379440] ) or erased by 
[CONTACT_2054].  Video footage and digital photos will be recorded onto  encrypted, password 
protected  local devices (e.g., USB “ thumb ” drive) and only be made accessible to pre -designed 
study team members who will store video files in a password -protected electronic storage device 
or password -secured campus server drive.

emergent baloxavir marboxil resistant viruses. The overall incidence of treatment -emergent 
amino acid substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir marboxil in two prior 
clinical trials was 2.7% (5/182) and 11%  (39/370). [ package insert ] 
Rapid flu test  
There are some risks associated with rapid flu tests. These tests can sometimes produce false -
negative results, meaning that a person who actually has the flu is told that they do not have it. 
False -positive results are also possible, which can lead to unn ecessary treatment and increased 
healthcare costs. Additionally, rapid flu tests have been known to have a lower sensitivity 
compared to other flu tests, meaning that they may not be as accurate in detecting the flu virus. 
Study participants will receive a n information sheet that outlines the risks and benefits associated 
with rapid tests, as well as other instructions. The participants will be encouraged to discuss their 
test results with their healthcare provider for further guidance and treatment, if nec essary.   
Unknown Risks  
There may be additional risks in this study which are not yet known.  
There is also small risk to subjects who report that they are in good health but who have an 
unknown health problem at the time of screening. This study will screen by [CONTACT_379443], a clinical questionnaire, clinical laboratories, and vital signs. Any clinically 
significant abnormalities discovered will be discussed with the participant and recommendations 
for appropriate referrals will be provided.  
Potential Risks with Specimens  and Data  for Secondary Research  
Specimens which may be left over after designated assays have been performed or extra 
specimens collected for secondary research may be indefinitely stored for future research.  These 
specimens will be labeled with a code which will not contain personal id entifying information. The 
risk of loss of confidentiality  of a specimen is minimized by [CONTACT_379444], 
to a subject and their personal information, in a secured and locked location with access only 
available to authorized study staff members.

10 scientific understanding of influenza transmission from participation in this study.  
3 IDENTIFICATION OF INDEX CASES FOR CHIVITT (DONORS PROTOCOL)  
3.1 Donor Protocol – Design  
We will enroll persons aged [ADDRESS_474848] acute symptomatic 
influenza infection will be eligible for enrollment. The screening process will include a cli nical evaluation 
for general health status, assessment of drug and alcohol dependence and abuse, and assessment of 
smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_379352].  
Recruitment  
We learned from focus groups that many potential donors do not generally go to a clinic when they are 
sick and may not ever have the cause of their influenza -like-illness (ILI) diagnosed.  We also learned that 
obtaining and paying for a flu test for purpos es of determining eligibility for the CHIVITT is a time and cost 
barrier to participation as a donor. Therefore, to detect cases early enough in the incubation period, we 
are adding several new options for flu testing to the original strategy of recruiting  donors during clinic 
visits.    
Therefor w e will take multiple approaches to Donor recruitment.  
Clinics and Urgent Care Centers  - Donor r ecruitment will involve  identifying influenza case 
patients at local urgent care centers, emergency rooms, campus health centers, and at local provider 
offices. Initial recruitment will be focused on the preliminary identification of potential participants being 
seen within the U MMC Emergency Department (Baltimore, MD), the UMaryland Immediate Care (UMIC, 
Baltimore, MD), UM Urgent Care - Downtown; UM Urgent Care - Columbia; University of Maryland Faculty 
Physicians, Inc. at Waterloo Crossin g, the University of Maryland Health Center (UHC, College Park, MD) , 
Express Healthcare, LLC (College Park, MD) , and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions  (JHMI) . However, with 
ongoing collaborations within the medical community, there will be an expansion of potential urgent care 
centers, medical practices, and other partners which might provide referrals of influenza patients as 
donors.  
Pop-Up Kiosks . CLIA -waived rapid flu tests will be administered at “pop -up kiosks” on campuses 
or other locations thought to have a high likelihood of yielding individuals with positive flu tests. Kiosks 
will be staffed by [CONTACT_7355] . Visitors to the kiosk who want to be tested will self -swab, 
provide their email address, and answer questions about fever, cough, and sore throat. Trained study 
personnel will perform the rapid flu test  and link the test to the visitor’s email address.  Study recruitment 
fliers will be distributed . Individuals who get tested will receive an information sheet describing the risks 
and benefits of the rapid test, along with study materials. These settings where healthy students, families 
and/or other adults congregate (such as dormitories, student lounges, barber shops) will allow 
investigators to raise awareness of the study, provide the means for no -cost test s and improve the 
chances of enrolling individuals with the influenza very early in the course of their disease.  
 Lord Baltimore  Hotel  – We will provide CLIA -waived flu testing kiosk  at the Lord Baltimore Hotel 
during the quarantine CHIVITT to facilitate identifying eligible donor volunteers. These individuals will 
have heard about the study via social media, fliers, or word of mouth, and have ILI but not been tested. 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474849] Baltimore Hotel during periods when we are 
recruiting Donors.  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379353]  - individuals who are enrolled in the EMIT -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379353] ( HP-00097730 ), 
may  be provided FDA approved  home  influenza rapid  test kits  during their screening or follow -up clinic 
visits if test kits are available . (This will be described in the Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379354].)  If they contract 
influenza -like illness  during a CHIVITT donor recruitment,  they can test themselves and volunteer as a 
donor if they are available and otherwise eligible.    
For all potential Donors, a  review of available electronic medical records may be necessary to assess for 
the presence of exclusion criteria prior to formal signed informed consent —this would require IRB 
approval to waive the  HIPAA  authorization  to obtain identifiable private information for this pre -screening 
process, as it would not be practicable to conduct this research without the waiver.  
Potential participant donors who have been identified at external care centers , kiosks , 
campus/community outreach services, or through self -testing (registry participants only) and  have  passed 
a phone screening , may verbally consent to be screened  and transported to the research facility.

[ADDRESS_474859] of up to 20  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379364] 5  Donors per CHIVITT, which would span an 
approximate 2-week  period.  The number of Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379365]’s availability 
and whether their most recent serum antibodies have demonstrated a relative low titer against the 
influenza virus to be transmitted in the CHIVITT.  To maintain the size of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379366], we may 
consider bringing in new recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379367] a significant number of original 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379368]. The number of Donors will be determined by [CONTACT_379446] a CHIVITT 
cohort’s stay.  
The CHIVITT studies are anticipated to occur during the peak of local seasonal influenza transmission (e.g., 
January and February). Timing of the study will be constrained by [CONTACT_379447]. It is intended that the local seasonal influenza activity will be closely 
monitored, including the virus subtypes which are predominantly circulating. During the peak of the local 
seasonal influenza activity, a cohort of Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379369] ~[ADDRESS_474860] year (under the EMIT -2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379370], UMB IRB HP -[ZIP_CODE]). Potential Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379371] (≤ one week) to decide 
whether to participate and they must complete an IRB -approved consent form for the C HIVITT study.   
Meanwhile, during the peak of community -wide local seasonal influenza the study team will be 
attempting to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_379372]. It is inte nded that there could be multiple Donors identified 
during a ~2 -week period; each of these Donor individuals could be introduced into the CHIVITT cohort in 
an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_379373], to provide more opportunities for transmission events.  
The success of each CHIVITT cohort will be influenced by  [CONTACT_379448], which 
influenza viruses may be circulating, willingness or availability of Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379374], and the ability 
to identify and consent Donors for each cohort. To mitigate these factors,  we will enroll sufficient potential 
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
17 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379375] a fraction are needed in any one season, multiple cohorts will be studied each year, 
and multiple clinical sources will participate in recruiting donors.   
6.1 General Outline of Activities During Each CHIVITT Cohort  
The CHIVITT is to be conducted as a randomized, open, controlled study. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379376] . After a two -
day run -in period to ensure that Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379377] a specially prepared event room.  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379378]  
(Control Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CR) . Before entering the ir first  Exposure Event  each Intervention Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (IR) will 
be trained on how to comply with the intervention. IRs will be required to wear a lightweight plastic face 
shield, comply with hand hygiene (i.e., using a hand sanitization product every 15 minutes, plus periodic 
hand washing with soap and water), and avoid face touching during each planned exposure event . The 
face shield may only be removed  after leaving  the exposure room  to go to the bathroom, for other short 
comfort breaks, and at mealtimes. In these instances, hand hygiene will be used after removing or 
replacing the face shield; and Donors will not be present . Hand washing with soap and water will be 
required before meals . IR will be separated from Donors by [CONTACT_726] 6 feet during meals. The exposure 
room will be supervised by a trained member of the study staff who will monitor to ensure  that 
Intervention Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379379] , are separated from Donors at meals, and do 
not touch their face s. Small sticks (e.g., coffee stirrers) will be provided to allow IRs to scratch their faces.  
Exposure events  are to occur as controlled (prescribed) activities within the exposure room . Exposure 
events will extend for up to 15 hours per  day when Donors are available  and able to participate  (e.g.,  15 
hours 8am to 11pm) . Each Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379380] 60 hours of Exposure Events  (e.g., 4 days at 
15 hours/day) which may be spread over up to [ADDRESS_474861] of aerosol 
inhalation , we may  alternate the air quality and cleaning  between  high and low air hygiene conditions  
during each quarantine cohort with a wash -out period (for example 2 days) . High air hygiene  conditions  
will be those  where ventilation, filtration, and /or germicidal UV will achieve effective air exchanges of ≥10 
air changes per hour (eACH) , or >10 liters/second/person, or a mean target CO2 concentration of ≤ 200 
parts per million (ppm)  above the outdoor concentration (if high air hygiene is achieved with ventilation 
alone) . Low air hygiene conditions  will be those  where effective air exchanges will be ≤ 0. 7 ACH  or <1 
liter/second/person (similar to an unventilated dorm room at the University of Maryland College Park), or 
a mean target CO2 concentration of ≥2 ,500 ppm (similar to a poorly ventilated public -school classroom) , 
or as low as achievable while controlling temperature  in a comfortable range and relative humidity <40% . 
It is intended that the first CHIVITT (Year 1) will be performed with the low air hygiene, ventilation, 
filtration, and no germicidal UV conditions so that we can determine the attack rate of influenza under 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474862] facilitate  inhalation exposure and  influenza transmission. In 
subsequent years, the air hygiene conditions will be alternated  within each CHIVITT cohort .   
Within the exposure room, digital cameras will be mounted for photography and video recording of the 
exposure events . The photos and video information are used to monitor and characterize the direction of 
exhaled breath, duration and proximity of persons from each other, and other positional information 
which will be needed to develop the analytical models of aerosol tr ansmission. Although the content of 
conversations is not the intent of the recordings, some audio data may be analyzed for “loudness”  and 
audible coughs and sneezes , as a proxy for periods during which higher exhaled breaths may be generated. 
In some CHIVITTs we may employ newer technologies, such as wearable biosensors with geo -positional 
data collection to allow for the investigators to collect data on minute respi [INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and 
proximity.   
When Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379381], the participants will be separated 
as much as possible to avoid transmission outside of the exposure events. Anti -septic hand hygiene 
products will be widely available throughout the area . In-room air filtration and/or germicidal UV fixtures 
will also be used to decontaminate the air of individual hotel rooms and hallways .  
6.2 Duration of Donor Participation  
It is intended that symptomatic influenza -infected Donors be introduced into the CHIVITT as soon as 
possible  after onset of symptoms , while still shedding influenza viruses. When the daily influenza testing 
(e.g., using BioFire Respi[INVESTIGATOR_379382] ) demonstrates no detectable virus, 
which is anticipated to occur by [CONTACT_3450] 3 to 5 days from the initiation of symptoms,  or more than 
three days has elapsed since onset of symptoms,  discharge plans for the participant may be entertained. 
Safe discharge will be contingent upon the absence of sufficient illness which may require escalation of 
care ( section 6.8 ). Donors may also be allowed to withdraw from the study early, for their own personal 
reasons (see section 6.7 ). 
6.[ADDRESS_474863] a significant number of discharged recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], they may participate 
for a shorter period.  It is possible that there may be multiple exposure event activities in a single day or 
there may be days where no exposure event activities are planned (e.g., because there are no donors 
available with shedding virus).  Total time for participation in exposure events will be up to 60 hours over 
the course of a CHIVITT.   
6.4 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379383] (hotel room which includes private bathroom and shower). While in their private room, they will be 
allowed to use the amenities available to them, including watching TV and using the WiFi internet. Th ey 
may engage in their professional work activities (telework) but must understand that their work schedules 
must be highly flexible given the nature of the timing of Donor availability and the timing of some exposure 
events  which will be according to the Donor’s symptomatology and ability to engage in prescribed 
activities. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379384] “isolation” conditions such that they will 
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
19 not be allowed to ingress and egress from the isolation unit at will. Guests will not be permitted during 
the Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s stay on the isolation unit. Limited p ersonal deliveries may be possible but must be 
negotiated for approval with the investigators and may not consist of illicit drugs, weapons, or other forms 
of contraband which could present a hazard to the welfare of the participants or staff members. An 
exercise room equipped with treadmill and/or stationary bicycle is intended to be provided on the 
quarantine research  unit; use of the exercise room’s equipment will be single occupancy with sign -up so 
that inadvertent transmission events can be minimized from this common use space. All meals are to be 
provided through the facility’s food services and outside food deliver ies will not be permitted, unless there 
is a specific need from a participant which has been authorized by [CONTACT_473] (e.g., special dietary 
needs which cannot be accommodated sufficiently by [CONTACT_379449]).  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379385] a reduction in compensation  (i.e., the payment scale will 
be adjusted for failures of compliance ).  
Should a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379386] -confirmed influenza infected (a countable SAR) and have 
accompanying symptoms during the CHIVITT, then the Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379387] a Donor. In order to accept the Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379388] , the Donor informed consent 
form must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_2299]. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225663] a countable SAR and do not 
want to continue in the CHIVITT may be safely discharged, contingent upon the absence of sufficient 
illness which may require treatment of influenza ( section 6.6 ). However, once the [ADDRESS_474864] not become influenza infected, they will be allowed to end their participation 
in the CHIVITT. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379389], for their own personal 
reasons ( see section 6.7 ). 
6.5 Staffing of the Facility  
The facility will be staffed by [CONTACT_379450] 8 am through 5 
pm each day (including weekends). An on -call physician will be available for all hours, including evenings 
and weekends, for the management of illness or to address any questions or concerns from any study 
participants. The on -call physician can make decisions on the treatment of influenza, use of supportive 
care, and escalation of care.  For overnight hours, a thermometer and over the counter antipyretics will 
be made available. Participants will be able to request video or phone call contact [CONTACT_379451]. The on -call physician will use their judgeme nt whether they may need 
to report into the quarantine research unit to directly assess the participant.  
6.[ADDRESS_474865] and supportive care. No later than 72  hours of a Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379390] >102˚F, meeting 
other criteria for a grade 3 adverse event (see Appendix A) , or as required by [CONTACT_379452] , therapeutic intervention with an approved influenza antiviral agent (i.e., oseltamivir or 
baloxavir marboxil) will commence. Meanwhile, the subject will be requested to provide exhaled breath  
specimens; the subject will not be required to participate in additional exposure event  group activities.  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379391] a Donor ; the Donor consent form must be reviewed and signed in order for the participant to 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474866] (now considered an infectious subject) will be instructed to participate in 
exposure event  group activities, as a Donor participant. The participant may choose to terminate their 
participation as a Donor participant at any time before the maximum [ADDRESS_474867] can be 
administered an influenza antiviral agent and may be discharged. Under all circumstances, symptoms of

contacts upon  discharge; the dates of resolution of influenza symptoms are intended to be documented.  
6.[ADDRESS_474868] with symptom -directed, over -the-counter therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aceta minophen, decongestants, or antihistamines.  Oral 
hydration (oral fluids) may be provided, should a subject become dehydrated due to poor appetite.  
Humidification of room air may also be performed to improve the comfort of the participant. Nonetheless, 
support care is intended to be limited for subjects that do not demonstrate any illness criteria that may 
satisfy conditions requiring escalation of care.  
6.[ADDRESS_474869]’s illness may meet criteria for escalation of care, wherein more in -depth 
evaluation and/or treatment of illness may be necessary. Escalation of care may involve referral to the 
local Emergency Room or Urgent Care Center, as the  investigator has deemed the severity of illness to be 
beyond the simple supportive care which can be provided by [CONTACT_379453] -2 facility.  Subjects infected with 
influenza will be monitored for the possible development of severe symptoms and any influenza 
com plications (as outlined in section 2.5.1 ). If a subject has a severe influenza complication(s) or has 
shortness of breath with an SpO 2 <89% or has any 2 severe grade vital signs (see Appendix A  for severity 
grading for vital signs), then escalation of care is to be considered.  
Therapeutic intervention with an approved influenza antiviral agent (oseltamivir or baloxavir marboxil) 
should commence immediately  upon recognition that escalation of care for influenza is necessary  and if 
not yet already initiated. Study physicians have the authority to exercise clinical judgement to initiate 
referral  for pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, institution of supplemental oxygen, or the 
initiation of bronchodilators for management. Escalation of care may also include immediate referral to 
the local urgent care or emergency department for rapid diagno stic testing and/or management. The 
intent is that there will be no delay in providing appropriate escalation of care to study participants and 
that the study physicians document their decision -making process.  UMB and/or its affiliated institutions 
or healthcare groups will not provide financial compensation or reimbursement for the cost of referred 
care that may be provided. The institution or group providing medical treatment will charge the 
participant’s  insurance carrier.  
Meanwhile, the ill subject will not be required to participate in exposure event  group activities and will be 
afforded the time to rest and recover or be referred for higher -level care. Participant preference is 
intended to be honored . However , when the investigator judges that escalation of care is necessary for 
the welfare of the participant  then participation in exposure event  activities will be prohibited . 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474870] discharge is planned at approximately 14 days (for Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379392]) or 2-5 days  (for Donor

observed or reported during the study . 
Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings that are part of mild to moderate influenza disease, including  
mild or moderate fever and lymphopenia from the time of onset of illness  through [ADDRESS_474874] -onset , will 
not be considered AEs . These signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings (mild and moderate) include the 
following: runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache, cough, malaise (tiredness), body 
aches, chills, feverish, shortness of breath, earache, fever, and lymphope nia.  Mild to moderate fever and 
mild to moderate lymphopenia is defined in Appendix A . Influenza infection -related symptoms that are 
deemed by [CONTACT_36687], in addition to severe fever and severe lymphopenia as defined 
in Appendix A , will  be considered as AEs.   
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12218]:  
• Study intervention -related serious adverse events occurring from the time of the first  exposure 
event  until  [ADDRESS_474875] -discharge from the hotel quarantine facility ). 
• Clinical safety laboratory adverse events occurring from the time of the first exposure  event  
through discharge from the hotel quarantine facility . Parameters to be evaluated include white 
blood cells (WBCs), absolute lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelets, alanine transaminase 
(ALT), and creatinine (Cr).  
• Adverse Events – non-serious adverse events occurring from the time of the first exposure 
through approximately [ADDRESS_474876]-exposure. See below for how adverse events are 
defined.  
7.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical intervention regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. 
FDA defines an AE as any untoward medical occurr ence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)) . 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) intervention. The 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474877] exceeded the expected severity or any moderate or severe 
complica tions, as listed in Section  2.5.1 , will be considered unsolicited adverse events and captured on 
the appropriate data collection form and electronic case report form (eCRF). Events that are not consistent 
with illness due to influenza will be considered unsolicited AEs as well. Events that occur after 
administration of antivirals will also be considered unsolicited AEs.  Any chronic or stable medical 
condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseline and not 
reported as an AE. However, if the severity of any pre -existing medical condition increases, it should be 
recorded as an AE.  
Classification of an Adverse Event  
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689] -site investigator who is 
qualified (licensed) to diagnose AE information, provide a medical evaluation of AEs, and classify AEs 
based upon medical judgment. This includes but i s not limited to physicians, physician assistants, and 
nurse practitioners.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)):  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient 
or subject and may require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], e tc. 
SAEs will be:  
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention and alternate etiology (if not related 
to study intervention) only by  [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-investigator  with the training 
and authority to make a diagnosis .  
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE data collection form and eCRF.  
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study clinician.  
• Reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_458], the DMID MO, MM, CPM , and the IRB/IEC.  
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
24 Severity of Event  
All AEs or SAEs  will be assessed for severity according to the toxicity grading scales in Appendi x A. 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity.  
• Mild (Grade 1) :  Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no treatment 
or therapeutic intervention and generally do not interfere with the subject’s usual activities of 
daily living.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) :  Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
• Severe (Grade 3) :  Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affect clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  Severe events are usually 
incapacitating.  
AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The start 
and stop date of each reported AE will be recorded on the appropriate data collection form and eCRF. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be document ed to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of intensity.  
Relationship to Study Intervention  
The licensed study clinician’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study intervention is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in this study. If there 
is any doubt as to whether a clinical obs ervation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship 
to study intervention must be assessed for AEs using the terms: related or not related.  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is e vidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
In this study, solicited symptoms of influenza infection will be collected from the time of first exposure  
event  through [ADDRESS_474878] -exposure.  AEs will be followed through 
resolution. Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to pretreatment status or stabilization of the 
condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators Reporting of AEs  
Information  on all AEs should  be recorded  on the eCRF.  Information to be collected for AEs includes 
event description, date of onset, assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention and alternate 
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
25 etiology (assessed only the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-investigator  with the training and authority to 
make a diagnosis), date of resolution, seriousness,  and outcome. AEs occurring during the study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
All clearly  related  signs,  symptoms,  and results of diagnostic  procedures performed because  of an AE 
should be grouped  together  and recorded  as a single  diagnosis.  If the AE is a laboratory abnormality that  
is part of a clinical  condition  or syndrome,  it should  be recorded  as the syndrome  or diagnosis  
rather  than  the individual  laboratory  abnormality.  Each  AE will also be described  in terms  of duration  
(start  and stop date), severity, association with the  study intervention , action(s)  taken,  and outcome.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators Reporting of SAEs  
Any AE that meets a protocol -defined serious criterion must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours 
of site awareness) on an SAE form to the PI (Wilbur Chen) , at the following address: 
[EMAIL_7352]. Any SAEs that satisfy a reportable new information, according to the 
UMB IRB, will be reported to the UMB IRB.  
In addition to the SAE form, select SAE data fields must also be entered into the DCC system. Please see 
the protocol -specific MOP for details regarding this procedure.  
The DMID Medical Monitor will review and assess the SAE for regulatory reporting and potential impact 
on study subject safety and protocol conduct.  
At any time after completion of the study, if the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_122757]-investigator  
becomes aware of an SAE that is suspected to be related to study intervention, the site principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_122757]-investigator  will report the event to the UMB IRB . 
Unanticipated Problems  
Definition of Unanticipated Problems  (UP)  
The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers 
unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following  criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the  characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to DMID, the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and to the Statistical and Data Management Coordinating Center (SDMCC)/study Sponsor and 
the lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
26 • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and as per reportable new 
information definition. for Serious Adverse Event Reporting within 24 hours of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP which satisfies one of the categories of a Reportable New Information (RNI) event 
will be reported to the IRB within five days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.

be obtained  
• A targeted physical examination may be performed, as directed by [CONTACT_198669], 
medications, and vital signs assessment. An absence of significant past medical history, 
concomitant prescription medications, and abnormalities in vital signs will not r equire a 
physical examination.  
• Review and record medical history* and concomitant medications †.  
*All significant past and current diagnoses will be documented. All signs and 
symptoms (regardless of severity) that the subject has experienced within 30 days 
prior to screening will be documented. Medication allergies will also be documented

DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
27 8.1.2  Exposure Events  
• Exposure events will be held in a large hotel room  each lasting up to several hours . Each 
cohort will experience multiple exposure events over the course of their stay. Each 
exposure event will be either a high or low air hygiene exposure.  
• Low air hygiene conditions will be limited by [CONTACT_379455]’s standard mechanical 
ventilation (~0.7 air changes per hour) and may be further limited by [CONTACT_379456] a poorly ventilated public space while remaining within the 
OSHA permissible exposure limit.  
• High air hygiene conditions will supplement the building’s mechanical ventilation with 
portable HEPA filter units and / or germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection  (either upper -
room [ADDRESS_474880] 222 nm UV -C or similar technologies and wavelengths with 
monitoring to confirm compliance with current ACGIH Threshold Limit Values ). 
• The room in which the exposure events occur will have the ventilation rate, CO 2 
concentration, temperature, and relative humidity continuously monitored and 
supplemental heating, cooling, and dehumidification will be supplied to maintain comfort 
(~20˚C ± 3) and relative humidity <40% .  
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379401] -borne and touch transmission intervention 
(Intervention Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], IR) and control (Control Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CR) within each exposure 
event, except that the initial exposure event may include only CR to assess the SAR and 
power of the study design for the rema ining events.   
• Prescribed group activities will be planned by [CONTACT_379457] -distance 
interactions between study participants (donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). Due to the 
unpredictability of when donors may become available, it is intended to be flexible for 
the scheduling of these events for the time of day, duration, and frequency of number of 
days. For example, donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379402], watching films, eating meals together while ensuring that randomized designated 
IR individuals comply with spray -borne and touch transmission prevention interventions 
(face shield use, hand sanitization, and no -touch -face rules). Outside of the exposure 
events, donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379403] 
“contamination” or transmis sions outside of the prescribed group activities.  
• The conditions of each exposure event, time, duration, and which participants engaged 
in the activity are to be documented in study logs.  
8.1.3  Daily Assessments  
• Vital signs (including SpO 2, HR, RR, BP, and oral temperature) will be obtained at least 
twice daily (intended to be at least once in morning and once in afternoon ). After the first 
two days, vital signs will be collected once a day until after exposure to a Donor or at PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
• A targeted physical examination may be performed, as directed by [CONTACT_198669], 
medications, and vital signs assessment. An absence of significant past medical history, 
concomitant prescription medications, and abnormalities in vital signs will not r equire a 
physical examination.  
• Once daily collection of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_379404] a

DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474882] Donor.  
• Twice daily completion of a Modified Jackson Score, Investigator Assessment Tool 
(Appendix C ). 
• Once daily completion of a self -reported Symptom Diary, FLU -PRO Survey Instrument and 
Validation Diary ( Appendix B ). 
• Additional nasal swab and a saliva sample for research tests . However, these two samples 
will not be collected between the period after the incubation and before the first donor 
arrives.  
• For Donors, Exhaled breath sampling  
8.1.4  Intermittent Assessments  
• Exhaled breath sampling , daily post -onset of infection in Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379405]  
• Venous whole blood (~ 10 mL) collection  
• Nasal swab for viral detection and nasal swabs and saliva for research tests at PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
8.1.5  Assessment within 48 hrs from Influenza Infection (Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840])  
Approximately 48 hrs (window 36 -60 hrs) from virologic -confirmation of influenza infection ( e.g., 
BioFire positive test), a blood volume of ~10 mL will be collected for the following safety labs: 
white blood cells (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), hemoglobin (Hgb), platelets (PLT), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), and creatinine (Cr). The ALC is a v ariable under the Modified Jackson 
score. (see Appendix C for Score).  
8.1.[ADDRESS_474883] be documented with 
signed orders and accompanied by a doctor’s note which provides cli nical assessment and 
judgement.  
• 12-lead electrocardiogram may be performed for complaints of chest pain, pressure or 
tightness, feelings of heart fluttering, or sustained tachycardia.  
• Vital signs measurements may be changed in frequency (e.g., increased frequency) for 
the management of influenza illness  
• Clinical laboratory assessments which might include serum chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, cardiac enzymes, and urinalysis (listing not exhaustive of possible lab 
assessments which could be performed)  
8.1.7  Discharge/exit from a CHIVITT cohort   
• Vital signs (including SpO2, HR, RR, BP, and oral temperature) will be obtained, if not 
completed within the past 12 hours  
• A targeted physical examination may be performed, as directed by [CONTACT_379458] , medications, and vital signs assessment. An absence of concurrent signs or 
symptoms and abnormalities in vital signs will not require a physical examination.  
• Performance of a combined influenza and SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_474884] (e.g., BioFire Respi[INVESTIGATOR_379406]), if not done within the past 12 hours

additional medical care.  
8.1.8  Outpatient Clinic Follow -up Visit (~1 month from CHIVITT)  
Each subject who participated in a CHIVITT cohort will be contact[CONTACT_41576] 4 weeks 
(allowable window is 3 -5 weeks) from their discharge from a CHIVITT cohort. The participant will 
be asked whether they have fully recovered from their influenza illne ss (if any) and whether there 
were any interim unscheduled medical visits. Venous whole blood (~10 mL) will be collected. 
Nasal wash specimen (~5 -10 mL) will be collected. The participant will be afforded the ability to 
ask questions or raise concerns and to be provided the answers.  
8.1.9  Phone call follow -up (~2 months from CHIVITT)  
Each subject who participated in a CHIVITT cohort will be contact [CONTACT_3450] 2 months 
(allowable window is 7 -10 weeks) from their discharge from a CHIVITT cohort. The participant will 
be asked whether they have fully recovered from their influenza illne ss and whether there were 
any interim unscheduled medical visits. The participant will be afforded the ability to ask 
questions or raise concerns and to be provided the answers.  
8.2 Research Laboratory Evaluations  
HAI and FRNT Assays  
The ability of antibodies to inhibit the interaction of hemagglutinin (HA) protein on the surface of influenza 
virus with sialic acids on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) will be examined by [CONTACT_33818] 
(HAI) assay performed on s erum samples from study participants at the specified collection timepoints. 
The readout will be the ability of antibodies to inhibit hemagglutination, HAI titers. For H3N2 viruses that 
have no HA activity, serum antibody will be titred using a focus reduc tion neut ralization test (FRNT) in 
which the ability of the serum to inhibit the formation of infectious foci in cell culture will be measured. 
The HAI and FRNT assays are to be performed with deidentified specimens at a collaborating lab ([CONTACT_379480], Icah n School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, [LOCATION_001], NY). The virus strain -specific HAI or 
FRNT titer will be considered the primary method for determining a participant’s immunity.  
Potential Antibody Assays  if funding is available  
A briefing listing of some of the potential additional antibody assays which may be performed on serum 
and/or nasal wash specimen includes the following:  
• Microneutralization (MN) assay, measures the ability of antibodies to prevent cytopathologic effects 
in cell cultures infected with influenza viruses.  
• Neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay, measure antibodies that block the enzymatic activity of the 
neuraminidase protein (NA), a surface glycoprotein which cleaves sialic acid residues.  
• Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), measures binding antibodies against full -length HA, HA -
stalk, NA, and other influenza antigens.  
DMID Protocol: 21 -0041  Version 6.0 
 01 November  2024  
  
30 • Influenza virus protein microarray, an approach which can measure the “landscape” of serum 
antibodies by [CONTACT_379459].  
• Antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay, functional antibody assay.  
8.[ADDRESS_474885] submit this decision in writing to the principal 
investigator.  
The secondary research use of the banked samples and data will require a separate study protocol with 
IRB approval before the use of the specimens. These residual samples  will be stored with a bar code  for an 
indefinite  period of time at the CVD or the University of Maryland (College Park) .  The linking information 
(to PHI) will be maintained separately in a secured and locked location to which only authorized study 
staff members have access. Subjects will be notified that their residual samples ( e.g., serum and nasal 
specimens) may be used for possible use in secondary research. Subjects will be informed that they cannot 
take part in this study if they do not agree to allow for the identifiable (coded) samples and data to be 
used for secondary research.  Possible use in other research studies may include but is not limited to non -
traditional immune assay development, assessing innate immune factors, cytokines, and other virologic 
evaluations. These residual samples will be stored indefinitely at a central  clinical storage facility and may 
be shared with investigators at the participating site and with other investigators at other institutions . No 
genetic tests will be performed on samples. These specimens are not intended for any genetic studies or 
the creation of cell lines or commercialized products. These specimens would be used in laboratory -based 
assays to try to answer questions related to influenza or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_379408]-induced 
immune responses.  Each sample will be encoded (labeled) only with a barcode and a unique tracking 
number to protect subject confidentiality.   
8.4 Exhaled Breath Sampling  
All Donors and secondarily influenza -infected Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379409] -II cone collector ( and/ or next generation iEBA sampler, when available).  The 
participant will be instructed to sit inside a tented apparatus containing the cone collector.  The 
participant’s face will be placed near the wide part of a metal funnel (the cone -shaped sampling 
instrument) or newer transparent cone with conductive coating. Breath samples are collected through 
the instrum ents gentle and controlled suction of air into the narrow part of the funnel and into the 
instrument’s collection system. Samples will be collected for a [ADDRESS_474886] text (e.g., 
the alphabet), talk loudly, shout, or sing.  The iEBA sampling instrument is able to fractionate different 
sized particles and these fractionated samples can be assayed by [CONTACT_4540], serial passaged 
for detection of low concentrations of virus, and RTqPCR. Within the EMIT -2 program, a newer iEBA 
collection instrument (e.g., Gesundheit -III) will be developed and is intended to be a supplement and 
replace the Gesundheit -II over the course of the [ADDRESS_474887] the tent with a hood resembling a loose -fitting powered air -purifying respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]. It is also 
anticipated that some shorter duration (5 -15 minute) samples may be collected using a spi[INVESTIGATOR_379410]: [ADDRESS_474888] surfaces (fomites) will be  collected and evaluated for the presence of 
influenza virus by [CONTACT_379460] . 
Within the EMIT -2 program’s Advanced Bioaerosol Technology Core (ABTC), a novel ambient sampling 
system will be developed. The following description of the device provides the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_379411]. The device will use a [ADDRESS_474889] impaction of these particles onto solid or liquid surfaces for delivery to in vitro 
assays. Gentle impaction will be achieved by [CONTACT_379461] -containing flow through multiple 
nozzles. Because condensation is achieved at moder ate temperature, and impaction velocities are 
optimized to minimize membrane damage, this technology retains high infectivity of airborne pathogens. 
Significantly, the technology will allow for each system to be tuned for collection into buffer for bulk 
analysis of total viral RNA or into culture media cell inoculation by [CONTACT_379462]; onto hydrogel membranes 
for efficient collection and culture of viable virus; or into an oil phase to form water emulsions enabling 
single aerosol particle analysis.  
Environmental and personal samples will also be collected using NIOSH BC251 cascade samplers – the 
current standard method for bioaerosol collection. The NIOSH BC251 is a two -stage dry cyclone employing 
two 1.[ADDRESS_474890] stage.  Coupled with a small 3.5 liter/minute personal air sampling pump it has been extensively 
used for area as well as personal sampling to monitor viral aerosol exposures of healthcare workers . 
Personal air samples may be collected from Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379412] a waist belt mounted 
personal air sampling pump (weight, approximately 22 oz) and attached shoulder strap for mounting the 
BC251 (<6 oz) in their breathing zone.  
8.[ADDRESS_474891] data that has been coded 
will be made available for secondary research. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and Analytic Code will 
also be made available. Data will be availab le immediately following publication, with no end date.  De-
identified data may be used for secondary research without further consent of the subject. Any coded or 
identifiable data used for secondary research may occur if the subject agreed to use by [CONTACT_379463].  
9 OUTCOMES AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Primary Outcome Measure – Attack Rate of Influenza  
The SAR of influenza infection will consist of virological confirmation, symptomatic infection, or serological 
evidence of an influenza infection.   
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474892]  (which runs 
the Xpert ® Xpress SARS -CoV-2/Flu/RSV  assay ) can be a satisfactory alternative m eans for 
determining influenza infection  from the BioFire Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4406] . 
Qualitative RT -PCR. This research diagnostic test will be used as a secondary means for 
determining influenza infection. The test result may not be available for day -to-day decisions and 
the test may be performed in batched analysis.  
Quantitative RT -PCR. This research diagnostic test will be used as another secondary means for 
the characterization of influenza infection. Peak viral shedding will be calculated for each subject 
as the maximum shedding during their CHIVITT participation period. Total viral shedding will be 
calculated with an area under the curve (AUC) with study day on the x -axis and shedding on the 
y-axis. The test result may not be available for day -to-day decisions and the test may be 
performed in batched analysis.  
9.1.2  Symptomatic Influenza Infection  
Modified Jackson Instrument score . (Appendix C ) Symptomatic influenza infection for 
determining AR will be assessed using a Modified Jackson score collected by [CONTACT_379464] a 
day (approximately 8 AM and after 3 PM) from the time of admission until the time of discharge. 
The Modified Jackson score  will be calculated after evaluation of vital signs, laboratory results, 
and the Modified Jackson score across multiple days.  
FluPro® participant reported tool . (Appendix B ) A previously validated, patient -reported outcome 
(PRO) measure to standardize the assessment of influenza symptoms in clinical research (i.e., FLU -
PRO Survey Instrument and Validation Diary) will be completed by [CONTACT_379465] a day (after 3:00 
PM) from t he time of admission through discharge. The investigators will review the FLU -PRO and 
Validation Diary responses each day.  
Fever . A febrile illness, with or without accompanying symptoms, will be defined as an occurrence 
of an oral temperature of ≥100.2°F (≥37.9°C).  Note: a qualifying temperature of 100.2°F -100.5°F 
does not constitute a gradable toxicity (see Appendix A ).  Elevated temperatures must be 
confirmed with a repeat measurement within [ADDRESS_474893] a limited physical examination of the head, neck, and lungs; a directed or more detailed 
physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the study physician for any reason. 
Physica l examination findings which would be consistent with an influenza infection will include:  
• Nasal discharge  
• Otitis  
• Sinus tenderness  
• Pharyngitis  
• New wheeze, rales, rhonchi, or other lower tract signs

33 9.1.3  Serological Confirmation of Influenza Infection  
Seroconversion . A positive seroconversion will be defined as achieving ≥4 -fold increase in serum 
HAI titer from baseline. The serological assessment will be performed in batched analyses and will 
not be available for day -to-day decisions.  
Seropositive . A seropositive will be defined as a serum HAI titer of ≥[ADDRESS_474894] based on an expected SAR of 25% and two alternate hypotheses that: 
a) long -range aerosol transmission accounts for 75% of transmission and b) contact, fomite, and spray -
borne transmission account for 60% transmission. These hypotheses are essentially attributable fractions, 
not the expected effect size of the interventions. The interventions, unfortunately, cannot cleanly block 
one mode without impacting transmission via other modes. Therefore, we derived the estimated effect 
sizes for the interventions by [CONTACT_379466]. It is assumed that hand hygien e and face shield is 100% effective for contact [CONTACT_379467] -
borne transmission and the effectiveness for short -range aerosols is based on the work of Lindsley5 and 
Bischoff6. The air hygiene (ventilation, filtration, and germicidal UV light) intervention will be designed to 
be 100% effective against long -range aerosol transmission using a validated computational model of these 
systems, to be developed by [CONTACT_379468] [ADDRESS_474895], to achieve the equivalent of > 
[ADDRESS_474896] size of 79% reduction in the observed 
SAR.  To compute power, we use one -sided alternat ives because we do not expect that either intervention 
is capable of increasing transmission.  Given a sample size of [ADDRESS_474897] 
84% power to detect the intervention effect with an alpha level of 5%.  
For power to detect an effect of contact, fomite, and spray -borne transmission, we assume a marginal 
effect size of 76% reduction in observed SAR. Given a sample size of [ADDRESS_474898] 84% power to reject the null hypothesis of no effect with the hand hygiene and face shield.  
9.3 Analysis Plan  
We will plan to analyze the binary outcome (SAR of influenza infection) using a generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) with a logistic link function. Individuals sharing a CHIVITT cohort will be considered as a 
cluster and the dependence will be adjusted by  [CONTACT_379469].  The effect of 
the interventions will be treated as independent,  and the analysis will be controlled for sex, race -ethnicity, 
and age ≥ or < [ADDRESS_474899] sufficient power to perform subgroup analysis. R markdown and reproducible statistical 
analysis will be applied to ensure maximal reproducibility of the data analysis.  
Continuous data will be transformed (e.g., Box -Cox transformation) to meet the normality assumption in 
the analysis. To compare proportions among unpaired samples, we will use logistic regression and adjust 
covariates as needed. For paired samples, we will  use the conditional logistic regression. To examine the 
group effect on the continuous effect, we will use the general linear model. To test for a trend across 
DMID Protocol: [ADDRESS_474900] for trend to compare proportions or Cuzick’s test for trend to 
compare continuous data. Spearman correlation tests will be used to assess correlations between non -
binary ordinal variables. The association of immunol ogical measures and other covariates on the risk of 
infection will be examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a Poisson distribution and 
robust standard errors to overcome the potential overdispersion. Principal components analysis (PCA)  will 
be used to assess the extent to which variables can be summarized using a smaller number of 
components. The potential effects of age and sex will be examined in all multivariable models.

 1.0 Introduction  
Acute Pulmonary Embolism  
Deep  vein thrombosis  (DVT)  occurs  when  a blood  clot forms  in a deep  vein,  typi[INVESTIGATOR_51346]. Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a DVT clot (or fragment) breaks free and  
travels through the heart to the pulmonary arteries and lodges in an artery causing complete or 
partial obstruction. Together DVT and PE comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE) , a major 
public  health  problem  in the United  States  ([LOCATION_003]).  VTE is the third leading cause  of cardiovascular 
death  (1), is estimated  to result  in 5% to 10% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51347]  (2), and the third most  common  
cause of preventable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51348] ( 3). Using the 2007 -9 
National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51349], 548,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51350] 
278,000 were for acute PE ( 4). The annual cost of VTE to the US healthcare system is $7 -10 
billion for newly diagnosed, medically treated VTE cases ( 5). PE is associated with a high short - 
term mortality,  requiring  a timely  and accurate  diagnosis  for the initiation  of antithrombotic  therapy. 
PE is difficult to diagnose on presentation due to the non -specific signs and symptoms for this 
condition such as cough, shortness of breath, hypoxia, tachycardia, and  hemoptysis.  
Computed Tomography Angiography  
Pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard for the detection of 
pulmonary emboli (PE) ( 6), however, radiation exposure and complications related to 
administering intraven ous contrast prohibit universal applicability ( 7). CTA can detect acute PE 
with a sensitivity of [ADDRESS_54244] venography 
(8, 9). In those who are medically ineligible for CTA, ventilation -perfusion (V/Q) single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is commonly acquired to detect PE ( 10, 11). 
However, SP ECT imaging acquisitions requires transporting the patient to the nuclear medicine 
clinic,  a prolonged  acquisition  period  compared  with CTA,  and in many  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51351]. In this study we will investigate an alternative method 
to obtain ventilation and perfusion images from respi[INVESTIGATOR_51352] -contrast CT (commonly 
called 4DCT) that can be performed in the Emergency  Department.  
99mTc-MAA SPECT Imaging  
Wagner reported the first use of radiolabeled macroaggreg ates of albumin (MAA) imaged with 
planar scintigraphy for the detection of pulmonary emboli (PE) causing vascular occlusion ( 12). 
MAA  is composed  of particles  ranging  in size from [ADDRESS_54245] pass after intravenous injection. Their distribution remains fixed 
with a biological  half-life of 11 h and is dependent  on the conditions  at the time of injection.  99mTc- 
labelled MAA (99mTc-MAA) imaged with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
is considered  the standard  method  for the quantitative  determination  of pulmonary  perfusion  (13). 
Alternative  pulmonary  perfusion  imaging  methods  include  positron  emission  tomography  imaging 
following administration of 68Ga-labeled particles or after bolus injection of 13N-N2 (14). Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast agents have been utilized experimentally to image the  
pulmonary vasculature and tissue perfusion ( 15). Quantification of SPECT images requires 
correction of the acquired data for attenuation and scatter ( 16, 17). One approach is to utilize 
spatially correlated CT images to determine the attenuation correction, which has lead to the 
development of SPECT -CT scanners ( 18). The low -dose CT can be utilized to evaluate the lung 
airway archi tecture, lung parenchyma, and pleural space in conjunction with the registered 
perfusion images rivaling CTA in sensitivity and specificity  (19). 
Variation in Pulmonary Perfusion with Breathing  
In a recent study using 99mTc-MAA SPECT imaging, the difference in distribution due to injection 
at maximum  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51353] -hold was measured  (20). Each  subject 
received  SPECT  imaging  after injection  of 99mTc-MAA  in either  maximum  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51354]. 
There  was a posterior  displacement  of the activity  centroid  in each  lung between  the expi[INVESTIGATOR_51355]: 2017 -018 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 04/19/[ADDRESS_54246]. The total mass of the lung parenchyma 
(HU <  –250) for each patient (p1 -3) was 
calculated within the manual segmented lungs 
from the CT values and equation. Note there 
are difference between the three patients’  data 
in amplitude and average  value.  and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51356]. In another study of normal volunteers MRI perfusion imaging obtained  at 
either  maximum  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51357] -holds  revealed  higher  perfusion  at expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (15). 
In a study comparing CT attenuation with SPECT perfusion defects, patients were found to have 
hypo -attenuated  pulmonary  regions  corresponding  to regions  with decreased  perfusion  in 57% of 
acute pulmonary emboli and 88% of chronic embo li cases ( 21). In the same study hyper - 
attenuated regions were found to correspond to regions with hyperperfusion. A method to 
measure  pulmonary  perfusion  based  on subtraction  digital  fluoroscopy  without  contrast  has been 
reported ( 22). In that study subtraction images were generated between chest projection images 
at systole and diastole generating an image representing the perfusion difference. These 
perfusion projection images were corre lated with 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy. Thus, changes in the 
amount  and distribution  of pulmonary  perfusion  throughout  the respi[INVESTIGATOR_51358]. 
Imaging Pulmonary Perfusion Defects with 4DCT  
Simon ( 23) described a technique to calculate the change in fractional content of air within 
pulmonary tissue between anatomically matched CT regions based on a simple model that 
assumes the density changes were solely due to air conten t (see appendix A in ( 24)). We 
successfully applied that model to inhale & exhale breath -hold CT image pairs ( 25) as well as 
4DCT images ( 24, 26) to create ventilation images. However, the amount of blood in the thorax 
and lungs  varies  with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_51359]  (27) 
and decreasing with in spi[INVESTIGATOR_51360] ( 28). Thus violating the 
assumption  of the model.  We found  a cyclic  variation  in the apparent  weight  of the  lung on 4DCT 
(see figure 1 below ( 26)) and others have reported respi[INVESTIGATOR_51361]  (MRI)  (29). The pulmonary  density  changes 
found on 4DCT thus result from both changes in air and blood  content.  
4DCT  derived  ventilation  images  can also be inferred  from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_51362] ( 24) independent of the 
4DCT density values. The Jacobian determinant 
of the deformation field, calculated from the DIR 
result of images depi[INVESTIGATOR_51363], is used to estimate the  local 
volume changes or ventilation ( 24, 30). There is 
a discrepancy  between  the density  based  and the 
Jacobian based ventilation images suggesting a 
method  to extract  respi[INVESTIGATOR_51364] 4DCT images. We hypothesize t he 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_51365]. Each 4DCT 
image set contains information representing the 
density change resulting from both ventilation 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_51366]. 
Extracting both vent ilation and a perfusion -like 
image from the 4DCT image intensities, referred 
to as Hounsfield  Units  (HU),  is our goal.  However,  
novel image processing methods are required to 
extract this information.  
We found a cyclic variation in the apparent mass 
of the pulmonary  parenchyma  (Figure  1) (26). We hypothesize  this variation  is due to changes  in 
pulmonary  perfusion  from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -induced  variation  in cardiac  output  (20, 31, 32). We

Albumin (MAA) perfusion 
images (Figure 2). However, in 
these cases there are matched 
ventilation and  perfusion  
defects  due to malignant  airway  obstruction.  It is unknown  if this process  works  to detect  perfusion 
defects due to pulmo nary emboli, where perfusion is obstructed and ventilation  normal.  
With spontaneous tidal breathing, venous 
return to the right a trium increases with  the 
decrease in intrathoracic pressure ( 33) 
and as a consequence pulmonary arterial 
blood  flow to the lungs  increases  (34). With 
positive pressure ventilation the  opposite  
occurs, positive -pressure inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51367], which decreases venous 
blood flow, RV stroke volume, and 
consequently cardiac output ( 33). We 
expect the decrease in lung mass, or 
pulmonar y blood, with normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_51368] [ADDRESS_54248]/CT and 4DCT to compare 
perfusion with RIBMC defects.

Summary & Significance  
This is a prospective imaging trial of [ADDRESS_54249]/CT and 4DCT imaging on the same day. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_51369] (RIBMC) images will be derived from the 4DCT im age and 
quantitatively compared with the SPECT perfusion images. A 5 patient cohort (cohort 2) to test 
effect of respi[INVESTIGATOR_51370]. A 124 patient cohort (cohort 3) to test the 
sensitivity & specificity of RIBMC was added. Illustrated in Figure 4 below.  
 
Figure  4. Study  design.  15 patients  (cohort  1) found  to have  segmental  or lobar  pulmonary  emboli  on CTA 
will be recruited for this study. All enrolled subjects will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT imaging. 
The 4DCT acquisitions will be performed at a single setting to evaluate reproducibility, prior to the 
SPECT/CT imaging. The primary end -point will be the identification and spatial correspondence of 
pulmonary perfusion def ects on the 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT derived RIBMC images. All  imaging 
will be performed  on the same  day. An additional  5 patients  (cohort  2) with the same  criteria  will be recruited. 
Each will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT imaging as before. They will als o receive two 4DCT acquisitions, 
one with normal breathing and the other with positive pressure breathing using BPAP. 62 patients  (cohort  
3) found to have PE on CTA and [ADDRESS_54250] functional imaging for detection of pulmonary  emboli.

6.0 REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed consent is required prior to participation in this study. The study 
coordinator will inform potential subjects about the study opportunity and ask if 
they would like to participate. If the patient is interested, they will be given an 
opportunity to read the informed consent and authorization document specific to 
the study and ask questions of the study coordinator. The patient will be informed 
about:  1) the rationale  for the study;  2) the logistics  of the study;  3) the risks of the 
study; 4) how the data will be used. Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_20234]. The patient will be given a copy of the consent, and asked to sign 
another copy for our  records.  
6.[ADDRESS_54258] (ROIs) on SPECT perfusion 
(standard) and deficit ROIs on RIBMC will be assessed using Dice similarity coefficient 
(DSC) ( 37). A priori , we expect a DSC of approximately 0. [ADDRESS_54259] 0.85 ( 38) and base our sample size calculations on this degree of 
improvement over a priori expec tations. With three experts delineating ROIs on RIBMC 
and SPECT  images,  we will calculate  an average  (n = 3 experts)  DSC  per patient.  Sample 
size considerations are based on a t -test for the mean DSC. Castillo et al. ( 39) provid e a 
working  DSC  standard  deviation  of ~0.2,  leading  to a standard  deviation  of 0.11 (=0.2/√3) for a 
mean DSC based on three experts. Assuming a significance level of .05, power of 95%, 
and standard deviation of 0.11, we find that [ADDRESS_54260] Functional Imaging (CT -FI) diagnostic 
test, consisting of RIBMC and 4DCT -Ventilation, as well as perform receiver operator

 characteristic  (ROC)  analysis.  We will conduct  a prospective  imaging  study  of [ADDRESS_54261] to the 
known  (CTA  defined)  PE diagnosis.  A score  of 1 (low)  to 5 (high)  will be assigned  to each 
defect for the ROC  evaluation.  
Because  PE status  of the subjects  will be known  a priori,  we may use the statistical  theory for 
estimating a single proportion to determine the sample size needed to estimate the 
sensitivity or specificity of the CT -FI diagnostic test. Assuming that the sensitivity will be 
(at least)  approximately  80%,  we can estimate  the true sensitivity  with a margin  of error  of 
10% (percentage points) with 95% confidence based on a sample size of [ADDRESS_54262]  an "Area  under  the ROC 
Curve" (AUC) greater than 50%, it is not necessary to have a prevalence value for PE 
(since PE status is known a priori). To detect an AUC of at least 70% with Type I error of 
1%, power 95% and a 1:1 ratio of cases:controls we require at least 60 cases and 60 
controls ( 40). Our study is designed to exceed the minimal sample size  requirements.

patient  for this study  is estimated  at 44.[ADDRESS_54264]/CT tests.  The patients recruit ed to this study will have 99mTc-MAA 
SPECT/CT  imaging  at study  entry.  No changes  are made  to the clinical  SPECT/CT

feeling of claustrophobia while lying in the scanner. The scanner is open at both 
ends and an open dialogue with doctors and staff will be maintained to minimize 
this risk. SPECT/CT imaging utilizes ionizing radiation. The radiation dose will be 
approximately 4.[ADDRESS_54265].

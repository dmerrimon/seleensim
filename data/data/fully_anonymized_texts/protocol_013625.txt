[INVESTIGATOR_808887]  
1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of motor control deficit guided personalized training on SSWS 
compared to non- personalized and control interventions. Hypothesis: Individuals receiving walking 
rehabilitation personalized to their baseline motor control deficit (INC LINE for low Pp and DECLINE for 
high Pp)  will exhibit significantly improved SSWS compared to those receiving non- personalized and 
control interventions. 
 
Specific Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of motor control deficit guided personalized training on increasing 
symmetry of Pp compared to non- personalized and control interventions. Hypothesis : Individuals receiving 
walking rehabilitation personalized to their baseline motor control deficit will exhibit significantly 
improved symmetry of Pp compared to those receiving non-personalized and control interventions. 
 
Specific Aim 3: Determine if the personalized intervention increase the positive response rate compared to 
non-personalized and control interventions, and to further advance personalize interventions by [CONTACT_808900]. Hypothesis 3.1: A higher percentage of individuals receiving personalized 
interventions will “respond” than those  receiving non- personalized and control interventions. Hypothesis 
3.2: Discreet sets of clinical and biomechanical variables will predict responses in those with differ ing 
baseline motor control deficits.  
 
2.0 Background  
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Deficits Associated with stroke:   Stroke is the leading cause of long- term disability in the [LOCATION_002], 
affecting approximately 795,[ADDRESS_1118424] some degree of long mobility deficits,2 and less than 50% 
of survivors progress to independent community ambulation.[ADDRESS_1118425] in balance and gait speed, with 60% of persons post -stroke 
reporting limitations in mobility related to walking.4,[ADDRESS_1118426] often stated goal of 
patients immediately following a stroke6 and after discharge to the community,7 and interventions designed 
to maximize functional ambulation skills are critical to promote activity and  social reintegration.8 The 
ability to walk an adequate distance at sufficient speed is a critical predictor of mortality, cardiovascular 
disease, and mobility disability9 and improving gait function has the potential to improve the quality of life 
of the 15,000 Veterans who survive stroke annually.10 
Anterior propulsion is critical for retraining walking:  Generation of forces required to propel the body forward during walking is an essential requirement of locomotion.
11 We developed the measure, paretic 
propulsion (Pp) to quantify this crucial force generation in those with post -stroke hemiparesis and it has 
emerged as perhaps the most used mechanistic measure of walking performance. Pp describes the contribution of the paretic leg in propelling the center of mass (COM) forward during walking and is defined as the percentage of propulsion performed by [CONTACT_808901] g.
12 The percentage of propulsion generated by 
[CONTACT_808902] c alculated by [CONTACT_808903] (the positive time integral of the 
anterior/posterior force curve) performed by [CONTACT_808904] 002; 01/06/2023 
 Page 2 of 16   by [CONTACT_635144] (see Preliminary Studies). Importantly, Pp has relatively little dependence, if any, on walking 
speed. Propulsion is associated with the muscle activity in the plantarflexors, with increased gastrocnemius and soleus electromyographic activity relating to increased propulsion of the paretic limb.
[ADDRESS_1118427] targeted propulsion as a primary outcome
17 and predictor of gait outcomes.18 This proposal 
aims to not only expand the use of propulsion to define the motor control deficit but also to indicate an intervention tailored to specifically to that pattern of deficit in order to improve the overall effects of the intervention. 
Relevance to the VA : According to the 2014 VA Stroke Quality Enhancement Research Initiative 
(QUERI), approximately 15,[ADDRESS_1118428] approaching $[ADDRESS_1118429] 6 months.
10,19 As the stated mission of the Stroke -QUERI is to 
“improve care and outcomes for Veterans at risk of ischemic stroke and those who have sustained an 
ischemic stroke,” it is imperative to develop interventions and frameworks to manage care efficiently and optimize outcomes. The VA stroke clinical practice g uideline strongly recommends a comprehensive motor 
recovery program early in stroke rehabilitation “emphasizing progressive difficulties, repetition, and functional task practice.”
[ADDRESS_1118430] that motor recovery interventions, including 
ambulation interventions, should include cardiovascular fitness and strengthening.20 In addition, the VA 
Blueprint for Excellence lists as one of its primary strategies to “advance health care that is personalized , 
proactive , and patient -driven, and engages and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_808888] -being.”21 Interventions that are specifically tailored to baseline biomechanical assessments, that 
are designed to improve force production and cardiovascular status via task -specific training, and are 
translatable to VA clinics and beyond meet the critical needs of the VA in support of its Veterans with stroke. 
 INNOVATION 
Biomechanical Definition of Motor Control Deficits :  We have biomechanically defined post -stroke 
walking patterns based on Pp:  1) low Pp  is the predominant pattern and is associated with increased and 
early paretic flexor EMG activity, lengthened paretic step length, and decreased paretic hip extension13,22; 
and 2) high Pp pattern is characterized by [CONTACT_808905], shortened 
paretic step length, and prolonged paretic hip extension13,22 (see Preliminary Studies for how these are 
defined).[ADDRESS_1118431]- stroke deficits.  
 
Treatment Determined by [CONTACT_808906]:   Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_808889]: 1) low Pp by [CONTACT_808907]24,25; 
and 2) high Pp by [CONTACT_244261] a declined treadmill, limiting hip extension and promoting effective stance to 
swing transitions, increasing knee flexion, and encouraging improved knee extensor eccentric control.24,25 
 Manipulation of Task Mechanics to Meet Specific Training Goals:  Successful uphill walking requires 
increased force production bilaterally in order to maintain forward progression.  Specifically, 
Version 002; 01/06/[ADDRESS_1118432] -stroke with body- weight support (BWS) and a 10% incline and compared to a group 
undergoing level treadmill training with BWS.29 Incline -trained individuals demonstrat ed significant 
improvements over the control group in walking speed (p=0.002) and paretic step length (p=0.02). 
However, all individuals trained at the same direction of treadmill inclination.29 
Although less studied, downslope walking has also been utilized in the training of individuals after 
neurologic injury. Incline and decline training are both associated with improved endurance, overground 
walking speed, and dynamic balance control.30 Randomized controlled trials in individuals with Parkinson’s 
Disease31 and Multiple Sc lerosis32 demonstrate significant improvements associated with downhill walking 
in mobility , functional activities, balance, and strength of the knee extensors. This knee extensor strength 
improvement primarily is associated with improved eccentric control of the knee extensors, and the trailing 
limb increases negative (eccentric) work productio n with increased slope of the treadmill.33 The increased 
negative work production at the knee is likely associated with the decline training effects of increased knee 
flexion and improved stance to swing transitions. Electromyographic and kinetic analyses demonstrate an 
increase in power absorption during downslope walking and increases in extensor activity, representative 
of increased eccentric control of the knee exten sors.27,34 Downslope walking is also effective in the 
examination of spi[INVESTIGATOR_808890], demonstrating decreases in spi[INVESTIGATOR_808891].
35 In addition, acceleration of the center of mass (see Preliminary Studies) is 
significantly increased in the transition from stance to swing,24,25 further indicating the viability of this 
treatment  for individuals with deficits related to decreased knee flexion, poor power absorption, and 
difficulty transitioning from stance to swing.  
 Predicting Responders to a Novel Locomotor Rehabilitation Intervention:  Many types of locomotor rehabilitation te chniques (activity- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],
36 lower extremity strengthening,37 aerobic 
conditioning,38 functional electrical stimulation39) produce robust changes in functional outcomes such as 
increased self -selected walking speed (SSWS).  However, no single intervention is shown to be superior in 
producing these functional changes.[ADDRESS_1118433] functional e ffects.

Intervention  
Version 002; 01/06/2023 
 Page 4 of 16   Personalized Intervention:   Each participant will be randomized to receive either INCLINE, DECLINE, or 
CONTROL training. During training, each participant will be asked to walk without an assistive device or 
ankle- foot orthosis (although an AirCast will be allowed for medial -lateral stability if necessary). For all 
INCLINE and DECLINE training, individuals will walk for 20 minutes at a 10- degree treadmill tilt, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_808892] (see “Vital Sign Monitoring” below). As many subjects post -stroke take a beta blocker or other medications that prevent heart rate and blood pressure 
increases during exertion, a rating of perceived exertion (RPE, must be below “very hard”) will also be collected and adverse events will be strictly monitored. For DECLINE  training, the treadmill will be tilted 
to 10 degrees with the belt reversed and the participant facing in the opposite direction.  While participants will be allowed to support themselves with the use of handrails for balance as required, they will wear a  
climbing harness attached to an overhead support system to prevent falls and thus minimize handrail use. Our previous work was completed at 8 degrees of tilt (see Preliminary Studies), based on work by [CONTACT_808908]. demonstrating that [ADDRESS_1118434] 50% of their current overground SSWS, determined at the beginning of each training week, but training as fast as they feel comfortable up to the overground SSWS.

4.0 Study Endpoints  
Outcome Measurement  
Paretic Propulsion (Pp):   Pp is a quantitative measure of the coordinated output of the pare tic leg and is 
defined as the percentage of propulsion performed by [CONTACT_808909].12 The percentage of propulsive forces 
generated by [CONTACT_808910] (the time integral of 
the anterior/posterior force curve) performed by [CONTACT_808911]. Importantly, Pp has relatively little dependence, if any, on walking speed. Our instrumented treadmill gives us the ability to measure this quantity in much more detail than would be possible in a conventional gait laborator y because we can easily record a large number of step cycles in a single 30 -
second trial. Statistics will be run on the absolute deviation from normal (Deviation = |0.5 - Pp|).  
Biomechanical Walking Testing:  F
 or instrumented treadmill assessments, particip ants will wear their own 
low-heeled shoes. A safety harness (Robertson Mountaineering) mounted to the laboratory ceiling will be 
worn by [CONTACT_808912]. Each participant will be asked to walk without an assistive device or ankle -foot orthosis (although an AirCast will be allowed for medial -lateral 
stability if necessary). Participants will be permitted to practice treadmill walking until they feel comfortable walking without assistive devices, orthotic devices  or support from the handrails. During the 
acclimation period, a trained staff member will offer any support the subject may require. This will continue until the participant feels comfortable enough to begin data collections. Ground reaction force data wi ll be

data on the treadmill, subjects will walk for approximately 10 seconds to achieve steady state prior to the 
30 seconds of data collection (40 seconds per trial). Two trials will be collected at the treadmill self -selected 
speed and two trials at the fastest comfortable speed. Biomechanical data collections will allow for secondary analyses of associated kinematic and kinetic variables (e.g. force impulse, COMa by [CONTACT_808913], joint moments/power/work, and joint angles). At baseline testing, post-testing, and at the beginning of each session , participants will walk on a 16 ft. long gait mat (GAITRite ) to measure SSWS and fastest 
comfortable walking speed (FCWS) and other spatiotemporal parameters. Subjects will be permitted a practice trial, and then be asked to complete two trials at each speed. A safety harness mounted to the ceiling will protect th e subject but will only support their body weight in the case of a loss of balance.  
Trained study personnel will be present for all testing sessions as needed.  Clinical Assessments: The proposed assessments are standard to most post -stroke intervention t rials. As 
the primary aim of this proposal is to improve functional outcomes using an intervention that is clinically translatable, it is imperative to include assessments routine to clinical rehabilitation. The below measures reflect a battery of body structure and function, activity, and participation measurement to reflect a broad range of clinical assessment across the rehabilitation model (ICF) as has been previously advocated.

• Walking Speed:  We will assess SSWS and fastest comfortable walking speed in meters per second 
over a [ADDRESS_1118438] -stroke has been established at 
0.84m/s,[ADDRESS_1118439] reliability (ICC=0.95 to 0.99) and interrater/intrarater reliability 
(0.87 to 0.88).3,52 Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for SSWS for stroke survivors 
of 0.16 m/s53 allows for the clinician to set meaningful walking speed goals, while providing a 
classification for researchers via cut off scores:  <0.4 m/s representing likely limited hous ehold 
ambulators, 0.4- 0.8 as limited community ambulatory profile, and >0.8 m/s as community ambulators.3  
• [ADDRESS_1118440] (6MWT) : Timed walking tests are primarily a measure of functional capacity.[ADDRESS_1118441] the Rivermead Mobility I ndex (r=0.75) and 10- meter walk time (r= -0.61).
55 The 6MWT has a 
high intra- and interrater reliability (ICCs = 0.82 -0.95).56 The Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) for 
individuals with chronic stroke is 120 feet57 and the MCID is 113 feet.58  
• F unctional Gait Assessment (FGA):  The FGA is modified from the Dynamic G ait Index and includes 
10 items to assess dynamic balance stability during gait.  Each item is scored on a 4- point scale from 
0 (poor) to 3 (excellent) with a maximum score of 30.  The MDC is 4.2 points,59 A score 22 or below 
out of 30 is predictive of falls in older adults (sensitivity and specificity each 85%).60   
• F ugl- Meyer Assessment of Motor Function:  We will utilize the lower extremity (LE FM Assessment) 
portion of the assessment to characterize our participant sample. The LE FM Assessment is a measure of motor recovery post-stroke and includes measures of reflex, motor control, and coordination with a total score of 34.  We will also evaluate separately the 22 -point motor sub- score as well as the LE 
sensory portion.
61  
• S troke Impact Scale (SIS):   The SIS is a stroke -specific outcome measure that includes 59 items 
covering nine domains: Strength, Hand function, ADL/IADL, Mobility, Communication, Emotion, Memory and thinking, Participation/Role function, and Perceived recovery. Standard error of measurement, MDC, and MCID have been published providing clinicians key metrics to measure the clinical change and significance of the questionnaire.
59  The SIS is responsive to change at 1- 3 and 1-
6 months62 (with a greater total responsiveness than the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SRM

(ICC = 0.82 and 0.80 respectively)63 with s ome deviations for specific domains.   
• Activities of Balance Confidence: The ABC is a commonly used 16 item subjective measure of 
confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling or experiencing a sense of 
unsteadiness (falls self -efficacy). Items are graded 0 -100% with higher scores representing increasing 
confidence in functional activities.  Standard error of measurement has been published as 6.[ADDRESS_1118443] yet to be published.  A cut -off score of 81.1 can 
provide some evidence that the patient/subject doesn’t have a history of falls.65 Total score normative 
data reveals a mean (SD) of 86.3 ±17.364 indicating that the average stroke survivor likely has some 
reduced confidence in their ability to perform ADLs/iADLs without loss of balance.  The ABC is designed to be used multiple times on a single patient with excellent 4- week test -retest reliability (ICC 
= 0.85) including item level metrics (ICC = 0.53-0.93).

Sample Size Determination and Statistical Approach:   A total of [ADDRESS_1118446] -stroke will be 
recruited for this study. We are assuming an attrition rate of 20% resulting in a final sample size of 60 for 
statistical analyses, ideally 10 in each combin ation of baseline group (low and high Pp) and intervention 
(INCLINE, DECLINE, and CONTROL training). 10% is consistent with attrition rates from previous trials of locomotor rehabilitation conducted by [CONTACT_27156],

based on the novelty and intensity of the intervention. There will be two strata of 30 individuals each with baseline low Pp and high Pp, respectively. From those strata, using block randomization, the subjects will be equally randomized into the INCLINE, DECLINE, and CONTROL training (10 in each training cell).  
 
7.0 Setting 
The research will be done at the MUSC/VA Rehabilitation Research space located at [ADDRESS_1118448]. 
Charleston, SC [ZIP_CODE].  The following labs will be utilized: 
Locomotor Energetics and Assessment Laboratory (LEA):  The LEAis a 988 square foot laboratory 
located in the College of Health Professions Research Building on the campus of Medical University of 
South Carolina. The laboratory is a shared resource of the college and is supported in part by [CONTACT_232723]. The laboratory is located in the same building as the offices of the PI, Co-I and staff. It features equipment capable of collecting kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic, strength, and metabolic data. A substantial investment in improving the capabilities of the laboratory will be funded by [CONTACT_808915]. The motion analysis laboratory is adjacent to a small workshop available for the construction, repair, and alteration of simple mechanical devices.

 Page 8 of 16   The Locomotor Rehabilitation Laboratory (LRL): is a state -of-the-art treatment laboratory, designed to 
offer a full range of locomotor interventions for those with impaired walking secondary to neurologic 
injury. The LRL is an 808 square foot laboratory located on the second floor of the College of Health Professions Research Building, Room C-213. The laboratory houses a ZeroG mobile body weight support system (only the 6th one installed nationally) designed to create a permissive environment for retraining walking ability not only over a treadmill, but also over level ground and environmental obstacles. Research participants will have access to a Woodway split -belt treadmill, for training cardiovascular 
endurance as well as lower extremity strength and power. Additional assessment capabilities include: [ADDRESS_1118449] injury. The overall goal is to understand and improve clinical 
decision making relative to locomotor interventions. 
Motor Performance Laboratory (MPL): The MPL is an approximately [ADDRESS_1118450] injury and/or healthy controls. An additional focus is the development of effective interventions to counteract these neuromuscular impairments and improve overall function, activity, and participation. Research participants will have access to a Woodway treadmill, a Precor elliptical trainer, Shuttle Systems jump trainers (MVP and 2000), recumbent and upright bikes, NUSTEP Recumbent Stepper, Full metabolic and EKG cart, and passive safety rail and harness system all aimed at improving and measuring lower extremity function and physical function.   
The Functional Neuro-S
 timulation Laboratory (FNSL): The FNSL is located on the 2nd floor of the 
College of Health Professions Research Building on the campus of Medical University of South Carolina.

motor control deficits. 72 individuals with unresolved propulsion asymmetry after chronic stroke (greater than six months post -stroke, so 
additional natural recovery is not expected) will be e valuated 
to determine their baseline level of Pp:  low Pp (≤ 0.47) and high Pp (≥ 0.53) (0.[ADDRESS_1118459] deviations around the mean for healthy controls). Individuals will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups (INCLINE, DECLINE, 
or CONTOL training), and we will recruit into each training group an equal number of 10 individuals with low or high Pp (Figure 6). Each participant in INCLINE training will walk four [ADDRESS_1118460] speed they can tolerate f or 5 minutes (up to 
SSWS and at least 50% of SSWS) on a 10% up-sloped treadmill followed by 6 minutes of level overground walking at the pace that they can maintain (breaks are allowed as necessary while the clock continues to run). INCLINE training will focus on increasing force production and promoting increased and symmetrical hip extension. Those in DECLINE training will also walk with the same number of bouts, intensity, and overground walking as INCLINE on a 10% down-sloped treadmill, limiting hip extension, and promoting effective stance to swing transitions through increased knee flexion and eccentric control of the knee. During the 6- minute walk, each participant will 
focus on specific gait details targeted in the INCLINE/DECLINE trials (e.g. increa sed hip extension, 
increase paretic leg loading, or improved stance to swing transition. CONTROL participants will walk four 5-minute bouts at their SSWS on a flat treadmill followed by 6 minutes of level overground walking at the SSWS, controlling for equal time of walking activity. Placement into the INCLINE, DECLINE, or CONTROL training groups will be randomized based on a computerized randomization by [CONTACT_4305]. Each individual will complete 12 sessions (three times a week for four weeks). Clinical and biomechanical outcome measures will be collected pre- and post -training and after a one -month follow -up 
period. In addition, we will collect a battery of clinical outcome measures before and after training. Spatiotemporal variables (including SSWS) will be collected before and after each session. All clinical and biomechanical assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_808920].

(INCLINE, DECLINE, and CONTROL training). 10% is consistent with attrition rates from previous trials 
of locomotor rehabilitation conducted by [CONTACT_27156],[ADDRESS_1118464] chosen a more conservative rate of 20% 
based on the novelty and intensity of the intervention. There will be two strata of 30 individuals each with baseline low Pp and high Pp, respectively. From those str ata, using block randomization, the subjects will 
be equally randomized into the INCLINE, DECLINE, and CONTROL training (10 in each training cell). The power analysis was based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_808895] . For the power analysis, we used a repeated measures model with an AR(1) correlation value 
of 0.[ADDRESS_1118465] deviation of 0.35 (also obtained from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) and 80% power, with [ADDRESS_1118466] correlat ion across time (which we anticipate to be high) this 
could also provide additional power. Therefore, in a secondary analysis we will be able to examine several covariates, including the sub- types mentioned above. For each Aim, each variable will be assess ed utilizing 
a repeated measures analysis of variance (baseline Pp, group and time) to evaluate the interaction between baseline Pp, group and time as well as the main effects of treatment for each group and group assignment at each time point. Since pi[INVESTIGATOR_808896] a log transformation of SSWS, we will assess the final SSWS 
outcome for normality and perform a transformation if necessary. All power estimates were conducted by a biostatistician ([CONTACT_798528]) using PASS 2008 (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah). Spaghetti plots and 
descriptive statistics regarding HR, BP, and RPE responses to INCLINE and DECLINE training will be 
reported prior to formal analyses. Patterns of attrition between the [ADDRESS_1118467]. Serious adverse 
events are defined as 1) being unexpected; 2) related to a subject’s participation in research; and 3) that 
subjects are at greater r isk of harm than was previously recognized. If > than 10% in each cell have a serious 
adverse event, we will evaluate the circumstances and decide if the event was caused by a particular treatment. If a majority of team or the IRB decides that the adverse event was related to intervention, 
subsequent randomizations will be stopped. 
 
 
 12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects  (if applicable)  
Version 002; 01/06/2023 
 Page 12 of 16   Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_21639] -site R&D IRB approved VA research staff (i.e.  research 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], research assistant, investigator, coordinator, or other associated trained staff) in a private room 
located at the Center for Rehabilitation Research in Neurological Conditions (CNNRC), Dept. of Health Sciences and Research, MUSC, [ADDRESS_1118468], MSC 700, Charleston, SC.2nd Floor, Room C214 and 
213 (designated VA space through MOU between MUSC and VA). 
All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_808897] (intake form) will be stored in a locked office 
located on the 2nd floor, Room C213, north wall, in a badge access and secure building at the Medical University of South Carolina ([ADDRESS_1118469], Charleston, SC, designated VA space through a Memorandum of Understanding between MUSC and VA ). 
 
13.0 Risks to Subjects  
Potential Risks: There are no significant risks to the subjects in the proposed training methods. The risks 
to individuals participating in this study are no greater than the risks when providing conventional physical 
rehabilitation services to an individual after stroke. The same precautions and safety guidelines will be 
taken that are provided in patient care in rehabilitation settings. The rehabilitation program should not present a risk for the patient but could result in muscle soreness and/or joint stiffness but these symptoms should not persist more than a few days. There is a minimal risk for muscle strains during the testing and training. The locomotor assessments used in the proposed study are routine, clinical assessments of gait used in physical therapy clinics and rehabilitation facilities. The GAITRite system has been used to assess walking performance with no adverse reactions or report of discomfort. The experimental protocol to be used in this portion of the proposal involves minimal risk, and is considered standard clinical practice. During all treadmill walking trials and training sessions, a safety harness will be worn and a trained staff member will be present to provide assistance in the event of loss of balance. During training, individuals will be allo wed to use a small amount of body weight support (≤ 20% of body weight) to facilitate 
independent walking.  The harness will be designed to eliminate the consequences of falling as the device “catches” the subject should they trip or stumble. The presence of this device affords comfort and diminishes the “fear of falling” in subjects.  
[CONTACT_798528] has been granted permission to break the blind of the data to ensure that randomization to each group is not harmful to the participants. This plan is thoroughly described in the Research Plan and Human Subjects sections.  All serious adverse events will be analyzed by [CONTACT_808922]. Serious adverse events are defined as 1) being unexpected; 2) related to a subj ect’s participation in research; and 3) that subjects are at greater risk of harm than was previously 
recognized. If greater than 10% in each cell have a serious adverse event, we will evaluate the circumstances and decide if the event was caused by a part icular treatment. If a majority of team or the 
IRB decides that the adverse event was related to intervention, [CONTACT_798528] will stop randomizing that patient profile into that group. 
Protection Against Risk:  A licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808898]. In addition, during all treadmill walking trials, a safety harness will be worn to provide assistance in the event of loss of balance. The research staff will closely monitor the subject to ensure their com fort. 
Any adverse events will be recorded and monitored as required by [CONTACT_232730]. In the event of an adverse medical event, standard facility emergency procedures will be followed and proper personnel notified. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_788788] a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808899] [ADDRESS_1118470] at any time without prejudice. Minimization of risk will be accomplished by [CONTACT_808923] 5 minutes within prescribed criteria for termination of the training session. We will follow the Ame rican College of Sports Medicine criteria for terminating an exercise session which 
Version 002; 01/06/2023 
 Page 13 of 16   includes: subject complaints of light -headedness, confusion, or dyspnea; onset of angina; excessive blood 
pressure changes (systolic BP greater than 220 mmHg, diastolic BP greater than 110 mmHg); and 
inappropriate bradycardia (drop in heart rate >10 beats per minute).  
Confidentiality: All records regarding participation in this study will be kept in locked file cabinets in the 
appropriate laboratories and/or offices, and stored on password- protected computers/servers in the offices 
and laboratories of the PI’s research team. There will be no direct link to participant identifying information (other than subject code) without access to a password- protected computer containing the identifying 
information linking information to a given subject. Access to linked identifiers is limited to research personnel intimately involved with the human subjects. All data and records acquired from subjects is for research purposes only and will be kept confidential and maintained in a secure database identifiable only by [CONTACT_232729]. The results of the study may be published for scientific purposes; however, subjects’ identities will not be revealed and data will not be traceable to any individuals in any resultant publications. The information gathered during this study will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
Subjects with who participate in this study may see improvements in th eir functional ability, but any benefit 
cannot be guaranteed. Others may benefit from advancement of scientific knowledge. Given the minimal risks involved and the potential for improved functional capacity, the potential benefits of participation make the potential risks reasonable

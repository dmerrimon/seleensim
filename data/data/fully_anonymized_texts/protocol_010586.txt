Confirmation  of 
Main 
Antipsychotic  At Screening, a blood sample will be  collected to confirm the presence 
or absence of the identified main  antipsychotic. 
Safety and 
Tolerability Assessments  Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_431817], vital signs, 
ECGs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory tests (including urinalysis), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale(AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), the Simpson -
Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety information on a regular basis throughout the study. 
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments and Endpoints  At each predefined timepoint, PK samples will be obtained for 
measurement of concentrations of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] , its metabolite AC -279, 
and the main antipsychotic.  When possible, an additional PK sample will be collected from subjects who experience a serious adverse event  
(SAE ) or an adverse event ( AE) leading to discontinuation, as soon as 
possible after the occurrence of that event.  
For all PK samples (scheduled and unscheduled), the dates and times of administration of the last [ADDRESS_546521] dose prior to the SAE or AE should also be recorded.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] p lasma concentration data will remain blinded until the 
Page 11 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  31 March 20 17 
Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 unblind ing of the clinical database at the end of the study.  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints:  
• Plasma concentration of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], AC-279, and the main 
antipsychotic 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_431762] a population pharmacokinetic approach  
• PK/PD using appropriate PK/PD analysis methods  
Pharmacogenomic 
Assessments  A blood sample will be collected at Baseline or later from consenting 
subjects for potential future pharmacogenomics analyses (where local 
regulations permit).  
Data for genetic analyses  will be anonymized, as is the customary 
approach according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . 
Sample Size 
Calculations The planned sample size is 380 (190  subjects per treatment group).  
Assuming the true difference in the mean change in the NSA-[ADDRESS_546522] deviation is 12.8 points, 171 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide 90% power to detect a difference between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431763] a significance level of 0.05, using a 2-sided t- test. 
Adjusting for a potential non-evaluable rate of up to 10%, approximately 380 subjects (190 subjects per treatment group) will be enrolled . 
Statistical 
Methods  The safety analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]).  Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that they actually received.  The safety analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The full analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one  dose of blinded study drug and who have both a baseline value 
and at least one  post-baseline value for the NSA-16 total score.  
Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment.  The full 
analysis set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints . 
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set will be defined prior to unblinding 
the study for the final analysis.  Subjects will be analyzed based on thei r 
randomized treatment assignment.  The PP analysis set will be used for sensitivity analyses of selected efficacy endpoints . 
The PK analysis set includes all subjects in the safety analysis set who have sufficient PK data.  
Subgroup Analysis  
Selected analy ses will be performed in subgroups defined by 
[CONTACT_1617] (North America, Europe, or rest of world).

Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 Additional subgroup analyses may be specified in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP).  
Descriptive Statistics  
Continuous measurement results will be reported using the number of 
subjects with data values, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.  For each categorical outcome, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be reported. 
Missing Data 
Handling of missing values will be described in detail in the SAP.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of missing data, including analyses based on a missing not at random assumption. 
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_145423] . 
The NSA -16 total score will be analyzed using mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM).  The dependent variable will be the change from Baseline in the NSA -16 total score.  The independent variables in the 
model will include the following:  treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit (Week  2, Week  4, Week 8, Week  14, Week 20, and 
Week  26), the treatment- by-visit interaction, geographic region (North 
America, Europe, or rest of world), the Basel ine NSA -[ADDRESS_546523] squares means at Week 26 and will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 (2-sided) using the full analysis set. 
The change from Baseline in the PSP score will be analyzed using an MMRM model similar to that described above for the primary endpoint, 
except that the visits will include Week [ADDRESS_546524] squares means at Week 26 and will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 (two- sided) using the full analysis set.  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used  to control the Type [ADDRESS_546525] terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation, TEAEs related to s tudy drug, TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_764], fatal TEAEs, SAEs, and SAEs related to study drug 
will all be summarized.  Other TEAEs of special interest may also be

 summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs and weight, and clinical 
laboratory paramet ers, including changes from baseline, will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_11191].  Additionally, categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with International Conference o n Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] , its active metabolite (AC -
279), and the main antipsychotic will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Results may be used for other ana lyses (e.g., 
population PK modeling), which will be presented in a separate report. 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to describe the exposure response relationship between pi[INVESTIGATOR_431764]/PD methods .  Results will be 
presented in a separate report.

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disease that affects approximately 2.4 million 
adults in the [LOCATION_002].  The lifetime prevalence is about 1% worldwide 
(McGrath  et al., 2008).  The onset of symptoms generally occurs among people 16 to 30 
years of age.  Positive symptoms of psychosis are necessary to establish a diagnosis; 
however, other symptom clusters, including negative, cognitive, and general psychopathology symptoms, are also highly prevalent and contribute significantly to the 
disabilit y and functional impairment of people with the disease.  Throughout life the course 
of the symptoms fluctuate, with acute exacerbations being treated and followed by [CONTACT_431818] a relapse occurs.  The chronic nature of schizophrenia and 
enduring positive and negative symptoms pose a significant need for safe and effective 
long- term treatment.  
According to the Worl d Health Organization, schizophrenia is included as one of the seven 
most disabling diseases in adults aged between 20 and 45 years, surpassing diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and HIV- AIDS (Ebdr up et al., 2011).  Indeed, 40% to 80% of pa tients 
with schizophrenia have a reduced capability for learning and working, 
performing self-c are, 
and maintaining interpersonal relationships and g
eneral living skills (Ebdrup e t al., 2011). 
Schizophrenia is cha
racterized by [CONTACT_431819], negative symptoms, and co gnitive 
impairment.  Comorbid sleep disorders may also present in this disease.  Negative symptoms 
of schizophrenia include blunted affect, alogia, avolition, asociality, and anhedonia ) 
(Alphs et  al., 1989; Andreasen 1982; Kay et al., 1988; Kirkpatrick et  al., 1989).   In contrast to 
positive symptoms, negative symptoms are relatively enduring, constant, and more predictive of psychosocial impairment ( Tamminga et al., 1998; Peralta et  al., 2000).  Persistent negative 
symptoms are present in more than 25% of patients with a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_114332] (Hovington et al., 2012).

adverse events (AEs ) were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and 
psychiatric systems.  Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.  The most common CNS treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) included dizziness (including postural), headache, and 
somnolence (drowsiness).  Common gastrointestinal disturbances included dyspepsia, 
nausea, constipation, and vomiting; severe nausea and vomiting were dose limiting in a few 
cases.  Reported psychiatric conditions included such events as agitation, insomnia, and confusional state.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
. 
The antipsychotic efficacy of pi[INVESTIGATOR_431769] a Phase 2 study (ACP -103-008) 
conducted in subjects with schizophrenia ( Meltzer et  al., 2012).  The primary objective of this 
Page 24 of 168

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  [ADDRESS_546536] udy was to determine whether a combination of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (17 mg  once daily) 
with either low -dose haloperidol (2 mg  once daily) or low-dose risperidone (2 mg ; 1 mg  
twice daily) administered to subjects with schizophrenia would demonstrate antipsychotic 
efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_331902] (PANSS) . 
It was observed that pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 17 mg  plus 2 mg  risperidone was significantly more 
efficacious than 2  mg risperidone plus placebo (p≤0.01 starting at Day 15, intent- to-treat 
[ITT] l ast observation carried forward [LOCF]) and similar in efficacy to a standard dose 
(6 mg) of risperidone (treatment differences not statistically significant).  Efficacy advantages 
of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431770] 2 mg  risperidone plus p lacebo group 
were demonstrated in the PANSS total score (p=0.007), PANSS negative symptom score 
(p=0.018), PANSS ≥20% (p=0.001) and ≥50% (p=0.039) responder analysis, and the CGI -S 
score (p=0.008) at endpoint (ACP-103-008).  Additionally, discontinuations due to lack of 
efficacy were notably lower in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431771] (4%) versus the 2 mg  
risperidone plus placebo group (17%). 
No statistical efficacy advantage was demonstrated for pi[INVESTIGATOR_431772] 2  mg haloperidol 
compared to 2 mg  haloperidol plus placebo.  The 2 mg  haloperidol plus placebo group 
demonstrated improvement in efficacy that was similar to the 6  mg risperidone plus placebo 
group (mean change from baseline to Day 43, ITT LOCF of -25.1 and -23.2, respectively).  
The 2  mg haloperidol dose was therefore not subtherapeutic, and the model was insufficient 
to allow for a statistical advantage of pi[INVESTIGATOR_431773]. 
Exploratory analyses comparing overall weight gain, subjects with 7% weight gain, prolactin 
increase, serum glucose increase, and akathisia (as measured by [CONTACT_431820]) all showed fewer 
events or improvement in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431772] 2 mg  risperidone group compared to the 
6 mg  risperidone arm; the differences were statistically significant on the first four measures 
(p=0.050, p=0.031, p<0.001 and p=0.024, respectively). 
Overall, safety results demonstrated that pi[INVESTIGATOR_431774] -tolerated 
in subjects with schizophrenia.  There were no meaningful difference in the TEAE profile, 
clinicall y relevant changes or trends observed in laboratory data, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), or physical examinations associated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_431775] 2 mg  haloperidol or 2 mg  risperidone. 
Study ACP -103-020, a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of 34  mg 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_431776] 199 subjects with Parkinson’s disease psychosis provided the 
primary evidence of efficacy of pi[INVESTIGATOR_431777]’s disease 
psychosis.  Clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement over placebo was 
demonstrated on the primary and secondary measures of psychosis over a 6- week Treatment

 Period .  Subgroup analyses showed consistent trends regardless of subjects’ age, sex or 
baseline Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) status.  In addition, clinical benefits were 
observed in all exploratory efficacy measures with significant improvements in nighttime 
sleep, daytime wakefulness, and caregiver burden.  The improvements observed in psychotic symptoms did not come at the expense of motoric control ( Cummings et al., 2014).

1.3 Study Rationale 
At the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -supported consensus meeting on negative 
symptoms, experts agreed that treatments for persistent and clinically signiﬁcant negative symptoms are an unmet therapeutic need ( Kirkpatrick et  al., 2006).  Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_431779].  While the effectiveness of 
antipsychotics has been established, a good proportion of patients do not achieve full control 
of their symptoms, including negative symptoms. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_431780], these symptoms remain inadequately 
addressed by [CONTACT_431821] ( Blanchard et  al., 2011).  Thus, the adequate treatment of negative symptoms 
remains an unmet therapeutic need in this patient population.  There is evidence that ritanserin, another selective 5 -HT2A/2C inverse agonist/antagonist has efficacy against 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia both as monotherapy ( Duinkerke et al., 1993) and when 
added to risperidone ( Akhondzadeh et  al., 2008).  These data support the use of 5- HT
2A 
receptor inverse agonists as adjunctive therapy for psychosis and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
In light of demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy and a wel l-defined safety profile, and on the 
basis of preclinical and clinical data suggesting potentiation of antipsychotic efficacy in 
coadministration with currently approved antipsychotics, ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

2.2.5 Safety Assessments 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_431822], vital signs, ECGs, physical examination results, 
and clinical laboratory tests (including  urinalysis), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement 
Scale (AIMS ), the Barnes Ak athisia Rating Scale (BARS ), and the Simpson -Angus 
Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS); and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) as identified in Table 6–1. 
[ADDRESS_546537] predominant negative symptoms while on adequate treatment with an antipsychotic .  
Schizophrenia is defined by [CONTACT_431823], Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5), confirmed by a customized module of the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM -5, Clinical Trials Version (SCID -5-CT).  Negative symptoms are considered 
predominant when other symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive symptoms such as 
delusions and hallucinations, are relatively mild and well controlled ( Marder et al., 2013).  
This study will enroll approximately 380 subjects (190 subjects per treatment group ) with 
predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia across approximately 70 study sites 
Page 28 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  [ADDRESS_546538] day of the randomized treatment phase (B aseline), eligible subjects will 
be randomly assigned to receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_431757] a 1:1 ratio, according to a 
computer- generated randomizat ion schedule.  The randomization will be stratified according 
to geographic region (North America, Europe, or rest of world).  The initial daily dose of 
study drug is pi[INVESTIGATOR_387341] [ADDRESS_546539] 
remain stable thereafter as described in Table 5–1.  The daily dose of the main antipsychotic 
must remain stable and may not be changed from Screening  through the duration of the study.  
Subjects will participate in the study for up to 34  weeks, including a Screening Period of up 
to 4 weeks, a 26-week Treatment Period, and a  4-week  safety follow -up (telephone call) for 
those subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the 
52-week, open -label, extension study (Study ACP -103-035). 
3.2 Screening Period  
During a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, subjects will be  assessed for study eligibility .  
All prohibited medications should be discontinued during the Screening Period (i.e., prior to the Baseline vi sit).  Only outpatients with stable living conditions and a reliable informant 
may enter the study.   Although subjects up to age ≤55 are allowed to participate, in order to 
provide appropriate age representation, Investigators are encouraged to enroll an equal 
number of subjects who are ≤35 and who are >[ADDRESS_546540] a structured telemedicine (i.e., live unrecorded video) inte rview  by [CONTACT_431824] t reatment with an antipsychotic.  
Subjects must be taking only one antipsychotic, which will be continued throughout the 
subject’ s participation in this study (see inclusion criterion #12 in  Sections 4.1). 
In order to provide appropriate representation of all antipsychotics in the study, Investigators are encouraged to enroll subjects with a range of allowable antipsychotics 
(see inclusion cr iterion #13 in Section 4.1).  The objective is that at any given site no more 
than one-third of total subjects enrolled are on the same antipsychotic . 
Subjects who meet the criteria for study eligibility will continue to receive their antipsychotic 
at a stable dose for the duration of the study and will be randomly assigned to receive either pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 20 mg  or matching placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_546541] may sign a separate informed consent to obtain a

 3.3 Double -blind Treatment Period  
The Baseline visit (Day 1) may occur as soon as all screening procedures are completed and 
subject eligibility has been confirmed.  Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 20  mg or matching placebo, and stratified according to 
geographic region (North America, Europe, or r est of world).  Study drug will continue daily 
at this dose level for the first two weeks of treatment.  Study drug will be  administered under 
double-blind conditions throughout the Treatment Period .  The  designated main antipsychotic 
medication will be continued  at a stable dose. 
At the Weeks 2, 4, and 8 visits, the daily dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_431786] 20 mg  or it may 
be either increased to 34  mg (for symptom improvement) or decreased to 10 mg  daily (if the 
20 mg  dose is not well tolerated).  After the Week 8 visit, no study drug dose changes may be 
made.  Clinic visits occurring after Baseline will be conducted at Weeks  2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 
26 (End-of- Study [EOS]/Early Termination [ET] visit).  
3.4 Follow- up 
Subjects who successfully complete the 26- week Treatment Period may enroll in a 52 -week,  
open- label , extension study (Study ACP-103-035) if they qualify.  For subjects who 
discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the extension study 
(Study  ACP -103-035), a safety follow- up telephone call will occur approximately [ADDRESS_546542] of care treatment  
following the treatment period .

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  [ADDRESS_546543] me et all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria ( Sections  4.1and  
4.2, respectively) to be eligible for participation in the study.  Protocol waivers for eligibility 
will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435].  If, during the course of a subject ’s post-randomization participation in the study, it is discovered that the subject did 
not me et all eligibility criteria, she or he will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation 
presents an unacceptable medical risk.  The justification to allow the subject to continue in the study will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented.  If allowed to remain in the study, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver. 
Subjects who screen fail will be allowed to rescreen with the permission of the Medical 
Monitor, provided the screen failure was due to a temporary condition that subsequently 
resolved.  Subject randomization will occur at the end of the Screening Period for those who continue to meet enrollment criteria.  
In order to participate in the optional pharmacogenomics component of the study, subjects must sign a separate pharmacogenomics informed consent form (ICF), indicating their willingness to have their DNA sample stored for future use.  Refusal to consent for this 
component does not exclude a subject from participation in the clinical study.

 6 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE  
It is required that trained and experienced clinicians administer the efficacy and safety scales 
for this protocol.  Training, certification , and materials for rating will be provided by 
[CONTACT_431828] . 
The NSA -16 is only to be administered by [CONTACT_431829].   All administrations of the NSA -16 will be audio-recorded for quality control, 
training , and calibration purposes.  Personnel will also be trained in the administration of the 
other efficacy and safety assessment scales prior to administration of assessment scales to 
subjects.  
6.1 Efficacy Scales 
6.1.1 Negative Symptom Assessment -16 (NSA-16) 
The 16- item Negative Symptom Assessment is a validated scale that can be completed in 
approximately15 to 20 minutes ( Axelrod et  al., 1993).   The NSA -16 assesses fi ve domains of 
negative symptoms:  (1) communication, (2) emotion/affect, (3) social involvement, 
(4) motivation, and (5) retardation. 
A sample NSA -16 is provided in Appendix C . 
6.1.2 Personal and Social Performance Scale 
The PSP is a validated 100-point single- item rating scale to assess the psychosocial 
functioning of subjects with schizophrenia ( Morosini et  al., 2000).   Ratings are based on the 
assessment of subject  functioning across four domains of socially useful activities (e.g., work 
and study, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive 
behavior). 
A sample of the PSP is provided in Appendix D . 
6.1.3 Clinical Global Impression of Schizophrenia  Scale  – Severity  
The CGI -SCH -S is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to evaluate positive, 
negative, depressive, cognitive symptoms and overall severity in schizophrenia 
(Haro  et al. 2003).  For purposes of this study, only the negative symptoms will be evaluated.  
A sample CGI-SCH -S is provided in Appendix E . 
6.1.4 Clinical Global Impression of Schizophrenia  Scale  – Improvement  
The CGI -SCH -I is a clinician -rated, 7-point scale that is designed to evaluate change in 
positive, negative, depressive, cognitive symptoms and overall severity in schizophrenia (Haro et  al. 2003).  For purposes of this study, only the negative symptoms will be evaluated.

Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Pr oprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 A sample CGI -SCH -I is provided in Appendix F . 
6.1.5 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a 30 -item scale used to evaluate the presence, absence, and severity of 
schizophrenia symptoms ( Kay et al., 1988) .  The 30 items are arranged as 7 positive 
symptom items, 7 negative symptom items, and 16 general psychopathology symptom items.  
The PANSS total score can range from a minimum of 30 to a maximum of 210. 
A sample PANSS is provided in Appendix G . 
6.1.6 Informant Questionnaire for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The Informant Questionnaire for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (IQ- PANSS) is a 
14-item Informant Questionnaire designed to obtain input from the informant on each of the 
items by [CONTACT_431830], absence, and severity of schizophrenia symptoms as they 
relate to the subject (Opler and  Ramirez 2009).  Behaviors observed by [CONTACT_431831] S item.   
While two PANSS items, Passive/apathetic social withdrawal (N4) and Active social 
avoidance (G16), are scored exclusively based on information obtained from the informant, 
information reported on the other items included in the IQ- PANSS is to be used in 
conjunction with data obtained during the Structured Clinical Interview for the PANSS (SCI -PANSS).  
A sample IQ -PANSS is provided in Appendix H . 
6.1.7 Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia  
The BACS is a performance- based assessment that measures treatment -related changes in 
cognition and assesses six cognitive domains, including verbal memory and learning (verbal memory task), working memory (digit sequencing), motor function (token motor task), verbal fluency (semantic and letter fluency), speed of processing (symbol coding), and executive function (Tower of London) ( Keefe et  al., 2004).  The BACS takes approximately 30 minutes 
to administer, and incorporates alternative forms for repeated testing.  
6.1.8 Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia  
The CDSS is a 9 -item scale that was developed specifically to assess the level of depressio n 
in schizophrenia.  It was originally developed to differentiat e depressive symptoms from 
negative symptoms ( Addington et  al., 1990; Addington et  al., 1992). 
A sample of the CDSS is provided in Appendix I . 
Page 44 of 168

(McHorney  et al., 1994).  The SF -36 assesses eight health concepts .  The scores are weighted 
sums of the questions in each section.  Scores range from 0 to 100 where lower scores 
indicate gr eater disability, higher scores indicate  less disability.  In this study, the SF -36 will 
be administered by a trained interviewer.  
A sample of the SF-36 is provided in Appendix J . 
6.1.10 10-Item Drug Attitude Inventory  
The DAI-10 is a modified version of the original 30- item Drug Attitude Inventory 
(Hogan  et al., 1983).  It is a true -false questionnaire that  assesses  attitude, experience, and 
beliefs about antipsychotics in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia.  The items on this questionnaire have been shown to distinguish betwe en subjects who are compliant with their 
treatment regimen  and those who are not, primarily through subjective feeling factors 
(Awad  et al., 1993).   In this study, the DAI will be administered by a trained interviewer.  
A sample of the DAI -[ADDRESS_546567]'s level of drowsiness 
(Åkerstedt  and Gillberg 1990; Johns 2009).  Respondents mus t choose statements that most 
accurately describes their level of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_431797], with the modified version used in this study, over an average period of time ( Reyner et  al., 1998; 
Geiger  Brown  et al., 2014).   In this study, the KSS will be administered by a trained 
interviewer.  
A sample of the KSS is provided in Appendix L . 
6.2 Safety Scales  
The following safety scales will be used to assess abnormal movements (e.g., extrapyramidal 
symptoms) in this study:  Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS ; see Appendix M ), 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS; see Appendix N ), and the Simpson-Angus 
Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS; see Appendix O ). 
In ad dition, the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS; see Appendix P ) will be 
used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors.

 6.2.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The AIMS is a 12 -item, physician -administered scale that measures involuntary 
movements known as tardive dyskinesia and aid s in the early detection of tardive dyskinesia 
(Lane et  al., 1985).  It assesses  severity of dyskinesias (orofacial movements and extremity 
and truncal movements).  Additional items assess the overall severity, incapacitation, and the 
subject’s level of awareness of the movements, and associated distress . 
A sample of the AIMS ( Guy 1976) is provided in Appendix M . 
6.2.2 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The BARS  is a 4-item, physician -administered scale  that assesses the severity of drug-
induced akathisia ( Barnes 1989).  Three items are rated on a 4 -point scale and the global 
clinical assessment of akathisia uses a 6-point scale. 
A sample of the BARS is provided in Appendix N . 
6.2.3 Simpson- Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale  
The SAS  is a 10-item physician -administered scale commonly used for the assessment of 
parkinsonian movement disorder related to psychiatric drug treatment  (Simpson and Angus 
1970).  One  item on the SAS measures gait (hypokinesia);  six items measure  rigidity; and 
three items measure  glabella tap, tremor and salivation, respectively.   The g rade of severity of 
each item  is rated  using a 5-point scale and individual scores are combined to obtain a total 
score. 
A sample of the SAS is provided in Appendix O . 
6.2.4 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk  (Posner et al., 2011).  The following four constructs are measured :  the 
severity of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality. The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors; the Baseline/Screening 
version will be administered at Screening , and the Since Last Visit version  will be 
administered at subsequent visits.  The C-SSRS results for each subject should be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_431832].  If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given subject reveal 
potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such 
results.  If a clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the 
Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment (Section  4.3). 
A sample of the C -SSRS is pro vided in Appendix P . 
Page 46 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  [ADDRESS_546568] will also be performed. 
6.3.3 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination should be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 26 
(EOS/ET) ; symptom-directed examinations will be performed at Weeks 2 and 14.  Pelvic 
and/or urogenital examination may be deferred, unless the Investigator deems this to be 
clinically indicated . 
6.3.4 Vital Sign  Measurements  
Vital signs, including sitting (at least 3 minutes ) blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and temperature, should be performed at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 (EOS/ET) .  At Baseline, vital signs must be measured before study drug is given. 
6.3.5 Height and Weight 
Height will be measured at Screening only.  Weight will be measured at  Screening, Baseline 
(Day 1), and Week 26 (EOS/ET) . 
6.3.6 Electrocardiograms  
A single 12- lead ECG will be performed in triplicate at Screening .  Single 12- lead ECG 
recordings will be performed at Baseline, Week 14, and at the Week 26 (EOS/ET) visit.  A single 12- lead ECG can be performed any time before blood sampling or at least 
30 minutes after blood sampling during clinic visits.  The ECG should not be recorded from 
the same arm as the blood draw if taken after blood draw. 
6.4 Laboratory Procedures/Evaluations  
6.4.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be analyzed by a central laboratory .  Laboratory tests will 
include hematology , serum chemistry (including metabolic parameters, prolactin levels ), and 
urinalysis.  Blood and urine samples f or laboratory evaluations will be collected at Screening, 
Baseline, and at Week 26 (EOS/ET visit).  Pregnancy tests will be performed for all women .

 7 ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related” ( CDER 2012). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion).  The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at Baseline  
• Overdose of either study drug (see Section 7.4.2) or concomitant medication without 
any signs or symptoms unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] f or observation 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will b e reported on a 
pregnancy form  
For subjects who enroll into ACP -103-035, AEs  will be recorded fro m the time informed 
consent is obtained through the until the first dose of open-label study drug in ACP-103-035. 
For subjects who discontinue from the study or do not enroll into ACP-103-035, AEs will be 
recorded from the time informed consent is obtained until [ADDRESS_546577] should be referred for appropriate treatment.

lock should be reported if in the judgment of the Investigator there is “a reasonable 
possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_77425]. 
7.1.2 Definition of S erious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious.”  The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event.  An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage 
• Requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject  at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149690] a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431800].  This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431801]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
• Outp atient surgery  
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Page 59 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  [ADDRESS_546578] normal life functions. 
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF: 
• Mild :  awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday ac tivities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or 
“not related.”  An event is considered related  if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3433] e product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
• Response to cessation (de- challenge) or re -challenge  
• Compat ibility with known class effect  
• Known effects of concomitant medications

 7.2.3 Definition of Une xpectedness  
Unexpectedness is defined as an AE, the nature or seve rity of w hich is not consistent with th e 
information  provided in the Reference Safety Information section of the current 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_387347]’s Brochure. 
7.[ADDRESS_546579] a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the last report or visit. 
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication  page. 
All AEs  will be coded by [CONTACT_387423] (MedDRA) . 
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate medical terminology.  Severity and relationship to study drug will b e assessed by [CONTACT_149726]. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] (e.g., 
“cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_546580] be reported within 24 hours of 
discovery to ACADIA or its designee. A n SAE (initial and/or follow -up) or, pregnancy must

 be reported within 24 hours by [CONTACT_149729], SAE, and/or pregnancy forms, as 
appropriate ( details on how to report SAEs are provided in a separate study reference 
manual ). 
At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_149730], 
unexpected, and possibly related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible IRB/EC.  For European Union member states, ACADIA or its designee will 
provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) directly to the 
ECs, as required by [CONTACT_19666].  In all other countries, it is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/ EC.  It is also the 
Investigator’s responsibility to notify the responsible IRB/EC regarding any new and 
significant safety information . 
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE and/or Pregnancy form (for initial and/or 
follow-up information) and cover sheet, including available supporting documentation relevant to the event and fax  or email  (within 24 hours of discovery) to the following: 
 
 
 
Subjects will be followed until EOS/ ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with ACADIA, deems them to be chronic or stable. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject  will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF.  All subjects  
experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_149731]. SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_546581] who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs)  must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the Pregnancy F orm within 
24 hours of discovery to ACADIA or its designee (see fax numbers and email address in 
Section 7.4.2) .  Any female subject  who becomes pregnant during the study will be followed 
through the first well- baby [CONTACT_765] .

 7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose 
An overdose of study drug (i.e., any amount more than the prescribed number of tablets in a 
given day) must be reported on the Overdose Form within 24 hours of discovery to ACADIA 
or its designee (see fax numbers and email address in Section  7.4.2).  
7.5 Safety Oversight 
A Safety Management Team  (SMT), internal to ACADIA, will regularly monitor all a spects 
of subject safety throughout this study.  The SMT will be comprised of qualified representatives from Clinical Development, Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance, and Regulatory Affairs, as well as other ad hoc representatives as appropriate.  The SMT w ill 
meet regularly to review all SAEs and will examine aggregate (blinded) non -serious AEs, 
clinical laboratory data, and other relevant safety data. 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review interim safety data 
including data on AEs and SAEs.   Additional information regarding the DSMB  is provided in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[ADDRESS_546582] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and amendment(s)  as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements.  Details 
of the study site monitoring process are desc ribed in a separate clinical monitoring plan

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be 
approved by [CONTACT_431840]. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The hypotheses  for the primary endpoint are the following : 
• The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in the NSA- 16 total score between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431803]. 
Page 64 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  31 March 2017  
Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 – The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the mean change 
from Baseline to Week 26 NSA- 16 total score between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431804]. 
The hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint are the following: 
• The null hypot hesis is that there is no difference in the mean change from  Baseline to 
Week 2 6 PSP score between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431805]. 
– The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the mean change 
from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_546583] one dose of study drug (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]).  Subjects will be analyzed based  on the trea tment 
which they actually received.  The  safety analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The full analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug and who have both a baseline value and at least one post- baseline value for the NSA -16 
total score.  Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment.  The full analysis set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set will be defined prior to unblinding the study for the final 
analysis.  Subjects will be analyzed based  on their randomized treatment.   The PP analysis set 
will be used for sensitivity analyses of selected efficacy endpoints.  
The PK analysis set includes all subjects in the safety analysis set  who have sufficient PK 
data.  
9.4 Description of Statistical Methods  
9.4.1 General Approach  
For continuous variables, the following summary statistics will be provided:  number of 
subjects, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
median.  For categorical variables, summaries will include the number and percentage of 
subjects in each category, using the number of subjects with non- missing values as the 
denominator for the percentages (unless otherwise specified). 
Unless otherwise specified, all reported p- values will be two-sided.  All analyses will be 
performed using SAS
® V9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) or higher.  Validation 
and quality control of the tables, listings and figures containing the results of the st atistical 
analyses will follow appropriate standard operating procedures.

Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is  the change from Baseline to Week 26 in the NSA-16 total score .  
The primary analysis will be based on the full analysis set.  The per -protocol analysis set will 
be used for sensitivity analyses.  
The NSA -16 total score will be analyzed using mixed model r epeated measures (MMRM).  
The dependent variable will be the change from Baseline in the NSA-16 total score.  The 
independent variables in the model will include the following:  treatment group 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week  14, Week 20, and Week  26), 
the treatment -by-visit interaction, geographic region (North America, Europe, or rest of 
world), the Baseline NSA-[ADDRESS_546584] squares means at Week 26 and will be 
tested at an alpha level of 0.05 ( two-sided) using the full analysis set . 
In addition to the primary treatment comparisons for the Week 26 timepoint, the treatment groups will also be compared at each of the other timepoints (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 14, and 20) 
using the same MMRM model described above.  These other comparisons will be considered 
exploratory. 
Handling of missing values will be described in detail in the SAP.  Sensitivity analyses will 
be performed to assess the impact of missing data, including analyses based on a missing not 
at random assumption. 
9.4.3 Analysis of the Sec ondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_546585] squares means at Week 26 and will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided) using 
the full analysis set.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Secondary Endpoints  and Exploratory Endpoints  
Other secondary endpoints are the following: 
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in CGI- SCH -S score  
• CGI-SCH -I scor e at Week 26  
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in the PANSS total score 
Page 66 of 168
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Protocol Amendment 3 Date:  31 March 2017  
Protocol ACP -103-038 Amendment 3 
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 • Change from Baseline to Week 26 in PANSS subscores (positive scale, negative scale, 
and general psychopathology scale) 
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in BACS score  
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in DAI-10 score 
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in KSS score 
Exploratory endpoints are the following: 
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in PANSS Marder factor scores (negative symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression factors)  
• Change from Baseline to Week 26 in CDSS score 
• Change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_546586] -Baseline timepoint will be analyzed using an MMRM 
model.  The dependent variable will be the CGI -SCH -I score.  The independent variables in 
the model will include the following:  treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit 
(Week  2, Week 4, Week 8, Week  14, We ek 20, and Week  26), the treatment- by-visit 
interaction , geographic region (North America, Europe, or rest of world ), the Baseline 
CGI-SCH -S score, and the Baseline -by-visit interaction . 
The change from Baseline to each post -Baseline timepoint in the CDSS score will be 
analyzed using an MMRM model similar to that described above for the primary endpoint, except that the visits will include Weeks  8 and Week  26, and that the Baseline CDSS score 
will be included in the model instead of the Baseline NSA-16 tota l score.  
The change from Baseline to Week 26 or early termination in the PANSS total score, the 
PANSS Marder factor scores (see  Appendix G ), the PANSS subscores, the BACS score, the 
DAI-10 score, and the SF -36 score will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOV A) model with effects for treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), geographic 
region (North America, Europe, or Rest of World), and the Baseline value of the endpoint 
being analyzed .

 9.4.9 Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis for efficacy  is planned for this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Review  
An independent DSMB  will review interim safety data , including data on AEs and SAEs.  
The DSMB  will be independent of the Sponsor and the Investigators and will be empowered 
to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921].  The DSMB  may review blinded, 
unblinded or partially unblinded data, but the Sponsor and the Investigators will remain 
blinded to the data provided to the DSMB  until the official unblinding of the database.  The 
membership, activities, responsibilities, and frequency of meetings will be described separately in the DSMB  charter.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Review  
The study will not be stopped early for superior efficacy.  
9.4.10 Additional Subgroup Analyses 
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups defined by [CONTACT_1617] (North 
America, Europe, or r est of world).  Additional subgroup analyses m ay be specified in the 
SAP. 
9.4.11 Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the Type 1 error rate across the 
primary and secondary endpoints.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.4.12 Tabulation of Individual Response Data  
Listings of the individual response data will be provided by [CONTACT_429238]. 
9.5 Sample Size  
The planned sample size is 380 (190 subjects per treatment group).  
Assuming the true difference in the mean change in the NSA- [ADDRESS_546590] deviation is 12.8 points, 171 evaluable subjects per treatment group will 
provide 90% power to detect a difference between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_431763] a significance level of 0.05, using a 2-sided t- test. 
Adjusting for a potential non-evaluable rate of up to 10%, approximately 380 subjects 
(190 subjects per treatment group) will be randomized.

 9.6 Measures to Minimize Bias  
9.6.1 Enrollment/Random ization/Masking Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]) 
in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive response technology (IRT) system.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617]  (North A merica, Europe, or rest of world).  The 
assignments will be based on a pre- generated permuted -block randomization schedule.  
Blinding will be assured by [CONTACT_431843]/or designee to the treatment codes, and providing identical tablets and packaging for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387390].  
9.6.2 Breaking the Study Blind/ Subject  Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after all subjects have completed the s tudy and the clinical database is locked.  
For DSMB safety reviews, the treatment codes will be released to an  independent 
statistician/programmer to produce unblinded statistical outputs.  The Sponsor and the 
Investigators will remain blinded.  
Unblinding of individual treatment assignment during the study is discouraged.  The 
Investigator at a site may break the blind  for a given subject  in the event of a medical 
emergency, where knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]) must be known in order to facilitate appropriate emergency medical treatment.  
The Investigator should attempt to contact [CONTACT_431844] 
a subject’s treatment identity in order to obtain concurrence that unblinding a subject’s 
treatment assignment is necessary.  Details of the process to be followed are provided in a 
separate IRT manual.  
10 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
10.[ADDRESS_546591] data required by [CONTACT_431845] (EDC) system on eCRFs.  The Investigator and his/her site personnel will be responsible for 
completing the eCRFs.  The Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all 
the information recorded on the eCRFs.   All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be 
supplied, including subject identification date(s), assessment values, etc ., and any omission or 
discrepancy will require explanation.  All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source docume ntation at the site . 
The study monitors will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded on the 
eCRFs, utilizing the source documentation, and will query discrepant findings.  The

for contact[CONTACT_149736], 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data ) 
provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The ACADIA and/or designee monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and ACADIA’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audited.  These audits may include a review  of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regula tory requirements.  
ACADIA and/or designee representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB /EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject  
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects ’ identities.

12.3.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation  
It is the Investigator or designee’s responsibility to obtain written informed consent from the 
subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study.  The subject must be given ample time to decide about study 
participation and opportunity to inquire about details of the study.  The IRB/EC -approved 
consent form must be personally signed and dated by [CONTACT_431847]-consent discussion.  The Investigator or appropriate site personnel 
must document the details of obtaining informed consent in the subject’s study documents.  
The subject must be given a copy of the signed informed consent and the original maintained in the designated location at the site.  
The subject’s caregiver must also indicate their understanding of t he study and their role as a 
caregiver to the subject during the study.  The subject’s caregiver must provide written agreement prior to any Screening  visit procedures being performed indicating their 
agreement to participate in the study in the caregiver role. 
Consent for pharmacogenomic testing is optional.  Subjects must sign a separate pharmacogenomics consent form prior to blood draws.  The pharmacogenomic ICF may be signed at Baseline or at any time during the study.  
12.[ADDRESS_546597] ’s anonymity is maintained as described below.  
On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to ACADIA and/or designee, subjects  must be 
identified by a Subject  Identification Number only.  Documents that are not for submission to 
ACADIA and/or designee (e.g.,  signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by [CONTACT_431848].

13.3 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criter ia protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study . 
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435].  If, during the course of a subject’s post- randomization participation in the trial it is 
discovered that the subject did not me et all eligibility criteria, s/he will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk.  The justification  to allow 
the subject to cont inue in the trial will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented.  If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  All  follow-up safety assessments must be 
complete d and documented as outlined in the protocol.  The Investigator must report any

 protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB /EC in accordance with local 
regulations, within reasonable time.  
A blood sample will be collected  from subjects who give informed consent for the 
pharmacogenomic component of the study.  A sample collected at a later timepoint does not 
constitute a protocol violation and would not require protocol amendment. 
13.4 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by [CONTACT_1034] (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator).  All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB /EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to the Regulatory Authority, as either an amendment or a notification.  Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial.  No approval is required for notifications.

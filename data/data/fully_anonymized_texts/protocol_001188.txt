 4 / 8 been updated as ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017 with no changes in the requirements for conducting the study and demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy, this study results can be referred for demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011 as well as per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017.  This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 2011 and :2020.  The study will not begin until the UCSF IRB approval is received.   2. Subjects  This study is performed on volunteers who have previously been determined to be healthy enough for this study, have signed an informed consent form and met the following IRB requirements.  These volunteers are compensated by [CONTACT_59290].  Point of enrolment is defined as time at which subjects sign and date the informed consent form and screening based on subject demography and inclusion/exclusion criteria is complete. Expected enrolment period is [ADDRESS_117252]’s participation will be about [ADDRESS_117253] subjects are:  1. Both male and female subjects who can give written informed consent 2. Healthy subjects capable of undergoing controlled hypoxemia to the levels outlined in the desaturation profile below 3. Meeting the demographic requirements listed above.  The exclusion criteria for the test subjects are:  1. Age below 18 or over 50 2. Pregnant women 3. Significant arrhythmia 4. Blood pressure above 150 systolic or 90 diastolic 5. Carboxyhemoglobin levels over 3% 6. Subjects whom the investigator consider ineligible for the study.  At least [ADDRESS_117254], a series of desaturation runs are performed.  Run 1 starts with a stabilized period at room air and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  Run 2 starts with a stabilized period at 100% and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  The following are value targets:  Run 1   Room Air, 97, 87,77 Run 2  92, 82, 72  The objective of these targets is to spread the data points evenly over the desired range.  Achieving them exactly is not important, though every effort will be made to be within 2%.  Saturation level at each plateau and the number of plateaus can vary depending on the subject’s condition.  The SpO2 value is reduced by [CONTACT_26129] a mixture of medical air and nitrogen, controlled by [ADDRESS_117255] not changed more than 1 % for 20 seconds (they do not have to agree with each other).  Each desaturation plateaus should not exceed [ADDRESS_117256] sample is taken using a 2.5 cc syringe.  At the time when the gas operator thinks the SpO2 is stable, the sponsor can ask that the blood sample be delayed for up to 90 seconds.  If the stability of a plateau cannot be confirmed

 5 / [ADDRESS_117257]’s condition.  Extra samples may be required at the discretion of the PI, in which case the total number of blood samples should not exceed 32.  The gas mixture is then changed for the next value.  This is then repeated for each plateau value.   For each subject, this allows [ADDRESS_117258] is coached on breathing.  If he/she appears to fall asleep, he/she is woken up.  At any signs of distress, he/she is given 100% oxygen.  Each run should take Between [ADDRESS_117259]’s demographic data, time of blood draw, and Co-oximeter values will be collected using specific data collection forms.  4. Reference Data  The reference blood samples will be analyzed using two Radiometer ABL90 co-oximeters (ABL-A and ABL-B).  Readings of two ABLs will be used to determine the validity of the readings of each other.  When two ABLs are determined to be valid, the SaO2 reference value is the average of the SaO2 measurements of the two ABLs.  The validity of ABL measurements is determined by [CONTACT_6453]: - Check if the difference between two ABL readings is within 2% - If the difference between two ABL readings is within 2%, the readings of two ABLs are valid. - Readings of two ABL differed by [CONTACT_726] 2% saturation will be excluded from the analysis. - If only one ABL returns the value, the value will be assumed to be correct.  The co-oximeters should be quality control checked and calibrated at the study site to be functioning properly before use. The heart rate will be measured using a Nihon Kohden PVM-[ADDRESS_117260] devices under the supervision of PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigator.  These probes will be arranged as follows:  On the right-hand side  Subject 1 + 4 + 7 + [ADDRESS_117261] 2 + 5 + 8 + [ADDRESS_117262] 3 + 6 + 9 +[ADDRESS_117263] Safety  1. The sensors will be isolated as follows500V between the sensor and earth ground 2. 4 KV between AC mains power and the low voltage power supply and 1.5 KV between the low voltage power supply and the sensor, OR 5 KV between AC mains and the sensor.

 6 / [ADDRESS_117264]’s safety and correct data recording.  The test will be discontinued when a subject requests to withdraw from the study, or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigator will terminate the desaturation procedure and/or a subject’s participation in the study because of the reasons including: 1) the subject experiences unexpected oxygen desaturation or 2) the subject loses consciousness.  Risks and anticipated adverse device effects associated with participation in the study that are to be assessed include the following: a. Risks of arterial cannulation include bleeding, infection, nerve injury and bruising at the site of catheter insertion.  There are also remote risks of an allergic reaction from the lidocaine used for local anesthesia, or the development of arterial spasm, dissection, or thrombosis. b. The risks of the brief exposures to hypoxia are include feeling short of breath, headache, and dizziness.  Brief loss of consciousness may occur but is not expected at the levels of oxygen targeted for these tests. c. The risks of hyperventilating include feeling light-headed or dizzy. The risks of breathing air with increased amounts of carbon dioxide include feeling short of breath and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a headache. d. The risks of burns and skin problems from poor blood circulation.  Poor circulation can be avoided by [CONTACT_59292]2 probes too tightly.  Nihon Kohden has determined that there is no residual risk associated with the test devices. Nihon Kohden will be responsible for maintaining the test devices.  Monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_59293].  Any adverse events (serious and non-serious) and adverse device effects will be documented in case report forms and reported to Nihon Kohden by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner.  7. Data Analysis  Collected data used for data analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_59286]. Data will be retained by [CONTACT_59294]. Nihon Kohden has no access to subject’s personally identifiable information.  The following case report forms (CRFs) will be used to record data and information: - Subject demographics CRF: Subject information will be recorded. - Adverse event CRF: An adverse event related or not related to the test devices will be recorded. - Subject withdrawal CRF: Any subject withdrawal after the subject signs informed consent will be recorded. - Device deficiency CRF: A deficiency occurred to the test devices will be recorded. - Protocol departure CRF: Any departure from the defined procedures as outlined in the protocol including mistake in recording of blood draw time will be recorded.  Data from subjects who did not complete the protocol will be thrown out.  Also, if subject’s carboxyhemoglobin level is confirmed to be over 3% during or after the study, data from the subject will be thrown out.  Missing data will not be supplemented.  Data that meets the following conditions will be also thrown out: - The CO-oximeter experienced error conditions - Two CO-oximeter readings differed by [CONTACT_726] 2% saturation - The first data points at a plateau where a co-oximeter output differs over 2% saturation from the second points at the same plateau - Data points at a plateau where a co-oximeter output changes over 2% saturation from the previous points at the same plateau - Data points which are the only ones at a plateau

Why is this study being done?  
 
The mechanical demands placed on the pelvic floor structures during vaginal delivery often exceed 
physiological tissue limits, resulting in mater nal childbirth trauma. Injury to the perineum, vaginal 
supportive tissues, pelvic floor, and sphincter muscles cause pelvic pain, infection, and dyspareunia 
(painful intercourse) in the short term, as well as pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontine nce and 
anal incontinence in the long term. Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are considered to be the main risk 
factors in weakening the pelvic floor support. This is considered to be due to damage to the endopelvic 
fascia  (tissues which serve to suspend the  female pelvic organs inside the pelvis) , pelvic floor muscles, 
and peripheral nerves.  
 
Several studies support that the incidence of pelvic floor disorders (PFD) depends on the mode of 
delivery. Numerous antepartum techniques and intrapartum obstetric int erventions have been described 
and introduced to reduce the risk of maternal trauma during the second stage of labor; however, no 
justifications were presented why one or another intervention is optimal for the patient. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_710511] l delivery is a biomechanical process, currently there are no tools to objectively 
measure the biomechanical properties of pelvic tissue in women before the delivery. Such data is essential 
to scientifically guide clinical decisions regarding the delivery mode and/or intrapartum interventions to 
reduce childbirth trauma. Thus, the key unanswered question is: Can an individual parturient’s risk for 
pelvic floor trauma per every possible intervention and delivery mode be predicted using objective data 
pertain ing to the biomechanical properties of soft tissue components affected during delivery?  
 
In the last decades, Elasticity Imaging or elastography, has emerged. E lastography  allows visualization 
and quantitative assessment of the mechanical properties of so ft human tissues. The Vaginal Tactile 
Imager (VTI)  allows acquisition of 3D elasticity data for pelvic soft tissues  which are influenced during 
the delivery .  Its use in this study is experimental.  
 
The long -term goal of this project is to develop, validat e, and integrate into clinical practice a new 
paradigm and a novel device to simultaneously measure the biomechanical properties of various pelvic 
structural components that are impacted during vaginal delivery, and to develop a risk prediction model of 
maternal birth injury. Ultimately, such approach will enable individualized patient counseling regarding 
the mode of delivery and/or the need for obstetrical interventions to reduce childbirth trauma.  
 
Why have you been asked to take part in this study?  
 
You have been asked to participate in this study to allow taking  a 3D elasticity image of your  pelvic 
floor structures which may be influenced during the vaginal delivery .

 Page 3 of 8 Version 1.0 from 11/16/2018   
Who may take part in this study? And who may not?  
 
Any patients may participate if t hey ar e women 21 + years of age  with prior vaginal delivery (parous)  and 
having  completed the 35th week of pregnancy with fetus in vertex position and premise of vaginal 
delivery . 
 
You may not participate in this study if you have  any of the following : 
 
1. Prior perineal surgery  
2. HIV or hepatitis B positive serology  
3. Warty lesions on the vulva  
4. Extensive varicose veins on the vulva  
5. Active skin infection or ulceration within the vagina/vulva (Herpes infection)  
6. Severe hemorrhoids  
7. Stillbirth or extensive congenital abnormalities of the fetus  
 
Because this study involves a vaginal  examination, any patient that cannot tolerate a vaginal examination 
or the position needed to perform a vaginal examination will be excluded.   
How long will the study take and how many subj ects will participate?  
 
The study will be performed in a single session lasting 3 -5 minutes for each participant. There will be 
several available dates to choose from for scheduling. Ten pregnant participant s will be included in the 
study.  
 
What will you b e asked to do if you take part in this research study?  
 
During the procedure a vaginal probe will be inserted and manipulated in various directions to obtain the 
required images. We do not anticipate the VTI scan procedure will cause any pain , but you will  be asked 
to fill out anonymously the Pain and Comfort Level Form.   
 
What are the risks and/or discomforts you might experience if you take part in this study?  
 
Subjects in this study will be exposed to certain risks of personal injury in addition to thos e associated 
with standard forms of treatment, which include: risks normally associated with standard manual 
palpation and transvaginal ultrasound, such as extremely rare possibility of physical damage of the 
vagina l, cervix tissue and infection. Other ris ks include software/hardware malfunction, toxicity, allergic 
reaction, electrical shock, and breach of confidentiality  
 
The study involves potential discomfort from a pelvic examination and pressure onto the soft tissues as 
during physical examination. You  may request  to discontinue the scan with VTI at any time, if you feel a 
discomfort or a pain.    
 
Are there any benefits for you if you choose to take part in this research study?  
 
The benefits of taking part in this study may be:  improved outcome of the most remarkable and painful 
event in woman's life, given the large proportion of women who suffer from pelvic floor disorders caused 
by [CONTACT_710514].  However, you will receive no direct benefit from taking part in this study.

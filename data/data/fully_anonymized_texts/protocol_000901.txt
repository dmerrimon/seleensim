1.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2 Randomized, Open -Label Study of RRx -001 vs Regorafenib in 
Subjects with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer  
Sponsor:  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_22170] , Inc. 
Active Ingredient:  RRx-001 
Study Phase:  Phase 2 
Number of Study Sites: Up to 10 
Study Design:  This is a two-stage phase 2, o pen-label, randomized  (2:1), two-arm study 
comparing RRx -[ADDRESS_21335] oxaliplatin - and irinotecan -based regimens 
with bevacizumab and cetuximab  or panitumumab  (if KRAS wildtype).  
Effective August 15th, 2016, general enrollment for this protocol has been closed 
to new enrollment.  An expansion cohort remains open at Stanford University 
with the potential to enroll up to [ADDRESS_21336]:  
Stage 1 
• Arm 1 – subjects will receive once-weekly intravenous , by [CONTACT_22238], RRx -001 for up to 4 hours at a dose of 4 mg on Days 1, 8, 
15, and 22 of a 4- week cycle.  
• Arm 2 – subjects will receive regorafenib at [ADDRESS_21337] or MRI response will be 
evaluated according to immune related response criteria (irRC)  (for 
evaluation of response or progression on irinotecan, RECIST 1.1 criteria  will 
be used, see below) . However, for informational purposes,  since the 
presence of treatment -induced inflammation may confound interpretation of 
radiologic scans,  RRx-001 subjects may receive an FDG-PET (see 
Section 9.1.2).  
Patients will receive RRx -001 until intolerable toxicity  or progression as defined by 
[CONTACT_22239]. Note: Continuation of RRx -[ADDRESS_21338] the 
initial scan at W eek 12 to the confirmatory scan at Week 16  (no earlier) following 
the appearance of a new lesion is only permissible provided the following criteria 
stated below are met: 
• In order to allow continued administration of  RRx -001 (or regorafe nib) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_22176] a new lesion (per 
irRC), patients must have absence of symptoms and signs of clinically important morbidity due to disease progression (e.g., requirement for 
additional medical management to control symptoms or irradiation to 
prevent morbidity), absence of symptomatic rapid disease progression 
requiring urgent medical intervention (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]), and no 
decline in ECOG or Karnofsky performance status.  
• Patients are re -consented using a written informed consent document at the 
time of progression of disease.

Stage 2 
On progression, provided  ECOG performance status is 0 or 1,  and if clinically 
appropriate i.e.  there are no absolute or relative contraindications in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960],  all subjects will receive  irinotecan  plus bevacizumab:  (irinotecan 
180 mg/m2 iv on day 1 of each 2 week cycle) see Section 6.1.3. Prior to ent ering 
stage 2, all study patients will need to meet Inclusion Criterion #10 regarding 
required laboratory parameters (a -e) (Inclusion Criteria ). 
 
This two-stage study is designed to compare the safety and activity between  RRx-
[ADDRESS_21339] treatment 
will be randomized 2:1 to receive either RRx -001 or regorafenib in 4-week cycles 
until confirmed radiologic progressive disease per irRC and clinical deterioration 
or intolerable toxicity  (Section 9.1.2).  The study is also designed to investigate 
potential resenitization to irinotecan  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22177] -001 or regorafenib. 
Subjects will unde rgo long term follow up for their response to subsequent 
therapy and for overall survival.

Duration of Treatment : In the absence of unacceptable treatment -related toxicity or disease progression as 
defined by [CONTACT_760], subjects may receive treatment to which they have been 
randomized (Arm 1, RRx -001 or Arm 2, regorafenib) for up to 1  year at the 
discretion of the Investigator and beyond 1 year with the agreement of the 
Investigator and the Sponsor.  Subjects will remain on study as long as they continue to receive RRx -001, regorafenib or irinotecan  plus bevacizumab.  
Subjects randomized to regorafenib are not permitted to crossover to receive 
RRx-001.  
 
Methodology:  Effective August 15th, 2016, general enrollment for this protocol has been closed 
to new enrollment.  An expansion cohort remains open at Stanford University with the potential to enroll up to 10 patients.  
 
• Subjects will now be enrolled to  RRx-001 only 
• Subjects receiving RRx -001 will receive RRx -001 as described in RRx- 001 
dose section above 
• Subjects receiving regorafenib  will receive regorafenib daily  as described in

the regorafenib package insert  
• Subjects receiving irinotecan will receive these agents as described in the 
irinotecan and bevacizumab (Section 6.1.3) 
• After progression on either arm, subjects wi ll receive irinotecan -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22180].  
General procedures : 
• Subjects will be screened for eligibility within the twenty-eight (28) days prior 
to enrollment  according to the Schedule of Assessments.  
• Tumor assessment (see below) will be performed at Screening unless a CT or 
MRI was performed within 28 days of Cycle 1, Day 1 .  
• Diagnostic CT with contrast  (see Section 9.1.2) will be carried out for RRx -
001 randomized subjects at Baseline . . 
• A diagnostic CT scan with contrast  for RRx-001 subjects that are at Stage 2 
(i.e. receiving irinotecan /bevacizumab therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be carried out at the first 
scheduled imaging visit after starting irinotecan.   
• In addition to safety labs as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments , blood 
may be drawn for the biomarker assays at Screening, Cycle 2, Day 1 and 
Progression. 
• Tumor biopsies may be performed following discussion and concurrence with 
the Medical Monitor.  
• Determination of p53 , PDI and beta glucoronidase  (RRx-001 subjects): 
Documentation of p53 status can occur via the following: 1) Prior genetic testing/profiling results; 2) Submission of archival tissue to local laboratory if site has the required capabilities; or 3) Submission of archival tissue to central 
laboratory. Only in the event that p53 status is unknown and there is not 
sufficient archi val tissue to be submitted, the patient should undergo a research 
biopsy of the primary tumor if deemed clinically appropriate.  
• Subjects will undergo a full physical exam at Screening.  
• Subjects will undergo all assessments including laboratory evaluations , vital 
signs and symptom-directed physical exam  every 2 weeks during Cycles 1 -2, 
then every 4 weeks  from Cycle 3+.   
• Subjects will be imaged by [CONTACT_22242]- enhanced  chest/abdomen/pelvi c CT (or 
non-contrast chest CT + abdomen/pelvic MRI if iodinated contrast is 
contraindicated ) every [ADDRESS_21355] should be performed throughout the study.  
• At progression, subjects may have blood drawn for biomarker assays.   
• Subjects will complete the QOL questionnaire every 2 weeks at a clinical visit.  
• Females of child -bearing potential will receive a serum pregnancy test at 
screening . 
• Adverse events  (AEs) and concomitant medications will be collected 
throughout the study  at clinical visits . 
• CEUS will be performed in patients , at the discretion of the Pr incipal 
Investigator and Radiologist, with liver metastases  before and after RRx -[ADDRESS_21356] -RRx-
001 in accordance with the schedule outlined in the Schedule of Assessments .  
(Subjects enrolled at Stanford University only, see Appendix 6).  
• The physician will complete the ESASr Assessment at Screening and the first 
week of every cycle. Questionnaire is not required at Cycle 1 Day 1 if screening ESASr  Assessments completed within 48 hours prior. An increase of 
2 or more points is classified as deteriorated, a change of 0 or ±1 as stable, and 
a decrease of 2 or more as improved. If the ESAS increases by [CONTACT_22243] 14 of 90

points, compared to baseline, indicati ng deterioration, then the patient should 
be scanned for progression.  
• Other tests and evaluations that are to be performed during Screening and at 
each visit to the study center are detailed in  Table 1, Schedule of Assessments.  
Criteria for Evaluation  Safety: 
All available data will be provided to an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) at the interim and final efficacy analyses to also review safety. There will 
be 2 planned analyses; an interim analysis once 61 (50%) OS events have occurred, and a final analysis once enrollment has been completed and [ADDRESS_21357] occurred.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_22244], 
clinical laboratory assessments, and monitoring of adverse events (AEs).  Adverse 
events will be graded using NCI CTCAE version 4.0 3.   
Efficacy:  
Radiographic and/or physical assessments of the malignancy will be made at 
Screening/Baseline (within [ADDRESS_21358] study drug administration) 
and every 2 cycles ( 8 weeks ±7 days) thereafter.  Objective response (complete 
response [CR] and partial response [PR]) as determined by [CONTACT_423]’s best tumor response, duration of response, and time  to progression will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_22245] (irRC) 
for RRx-001 response and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria 
(RECIST) version 1.[ADDRESS_21359]/MRI scan 
should be performed at approximately 4 weeks from the previous scan for all 
patients with an objective response of ≥ PR.  The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR = 
CR + PR + stable disease [SD] of ≥4 months duration) will also be determined.  
Tumor ma rkers will also be assessed on a monthly basis, but will not be used as a 
basis for disease progression or response in the absence of radiologic findings 
consistent with disease or progression or response . 
Exploratory  Assessments:  Tumor Biopsy:  
Tumor biopsies may be performed  as needed following discussion and approval 
by [CONTACT_1689].  
Biomarker Assays:  
Determination of p53 , PDI and beta glucoronidase (RRx-001 subjects only): 
Documentation of p53 status can occur via the following: 1) Prior genetic 
testing/profiling results; 2) Submission of archival tissue to local laboratory if site 
has the required capabilities; or 3) Submission of archival tissue to  central 
laboratory. Only in the event that p53 status or level of PDI expression is 
unknown and there is not sufficient archival tissue to be submitted, the patient should undergo a research biopsy of the primary tumor if deemed clinically 
appropriate.  Soluble PD-L1, epi[INVESTIGATOR_22181]-001 transporter effects including Transferrin receptor -1 (TfR1), ASC amino -
acid transporter 2 (ASCT2), and the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system xc) and 
glutamine transporter blockade  will be studied.  
Statistical Methods:  Determination of Sample Size:  
Effective August 15th, 2016, general enrollment for this protocol has been closed 
to new enrollment.  An expansion cohort remains open at Stanford University with the potential to enroll up to [ADDRESS_21360]:

including adjuvant therapy,  will increase median OS by 3 months (i .e., from 6 to 9 
months) when compared to the control therapy  of regorafenib .  Such an increase in 
median O S corresponds to a 33 % reduction in the risk of death (i.e., target hazard 
ratio of 0.6 67).  As this is a proof of  concept study, the c omparison between the two

Safety Analyses:  
Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects receiving at least [ADDRESS_21365] of data summaries for clinical and 
laboratory parameters, and for AEs.  The safety data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_2939].  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_22246].  Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)

statistics, by [CONTACT_447] -dosing shifts relative to baseline, and data listings of clinically 
significant abnormalities.  Vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_22247].  
  
Efficacy Analyses:  
All available data will be provided to an independent Data Monitoring Committee

OS, defined as the number of months from randomization to death due to any ca use.  
OS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.  M edian OS 
will be estimated for each treatment group from the 50th percentile of the corresponding Kaplan- Meier estimates.  The primary inferential comparison 
between treatment group s will use the log -rank test using the full analysis

For all estimates, 95% 2-sided confidence intervals will be calculated.  The duration 
of objective response and clinical benefit response will be described descriptively 
using the Kaplan- Meier method.  
We also prospectively plan to conduct exploratory subgroup analyses on the 
following populations: 
1. Subjects with KRAS, BRAF or P53 mutations  
2. Subjects with  prior bevacizumab or cetuximab therapy  
3. Subjects with prior oxaliplatin therapy  
4. Subjects with prior irinotecan therapy  
5. Subjects with prior 5 -FU based therapy  
A single interim analysis for futility is planned at the tim e that 50% of the total 
death events are expected .  The objective of the futility analysis is to stop 
randomization to the study if there is sufficient evidence that such therapy is not 
improving outcomes relative to the control therapy .  As the intent of the interim 
analysis is for futility only, no adjustment to the type I error at the final analysis is proposed.   An independent statistical service provider will perform the interim 
efficacy analysis . On further review, given the lack o f systemic toxicity observed to 
date, a data monitoring  committee will only be convened  to review significant 
serious adverse events and unacceptably frequent adverse events .  
 
Exploratory Analyses:  
CEUS results will be summarized  descriptively for the RRx -001 treatment arm . 
 Considerations for Amendment 01 : 
Due to the changes in Amendment  [ADDRESS_21367] to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and study design, subjects that were enrolled prior to

1. Screening Assessment:  Must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization  and Cycle 1 Day 1 . Assessments can be performed in one or more visits, so 
long as they are completed within the time frame. If screening clinic visit is performed within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, it does not need to be repeated. 
If screening labs (hematology , complete metabolic panel , and CEA ) are completed within 48 hours prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, these do not need to be repeated.  
On progression, study patients will need to meet eligibility criteria #10 regarding required laboratory parameters (a- e) before moving to St age 2 of the 
protocol (see Inclusion Criteria ). In addition, the following criteria need to be met:

• In order to allow continued administration of  RRx -001 (or regorafenib ) despi[INVESTIGATOR_22176] a new lesion (per irRC), 
patients must have absence of symptoms and signs of clinically important morbidity due to disease progression (e.g., requirem ent for additional medical 
management to control symptoms or irradiation to prevent morbidity), absence of symptomatic rapid disease progression requiring urgent medical 
intervention (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]), and no decline in ECOG or Karnofsky performance status.  
• Patients are re -consented using a written informed consent document at the time of progression of disease.  
 
2. Enrollment : To be performed up to [ADDRESS_21371] Assessments:  Subjects will undergo all assessments including vital signs , height (screening only ), weight, ECOG performance status,  and symptom-
directed physical exam every [ADDRESS_21372] 8 weeks on study (Cycles 1 and 2), then every 4 weeks (Cycle 3+) during Stage 1.   A full physical exam 
needs to be conducted at Screening , prior to starting Stage 2, and at the Study Termination Visit (ST V). If screening physical exam is performed within 
seven (7) days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, it does not need to be repeated.  
4. Tumor Assessment:  Tumor CT/MRI assessments  during the screening period must be perform ed within 28 days prior to enrollment  and no more than 35 
days prior to start of treatment. Tumor assessments will be performed every 12 weeks (or more frequently , if clinically indicated), until disease progression  
per irRC (See Section 9.1.2).  Although the use of contrast agent is preferred, f or subjects allergic to the iodinated  contrast agent, either a non -iodinated CT 
contrast agent or an MRI is perm itted. MRI is also permitted if it is the best imaging modality for a given tumor site.  The same imaging modality for tumor 
assessments for each subject should be performed throughout the study.  Per irRC, a confirmatory scan will be carried out at [ADDRESS_21373]  imaging (with contrast) at Baseline (Screening) . A diagnostic CT  scan (with contrast) for RRx-
001 randomized subjects that are at Stage 2 (i .e. receiving irinotecan  and bevacizumab ) will be carried out at the first scheduled imaging visit after starting 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . See Section 8.1 and 9.1.2.  
6. Laboratory Assessments:  All laboratory testing will be performed by [CONTACT_14189]’s local laboratory. Laboratory evaluations are not required at Cycle 1 Day 1 
if screening evaluations are performed within 48 hours prior. Hematology includes: red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin,  platelets, and white blood cells 
with differential (neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil).  Complete Metabolic Panel includes: sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase , and LDH. Laboratory evaluations 
will be performed every [ADDRESS_21374] 8 weeks on study (Cycles 1 and 2), then every 4 weeks (Cycles 3+). CEA tumor marker will be assessed  at 
screening, on Day [ADDRESS_21375] : A serum pregnancy test will be performed on women of child- bearing potential (WOCBP) at Screening, and prior to starting Stage 2 
(irinotecan).  
8. Tissue Submission:  Archived tumor tissue will be collec ted during Screening. Archived tissue will be collected for subjects who consent to the collection 
and use of archived biopsy material for biomarker analyses. It is preferred that tumor biopsies be submitted for biomarker analysis as a formalin fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks ; however unstained slides are also acceptable (at least 1 0 slides, if possible).  
9. Quality of Life Questionnaires:  QOL Questionnaires should be completed at the beginning of the visit, prior to any other assessments and prior  to the subject 
receiving study drug. Subjects will complete QOL questionnaire ( Appendix 4) at their clinical visits every [ADDRESS_21376] 8 weeks on study (Cycles 1 
and 2), then every 4 weeks (Cycle 3+) , and at each visi t during Stage 2 The QOL Questionnaire is not required at Cycle 1 Day 1 if screening QOL 
Questionnaire is completed within 48 hours prior.  
10. Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications:  Adverse event assessment should be recorded in all subjects who have received at least one dose of either 
RRx-001 or regorafenib beginning with Cycle 1, Day 1, and continue until the Progression on irinotecan (if continuing to Stage 2) or at Progression on either 
RRx-001 or regorafenib if not proceeding to Stage 2. In either case the SAE will be followed to resolution if not resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline at time of

progression . Adverse events will be collected at each clinical visit. Concomitant Medications should be recorded at Screening and con tinuously throughout 
the same period as AEs, unless indication is for the treatment of an ongoing AE; in this case it should be recorded until resolution of AE to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_21377] supportive care procedures and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22183]/procedures.  
11. RRx-001 administration and clinical visits: RRx-001 will be administered at a dose of 4 mg IV once a week, with infusions performed every 7 days ±1 day 
apart, over a period of up to 4 hours, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 4 -week cycle.  Pre-medication  with a corticosteroid (e.g. 10 mg dexamethasone IV ) is 
required. Other agent s, for example ibuprofen  (see Section 6.0), may be administered as needed for pain relief  at the discretion of the PI . The use of 
palliative radiation and/or surgical intervention is under the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor.  
12. Regorafenib dosing: Regorafenib will be administered as directed in the package insert, at [ADDRESS_21378] 21 days of a 28 day cycle . 
Dose interruptions and reductions, if required, should strictly adhere to the guidelines in the package insert. The use of palliative radiation and/or surgical 
intervention is under the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor.  
13. Progression  Visit: Subjects found to have progressive disease as defined by [CONTACT_22249] (see ESASr below) will 
complete the assessments and  enter Stage 2 of the study.  All subjects will receive an irinotecan  (180 mg/m2 IV) on Day 1 of each 2 week cycle.  On 
progression, study patients will need to meet eligibility criteria #10 regarding required laboratory parameters (a -e) before moving to Stage 2 of the protocol 
(see Inclusion Criteria ).  
14. Post-Progression Follow-up and Survival Follow- up: Following disease progression  on RRx-[ADDRESS_21379]- Progression Treatment Period . During Survival Follow-Up, subjects 
will be followed every 8 weeks until death from any cause or withdrawal of consent.   
15. CEUS Imaging:  CEUS will be performed in newly enrolled subjects at Stanford University  before and after RRx -[ADDRESS_21380] and sponsor.  
16. Optional biopsy : may include fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22184] 4.  
17. Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (revised): The ESASr  consists of 9  visual analog scales (VAS) for pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, appetite, 
shortness of breath, depression, overall wellbeing and an extra empty VAS for the assessment of a less frequent symptom that might be important.  The 
severity of each symptom is  rated on a scale from [ADDRESS_21381] 
week of every cycle. Questionnaire is not required at Cycle 1 Day 1 if screening ESASr Assessment s completed within 48 hours prior . An increase of 2 or 
more points is classified as deteriorated, a change of 0 or ±1 as stable, and a decrease of 2 or more as improved. If the ESAS increases by [CONTACT_22250], compared to baseline, indicating deterioration, then the patient should be scanned for progression. If the scan is stable or better the decision about 
whether to continue RRx -001 or Regorafenib or restart irinotecan  should be made in consultation with the Medical Monitor .

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Colorectal Cancer 
Stage IV colorectal cancer is an aggressively morbid disease, with a poor prognosis: the median 
and 5-year survival rates are between 28 and 30 months and 10%, respectively ( Goldberg, 2013), 
with treatment.  Over the last decade, the incidence of colorectal cancer has decreased slightly, due to improved screening programs and detection of precancerous polyps, however the burden of disease remains high, and is disproportionate within demograp hic subpopulations such as 
African-American men  (Haggar, 2009). According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal 
cancer ranks 3
rd in terms of incidence and mortality (American Cancer Society. Colorectal 
Cancer Facts & Figu res 2011-2013, Rebecca Siegel). The natural history of the disease is 
associated with rapid systemic dissemination predominantly to the liver although extrahepatic hematogenous spread to the lung, peritoneum and bone with significant morbidity is not uncommon (Kufe, 2003).  
While surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment for early -stage colorectal cancer, 
palliative chemotherapeutic management to prolong overall survival and maintain quality of life 
is the first treatment option in medically inoperable metastatic disease ( Chibaudel, 2012). 
Three cytotoxic drugs are available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in the therapeutic continuum between first and third line therapy: fluoropyrimidines (e.g. capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. These drugs can be administered either in combination (doublets: fluoropyrimidine/ oxaliplatin, 5- FU/ irinotecan; triplets: 5 -FU/ 
oxaliplatin/irinotecan; or as monotherapy (fluoropyrimidine alone). Although there is much variability in prescription, and other combinations  are available, typi[INVESTIGATOR_22187] (5 -FU/
leucovorin/oxaliplatin) or XELOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) is used as first line 
therapy and FOLFIRI ( 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan) is used as the most common second line 
treatment ( Hess, 2010).  
Newer biological agents, particularly bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, have 
been shown to be potentiate the activity of the combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22188] -drug regimens  in the first or second line setting .  
The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab have been shown to increase survival in patients lacking the KRAS  mutation (KRAS wild type) giving an additional 
treatment option in the second or greater line  setting.   
This crowded and creatively chaotic therapeutic landscape (Goldberg, 2006) became even more 
active with the approval of the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, in September 
2012, in the setting of 3
rd line KRAS mutant or 4th line KRAS wild -type metastatic colorectal 
cancer.  
Based on the stop and go, that is intermittent maintenance therapy approaches investigated in such large scale trials as ‘OPTIMOX 1’, ‘OPTIMOX 2’, ‘DREAM’, and ‘CAIRO’, where the 
intermittent therapy arm involving rechallenge to the previous induction therapy post progression

oxaliplatin - and irinotecan- based chemotherapy, including the adjuvant setting, with or without 
anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, anti- EGFR therapy  that are refractory to irinotecan . 
This study will enroll subjects with both wild type and mutant KRAS status.  It will provide data 
to support an expanded Phase 2b or a Phase 3 study of RRx -001 therapy in colorectal cancer . 
2.3 RRx-001 
RRx-001 (N-(bromoacetyl)-3,3- dinitroazetidine) is a novel small-molecule, polynitro-substituted 
cytotoxic with pro-oxidant induced anticancer activity and a favorable toxicity profile compared with standard cytotoxic agents. RRx -[ADDRESS_21385] nucleophilic 
free thiols  (Scicinski, 2012). Because of the high reactivity of RRx-001, the only reaction 
products that have been observed are the glutathione (GSH) and cysteine adducts and the binding product of RRx-001 to  the beta Cysteine 93  on hemoglobin.   
In an in vitro blood distribution study using labeled RRx-001 and blood from three human volunteers, approximately 30% of the label was found bound to hemoglobin with the remainder 
in the plasma. The plasma soluble products were found to be the GSH and cysteine adducts. The toxicology of these metabolites has not been fully explored, however they are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_22189]-001-Cysteine found that a dose of 300 mg/kg in rats had no effects, compared to an IV 25 mg/kg dose of RRx-001, which was toxic. 
Binding to the beta Cysteine [ADDRESS_21386] impaired systemic 
oxygen delivery. 
In vitro experiments confirmed that high doses (3 mM) of RRx-001 induces a left shift of the p50 
curve, but the  change in the p50 curve was not observed at physiologically meaningful doses 
(< 20 µM). 
Compounds that bind to beta Cys-93 and change the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, can also 
enhance hemoglobin's nitrite reductase  activity, which generates nitric oxide under hypoxic 
conditions. RRx-001 has intra-tumoral vasoactive properties, inducing acute changes in tumor

microvascular blood flow up to 72 hours in squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCVII) tumor-bearing 
mice, which could arise from the red blood cell-mediated production of nitric oxide.  
An in vitro screen of RRx -001 activity revealed micromolar growth inhibitory (GI 50) values 
against a broad spectrum of both human and murine tumors, similar to the activity of cisplatin 
(Ning, 2012).  
As part of the n on-clinical safety evaluation program for RRx -001, repeat-dose (4-week) toxicity 
studies, a cardiopulmonary safety pharmacology study, an in vitro  genetic toxicology study (non- 
GLP), and an evaluation of blood/plasma compatibility were conducted. Fo rmulations containing 
up to 2.0 mg/mL RRx -001, prepared in 3% N,N- Dimethylacetamide ( DMA), 6% Polyethylene 
glycol 400 ( PEG 400) in sterile Water for Injection (WFI) were administered via intravenous 
infusion three times a week.  In animals, clinical changes and mortality/morbidity  were present 
beginning at 20.1 mg/kg in rats and 8.0 mg/kg in dogs. In these repeat -dose toxicology studies, 
mortality/morbidity in both species was associated with acute exudative pulmonary edema. Decreased erythrocytes and hemogl obin and increased total bilirubin occ urred in rats beginning 
at 12.0 mg/kg. In dogs, decreased erythrocytes and hem oglobin occurred beginning at 3 mg/kg 
and increased total bilirubin occurred at 5 mg /kg. In both rats and dogs, the erythrocyte, 
hemoglobin and bilirubin changes were reversible. The dog was considered to be the most sensitive test species.  As outlined in International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) Guidance 
S9 (NonClinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals), the highest non- severely toxic dose 
(HNSTD) , also described as the no observable affect effect level ( NOAEL) in dogs, was 
considered to be 5 mg /kg. However, based on the gross pathology findings indicative of 
pulmonary and liver toxicities, the lower dose of 3.0 mg/kg in dog is used as a dose level from which to set the starting dose. 
Rats administered a single intravenous (IV) dose of 12.5 mg/kg RRx-001 had transient elevations 
in blood pressure (20 – 25 mmHg), and mild, reversible effects on heart rate and several 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] p arameters. At 25 mg/kg, transient elevations in blood pressure (20 – 25 mmHg) and 
mild to moderate effects on heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_22190] -001 
was administered at a rate of 15 mL/hr.  When the 25 mg/kg dose was given at a sl ower rate 
(2 mL/hr vs. 15 mL/hr) signs of overt toxicity and mortality occurred. The mechanism for this 
finding is under examination. Macroscopic findings of red fluid in the thoracic cavity and mild to 
moderate red, discoloration in multiple lobes in the lungs were present. Because of this preclinical observation, each dose of RRx-001 was initially administered intravenously over 20 
minutes. 
Solutions of RRx-001 for Injection were previously tested for hemolytic potential:  Test formulations of 0 (vehicle), 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/mL RRx-001 were tested (1:1) with human 
whole blood and plasma. Hemolysis was evaluated by [CONTACT_22251]. Plasma compatibility was determined macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. Formulations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL were prepared by [CONTACT_22252]-001 powder with the vehicle (3% DMA, 6% PEG 400 NF, and sterile WFI USP). Osmolality values were 618, 612, and 614 mOsm/kg for the 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL formulations, respectively, compared with the control value of 606 mOsm/kg. RRx-001 at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/mL or vehicle alone did not cause hemolysis or macroscopic changes in plasma.

A time course following dilution of human whole blood (5 parts) to RRx-001 infusion solution 
(1 part) was followed over two hours. CBC parameters were collected at 1, 5, 15, 60 and 120 min. At this dilution and over this time period, only mild changes in cell size were noted. No evidence of clotting or hemolysis was seen.  
In a genetic toxicology scre ening assay , RRx-001 tested positive in both TA 98 and TA 100 in 
either the absence or presence of metabolic activation and was concluded to be mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay.  In vitro, RRx-001 at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/mL or 
vehicle alone did not cause hemolysis or macroscopic changes in plasma.  
The effects of RRx -[ADDRESS_21387] of RRx -001 on cell cycle kinetics and on apoptosis was analyzed using flow 
cytometry. RRx-001 triggered replicative cessation through the G1 to S phases. As a measure of 
HT-29 DNA damage after treatment, γ-H2AX foci were determined as a function of time after

nitrogen (RONS)- mediated in association with delayed  repair of induced DNA damage. The

It is unclear whether apoptosis or premature senescence is the predominant  response to the RRx-
[ADDRESS_21390] cells with a senescent -like, “stunned” phenotype. Although the se cells 
resemble senescent cells in several ways, senescence- specific markers were not measured . It is

Preclinical and Phase 1 data suggests that RRx -001 restore d sensitivity  to previously failed

cancer pathways. On this basis, reintroduction of irinotecan  is mandated, if feasible,  on

trial in lung cancer  (TRIPLE THREAT, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) have revealed an influx of CD8 
expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, confirming that RRx-001 is an immunotherapeutic as well as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_22192] (Brzezniak, 2016 ). 
2.5 Clinical Studies with RRx -001 
To date, RRx-001 has been studied in a single Phase 1 clinical trial (Protocol RRx001-11-01).  
The study design was standard ‘3+3’ dose escalation cohorts based on a modified Fibonacci 
scheme.  The primary endpoint was safety and pharmacokinetics with the objective of defining a 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  RRx -001 was 
administered to subjects intravenously through a peripheral line on a weekly and twice-weekly schedule. 
2.5.1 Safety 
Twenty-five subjects were treated at 6 dose levels of 10  (n=6), 16.7 (n=3), 24.6 (n=3) , 33 (n=4),

considered to be the maximum feasible dose when delivered over up to 8 hours.

There were 12 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in 10 subjects, all of which were 
considered unrelated to study drug.  The SAE terms were 1) seizures secondary to brain mets; 
2) hypercalcemia; 3) cerebral bleed; 4) increased somnolence; 5) atelectatic changes right lung base; 6) bilirubinemia ; 7) klebsiella septicemia; 8), upper gastrointestinal bleed; 9) pleural 
effusion (two SAEs in the same subject) ; 10) bowel obstruction; and 11) dehydration.  Overall, 
the types of serious AEs reported among this study population were consistent with the severity of illness and underlying disease. No ECG effects or clinically relevant RRx -001-related changes 
in vital signs or laboratory values were seen in the study.  
There were [ADDRESS_21396] dose of study drug, all considered 
unrelated to RRx-001, and related to the subjects’ underlying malignancy. RRx-001 was administered through a peripheral vein. 84% of subjects across the 6 cohorts 
experienced a prominent and transient, dose-dependent forearm vasodilation and transient mild 
to moderate pain that was ameliorated with slowing of the infusion time, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_22193] a slower rate, and concomitant administration of analgesics (short-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_22194] -inflammator y medications  such as corticosteroids as needed. In 
particular, premedication  treatment with corticosteroids and ibuprofen at the day of dosing was 
found to be effective. Premedication with corticosteroids is  required at every RRx-[ADDRESS_21397] dose cohort (83 mg/m
2) complained of moderately severe 
injection pain, that was  inadequately addressed with adjunctive opi[INVESTIGATOR_22195] a reduced total dose or a split dosing schedule (twice -weekly). Overall, higher doses 
tend to result in a concomitant escalation in pain, which has become more severe in the later 
cohorts. At present,  83 mg/m2 is the maximum feasible dose using the current infusion rates.  
Most subjects recovered from the injection site pain and vasodilation within minutes of the infusion being stopped or slowed down and without sequelae; four subjects temporarily developed a non- tender, non- erythematous cord -like induration over the vein of injection, which 
resolved spontaneously within a few weeks. Duplex ultrasound was negative for venous thrombosis and in the absence of warmth, swelling, redness or tenderness, the diagnosis was more suggestive of focal venous dilation than superficial phlebitis.  Initially, RRx -[ADDRESS_21398] cohort of an unpleasant nasopharyngeal burning sensation, which led to his (voluntary) discontinuation from the study, IV administration was moved to the antecubital or forearm area and the infusion rat e was reduced . One Phase I subject received seven (7) doses of 
RRx-[ADDRESS_21399] protocol (RRx001-11-
08) with no local ized pain, and no acute or latent systemic toxicity . Similarly, a Phase II patient 
(under this protocol, RRx001-21-02) received RRx -001 through a central line over five (5) hours 
with minimal complaints of pain  and no acute or latent systemic toxicity . 
An emergency use protocol of 2 mg (1 mL) RRx-[ADDRESS_21400] on the Phase 1 trial with intolerable local pain, demonstrated safety and feasibility: it was well -tolerated, systemically non -toxic, relatively easy 
to administer and the subject reported a sense of well -being for se veral days after the co -infusion. 
Subsequently, a Phase 2 protocol “An Open-label, Three Stage, Three Arm Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22196]-

2.0 m2) mixed with [ADDRESS_21402] demonstrated a markedly improved clinical status suggests that a trade-off of anticancer activity for convenience is unlikely. Shorter overall treatment times will 
also improve the feasibility of same-day radiotherapy.  
In summary, other than localized venous dilation and pain on infusion, RRx-001 was very well 
tolerated.  In the Phase 1 study, t he pain was dose related and resulted in attempts to slow  the 
infusion and split the dose between two days within a week.  The maximum feasible dose appears to be 83 mg/m
2 at the present time and under the present infusion conditions.  
2.5.2 Pharmacokinetics  
On infusion, RRx-001 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_22197]; conseq uently a bioanalytical method was 
developed and validated for the RRx-001-glutathione conjugate, a major soluble metabolite of 
RRx-001. Blood samples taken prior to the start of infusion, during infusion, at the end of the 
infusion then at time intervals p ost infusion were analyzed for RRx-001- GSH. Preliminary data 
suggests rapid clearance of RRx -001-GSH (median terminal half life: 10 -25 min). AUCt and 
Cmax of RRx-001-GSH were found to increase in a dose-dependent manner for doses from 
10 mg/m2 to 55 mg/m2.

The subject  had previously failed radiotherapy and imatinib. A partial response was reported in 
this subject at the first  8-week scan and was durable for just over a year.  Nine (9) out of 20

benefit had metastatic CRC (n=4), adenoid cystic carcinoma (n=2), pancreatic cancer (n=1), 
ovarian cancer (n=1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n=1).    
Eleven subjects (44%) dosed in the Phase 1 study had a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC).  Ten of the [ADDRESS_21405] therapy, including 
5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and, in some cases, also experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Per 
investigators, all subjects had rapi[INVESTIGATOR_22198] (≥ 2) 
on enrollment.  Only one subject had previously been treated with one line of therapy, 5- FU 
only, having rejected other standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Four of 9 evaluable (44 %) subjects, regardless of 
KRAS status or RRx -001 dose, had SD for ≥ 4 months.  These subjects received RRx -001 at a 
dose of 10 mg/m2, 55 mg/m2 and 83 mg/m2 (n=2). Four subjects, three with colorectal cancer 
(A, C and D) and one with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Subject B) became responsive 
to previously failed therapy after exposure to RRx-001, as shown by [CONTACT_22255].  One subject (D ) had SD for approximately [ADDRESS_21406] regained sensitivity to FOLFIRI, a regimen he had previously failed, based on a decrease in his CEA level from 511 to 162 ng/mL. Subject A had SD for approximately 6 months with RRx-001 and regained sensitivity to FOLFIRI, a regimen he had previously failed with a 
survival of over 25 months ( Reid, 2014).

Figure 1: Subjects Resensitized to Previously Failed Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 
2.[ADDRESS_21407] supported the rationale for current clinical development of RRx-001 in 
colorectal cancer. RRx -001 potently inhibited survival of colorectal HT- 29 cells, as measured by 
[CONTACT_10842] a modified mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity ( MTT assay). These effects were 
enhanced by [CONTACT_22256]. The findings are consistent with immunohistochemical analysis 
of in vivo treated HCT116 and Colo205 colorectal tumors where RRx-[ADDRESS_21408] magnified by [CONTACT_22257]. Moreover, excessive ROS 
levels in colorectal tumors ( Inokuma 2009) presumably render these cancer cells highly 
susceptible to redox active therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Based on the preliminary anti- tumor activity observed in the limited number of CRC subjects in 
the Phase [ADDRESS_21409] approximately the same clinical activity by [CONTACT_22258] a significantly more favorable safety profile for RRx -001.   While the number of 
CRC subjects treated with RRx -001 in the Phase 1 study is limited, the anti- tumor activity 
observed appears to be independent of subjects’ KRAS status and RRx -001 dose.  Several CRC 
subjects had an excellent response to subsequent chemo/radiotherapy after progression and this study will investigate whether treatment with RRx -[ADDRESS_21410]-RRx-001 with overall survival as the primary  endpoint.

In summary, the available preclinical and preliminary clinical data identify RRx -001, with its 
pro-oxidant mechanism of action and lack of systemic toxicities due to an apparent selectivity for 
malignant cells, as a potential novel agent for the treatment of CRC.  
2.7 Clinical Dose Selection  for RRx-001 
The RRx-001 dose selected  for this study is based  on experience from the Phase 1 clinical study.  
Although an MTD was not determined, the maximum feasible dose of 83 mg/m2 was determined 
based on a prolonged IV infusion time of up to [ADDRESS_21411] as rapid resolution upon 
discontinuation .   This adverse event , experienced  at all dose levels studied , was accompanied by 
a palpably prominent focal venous dilation, presumably due to the focal generation of nitric 
oxide within the vessel  that generally returned to baseline immediately after discontinuation of 
the infusion.  The  intensity of the pain, which was associated with increased dose and rate of 
administration, was managed by [CONTACT_22259] 8 hours and concurrent administration of anti- inflammator y medications, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_22199]/ or opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  
Twice-weekly infusions separated by  [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_21412] cohort  of 83 
mg/m
[ADDRESS_21413] with colorectal cancer developed an upper 
extremity  DVT during the study. 
Clinical benefit (PR + SD ≥ 4 months) was observed in 9 of 20 (45%) evaluable subjects in the 
Phase 1 study at all  dose levels.  There does not appear to be a dose- response curve based on the 
limited clinical data available.  Based on the safety and preliminary clinical activity observations 
from the Phase 1 study, a n initial dose of 16.5 mg/m2 and infused intravenously once weekly  was 
chosen for this Phase [ADDRESS_21414] since RT is administered immediately after RRx -001, clinical experience with 5 
patients to date (1 on an emergency use protocol and 4 patients on an ongoing Phase 2 protocol entitled  “An Open-label, Three Stage, Three Arm Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22196]-[ADDRESS_21415] Line or greater Non-Small Lung Cancer, and Second Line or greater High Grade Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior to Re- administration of Platinum Based 
Doublet Regimens (TRIPLE THRE AT)” (RRx001 -211-01)) has demonstrated significantly 
better tolerability. The improved tolerability is related to RRx -[ADDRESS_21416] appears to cause pain or discomfort at the site of intravenous injection, related to the release of 
nitric oxide. When RRx-001 is mixed with whole blood outside of the body, the released nitric oxide is sequestered by [CONTACT_22260]-infused.

Moreover, in the TRIPLE THREAT study, increased convenience of treatment has been 
accompanied by [CONTACT_22261] a dose corresponding to 2 mg/m2; in the 
BRAINSTORM study, under Amendment 02, the starting level of 5 mg/m2 has resulted in at 
least two Partial Responses.  
Subjects randomized to the RRx- 001 treatment arm will receive a once-weekly dose of RRx -001 
at 4 mg by [CONTACT_22262] a time period, not to exceed 4 hours from the time 
of extraction of the patient’s blood on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 4- week cycle. The dosing 
schedule window may vary ± [ADDRESS_21417] convenience or clinic schedules.

Per the FDA package ins ert, subjects randomized to regorafenib will receive regorafenib at 160 
mg orally daily on Days 1-21 of a 4- week cycle.

4.0 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This is a two-stage, phase 2, open-label, randomized (2:1), two-arm study comparing RRx-[ADDRESS_21419] 
oxaliplatin - and irinotecan- based regimens with bevacizumab and cetuximab or panitumumab  (if 
KRAS wildtype) .  
Effective August 15th, 2016, general enrollment for this protocol has been closed to new 
enrollment.  An expansion cohort remains open at Stanford University with the potential to 
enroll up to [ADDRESS_21420]:  
Stage 1 
• Arm 1 – subjects will receive once-weekly intravenous RRx-[ADDRESS_21421] feel it is necessary to mitigate 
infusion pain.  
• Arm 2 – subjects will receive regorafenib at 160 mg orally daily on Days 1-21 of a 4-
week cycle.  
Stage 2 
On progression all subjects will receive irinotecan. The recommended doses will be 180 mg/m2, 
administered once every two weeks. St udy patients will need to meet eligibility criteria #10 
regarding required laboratory parameters (a -e) before beginning Stage 2 (see Inclusion Criteria ). 
In addition, the following criteria need to be met:  
• In order to allow continued administration of  RRx-001 (or regorafenib) despi[INVESTIGATOR_22202] a new lesi on (per irRC), patients must 
have absence of symptoms and signs of clinically important morbidity due to disease progression (e.g., requirement for additional medical management to control symptoms

or irradiation to prevent morbidity), absence of symptomat ic rapid disease progression 
requiring urgent medical intervention (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]), and no decline in 
ECOG or Karnofsky performance status. 
 
• Patients are re-consented using a written informed consent document at the time of 
progression of disease.  
The study is designed to compare the safety and activity between RRx-[ADDRESS_21422] treatment will be randomized 2:1 to receive either RRx-001 or regor afenib in 4- week cycles until confirmed 
radiologic progressive disease per irRC and clinical deterioration or intolerable toxicity  
(Section 9.1.2). The study is also designed to investigate potential resensitization  to irinotecan  
post RRx-001 or regorafenib.  Subjects will undergo long term follow up for their response to 
subsequent therapy and for overall survival. Approximately 190 subjects will be randomized and followed for between 6 months and 18 months: 127. Arm 1 (RRx -001) will enroll approximately 
127 subjects and 63 Arm 2 (regorafenib).   
4.1 Duration of Treatment 
In the absence of  unacceptable treatment -related toxicity or disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_12695] (Section 9.1.2), subjects may receive the treatment to w hich they have been randomized 
(Arm 1, RRx -001 or Arm 2, regorafenib) for up to [ADDRESS_21423] been randomized to regorafenib are not permitted to crossover to receive 
RRx-001.  
4.2 Study Procedures  
Subjects will be screened for eligibility within the twenty -eight (28) days prior to enrollment 
according to the Schedule of Assessments. Radiologic t umor assessment diagnostic CT (with 
contrast), will be performed at Screening unless imaging was performed within [ADDRESS_21424] scans at Stage 2 (i.e. receiving irinotecan- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be 
carried out at the first scheduled imaging visit after starting irinotecan.  In addition to safety labs 
as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, for subjects randomized to receive RRx -001, blood 
may be drawn for biomarker assays at Screening, Cycle 2, Day 1 a nd at Progression. 
Tumor biopsies may be performed following discussion and concurr ence with the Medical 
Monitor.  
Subjects will undergo all  protocol-required assessments including laboratory evaluations, vital 
signs, physical exam and QOL questionnaire every 2 weeks during Cycles 1 and 2, then every 4 
weeks from Cycle 3+.  Subjects will be imaged by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced chest/abdomen/pelvis CT

4.[ADDRESS_21426] s will be followed 
every two (2) months by [CONTACT_22263]/or phone contact [CONTACT_22264].  
4.4 Data Monitoring Committee   
On further review, given the lack of systemic toxicity observed to date, a data monitoring 
committee will only be convened to review significant serious adverse events and unacceptably 
frequent adverse events.  There will be 2 planned analyses; an interim analysis once 61 (50%) 
OS events have occurred, and a final analysis once enrollment has been completed and [ADDRESS_21427] occurred.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_22244], clinical laboratory assessments, and monitoring of AEs.  Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v4. 03.   
4.5 Response Assessment  
Radiographic and/or physical assessments of the malignancy will be made at Screening/Baseline 
(within [ADDRESS_21428] dose of RRx-001 or regorafenib) and every 3 cycles (8 weeks ± 7 days) thereafter.  However, to capture non- radiologic progression, Physicians will administer 
the well validate d questionnaire: the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESASr) to 
patients at Screening and during the first week of every cycle. The ESASr
  consists of 9 visual 
analog scales (VAS) for pain, tiredness,  drowsiness, nausea, appetite, shortness of breath, depression, overall wellbeing and an extra empty VAS for the assessment of a less frequent symptom that might be important. The severit y of each symptom is rated on a scale from [ADDRESS_21429] severe. The physician completes this assessment starting at Screening. An 
increase of 2 or more points is classified as deteriorated, a change of 0 or ±1 as stable, and a decrease of  2 or more as improved. If the ESAS increases by [CONTACT_22265], compared to 
baseline, indicating deterioration, then the patient should be scanned for progression. If the scan is stable or better the decision about whether to continue RRx -001 or regor afenib or restart 
irinotecan  should be made in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
Objective response (CR+PR) as determined by [CONTACT_423]’s best tumor response, duration of response and time to progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_22266] -[ADDRESS_21430]/MRI 
scan should be performed at approximately 4 weeks from the previous scan for all patients with an objective response of ≥ PR.  The clinical benefit rate (CBR = CR+PR+SD≥4 months) will 
also be determined.  Tumor markers , as applicable,  will also be assessed on a monthly basis, but

will not be used as a basis for disease progression or response in the absence of radiologic 
findings consistent with disease pr ogression or response. 
4.6 RRx-001 Treatment  
RRx-001 treatment arm patients will receive once-weekly intravenous RRx-001 premixed with 
the patient’s blood prior to reinfusion, at a set rate of 3 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes, 
increased by 1 mL/minute every 10 minutes thereafter u ntil completion of the infusion, in the 
schedule described in the Schedule of Assessments. .   
All subjects will receive premedication with corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV  or 
PO) prior to RRx -001 administration, along with ibuprofen, benzodiaz epi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], gabapentin, and/or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_22203].  
The patient's identification must be verified by [CONTACT_22267].  Ensure the RRx-[ADDRESS_21431] patient (using patient identifiers noted on labeling), that the RRx -001 and 
anticoagul ant are mixed with the patient's autologous blood, and re-infused back to the correct 
patient.  DO NOT proceed with administration if any discrepancies are noted.  
 
Proper Handling:  
The methodology for administering the RRx-001 dose by [CONTACT_22268]’s blood is 
based on procedures used in blood product transfusions.  Standard procedures for avoiding hemolysis will be followed. These include the use of large gauge IV needles (19g or larger) and slow consistent rate during blood draw to avoid undue mechanical shear stress to red blood cells.  
Whenever blood is present during the administration procedure, handle with care and do not shake.  Avoid excessive temperatures, (both high and low temperatures can cause hemolysis). Avoid conditions that create high turbulence or trauma to the red blood cells.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging  and FDG -PET 
X-ray computed tomography (CT ) with contrast procedures will be  performed to establish a 
baseline for the tumor, and disease progression will be monitored as detailed in Section 4.4.  
Imaging should be performed with the use of contrast. The Screening CT procedure does not 
need to be repeated if a CT was performed within [ADDRESS_21462] should be performed  throughout the study. As 
described in Section 9.1.2, an FDG- PET scan  may be carried out at the Investigator’s discretion 
for informational purposes since RRx- [ADDRESS_21463] or MRI progression is observed . Imaging in this study will be carried out as 
described in  (Table 8).

8.3 Tumor Biopsies  
See Appendix 4 for further details  concerning tumor biopsy methodology, labeling and shipment 
instructions for a central pathology service. Determination of p53 and PDI (RRx -001 subjects): 
Documentation of p53 status or level of PDI expression can occur via the following: 1) Prior genetic testing/profiling results; 2) Submission of archival tissue to local laboratory if site has the required capabilities; or 3) Submission  of archival tissue to central laboratory. Only in the event 
that p53 status is unknown and there is not sufficient archival tissue to be submitted, the patient should undergo a research biopsy of the primary tumor if deemed clinically appropriate. 
8.4 Laboratory Assessments  
Clinical laboratory (hematology , chemistry , and tumor marker), urinalysis and serum or urine 
pregnancy (on females of childbearing potential) will be performed according to the Schedule of 
Assessments  and under Institutional Standard of Care. 
The Investigator will monitor the laboratory test findings.  If any laboratory test is abnormal, it 
will be followed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Abnormal laboratory tests may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], be considered clinically significant and, thus, constitute or be associated with an AE. In such cases, they must be reported

8.[ADDRESS_21467] common adverse event associated with RRx -001 was transient 
discomfort or vascular pain at the injection site, for the length of the infusion, which was 
unpleasant to the clinical trial participants. Pretreatment with a parenteral or oral corticosteroid 
and NSAID on dosing days mitigated the intensity of pain and is a prerequisite and cornerstone of pain management in this Phase 2 trial. However, the administration of corticosteroids outside 
of dosing days on a chronic or subchronic basis is contraindicated except in emergencies and in clinically symptomatic disease pseudoprogression (see below). In these cases, the lowest possible dose for symptom management should be used. As immunosuppressants, corticosteroids may alter the release of RRx -001-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and thus 
impact negatively on anti- tumor activity.

Phase [ADDRESS_21468] be addressed on a case -by-case basis, with individualized 
infusion rates and the co-administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and benzodia zepi[INVESTIGATOR_22211].   
Another complication is the potential for treatment- related necrosis and tumor enlargement or 
pseudoprogression with RRx-001. The clinical significance of this complication is variable, ranging from none to requiring medical intervention. The management is individualized, depending on the size of the acutely enlarged mass, and its relation to adjacent anatomical structures. An acutely enlarged necrotic mass may present with compressive symptoms, mimicking other more common conditions including true progression and therefore even nonspecific complaints such as abdominal pain or nausea should increase the index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_22212]/or biopsy suspected cases aggressively.

before-and-after images of this EGFR+ NSCLC TRIPLE THREAT patient taken from a 
published case report are a case in point. [Brzezniak et al. 2016]. A biopsy of this tumor revealed 
inf
iltration of T lymphocytes and only scant surviving tumor cells. Over time presumably due to 
resorption  of the necrotic debris, the lesion shrunk in siz e. Therefore the apparent increase or  
decrease in s ize 
of RRx-001-treated tumors m ay in reality be a function of the development or 
s
ubsidence of inflammatory swelling.

(MedDRA) for coding all AEs. A dverse events within each system will be summarized by

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product,  whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. 
Pre-existing events, which increase in frequency or severity or change in nature during or as a 
consequence of use of the study medication will also be considered as AEs. AEs may also 
include pre- treatment or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated 
procedures. Any medical condition or clinically signi ficant laboratory abnormality with an onset 
date before any study required procedures is considered to be pre-existing, and should be documented in the CRF as such. Any AE (i.e. a new event or an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition) with an onset afte r the administration of study required procedures up to the last day 
on study (end-of-treatment visit) should be recorded as an AE on the appropriate CRF page(s). 
For the purposes of this study an AE will not include the following: 
• A medical or surgical pr ocedure (e.g., biopsy, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion); associated with the underlying condition that leads to the procedure;  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before start of study medication

administration and which do not worsen or increase in severity or frequency after the

10.2.[ADDRESS_21477] Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis , tumor marker ) or 
other abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) per se are not reported 
as AEs.  However, those abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_22279]/or symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet 
the definition of an adverse event (and recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious). The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE include the following: 
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms;  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy. 
 Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE. 
10.3 Monitoring Adver se Events  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_22280]; the reported 
verbatim term will be documented including the date of onset and resolution, NCI- CTCAE grade 
of severity, relationship to study medication, outcome, and action taken. Adverse events will be reported starting at the Cycle 1 Day 1 clinical visit and be recorded continuously through the treatment period and until the Study Termination Visit (STV) or resolution if not resolved to 
baseline at time of STV.  
Adverse Events Data Elements:  
• Verbatim description of event.  
• NCI-CTCAE v4.03 grade for AE severity. 
• Start and stop date of AE. 
• Relationship to study drug (attribution).  
• Whether or not the subject  was discontinued from the study due to the AE. 
• Action taken  with regard to the administration of study drug. 
• Whether or not the event met the criteria  for a SAE; if yes, an SAE form needs to be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hrs.

outcome. All AEs will be assessed for severity using the NCI -CTCAE v4.03.  
If a particular AE is not listed in the NCI- CTCAE v4.03, the following criteria will be used:  
• Grade 1 = Mild  
• Grade 2 = Moderate  
• Grade 3 = Severe  
• Grade 4 = Life threatening or disabling 
• Grade 5 = Death  
 
10.3.2 Causality Relationship of AEs  
The relationsh ip of each AE to the study medication will be evaluated by [CONTACT_22281]: 
• Unrelated: The AE is unlikely or clearly not related to the study drug. The AE can be 
explained to be likely related to other factors such as conco mitant medications, underlying 
disease, or the subject’s clinical state.  
• Related: The AE is possibly or definitely related to the study drug.  A plausible temporal 
sequence exists between the time of administration of the study drug and the development 
of the AE and it follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or other 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22217]. 
 If the Invest igator determines a n SAE is associated with study procedures, the Investigator must 
record his causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.

death should include an Adverse Event term for the cause of the death.  For all reports in which 
an Adverse Event term is not provided (other than ‘Death’), follow-up for the cause of death will be required.  Only in the rare occurrence that no verbatim description of an adverse event can be

obtained from the investigative site, then “Death – Unknown Cause” will be used as the event 
term. 
10.4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the follow outcomes: 
• Death; 
• Life-threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death);  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject  who received study 
medication; 
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition, examples of such events are: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic response, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency or drug abuse, etc.  
 
Death: Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. All deaths regardless of causality 
must be reported. See  Section 10.3.4.  
Life-Threatening:  “Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  
An AE is considered “life- threatenin g” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE, that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191]” means the subject  has been admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22218].  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. AEs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22219]. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets these criteria.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:

• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g. , caregiver relief);  
• Skilled nursing facilities;  
• Nursing homes; 
• Routine emergency room admissions; 
• Scheduled or elective same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22220] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_22221] a SAE.  
All SAEs require report ing to the Sponsor within 24 hours of a site’s knowledge of the SAE.   
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive procedures, and surgery, should not be reported as AEs. 
However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.  
10.4.1 Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction (AR) means any AE caused by a drug. An AR or adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a subset of all suspected adverse reactions (SARs) as defined below for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected AEs for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the AE. 
10.4.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspect ed 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
For reporting purposes, AEs assigned a relationship to treatment of “ related” will be classified as 
SARs. 
AEs assigned a relationship to treatment of  “unrelated” will not be classified as SARs.  
10.4.3 Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions  
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or 
the FDA package insert or is not listed at the  specificity or severity that has been observed. For 
approved drugs (i.e., regorafenib ) used in this study please refer to the currently approved 
product label for a summary of the AEs associated with that product. The IB provides Investigators with inform ation (clinical and nonclinical) about the 
investigational product. The IB includes those AEs for which a causal relationship is suspected 
or confirmed (SARs or ADRs) as well as AEs that may be predicted to occur based on the 
Confidential Information   Page 60 of 90 
09 Nov 2016 
IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_21481]. The IB is used as the basis for the 
Sponsor’s determination of “unexpected” for reporting purposes. 
“Unexpected” SARs are AEs not currently listed in the IB. An AE or SAE may also be 
considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
10.5 Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events 
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response 
or any other reason, according to the definition of AE noted earlier and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page or electronic-based CRF (eCRF) screen. 
When a subject  withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below. 
In case the AE has not resolved up to [ADDRESS_21482] dose of study drug, the final outcome of 
these ongoing and new unrelated AEs will be captured as “Not Recovered/Not Resolved” or “Recovering/Resolving” whichever is applicable.  
10.6 Reporting Responsibility  
An IND safety report will be submitted for any SAR that is both Serious and Unexpected. Before submitting this report, need to ensure that the event meets the following criteria:  
• SAR  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
 If the AE does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an expedited IND safety report.  
10.6.[ADDRESS_21483] immediately report to the Sponsor all SAEs, 
regardless of whether the investigator believes that they are drug related, including those events listed in the  protocol as anticipated to occur in the study population independent of drug 
exposure or in the Investigator Brochure as predicted to occur with the drug. Study endpoints that are also SAEs are reported to the Sponsor. 
10.6.2 Instructions for Notification of SAEs: 
The SAE reporting period will extend from the signature [CONTACT_22304], until [ADDRESS_21484] dose of study drug, or the resolution or 
stabilization of the AE to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_21485] be made immediately, i rrespective of the extent of the available

SAE information. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow up) on 
previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow up reporting of Exposure in Utero (Pregnancy) cases.  
In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g. , if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
Investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_21486] awareness of the SAE and to document the time of his/her first awareness of the SAE.  
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the Sponsor or designee in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_22282]. This information may be more detailed than information captured on the AE CRF . In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail 
to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant mediations and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject  death, a summary of available 
autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Sponsor or designee.  
For all AEs, the details must be recorded in the source documents and the Investigator must

whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring  prompt notification to Sponsor

permanent sequelae, commencement of other anticancer therapy or loss to follow  up.  
10.6.3 Reporting Serious Events to the IRB and FDA  
SAEs and SSARs require  immediate notification to the site’s IRB as per t heir reporting 
guidelines. All correspondence relating to IRB correspondence should be sent to Sponsor or designee for inclusion in the trial master file (TMF).  
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening SAR shall be reported to the FDA as soon as possible but in no case later than seven  (7) calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information. Notification may be made by [CONTACT_22285].  
The minimum information shall include the subject’ s study number, age, gender, name [CONTACT_22305], and the term for the SAE or SSAR. 
The Sponsor must also notify the FDA and all participating Investigators in a written IND safety 
report of any SAE that is both serious , related, and unexpected, as soon as possible, but in no 
case later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
Sponsors are specifically required to notify all participating investigators (and FDA) in a written 
IND safety report of “any adverse experience ass ociated with the use of the drug that is both

significant risk for human subjects” (§ 312.32(c)(1)(i)(A),(B)). 
Any relevant additional information that the Sponsor obtains that pertains to a previously 
submitted IND safety report must be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report 
without delay, as soon as the information is available. 
10.6.4 Additional Sponsor Responsibility  
More generally, Sponsors are required to “keep each participating Investigator informed of new 
observations discovered by [CONTACT_22286], particularly with respect to adverse effects and safe use” (§ 312.55(b)).  
10.6.[ADDRESS_21487]- study Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
If a subject terminates study participation early, any SAEs that occur for a period of up to [ADDRESS_21488] dose of study drug should be reported to the Sponsor. SAEs that occur after 
completion of the study are not required to be reported to the Sponsor unless the Investigator believes the event is related to study drug.

A single interim analysis for futility is planned at the time that 50% o f the total death events are 
expected.  The objective of the futility analysis is to stop randomization to the study if there is 
sufficient evidence that such therapy is not improving outcomes relative to the control therapy.  As the intent of the interim analysis is for futility only, no adjustment to the type I error at the 
final analysis is proposed. An independent statistical service provider will perform the interim efficacy analysis in conjunction with the DMC.  As noted previously, the DMC also will review 
safety data every 3 -6 months. 
Exploratory Analyses: 
Screening Data:  All baseline subject  characteristics of demographic data (age, height, weight, 
race, ethnicity, etc.), medical history (abnormalities only), cancer history, cancer treatment history, PE findings (abnormalities only), and concomitant medications at study entry will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. Demographics will be tabulated and summarized . 
Due to the changes in Amendment 01, particularly with respect to inclusion/exclusion criteria and study design, subjects that were enrolled prior to Amendment [ADDRESS_21497] approve any change to the protocol prior to seeking approval from the IRB/IEC. Investigators will be responsible for enrolling only those subjects who have met all the protocol inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, or must have obtained prior approval from the Medical Monitor for deviations from the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
12.2 Disclosure  
All information provided regarding the study, as well as all information collected/documented during the course of the study will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission from the Sponsor.

Appendix 6: CEUS Imaging Protocol  
Purpose 
• To assess tumor response before and after treatment with RRx -001 with CEUS via 
measurement of tumor blood volume and perfusion 
• To assess tumor response with irinotecan post -RRx-[ADDRESS_21524] start of 
irinotecan therapy.  
• CEUS Imaging will be carried out at Stanford University only  
 
Methodology  
• CEUS will be performed in patients with liver metastases prior to infusion of RRx -001 
(baseline) and at the end of infusion  in accordance with the Schedule of Assessmen ts.  
• The decision as to who (which patients), on what therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22234], [CONTACT_22308], 
and the Stanford University radiologist, [CONTACT_22309] ent 
• Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc., North Billerica, MA) given as a bolus or infusion 
via peripheral IV catheter in the forearm of the patient opposite the side of the ultrasound 
examination  
• Recommended dosage as a bolus: (1) 10 microliters (μL )/kg of the activated product by 
[CONTACT_22303] 30 -60 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush  
• Recommended dosage as an IV infusion: 1.[ADDRESS_21525] added to 30 mL of 
preservative- free saline where the rate of infusion should be initiated at 2.0 -4.0 mL/minute 
but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement  
 
CEUS Procedure  
• Image tumors larger than [ADDRESS_21526]  
• Assess tumor morphology with B -mode 
• Identify target tumor and select best ac oustic window for its assessment  
• Measure maximum width, length, and depth of the tumor with electronic calipers

• Calculate the tumor volume with the formula for a prolate ellipsoid (volume cm3 = length cm 
* width cm * height cm * π6)  
• After determination of the largest tumor cross- section in sagittal or parasagittal plane, fix the 
transducer in place and set the contrast specific imaging parameters  
• Keep all parameters including gain settings, focus, and depth as well as the position of the 
probe with respect to the lesion scan plane constant during the study  
• Quantify perfusion parameters with destruction -replenishment analysis produce 
microbubble -replenishment time -intensity curves  
o Image contrast microbubbles without disruption at a low acoustic amplitude pressure or 
mechanical index (MI)  
o Increase the acoustic pressure amplitude for a few frames causing bubble disruption; 
immediately after that, return imaging is returned to the non -disrupting level to observe 
the replenishment of the microbubbles into the ROI. This effectively creates a negative 
bolus within the imaging plane, which decays as inflow of fresh bubbles replenishes the 
vasculature. The initial rate of replenishment is related to flow; the steady state to 
vascular volume.

Appendix 7: Additional Information About Irinotecan Toxicity   
The most common toxicities associated with irinotecan , which is generally well tolerated,  are 
neutropenia, anemia, delayed diarrhea, and fatigue  (Sargent, 2001) . In subjects with an elevated 
bilirubin >2 mg/dL , 5-FU plus bevacizumab may be  preferable to irinotecan, as dose reductions are 
not necessary to avoid the potential for severe toxicity . In case of ileus, fever or febrile 
neutropenia, prompt supportive care is necessary including the use of antibiotics. The Warnings 
Section excerpted below from the package insert describes the risks associated with irinotecan 
administration  (Camptosar , US FDA- approved product information).

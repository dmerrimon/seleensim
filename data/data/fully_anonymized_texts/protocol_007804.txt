Interest in fasting -based programs (i.e. intermittent fasting) for improvement of health and longevity  
continues to grow [1-3]. While benefits of intermittent fast ing have been convincingly  demonstrated in 
rodent models, the more limited data in humans is less clear. As such, additional  investigations of the 
Fast Bar  Version 1.0 
Protocol [ XXXXXX]  June 19,  2020  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template –  v1.0 7 Apr 2017   4 effects of fasting -based protocols in humans are needed. The short -term  fasting (e.g. 12 to 48 hours in 
durat ion) utilized in many intermittent fasting programs are  considered safe, but some individuals may 
find them subjectively difficult. As such, the question of  whether the benefits of fasting can be obtained 
while small amounts of food are  consumed is of  subs tantial interest. An attractive strategy may be to 
consume small quantities of foods specifically  formulated to maintain a fasted or pseudo -fasted state. If 
such a strategy is successful, the benefits  of fasting may be maintained even though a small amount of 
food consumption , which will alleviate subjective feelings of hunger and promote adequate nutritional 
intake.  
One commercially available product that is designed to be consumed during periods of intermittent  
fasting is the Fast Bar™ ( www.fastbar.com ),which stems out of  the well- researched fasting -mimicking 
diet [4, 5] to assist prolonged fasting . The unique formulation of  the Fast Bar™, which consists of nuts and 
other select ingredients, is thought to minimize deviations in metabolic biomarkers associated with  a 
fasting state. This may allow for extension of a fasting period through reduced subjective difficulty of 
fasting. However, these items have yet to be evaluated for its effects during intermittent fasting  through 
a controlled research trial. As such, the  objective of this study is to evaluate the metabolic  and subjective 
effects of consuming a novel food  product (Fast  Bar™) after a short period of fasting.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Negative energy balance induced by [CONTACT_619993] (CR) or increased energy expenditure induced by 
[CONTACT_14759] (EX) improves all metabolic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, including plasma LDL -
cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, HOMA -IR index, and CRP concentrations [ 6, 7].  However, chronic 
calorie restriction, whose bene ficial effects have been known for decades, has not been adopted by [CONTACT_47041] 
a small percentage of the US population, in part because compliance to chronic and extreme diets is very 
low.   
In healthy human subjects, three  monthly cycles of  fasting -mimicking di et (FMD) lasting 5 days reduced 
body weight, trunk and total body fat, and blood pressure [ 5].  In the same study, a post hoc analysis 
demonstrated that body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total and low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and C -reactive protein were more beneficially affected in those participants with 
the highest baseline levels for the same variables, suggesting that FMD may be particularly effective in participant s with established metabolic syndrome .  Moreover, FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and 
glucose homeostasis in both typ e 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models .  In mice, a 4 -day fasting mimicking 
diet (FMD) induced a stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx -1, followed by [CONTACT_619994]3 -driven generation of 
insulin -producing b cells, indicating that FMD promotes the reprogramming of pancre atic cells to restore 
insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in rodent  models 
[8]. 
The Fast Bar
TM is a designed to provide energy without interfering with the protective and metabolic 
effects of fasting.  The Fast BarTM diets consist of 100% ingredients, which are generally regarde d as safe  
(GRAS).

a minimal risk  to the study subjects.  
BENEFITS  
Participants  may not receive any direct benefit from taking part in this study.  
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
The research questions to be addressed are:  
1. What are the metabolic effects of consuming a Fast  Bar™, as compared to consuming a typi[INVESTIGATOR_619981], after an overnight fast?  
2. Based on the observed metabolic effects, does consumption of a Fast  Bar™ allow for maintenance 
of the fasting state?  
3. Does consumption of a Fast  Bar™ facilitate fasting by [CONTACT_619995]?    
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION  FOR ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
Physiological condition 
associated with fasting  • Blood ketone ( ß-
hydroxybutyrate , BHB) level  
• Blood glucose level  When hepatic glycogen stores are 
exhausted (after 12 -24 hours of 
total fasting), the liver produces 
ketones (ketogenesis: acetoacetate 
(AA) and BHB  to provide an energy 
substrate for peripheral tissues.  
Secondary    
Questionnaires  • Food evaluation  
• Self-evaluation  The secondary objective is to 
assess the subjective variables  
 
[ADDRESS_824576] Bar  Version 1.0 
Protocol [ XXXXXX]  June 19,  2020  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template –  v1.[ADDRESS_824577] participation is 2 days .   
The study will be carried out off- site (at participants’ home) .   
After the explanation of the study and informed consent signature, eligible participant s will be 
randomized to three  groups .  
1. Subjects in all  groups will be asked to consume a standardized ready -to-eat dinner meal before 
[ADDRESS_824578]  Group : overnight fasting  (approximately 15 hours) , then consume a breakfast on day 
2; 
3. Fast Bar Group : overnight fasting  (approximately 1 5 hours) , then  consume a Fast  BarTM on day 2. 
4. Water -only fasting group: overnight fasting (approximately 1 9 hours);  
5. Subject all  groups will be asked not to consume any food or calorie -containing drinks  other than 
the study foods  till [ADDRESS_824579]  Bar™ during  intermittent 
fasting.   That is, this research will allow for quantification of the changes in metabolic  biomarkers after 
consumption of a Fast  Bar™, following a period of acute fasting, to determine  whether deviations from 
the fasted state are smaller and more transient than when consuming a breakfast bar.   This comparison 
will facilitate a better understanding of whether the Fast  Bar™ is a viable strategy for extending the 
benefits of intermittent fasting despi[INVESTIGATOR_619982].  
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
Fasting leads to the mobilization of hepatic glycogen stores .  When the glycogen stores are exhausted 
(after 12 -24 hours of total fasting), the liver produces ketones (ketogenesis: acetoacetate (AA) and ß -
hydroxybutyrate (BHB) to provide an energy substrate for peripheral tissues .  Consumption of food, 
depending on the composition of the food, i.e., the absolute levels and ratios of carbohydrate, protein 
and fat, may markedly affect the ketogenesis state.   We hypothesis that the specially formulated Fast  
BarTM will not significantly impact the overnight fasting -induced k etogenesis state.  
4.4 END OF S TUDY DEFINITION  
The end of the study is defined as completion of the procedure s shown in the Schedule of Activities

N/A   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a))  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525232], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions .  Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may 
require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severi ty.   
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities .   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures .  Moderate events may cause some interferenc e with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment .  Severe events are usually incapacitating .  Of note, the term  “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
• Extreme – life-threatening or disabling  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_619999]/her clinical judgment .  The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below .  In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect .   
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event .  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
Fast Bar  Version 1.0 
Protocol [ XXXXXX]  June 19,  2020  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template –  v1.0 7 Apr 2017   12 • Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study interven tion 
and event onset,  or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
William W Hsu , MD , will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or 
unexpected .  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the s tudy intervention .   
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study or upon review by a study personnel . 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF).  Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_10263] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event .  All AEs  occurring 
while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship .  All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and n ot reported as an AE .  However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE .   
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed .  AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Angie Huang, MS, RDN , will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until the last day of study participation .  Events will be followed for outcome 
information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Following adverse event ( AE) or serious suspected adverse rea ction will be reported to IRB with in 10 
working days after investigators becoming aware of the event . 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Following serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction will be reported to IRB within 
10 working days after investigat ors becoming awa re of the event.  
8.3.7  REPORTING EVENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
Angie Huang, MS, RDN , will report eventual AE and/or SAE to the participant .  Any adverse effects will be 
reported to participant  directly in person or via phone /video conference/email.

8.3.10 DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.3.11  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the revi ewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB).  The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
8.3.12 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Angie Huang, MS, RDN , will report eventual UPs to the participant .  Any adverse effects will be reported 
to participant  directly in person , via phone  or Zoom . 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
The primary trial outcome will be the ketone (beta -hydroxybutyrate, BHB) levels 3 hours (T3) after 
consuming the Fast and changes in BHB area under the curve (AUC) between [ADDRESS_824591] Bar grou p. 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Sample -size estimation is based on two considerations:  
1. Sample -size estimation is based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_619988] (BHB) levels of 0.25 (SD: 0.19) 
and 0.16 (SD: 0.05) mM for the Fast Bar and the Breakfast groups, respectively.  With t test (one-
Fast Bar  Version 1.0 
Protocol [ XXXXXX]  June 19,  2020  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template –  v1.0 7 Apr 2017   14 tailed) of difference between two independent means, a total sample size of 62 will be necessary 
to achieve 80% power with an α error probability of 0.05. Sample  size calculation was performed 
using the GPower v3.1.9.6 (Franz Faul, University Kiel, [LOCATION_013]; Actual power = 0.8164386; Actual α = 0.0291400). * 
2. Sample -size estimation is based on Fisher’s exact test (one tailed) for proportion difference  
between the breakfast and Fast Bar groups: food consumption will  reduce blood ketone in 67 % 
vs. 33 % of the participants in the breakfast and Fast  Bar g roup s, resp ectively. A total sample size 
of 64 will be necessary to achieve 80% power with an α error probability of 0.05.  ** 
 
Based on prior experience in similar dietary intervention studies, we anticipate an approximate 10% 
dropout and/or data loss .  36 subjects per group will be enrolled.  S ample  size calculation was performed 
using the GPower v3.1.9.6 (Franz Faul, University Kiel, [LOCATION_013] ; 
Actual power = 0.8164386; Actual α = 
0.0291400) . A fasting only group (32 subjects) will also be included for comparison.  A total 108 subjects 
will be enrolled.

9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Continuous trial outcome variables will be evaluated for normality; normalizing transformations or 
nonparametric statistics will be used as needed .  All group comparisons on post -randomization efficacy 
outcomes will include randomized treatment ( Fast Bar vs breakfast ). A 1-sided level of significance set at 
P<0.05 will be used for the primary outcome; secondary and exploratory outcomes will not be adjusted  
for multiple hypothesis testing.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
The primary trial outcome will be the  ketone (beta -hydroxybutyrate, BHB) levels 3 hours (T3) after 
consuming the study foods (Breakfast Bar or Fast Bar) and change s in BHB area under the curve (AUC) 
between 0 to 4 hours after consuming the study foods on day2 . 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The correlations of the time- dependent blood BHB levels between the groups (Fast Bar vs. Fasting and 
Fast Bar vs. Breakfast) will be carried out using Pearson correlation coefficient  or Spearman's rank 
correlation analyses.  
Separate analyses by [CONTACT_1570] s will test for difference  in mean levels of continuous or prevalence 
of categorical outcomes .   
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
Incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact tests .     
9.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Baseline comparability between randomized groups will be evaluated for demographics, age, sex, BMI .  
Group differences will be evaluated with t -tests or nonparametric rank sum tests for continuous variables, 
and chi -square tests for categorical variable s.  Standardized group differences (group difference divided 
by [CONTACT_620000]) will also be computed for each baseline variable.  
   
9.4.6  PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
An interim  analys is will be carried out when 50% of the trial has been completed . Interim analys is will 
assess the accrual rates, basic characteristics of the study population, protocol adherence , and answer 
following questions:  
1. Are the assumptions under which the original sample size was computed appropriate?  
2. Is it likely that a relevant intervention difference will be demonstrated?

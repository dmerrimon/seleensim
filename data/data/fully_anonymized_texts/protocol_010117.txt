Clinical Study Protocol Study No. [ADDRESS_1201883] been implicated in 
disease extent or seve rity. Of these, the microorganisms in dental plaque are recognized as 
playing a prominent etiological role. In the absence of adequate oral hygiene, supra  gingival 
plaque accumulation may be rapid, and visible gingival i nflammation manifested within a few 
days.  
Even in extreme plaque accumulation conditions, thorough oral hygiene and mechanical plaque 
removal is reported to reduce gingivitis and restore health. Control of supra  gingival plaque is an 
essential element in e ffective oral hygiene programs. Oral hygiene devices are under continuous 
review for efficacy and safety, as new devices or improvements of features on existing devices 
are developed.  
2. Study Objective  
The primary objective of th is exploratory  study is to evaluate the efficacy  of an Oral Irrigator in the 
reduction of gingivitis  compared to a negative control  over a 3 week period  by [CONTACT_861916].  
The secondary objective  is to evaluate  the efficacy of an Oral Irrigator in the reduction of plaque  
compared to  a negative control  using  the extended Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein Index (T QHPI ) 
after 3 weeks of use.  
3. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a single -center, examiner -blind, three  (3) week , two (2) treatment, parallel group, 
randomized study design. Thirty  (30) subjects who have shown evidence of  gingivitis and plaque 
will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will  be evaluated  for gingivitis using the Modified Gingival 
Index (MGI) and the Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) and  evaluated  for plaque using the Turesky 
Modified Quigley -Hein Plaque Index (TQHPI)  at two (2) time  points: Baseline and after three (3) 
weeks of product use . Prior to each visit (Baseline and Week 3) subjects will be inst ructed to 
abstain from brushing and performing any oral hygiene 12 hours prior and to abstain from eating, 
drinking (small sips of water will be allowed up to 45 minutes prior to the visit), chewing gum and 
tobacco use for four (4) hours prior to the visit s.   
Qualified subjects will be stratified and randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups , 
toothbrushing on conjunction with an  Oral Irrigator or toothbrushing without an  Oral Irrigator,  
(N=15/treatment) based on  Baseline  gingivitis (MGI)  score , Baseline  whole mouth mean TQHPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_32005] , Baseline number of bleeding sites, and tobacco use. Subjects will be given product use 
instructions and asked to perform a supervised usage of their assigned products. Subjects will be 
instruc ted to brush twice a day for approximately three (3) weeks with their assigned products  
and return for plaque and gingivitis measures at approximately three (3) weeks after  the Baseline 
visit. Specific procedures are detailed below (Table 1).

Baseline  
Subjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent, of which they will receive a signed 
copy. Medical history information will be obtained, reviewed, and retained as site source 
documentation. Demographic information and study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be obtained 
and documented on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF). Subjects will be eligible to 
enroll in the study after meeting study entrance criteria . 
Subjects will then receive an Oral Examination  by [CONTACT_861918] r. Then the subjects will 
receive an MGI  and GBI examination , in that order.  Following that, subjects swish their mouth with 
disclosing solution and an experienced examiner will conduct a pre -brushing plaque exam: Turesky 
Modified Quigley -Hein Index (TQHPI ). Subjects will qualify for participation if they have a baseline 
whole mouth mean MGI score between 1.75 and  2.5, a Baseline whole mouth mean TQHPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] 
(>2.00), and between [ADDRESS_1201884] usage instructions. Subjects wi ll brush according to the provided  usage 
instructions with their assigned  oral hygiene products  (toothbrush  and toothpaste  with/without Oral 
Irrigator) . The group with the Oral Irrigator will also use the device  before  brushing with the provided 
toothbrush  and toothpaste . This on -site practice brushing will be considered one of the su bject’s 
two daily brushings. Subjects will be instructed to use their assigned products twice per day, 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2021043  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 6 of 15 following the provided usage instructions for approximately 3 weeks.  The Oral Irrigator will only be 
used  once a day  at the evening brushing s. 
Prior to leaving the clinic, subjects will be scheduled for their next visit (Week 3, ± 2 days) and 
reminded to refrain from using their oral hygiene products  for 12 hours a nd refrain from eating, 
chewing gum, drinking (small sips of water will be allowed up to 45 minutes ), and tobacco use   for 
[ADDRESS_1201885] related will be reported as will all oral related Adverse Events.  
 
Week 3 (± 2 day):  
Subjects will return to the site and bring their test products. Continuance criteria will be assessed 
and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Subjects will then receive O ral Examination , MGI, and GBI  
assessments  (in that order) by [CONTACT_861919] . Following that, subjects will swish their 
mouth with disclosing solution and the same experienced examiner will conduct a pre -brushing 
plaque exam: Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein Index (TQHPI).  
 
Any Adverse Events or general comments will be recorded on the appropria te eCRF. All serious 
AEs will be reported. As for non -serious AEs, only voluntarily reported whole body adverse events 
that are potentially product related will be reported as will all oral related Adverse Events.  
 
Subject accountability will be recorded o n the appropriate eCRF and subjects will be dismissed 
from the study. Subjects must return all test products in order to be exited from the study.

product. Kit box labels will also contain the study number, emergency phone number, distributor 
name/address, appropriate caution statements, and other inform ation as required by [CONTACT_861920] d clinical SOPs. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_861912] "ship to" clinical 
site address and a "content statement" listing study number and kit box numbers contained within. 
Supplemental product will be provided if additional product is ne eded. Supplemental product may 
be dispensed only after consulting with the sponsor for correct treatment group identification; the 
subject identification number and original kit box number must be provided to the sponsor.   
 
The site will be provided with a code breaker report in a sealed envelope. If the study blind needs 
to be broken, a subject’s investigational product may be ascertained by [CONTACT_787378] (appropriate procedure for breaking the blind). The sealed code breaker repo rt will 
be opened if a clinically serious AE occurs or management of the subject requires knowledge of 
the identity of the investigational product. The Investigator should immediately inform the Sponsor 
that the code wil l be broken and record the date, tim e, and reason for breaking the code in writing.  
10. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet enrollment criteria will be stratified based on Baseline MGI  (≤ 2.4 vs > 2.4) , 
Baseline number of bleeding sites (≤ 45 vs > 45) , Baseline w hole mouth mean TQHPI  (≤ 3.0 vs. 
> 3.0)  and smoking status  (yes/no) . Subjects will then be randomized to one of the t wo (2) 
treatment groups using a balance and assignment procedure on site. This assignment process 
and the distribution of test pr oducts will be conducted in a protected area that will ensure blinding 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. [ADDRESS_1201886] return will be 
recorded on the Clinical Materials Inventory  provided by [CONTACT_1034].  Subjects from the same 
household will be assigned to the same treatment group.  
11. Determination of Sample Size  
Thirty ( 30) subjects, 15 per treatment group , will be enrolled in this study.  The sample size was 
based on logistical considerations.  
12. Safety Variables  
Safety Observations and/or Measurements  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_669175].  Adverse event (AE) data will 
not be solicited by [CONTACT_801960]. However, all AEs will be recorded in eCRF .  
Oral Examination  
Assessment of the oral soft tissue will be  conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and 
perioral area utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and gauze. The examined structures 
will include the gingiva (free and attached), hard and soft palate, oropharynx/uvula, buccal mucos a, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, labial mucosa, mucobuccal/mucolabial folds, lips, and perioral area.  
Assessment of the oral hard tissues will be conducted via a visual examination of the dentition and 
restorations utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and air syringe. All abnormal findings will 
be recorded and categorized by [CONTACT_669176]; hard tissue findings will be categorized as “other 
oral”. An AE will be recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after investigational product usage  
or an y previously noted abnormal finding increases in severity during a treatment period.  
 
Examiner: K. Milleman , RDH, BSEd, MS  
 
13. Efficacy Variables  
The same examiner will evaluate clinical measurements for each subject at all time points . The 
examiner will  be blinded as to the treatment assigned to each subject in each period. Clinical  
information will be recorded for all scorable teeth present excluding 3rd molars, teeth with crowns, 
or large restorations, i.e., covering 50% or more of the tooth surface, b ridges, orthodontic 
appliances, or implants . 
 
The order of clinical measurements will be as follows:  
A. Modified Gingival Index  
B. Gingival Bleeding Index  
C. Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein Plaque Index (extended)  
 
 
A. Modified Gingival Index (MGI):  
 
Gingivitis will be scored on the buccal and lingual marginal gingival and interdental papi[INVESTIGATOR_861913] (six scores per tooth):  
 
0 = normal (absence of inflammation)  
1 = mild inflammation (slight change of color, little change in texture) of an y portion of the 
gingival unit  
2 = mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit  
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2021043  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 10 of 15 3 = moderate inflammation (moderate glazing, redness, edema and/or hypertrophy) of the 
gingival unit  
4 = severe inflammation (marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous  bleeding or 
ulceration) of the gingival unit  
 
MGI whole mouth score is computed by [CONTACT_861921].    
 
Examiner:   K. Milleman , RDH, BSEd, MS  
 
 
B. Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI): as defined by [CONTACT_861922].  
 
The gingiva should be lightly air -dried and a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip inserted 
into the gingival crevice to a depth of 2mm or until slight resistance is felt.  The probe is then run 
gently around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60◦ and in contact [CONTACT_861923][INVESTIGATOR_2130]. Minimum axial force is used to avoid undue penetration into the tissue and the probe 
is moved around the crevice, gently stretching the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  Each of the 3 gingival areas,  i.e., 
buccal, mesial/dystal and lingual, of the teeth will be probed in this manner waiting approximately 
30 seconds before recording the number of gingival units which bleed, according to the following 
scale:  
 
0 = absence of bleeding after 30 seconds  
1 = bleeding observed after 30 seconds  
2 = immediate bleeding observed  
GBI whole mouth score is computed by [CONTACT_861921].  
 
Examiner:   K. Milleman , RDH, BSEd, MS  
 
 
C. Tures ky Modified Quigley -Hein Plaque Index  (extended)  
 
The plaque deposits on the teeth will be scored on six sites (distobuccal, midbuccal,   
mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual) of all 28 teeth (excluding  buccal surfaces 
of the upper 1st and 2nd molars,  3rd molars, crowns and surfa ces with cervical restorations)  
according to the Quigley -Hein Index as modified by [CONTACT_861924] . which emphasizes plaqu e in 
contact [CONTACT_861925].  Buccal, lingual, and whole mouth average plaque scores will be  
calculated for each subject and tooth surfaces by [CONTACT_861926]  (the examiner will score all 168 sites however the whole mouth mean 
will later be computed from only 162 sites - the 6 sites used in the plaque sampling will be 
excluded from plaque calculation ).  Scoring criteria are shown below.   
 
Scoring criteria are shown in Table 2.    
 
Table 2.  Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein Index  
Score  Description  
0 No Plaque  
1 Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin.  
2 A thin, continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical margin.  
[ADDRESS_1201887], but less than two thirds of the side of the 
crown of the tooth.  
5 Plaque covering two thirds or more of the side of the crown of the tooth.  
8 Ungradable site  
9 Missing tooth  
Examiner:  K. Milleman , RDH, BSEd, MS  
14. Hypothesis  
 The following hypotheses will be investigated for each efficacy endpoint at Week 3: 
Gingivitis Hypothesis : 
 
Null Hypothesis : There is no difference between treatment groups with respect to the mean GI 
change from baseline (MGI , GBI, or number of bleeding site s) at 3 weeks when an adjustment 
is made for the respective baseline GI score.  
 
Alternative Hypothesis :  There is a difference between the treatment groups with respect to 
mean GI change from baseline (MGI , GBI, or number of bleeding sites ) at 3 weeks when  an 
adjustment is made for the respective baseline GI score.  
 
Plaque Hypothesis : 
 
Null Hypothesis : There is no difference between treatment groups with respect to the mean 
TQHPI [CONTACT_433173] 3 weeks when an adjustment is made for baseline TQHPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_32005].  
 
Alternative Hypothesis :  There is a difference between the treatment groups with respect to  
mean TQHPI [CONTACT_433173] 3 weeks when an adjustment is made for baseline 
TQHPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005].  
15. Statistical and Analytical Plans   
Statistical analyses for gingivitis efficacy will be based on whole -mouth average MGI , GBI, and 
number of bleeding sites  change from baseline scores (Baseline minus Week 3).  An ANCOVA will 
be performed to determine treatment differences on the whole mouth average gingivitis reduction 
with the respective baseline gingivitis score as the covariate. Baseline by [CONTACT_861927] 10% level.  Separate 
analyses will be performed for each gingivitis endpoint  with MGI being primary . 
 
Statistical analyses for plaque efficacy will be based on average whole mouth TQHPI  [INVESTIGATOR_861914] (Baseline minus Week 3). The 3-week plaque reduction will be analyzed for 
treatment differences using a n ANCOVA with baseline whole mouth TQHPI  [INVESTIGATOR_861915].  
Baseline by [CONTACT_861928] 10% level.   
 
The within -treatment difference s from baseline gingivitis sc ores (MGI , GBI, number of bleeding 
sites) will be tested versus zero using  a paired difference t -test. Similar within -treatment analyses 
will be carried out for TQHPI.  
 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2021043  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 12 of 15 The lingual and buccal surfaces of the gingivitis and plaque endpoints will be analyzed  separately 
for treatment differences as described above.   
 
If the data does not satisfy the normality criterion, transforming the data or analogous 
nonparametric methods will be employed. Additional analyses may also be performed in order to 
more fully understand the data. All treatment comparisons will be considered two -sided with an 
=0.[ADDRESS_1201888] receive prior approval from P& G and 
the Investigator’s IRB.  A copy of the IRB -approved advertising and the documentation thereof 
must be provided to P&G.  
Data Collection  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and 
are available at the site.  
Case Report Forms  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRFs to be used in this study.   It is the 
responsibility of the Investi gator to maintain and submit accurate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor. 
All hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
All questions should be answered.   For paper CRFs, if an entry requires correction, a single line 
will be placed through the entry so as not to obscure the original record, the corrected entry will 
be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_121754], and a reason will be given for the 
change.   There will be no whiteouts or erasures.   For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires 
correction, the change is made directly to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to 
provide a reason for the change, and the correction is logged in by [CONTACT_121755].  
As necessary, the Data Manager may make specified allowable changes to the database without 
issuing a query to the site, as agreed upon by [CONTACT_395312]. Examples of allowable 
changes include incorrect date formats, incorrect current year recorded (as in the start of a new 
year), and unambiguous spelling errors . Changes to common abbreviations and symbols to 
equivalent text to meet system or coding constraints (e.g., @ = at, ~ = approximately), may also 
be allowable. Values that are ambiguous or open to interpretation will be queried to the sites. It is 
the resp onsibility of the Data Manager to ensure all changes are supported by [CONTACT_395313]/or are unambiguous.  
Source Documents  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical record s) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and is 
available at the site. Any CRF used as a source document must be identified as such in the 
Investigator Notebook.  
Protocol Amendments/Changes  
Changes to the Protocol following IRB approval affecting the safety of subjects, scope or 
objectives of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study will be documented as 
amendments.  Such changes will require the Sponsor, Investigator, and IRB approval prior to 
implementation , unless immediate action is required to safeguard subject safety.  Administrative

 Study: Excess Opi[INVESTIGATOR_241590] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Detailed Protocol  I. Background and Significance  Prescription drug use, particularly opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], has become an increasingly prevalent issue in the [LOCATION_002]. (1-4) After orthopedic surgery, opi[INVESTIGATOR_241591]-operative pain management, and orthopedic surgeons are the third highest prescribers of opi[INVESTIGATOR_241592]. (5) With the growing concerns of addiction and abuse, there has been a drive to reduce the prevalence of excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_241593].   In orthopedic surgery, there is variability and unpredictability in provider preference for prescription length and dosage. This further varies by [CONTACT_241613].  These factors can result in excess, unused medication, which can be deleterious and even dangerous.   For instance, in one study of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patients, the probability of long-term use correlated with the opi[INVESTIGATOR_241594]-operative month (6). This suggests that the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_241595] a patient may affect the likelihood of long-term use.  Additionally, left-over post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_241596].   Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a system for proper opi[INVESTIGATOR_241597].  When given a prescription here in the BWH Foot and Ankle clinic, patients are instructed to dispose of left-over medication in the drop box at the main BWH campus or at a similar drop box at a local police or fire department. A recent review of 6 studies with 810 patients found that 67%-92% of patients reported having unused opi[INVESTIGATOR_241598] 42% to 71% of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_241599].  However, no more than 9% of patients in any study reported bringing medication to drop off locations to be disposed of properly. (7)     Deterra Drug Deactivation System offers a series of pouches and containers that contain carbon MAT12 that renders opi[INVESTIGATOR_241600]-retrievable and 99% deactivated. Deterra has been proven to work with narcotics, antibiotics and transdermal patches. (8)  By [CONTACT_241614], they are rendered unusable, and made safe for landfill disposal, meeting both FDA and DEA standards. (8)  This product also falls within the guidelines of the Office of National Drug Control policy supporting at home drug deactivation systems for the removal of unwanted medication from the home. (9)   Drug deactivation pouches offer a safe and effective method for opi[INVESTIGATOR_241601].   However; it is unknown to what degree patients will use this system compared to the standard protocol that utilizes a community drop box.    The current investigation will address this by [CONTACT_3553] a prospective, randomized control trial in which test subjects be instructed to dispose of unused opi[INVESTIGATOR_241602] a deactivation pouch or a state approved medication drop box.  
12/21/[ADDRESS_293377] Selection  This study will include foot and ankle orthopedic patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241603] a surgical procedure.  These patients will stand to benefit from the increased information about opi[INVESTIGATOR_241604]. Those under age [ADDRESS_293378] Enrollment  Subjects will be identified in the outpatient orthopedic foot and ankle clinic of Brigham and Women’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients can be identified at any of the Brigham orthopedic locations: main campus, 850 Boylston, Faulkner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or Foxborough. Orthopedic foot and ankle outpatients that fit our criteria will be approached during their pre-operative visit by a study staff member. Patients who arrive for a preoperative visit at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241605]. The study staff will then proceed as described in the below procedure.   V. Study procedures  After obtaining approval from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Institutional Review Board, Brigham and Women’s foot and ankle orthopedic surgical patients will be eligible to participate in this study. We will monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_241606]. We expect to enroll [ADDRESS_293379] a history of prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].   Patients will be informed of the nature of the study and, if willing to participate, be verbally consented by [CONTACT_241615]’s pre-operative clinical visit. They will be asked if they would be interested in hearing more about the study. If they respond yes, the person consenting the patient will read through the fact sheet with them and ask if they would like to participate in the study.  A record of consent will be 
12/21/2017  
 maintained on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with the patient’s name, date of birth and date of consent. Participants will be informed that their survey responses will be anonymous and remain separate from any documents containing personal information. Subjects will be randomized into [ADDRESS_293380] at the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241607], including the Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [ADDRESS_293381]-operative follow-up appointment.  The survey will be anonymously completed on REDCap a Partners approved website. An Excel spreadsheet will be generated with de-identified data responses only. All responses will be stored on Partners secure computers using Partners approved applications.    If a patient does not attend their 6 week follow up appointment, they will be contact[CONTACT_241616]. If they chose to complete the surveys online, the following statement will be read over the phone to patients:   “The Partners HealthCare standard is to send email securely.  This requires you to initially set up and activate an account with a password. You can then use the password to access secure emails sent to you from Partners HealthCare. If you prefer, we can send you “unencrypted” email that is not secure and could result in the unauthorized use or disclosure of your information. If you want to receive communications by [CONTACT_241617][INVESTIGATOR_241608], Partners HealthCare will not be held responsible. Your preference to receive unencrypted email will apply to emails sent to you from research staff in this study. If 
12/21/[ADDRESS_293382] to be documented with each research group.”  Depending on the response of the patient, the REDCap link to administer the survey will be sent via the patient’s choice of secure or unsecure email.  Documentation of the patient’s communication preference will be made in the research record.   VI. Biostatistical Analysis  The endpoint for the study will be after all available patients have completed the brief survey.   VII. Risks and Discomforts  The subjects in this study will already be at BWH for an orthopedic foot and ankle procedure. This standard of care will not change.  The only difference is the additional survey and provision of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_241609]. Although the Deterra system is not routinely used at BWH, it has been widely used in other healthcare settings and is an approved technology for safe drug disposal.  If subjects decline to participate in the study, they will not be offered a Deterra system as it is not routinely administered.    There will be no follow-up or note in the medical record concerning participation in the survey or answers recorded by [CONTACT_423]. No information will go into the patient’s medical record regarding their participation in the study.  The subjects’ responses to our survey will remain confidential. Subjects will not be forced to fill out the questionnaire and, if they choose, may decline to answer any of the questions. It is anticipated that the questionnaires have no affiliated risk of physical or emotional harm.   This study carries no associated risk of physical or emotional harm to the subjects. If the subject feels uncomfortable participating in the study or answering any of the questions, he/she may decline to participate. The questionnaire responses will remain anonymous.  VIII. Potential Benefits  The study may benefit patients by [CONTACT_241618], reducing the risk of abuse and overdose. It will also help determine if this is an effective means of excess drug disposal for future patients and the community at large.   IX. Monitoring and Quality  Study staff listed in IRB is responsible for monitoring validity and integrity of all data. All data will be collected, viewed, recorded, and analyzed only by [CONTACT_146814]. Principal investigators will oversee all monitoring and quality assurance.

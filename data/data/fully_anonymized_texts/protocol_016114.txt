  3. BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
3.[ADDRESS_837389] rapi[INVESTIGATOR_628442].  In 2014, it is predicted that 18,170 cases will be diagnosed and 15,450 patient s will die of this disease. [ 1] 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
7 Globally , esophageal cancer was diagnosed in 482,300 persons and 406,800 individuals died of 
this cancer in 2008.[2]  Therapy remains inadequate, as these numbers show, and few definitive 
trials have been conducted in esopha geal cancer specifically.  Based on a few large randomized 
trials that have included esophageal cancer in addition to gastroesophageal junction cancer and gastric cancer, it is believed that esophageal cancer responds similarly to standard chemotherapy 
as these lower GI malignancy sites.[3]  Thus, the standard of care is a platinum -fluoropyrimidine 
doublet (+ trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive tumors) upfront and recently, [ADDRESS_837390], and 
RAINBOW, as the combination of Paclitaxel and Ramucirumab.[4- 6]  There are, however, no 
other established lines of therapy beyond this and the treatment algorithm remains wide open to 
additional new effective drugs in this disease.  
 Recently, immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_528069] -[ADDRESS_837391] CTLA -4, was FDA approved for the tre atment of melanoma 
after two randomized phase 3 clinical trials showed a significant survival benefit.[7,8]  
Monoclonal antibodies directed against PD -1, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have also shown 
promising results in metastatic melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer, and renal cancer. [9-12] 
Importantly, in melanoma the majority of responses to both CTLA -[ADDRESS_837392] for greater than one year.[12,13]  Pembrolizumab was granted FDA 
approval in 2014 on the basis of  a phase 1 clinical trial expansion cohort of 173 patients with 
refractory metastatic melanoma ( Robert et al. ). Refractory melanoma patients receiving 
pembrolizumab had an overall response rate of 26% and 88% of t he responding patients were still 
benefitting from the drug after 6 months.[7]  Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated and 
drug- related grade 3 and 4 toxicity occurred in only 13% of patients.  
 
A large, multicenter phase [ADDRESS_837393] (MK -3475- 028, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This trial is molecularly prescreening 
patients for PD -L1 positivity. Preliminary data generated by [CONTACT_528096] 
33% of [ADDRESS_837394] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in 
many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_837395] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditio ns, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to 
CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
8 engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 has been 
resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytopl asmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 
tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (IT SM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_837396] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_628443].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double 
negative) T -cells as well as su bsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 
(PD-L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors .  Both ligands are type I 
transme mbrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_837397] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments .  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -
cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  
This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be c onsidered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -
L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for 
the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
 3.[ADDRESS_837398] of PD -L1 and PD -L2 in human esophageal cancer 
is limited.  One study by [CONTACT_628462] -L1 
and PD -L2 expression after esophagectomy.[14] They evaluated 41 esophagectomy patients by 
[CONTACT_5203]-time quantitative PCR, using newly generated monoclonal antibodies that recognize human 
PD-L1 (MIH1) and PD -L2 (MIH18).  They demonstrated that PD -L positive pat ients had a 
significantly poorer prognosis than negative patients.  This was more pronounced in advanced

9 stage tumors. Multivariate analysis indicated that PD -L status was an independent prognostic 
factor. Although there was no significant correlation betw een PD -L1 expression and t umor -
infiltrating T lymphocytes.  PD -L2 expression was inversely correlated with tumor -infiltrating 
CD8+ Tcells.  
 
Until recently, there was  limited clinical experience with immune checkpoints inhibitor in 
gastroesophageal cancer. A phase [ADDRESS_837399] one patient who had a durable, 
over 2.5 years, partial response.[15]  
 
Recently, the gastric cancer results of Keynote - 012 wer e presented at GI Cancers Symposium in 
San Francisco, [LOCATION_004] by [CONTACT_628463] .[16] This [COMPANY_006] phase 2 clinical trial screened 
162 patients with recurrent of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GE junction and found that 65 (40%) were PD -L1 positive.  PD -L1 expression was assessed in archival tumor 
samples using a prototype IHC assay and the 22C3 antibody.  Patients with PD -L1 staining in the 
stroma or in >  1% of tumor cells were eligible for enrollment.  Of these 65 patients, 39 patients 
received Pembrolizumab at 10mg/kg every 2 weeks.  Nine (23%) had received <  1 prior therapy 
and 26 (67%) had received two or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_437376].  The treatment was well tolerated and grade 3 -5 adverse events occurred in only 4 patie nts (10%), including grade [ADDRESS_837400] overall response by [CONTACT_107443] (N=39) was 33% (95%CI: 19.1- 50.2) with [ADDRESS_837401] overall 
response by [CONTACT_9559] (N=36) was 22% (95% CI:  10.1- 39.2) with 8 partial responses, 5 
stable disease, and 19 progressive disease.  Overall, 53.1% of patients showed at least some improvement from baseline in the measurement of their tumor size by [CONTACT_9559].  Of the patients with response, [ADDRESS_837402] had responses of 24 weeks or longer and many responses are ongoing.  Six month progression- free survival is 24% and median overall survival has not  yet 
been reached.   A trend toward an association between higher levels of PD -L1 expression and 
response, progression- free survival, and overall survival was observed.  
 A second study in esophageal carcinoma, t he Keynote - [ADDRESS_837403], 2015.[17]   This study 
screened 83 patients for PD -L1.  Of these, 37 were deemed PD -L1 positive by [CONTACT_628464] - 012.  Of these, 23 patients (17 with squamous cell  carcinoma and 5 with 
adenocarcinoma and 1 with mucoepi[INVESTIGATOR_131715]) were enrolled.  Two patients (8.7%) had one prior therapy for advanced disease, nine patients (39.1%) had two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_165816], and 11 (47.8%) had three or more prior lines of therapy for advanced disease.  Treatment -related adverse events occurred in only four (17.4%) patients, including one decreased 
lymphocyte  count, one decreased appetite, one liver disorder, and one pruritic rash.  There were 
no treatment -related deaths or discontinuations due to treatment -related adverse events.  
Pembrolizumab -specific toxicity included 2 patients with grade 2 hypothyroidism and 2 patients 
with grade 2 adrenal insufficiency, neither requiring pembrolizumab discontinuation.  Of  23 
patients, a partial response rate was documented in 30% (95% CI:  13.2- 52.9) of patients by 
[CONTACT_107443].  Five of 17 squamous cell carcinoma patients had a major response and two of five adenocarcinoma patients had a major response.  Overall, 5 2.2% of patients showed a 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837404] been 24 weeks or longer in 7 patients, 
including 2 adenocarcinoma patients.  The median time to response was 16 weeks and the median duration of response was 40 weeks.  
 Data from KEYNOTE -059 (DFCI Protocol 15- 073) have recently become available to co -
authors and is embargoed (strictly confidential) until the presentation at the ASCO Meeting on 
June 4
th, 2017.  A manuscript has been submitted to Lancet.  KEYNOTE – [ADDRESS_837405] 1.1.  Important points 
of this study relevant to this protocol  are:  1)  the study enrolled 259 patients, of whom 51.4% 
were gastroesophageal junction cancers;  2)  the study enrolled both PD -L1 positive and negative 
patients, of whom 42.1% were PD -L1 negative; 3) Objective response was 15.5% for PD -L1 
positive patients and 6.4% for PD -L1 negative patients; 4) Patients with PD -L1 negative tumors 
who received pembrolizumab as a third- line treatment for metastatic disease had an objective 
response r ate of 8.6% with 3.4% achieving complete response; 5) Median duration of response 
was 16.3 months in PD -L1 positive patients and 6.9 months in PD -L1 negative patients. 
 This trial is being performed to further characterize pembrolizumab’s  activity  in esophageal 
carcinoma, particularly in the esophageal adenocarcinoma population th at is less common in East 
Asia ( with only 5 patients reported in the Keynote - 028 study ).  However, we would also like to 
perform an exploratory analysis of North American squamous  cell carcinoma patients, which may 
have a different pathophysiology from East Asian patients.  This is based on the fact that North American  squamous cell carcinoma patients are HPV negative [18]  and these patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_628444].  
 3.3.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
 An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial eval uated three dose 
levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities 
were observed.  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement 
and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the 
MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be 
sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data anal ysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 
release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK 
and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharm acokinetic analysis  has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837406] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma 
indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg 
Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure 
margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based 
on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose 
regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation 
revealed that there was  no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure 
was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further expl oration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of 
pembroli zumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dyna mics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in 
the exposure range established in melanoma as asso ciated with maximal efficacy response and 3) 
will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 4. PARTICIPANT  SELECTION  
 4.[ADDRESS_837407] : 
 
1. Histologically confirmed , measurable, unresectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell 
carcinoma of the esophagus.  For the purposes of this study, undifferentiated carcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas will be categorize d as adenocarcinomas.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837408] meet Sievert Type 1 criteria:  “Adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus which 
usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplas ia of the oesophagus (i.e. 
Barrett’s oesophagus) and which may infiltrate  the oesophagogastric junction from 
above.”  For the purposes of this protocol, this will be interpreted as:  greater than 50% of 
the tumor must be above the GE junction or, alternati vely, the tumor must involve the GE 
junction and arise in the setting of biopsy -documented Barrett’s esophagus (specialized 
intestinal metaplasia).  
3. Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease.  Patients 
with recurrence w ithin 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy  may be 
considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable disease.  
4. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.  
5. Be ≥  [ADDRESS_837409] commonly an EGD biopsy from the esophagus .  Newly -obtained is defined as a specimen 
obtained up to 6 weeks (42 day s) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1.  Subjects for 
whom newly -obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety 
concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.  Please note, patients may not in itiate therapy until the biopsy specimen is received at the 
Dana- Farber Cancer Institute.  
8. The first 15 patients with adenocarcinoma will be offered an optional tumor biopsy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_628445]) at 8 weeks.  Starting with adenocarcinoma patient #16, pati ents 
must have an accessible tumor and must agree to tumor biopsy at 8 weeks; this will continue to be mandatory until a total of [ADDRESS_837410] a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale (Appendix A) . 
10. Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy 
within [ADDRESS_837411] dose of study medication (Re ference Section 6.3.2).  
Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > [ADDRESS_837412] dose of study therapy.

 Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  
  5. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 5.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  
 Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore . Registrations  must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants  may begin protocol therapy . Issues that would cause treatment 
delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the study  must  be 
canceled . Registration cancellations  must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.  
 5.2 Registratio n Process for DF/HCC Institutions  
 DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.

week cycle  Experimental  
 6.1.1 Timing of Dose Administration  
 Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart ( Section 11).  Trial treatment ma y be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.  
 All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
 Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: - 5 min/+10 min).  
 The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.  6.2 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations  
Medications or vaccinations specifically pr ohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccinatio n may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with 
the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
  6.2.[ADDRESS_837427]’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be re corded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be incl uded on the CRF.

6.2.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_528071] 
(including ret reatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Intranasal influenza vaccines  
• Investigational a gents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy   
Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion.   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_837429] dose of trial treatment and while  
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modul ate symptoms from an event 
of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
 Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are pro hibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
6.3 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
 6.3.[ADDRESS_837430] -feeding women may be enrolled if th ey are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
18 considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically 
sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater th an 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the 
duration of the study.  The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a 
barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should s tart using birth 
control from study Visit [ADDRESS_837431] dose of study 
therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine de vice, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of  the 
study and during the  follow -up period defined in section 8.2-Reporting of Pregnancy and 
Lactation to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006].  If there is any question that a subject will not reliably 
comply with the requirements for contra ception, that subject should not be entered into the study.

outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Me rck if the outcome is a serious adverse 
experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening 
complication to the mother or newborn).   
 The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow th e outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject impregnates his female partner , the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and 
the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to Me rck and followed as described above and in 
Section 8.2.

Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not  
related to study the rapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or 
holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interrupti on should be 
documented in the patient's study record.  
 
7.2 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
7.2.[ADDRESS_837442] ( ECI) guidance document. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or 
intraven ous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of 
steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid do se is decreased. 
For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to 
pembrolizumab.   Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed 
to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidan ce (as 
outlined in the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 7 .1 for dose modification.  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditiona l procedures, as appropriate, 
can be found in the ECI guidance document.  
• Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
 
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
2 perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experien ce diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by [CONTACT_628466] l steroids.   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or 
ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 
1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, stero id taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypoth yroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hypert hyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper

appropriate hormones may be requi red as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade [ADDRESS_837443] eroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with s ystemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion 
of infusion.  
Table 4 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475).

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 9.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 9.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in addition  to 
routine reporting.  
  
8.1 
Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_837445] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://cte p.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are listed above should be reported only if the adverse event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which is provided. 
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section (Expedited Adverse Event Reporting) under the sub- heading of Protocol -
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exc lusions. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
5 - Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to th e study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
8.2 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
8.2.1 All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in accordance with all applicable global law s and regulations. 
 8.2.[ADDRESS_837446]  report to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_102802] (SAE) that occurs 
after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within [ADDRESS_837447] dose of treatment  or 30 days of starting a new treatment (whichever is earlier),  on the local 
institutional SAE form.  
 8.2.3 
DF/HCC Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Investigative sites within DF/HCC will report AEs directly to the DFCI Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB reporting policy.  
 8.3 
Exped ited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
 The Overall PI, as study sponsor, will be responsible for all communications with the FDA. The Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_57895], regardless of the site of occurrence, any serious adverse event that meets the FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and 
timelines set by [CONTACT_1622].  
 8.[ADDRESS_837448]  be reported in routine study data submissions  to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_52458] .  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the 
IRB, FDA, etc.)  must also be reported in routine study data submissions.

Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
6 and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the 
[COMPANY_006]’s product  is also an adverse event.  
 Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples of 
this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_482566] a physiologically appropriate time.  
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent 
or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active compar ator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_199954].  
 Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials or within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_60797], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre- allocation baseline period as a 
result of a protocol -specified int ervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, 
diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
 Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered to be drug related by [CONTACT_093].  
 All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious cri teria is 
described in S ection 8.  
 8.7 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
 For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serio us adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
 If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose 
without adverse effect.”

Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of inf ant) must also be reported.  
 Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220)  
 8.9 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
 A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of [COMPANY_006]’s product that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolong s an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an other important medical event  
• Note : In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are r eportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe 
as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892].  
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
● Is associated with an over dose.

 For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study (reference 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details) that  occurs to any subject must be reported within [ADDRESS_837453] to be 
excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.

must be reported within [ADDRESS_837455] be followed up for outcome.  
 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the [COMPANY_006] Global Safety facsimile number:  +1 -[PHONE_833] 
 A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by [CONTACT_8415], European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this submission according to local regulations to the [COMPANY_006] Investigational Compound Number  (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  
Additionally , investigators will submit a copy of these reports to [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. (Attn: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220) at the time of submission to FDA.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Events of Clinical Interest  
 Selected n on-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global S afety. (Attn: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220)  Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 
 1.  An overdose of [COMPANY_006] product, as defined in Section 8 .1 - Definition of an Overdose for This 
Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837456] of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.*  
 
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose 
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). 
 
3.  Additional adverse events:  
 A separate guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document” (previously entitled, “Event of Clinical Interest and Immune -Related 
Adverse Event Guidance Document”).  This document can be found in Appendix 4 and provides guidance regarding identification, evaluation and management of ECIs and irAEs.   
  ECIs (both non- serious and serious adverse  events) identified in this guidance document from 
the date of first dose through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days after the initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need to be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220), regardless of attribution to study treatment, consistent 
with standard SAE reporting guidelines.  
  Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior t o each dose.  Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune -
related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should have 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic ca uses.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a 
possible immune -related ECI, then additional testing should be performed to rule out other 
etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, then it is assumed to be immune -related.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Protocol -Specific Exceptions to  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to [COMPANY_006] as described in Section 7.2.3.-  Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006], unless there 
is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any such event will 
be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety within 2 working days either by [CONTACT_131008].  
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under study.  
The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure 
the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon revi ew is not 
progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety as a SAE within

Relationship 
to test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will 
be provided by a n investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet 
that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This i nitialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the 
investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the av ailable information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the 
correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the M erck product caused the 
adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable 
compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or mea surement of drug/metabolite in

10.1.3 Analysis  of Circulating Immune Markers:  
 
In parallel to PBMC isolation, we will also collect plasma at multiple time points thro ugh the 
course of pembrolizumab therapy. Plasma samples will be isolated prior to the administration of 
pembrolizumab on day [ADDRESS_837468] three cycles. Following cycle 3, plasma samples  will be 
collected at the time of restaging . A plasma sample will als o be collected, if possible, on the visit 
when the patient is taken off the trial.  
 
Blood samples collected at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_628452]. All samples will be processed and  stored by [CONTACT_628471] . 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
16 Plasma will be frozen and then analyzed in batches by [CONTACT_262956]’s immune -oncology core laboratory 
(led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steve Hodi). A panel of cytokines and chemokines will be tested in serum using 
Luminex cytokine assay. Changes in cytoki ne production in immune cell subsets as a function of 
treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_222128]. Absolute lymphocyte 
count (ALC) will be monitored. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_837469]-treatment biopsies will be obtained at 56 days (+/ - 5days) after the first dose of 
pembrolizumab .  Patients that develop acquired resistance to pembrolizumab will be encouraged 
to undergo an optional post -treatment biopsy  but this is not man datory . This biopsy will allow us 
to study mechanisms of resistance to pembrolizumab. To do this, we utilize the immune characterization techniques described above.   Furthermore, at time of acquired resistance, 
additional testing of the sampled tumor may include genomic analysis  to identify novel somatic 
alterations which c ould contribute to resistance.  
 Additionally, further testing of samples will be done to explore genomic sequencing, RNA expression patterns, and somatic alterations with existing next ge neration testing, for example,

  12. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 12.[ADDRESS_837478] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, participants  should be re -evaluated for response every 9 weeks  (3 
cycles) up  to cycle 18. After cycle 1 8, restaging  scans can be performed  every 4 cycles at the 
discretion of the treating investigator.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new Immune -related Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) criteria.  [Wolchok et al. Clin Cancer Res 
2009;15( 23):7412- 20] as administered by [CONTACT_628472]- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Tumor 
Imaging Metrics Core .[19] . 
 
12.1.1 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or P R (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Par ticipants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ). 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
20 Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive dis ease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported 
are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for pr ogression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
12.1.2 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration  to dea th 
due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression- Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
registration  to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive 
without disease prog ression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from registration  to 
progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported.  
 
12.1.3 Respon se Review  
 Central review of baseline and restaging scans will be performed by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Tumor  
Imaging Metrics Core.

21 13.2 Data Safety Monitoring 
 
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data from this study . The committee is composed of clinical specialists with 
experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises 
any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749]. 
 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up -to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_837480] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols;  for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while 
being treated and during active follow -up; any response information; audit results, and a summary 
provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.  
  14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 14.1.[ADDRESS_837481] udy is to determine the major response rate (CR + PR) of patients 
with refractory esophageal adenocarcinoma to pembrolizumab.  We expect a response rate of 
approximately 10- 15% for patients with refractory metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma, similar  
to what was seen in the Keynote – - 059 study  (DFCI Protocol 15- 073).   
 
 We propose a one -stage study (n=40) including both PD -L1 positive and PD -L1 negative patients.  
With this sample size, we will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the response rate is 7% or lower if the true response rate is 22% or higher, using a one -sided binomial test with 5% 
type 1 error.  The null hypothesis is rejected if there are 7 or more responses.  We will also perform an exploratory analysis in patients with esoph ageal squamous cell 
carcinoma, a cancer that accounts for only approximately 10- 20% of the patients seen in our 
practice.  We will enroll  no more than [ADDRESS_837482] itic cells,  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/2019  
 
 
22 T cells, and B cells. Phenotype changes in these cell populations by [CONTACT_628473] a function of treatment. These include regulatory and effector immune panels,  
naïve and memory CD4, CD8 and NK lymphocyte populations. Given its importance in immune  
regulation and association, we will evaluate Tie -2 expressing monocytes (TEM).  
 
For the analysis  of cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell populations from serum or blood, 
data will be analyzed in longitudinal measurements for all patients. Serum marker levels will be 
summarized descriptively and graphically. The time course  of expression levels will also be 
summarized graphically by [CONTACT_528103].  
 A pretreatment tumor biopsy will be utilized for analy sis of tissue biomarkers. Pre -treatment 
biomarker expression, using appropriate IHC, Aperio scoring, or H -score will be reported and 
summarized using descriptive methods. We will also summarize descriptively pre -treatment 
biomarker levels according to resp onse (PD vs. non- PD). For a  sample size of 32 patients , formal 
statistical inference relating pre -treatment biomarker levels to response  will be of low power and 
will be capable of detecting only a strong signal. However, we will explore the prognostic abi lity 
of biomarker scoring by [CONTACT_528104]. non- PD.  
 Pre-treatment immune cell infiltration and biomarker changes will be  summarized graphically and 
using descriptive methods. Immune ce ll infiltration sub -populations will also be dichotomized 
into positive and negative at 10% (negative: < 10%, positive: ≥  10%).  
  15. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The results should be made public within [ADDRESS_837483] that meets the requirements of the International Committee  of Medical 
Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes should be made public no later than three (3) years 
after the end of the study .

Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837487] for the MK -3475 (also known as pembrolizumab) program.   
 
Based on the literature review [1 -11], and consideration of mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, 
potential immune -related adverse events (irAEs) are the primary Event of Clinical Interest (ECI). Immune -
related AEs are adverse events associated with the treatment of patients with immunotherapy tr eatments 
that appear to be associated with the immune therapy’s mechanism of action. Based on these potential 
irAEs, the sponsor has defined a list of specific adverse event terms ( ECIs) that are selected adverse 
experiences that must be reported to [COMPANY_006] within 24 hours  from the time the Investigator/physician is 
aware of such an occurrence, regardless of whether or not the investigator/physician considers the event to 
be related to study drug(s). In addition, these ECIs require additional detailed informa tion to be collected 
and entered in the study database.  ECIs may be identified through spontaneous patient report and / or 
upon review of subject data. Table [ADDRESS_837488] is not comprehensive for all potential immune -
related ev ents, it is possible that AEs other than those listed in this document may be observed in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Therefore , any Grade 3 or higher event that the investigator /physician considers 
to be immune -related should be reported as an ECI r egardless of whether the specific event term is in 
Table 1 and reported to [COMPANY_006] within 24 hours  from the time the Investigator /physician is aware of 
such an occurrence.  Adverse events that are both an SAE and an ECI should be reported one time as an SAE only, however the event must be appropriately identified as an ECI as well in the database.

28 Each of the events above is described within this guidance document, along with site 
requirements for reporting these events to the Sponsor.  The information collected should be entered into the narrative f ield(s) of the Adverse Event module in the database (please note, if 
narrative entry into the database
 is not available, please use the narrative text box on the 
1727/AER Form).  If additional Medical History or Concomitant Medications are reported, the 
Medical History and Concomitant Medication modules in the database must be updated.   
 
In addition, the guidelines include recommendations on the management of these ECIs. These 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the physician determines the events t o be related to 
pembrolizumab. Note : if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
physician is instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (below). Therefore, these recommendations should be seen as guidelines and the treating physician should exercise individual clinical judgment based on the patient.  For any question of dose modification or other treatment options, the specific language in the protocol should be followed.  A ny questions pertaining to the collection of this information or management 
of ECIs should be directed to your local Sponsor contact.  
 Dose Modification/Discontinuation  
 The treatment guidance provides specific direction when to hold and/or discontinue pembrolizumab for each immune related adverse event.  Of note, when the guidance states to 
“discontinue” pembrolizumab this is the permanent discontinuation of treatment with pembrolizumab. “Hold” means to stop treating with pembrolizumab but resumption of t reatment 
may be considered assuming the patient meets the criteria for resumption of treatment.   
  
2. ECI REPORTING GUI DELINES  
 
ECIs are selected non -serious and serious adverse experiences that must be reported to [COMPANY_006] 
within 24 hours regardless of attribution to study treatment.   The AEs listed in this document and 
any event that meets the ECI criteria (as noted) in Table 1 or in the respective protocol (event term and Grade) must be reported regardless of physician- determined causality with study 
medic ation and whether or not considered immune -related by [CONTACT_099]  (unless otherwise 
specified).   Physicians/study coordinators/designated site personnel are required to record these experiences as ECIs on the Adverse Experience electronic Case Report Fo rms (eCRFs) (or on 
paper) and to provide supplemental information (such as medical history, concomitant medications, investigations, etc.) about the event.   
 
– Please refer to the Data Entry Guidelines (DEGs) for your protocol.  
– Please refer to protocol for  details on reporting timelines and reporting of Overdose and 
Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI).      
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-293 
Protocol Version Date:  02/26/[ADDRESS_837489] management guidelines when an ECI is reported.      
3.1 Pneumon itis 
The following AE terms, if considered ≥ Grade 2, are considered ECIs and should be reported to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of the event:  
– Pneumonitis  
– Interstitial lung disease  
– Acute interstitial pneumonitis  
 
If symptoms indicate possible new or worsening cardiac abnormalities additional testing and/or a cardiology consultation should be considered.  
 All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral infection .  It is important that patients with a suspe cted diagnosis of pneumonitis be 
managed as per the guidance below until treatment -related pneumonitis is excluded.  
Treatment of both a potential infectious etiology and pneumonitis in parallel may be warranted.  Management of the treatment of suspected p neumonitis with steroid treatment 
should not be delayed for a therapeutic trial of antibiotics.   If an alternative diagnosis is 
established, the patient does not require management as below; however , the AE should be 
reported regardless of etiology.  
 Cours e of Action  
Grade 2 events:

• Calculate the vo lume of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) and normal saline required to 
prepare the infusion (admixture) bag  
 
Volume of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) (mL) = required dose amount (mg) / 25 (mg/mL)  
 
Volume of normal saline = total infusion volume – volume of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) 
from above  
 
• If a bag pre -filled with normal saline is being used, remove the excess volume of normal 
saline using a sterile syringe (Polypropylene, latex -free) attached to a suitable needle. 
Keep in consideration the excess bag fill volume as well as the volume of pembrolizumab  
(MK-3475 ) to be added to the bag to prepare the infusion solution.  This helps ensure that 
the concentration in the bag can be accurately calculated and falls within the acceptable 
range of 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. If the site would like to proceed w ithout removing excess 
saline they must ensure that the concentration of MK -3475 would still fall within 
acceptable range.  
 
• If an empty bag is being used, withdraw the necessary volume of normal saline from 
another appropriate bag and inject into the empty  bag. Keep in consideration the volume 
of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) to be added to the bag to prepare the infusion solution.  
 
• Withdraw the required volume of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) from the vial(s) (up to 4 
mL from each vial) using a sterile syringe attached to a suitable needle. The vial(s) may 
need to be inverted to remove solution.  
 
Volume of pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) (mL) = required dose amount (mg) / 25 (mg/mL)  
 
Note:  If it is necessary to use several vials, it is advisable to withdraw from several  vials 
into a suitable size single use syringe using a new needle for each vial.  
 
• Add the required pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) into the infusion IV bag containing normal 
saline and gently invert the bag 10 -15 times to mix the solution.  
 
• Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) solutions may be stored at room temperature for a 
cumulative time of up to 6 hours.  This includes room temperature storage of admixture 
solutions in the IV bags and the duration of infusion.

• A sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2 to 5 µm in -linefilter made of 
polyethersulfone (PES) must be used during administration to remove any adventitious 
particles.  If the infusion set does not contain 0.2 to 5 µm in -line filter, it is recommended 
to use 0.2 to 5 µm add-on filter which may contain an extension line (Note: the materials 
of the extension line and filter should be as mentioned above).  
 
• Attach th e infusion line to the pump and prime the line, either with normal saline (at least 
25 mL) or with infusion solution as per local SOP, before starting the infusion.  
 
• Infuse pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) over approximately 30 minutes, with a window of  
        -5 and +10 minutes, through a peripheral line or indwelling catheter.   
 
• Ensure the entire contents of the bag are dosed and all remaining drug solution in the line 
is administered through  saline flushing.  
 
• Document volume administered according to data entr y guidelines.  
 
• In case of infusion reactions, infusion rate may differ; refer to protocol for specific 
instructions.   
 
• Whenever possible, the lowest infusion rate should be used that will allow completion of 
the infusion within the 30 minutes .  
 
• Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 mL/min. through a peripheral line or 
indwelling catheter.   
• However, when it is necessary to infuse a larger volume (i.e. 250 mL), the flow rate may 
go as high as 10 mL/ min (maximum) in order to keep the infusion withi n the window as 
defined above.   
 
 
• DO NOT CO -ADMINISTER OTHER DRUGS THROUGH THE SAME 
INFUSION LINE.  
 
• UNUSED INFUSION SOLUTION FOR INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED 
FOR ANOTHER INFUSION OF THE SAME SUBJECT OR DIFFERENT 
SUBJECT.

Description of the Project  
You are being asked to take part in a research study .  This research study is looking at women 
living with HIV and studying strategies to help the se women who want to quit smoking.  [CONTACT_473235] works  at the University of [LOCATION_005] [LOCATION_011] (UMB) .  Please kindly read this  form and 
feel free to ask questions .  If you have more questions later, you can discuss these  with [CONTACT_32246]

Procedure of the Study  
This study involves written questions, telephone interviews, counseling  and a special test of the 
liquid in your mouth (spit) .  You will  have counseling and nicotine patches  at no cost to you.  
How you get  the counseling  will be  decided by [CONTACT_3364], like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  Half of the women 
in the study will get the counseling by [CONTACT_553016].  You will have t he counseling  once  a week  for [ADDRESS_726744] living with 
HIV,  drugs , alcohol  use, smoking,  and your confidence  in resisting smoking temptation and bad 
mood s. Your answers to these questions will help us identify your needs to stop smoking and provide 
the right advice .  
Counseling  will be the same for everybody. The only difference is how the counseling is 
provided  (teleph one video  or telephone voice call). The advice is given to help you quit. After 
the day you quit you will be counseled on how to manage withdrawal symptoms of smoking.  
You will be followed over [ADDRESS_726745] heart beats and strange  dreams.  All these  
things  occur at about  10-15% of people and most  of them  are mild.  They will disappear once 
you stop using  the patch .  If you have severe headache, dizziness, vomiting  or blisters on the  area 
where you have applied the  patch, you should  immedi ately take off the patch and call [CONTACT_32246]  at 
([PHONE_11505].   
Another po ssible  risk is bad fe elings  when doing the telephone interview .  You may want to

 2 1.0 Objectives 
The primary objective is to assess the activity of the combination of the Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor PCI-[ZIP_CODE] and rituximab in patients with high-risk 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL).  
For this study, we define high-risk CLL as any CLL patient who has a 17p 
deletion or an 11q deletion or a TP53 mutation. We define high-risk SLL as any 
SLL patient who has a 17p deletion or an 11q deletion or a TP53 mutation. 
Alternatively, any patient with a diagnosis of CLL or SLL who had a short 
remission duration of less than [ADDRESS_330583]-line chemo-immunotherapy 
would be considered a high-risk CLL or SLL patient, regardless of the presence 
o
r absence of any chromosomal marker. The secondary objective is to assess 
the tolerability of the combination of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] and rituximab in CLL/SLL 
patients. 
 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  
CLL is the most common form of adult leukemia in the [LOCATION_002]. It has been 
estimated that there are approximately 150,000 individuals living with CLL in the 
[LOCATION_002]. The use of combination of chemo-immunotherapy as initial 
therapy is associated with high response rates. Unfortunately, once disease 
relapse has been observed, second line treatment is less effective and response 
durations are shorter. An alternative to repeating chemo-immunotherapy is to use 
the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab is able to induce a 
response in up to 30% of the patients, but is associated with significant 
immunosuppression and infections. Also, it lacks activity in patients that have 
developed bulky lymphadenopathy (larger than 5 centimeters)1. Combination of 
purine-analogue based regimens have limited activity: the combination of 
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, alemtuzumab (CFAR) is associated 
with an overall response rate of 65% in patients that have received prior therapy 
and once patients are fludarabine refractory their median survival is less than 
twelve months based on our published experience 2.  
 
2.2 High-risk genetic abnormalities (17p deletion, 11q deletion, TP53  
mutation). Standard treatment approaches such as chemo-immunotherapy (e.g., 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab or FCR) are highly effective in frontline 
treatment of the majority of CLL patients. However, there is a small, challenging 
 
 [ADDRESS_330584] received 
prior therapy to enroll. 
CLL patients with del(11q22–11q23) represent another challenging clinical 
subset. This genomic aberration occurs in approximately 20% of patients with 
advanced CLL. These patients are usually younger than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_271176] 
(median age: 59 years), and often have extensive lymphadenopathy at the time 
of diagnosis. The clinical course of patients with the 11q deletion is usually 
characterized by [CONTACT_271194]-free survival; a 
shorter overall survival has been reported in patients younger than [ADDRESS_330585] an improved progression-free survival 
(PFS) with chemo-immunotherapy, remission duration and overall survival of 
patients in this subgroup indicate that patients with 11q deletion have an inferior 
outcome compared with patients with favorable genomic abnormalities6. 
Patients with short remission duration after frontline chemo-
immunotherapy, for example with the FCR regimen, constitute another high-risk 
group of CLL patients6, and oftentimes such patients also display high-risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p, del11q). Such patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_271177]-treated with chemo-
immunotherapy6. 
The preliminary experience with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in relapsed CLL patients with 
17p deletion, 11q deletion, or TP53  mutation indicates that PCI-[ZIP_CODE] displays 
high clinical activity in this risk group. An analysis presented at the 2010 annual 
meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) showed that single agent 
treatment with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] induces 30% partial remissions (PR, n=3), 30% partial 
remissions with lymphocytosis (PR with lymphocytosis, n=3), and stable disease 
in 30% (SD, n=3) of CLL patients with 17p deletion, which is similar to the 
response rates for CLL patients without 17p deletion. Treatment was 
discontinuation in only one out of 10 patients with 17p deletion 7. These data are 
 
 4 based on a relatively short median follow-up time (2 to 8 months), but 
nonetheless are highly promising and therefore should be verified in a larger 
cohort of CLL patients. Therefore, to address this unmet medical need and to 
generate more robust experience with PCI-[ADDRESS_330586] relapsed disease. 
 
2.2 PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
Antigenic stimulation through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) promotes the 
expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other malignant B cells 8, 9. 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), a key component of BCR signaling, can be 
blocked by [CONTACT_9090]-[ZIP_CODE], a small-molecule Btk inhibitor, that displayed activity in 
patients with CLL and other B cell malignancies in the first clinical trial 7. PCI-
[ZIP_CODE] is a potent (IC50, 0.5 nM) and selective Inhibitor of Btk that binds 
covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the active site of Btk, leading to 
irreversible inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Btk 10. Once daily oral dosing 
results in 24-hour sustained target occupancy. In vitro studies demonstrated that 
inhibition of Btk in CLL cells results in the blockade of BCR related survival 
signals, thereby [CONTACT_271195] 11. Additionally, [CONTACT_271201]’s laboratory has 
demonstrated that inhibition of Btk with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] markedly decreases CLL cell 
responses to chemotactic factors elaborated by [CONTACT_166851], such as CXCL12 
and CXCL13, resulting in diminished CLL cell migration and homing capabilities 
11. 
A recent analysis of 38 CLL patients from an ongoing Phase Ib/II trial of 
single-agent PCI-[ADDRESS_330587] scan every 2 months, patients treated with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_271178]; 87% of patients with 
evaluable nodal disease achieved a nodal response. There have been no cases 
of primary lymph node progression. For the Phase Ia trial with a median follow- up 
of 8 months, there were 13 evaluable patients with 1 CR (8%), 8 PRs (62%) and 
2 patients with a nodal response with lymphocytosis (15%). Two additional 
patients had stable disease. There have been only 3 patients with disease 
progression, and an additional 3 patients discontinued treatment for reasons 
other than progressive disease. Of 32 evaluable patients in the Phase Ib study 
 
 5 (with less than 2 months median follow-up) there were 8 PRs (25%) and an 
additional [ADDRESS_330588] stable disease. As such, the overall response rate (ORR) from 
the Phase Ib/II trial experience at this point is 38% (1 CR, 16 PRs in 45 patients).  
94% patients experienced an adverse event (AE), 38% patients 
experienced an adverse event grade 3 or greater in severity (nausea, vomiting, 
fatigue, diarrhea, headache, rash). The incidence of >/= grade 3 adverse events 
believed to be related to PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was 17%. 14 patients experienced a serious 
adverse event (SAE), with “serious” defined as requirement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 6 
SAE were considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_093]. These were one 
case of viral lymphadenitis, one case of a subdural hematoma, one case of viral 
infection (follow-up reported as unrelated), one case of decreased appetite, 
dehydration, and asthenia, one case of sepsis, and one case of headache and 
dizziness (follow-up reported as unrelated viral vestibular neuritis) 7. Two patients 
in this pooled analysis have died due to progressive disease. 
Diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue have been the most commonly reported 
adverse events, with most of the reported events occurring early in treatment 
(cycles 1 or 2). Significant myelosuppression has been infrequent; with grade 3 
or greater thrombocytopenia or neutropenia reported in less than 5% of patients. 
Significant hepatic or renal toxicity has been absent. In addition, with longer-term 
follow-up, there has been no evidence of cumulative toxicity, either overall, or 
related to specific events. Because of a) one event of spontaneous subdural 
hematoma in a patient who took ibuprofen and PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at the time of 
detection of the subdural hematoma, and b) the controversial role of Btk in 
platelet function and aggregation, we initiated clinical and laboratory assessment 
of platelet function of patients treated with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] on the ongoing Phase I/II 
trial. There have been no subsequent bleeding events; some patients, however, 
displayed petechiae or bruises. Therefore, we will implement regular clinical and 
laboratory assessment and exclude patients with a history of bleeding diathesis 
or coagulopathy, recent surgical procedure, stroke, or hemorrhage, and patients 
receiving Coumadin. 
 
2.2 Rituximab 
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the human CD20 antigen. 
Rituximab has been extensively used for the treatment of chronic 
lymphoproliferative disorders. As a single agent, it is able to induce a response in 
 
 6 up to 30% of the patients with relapsed CLL and is synergistic with chemotherapy 
agents and other monoclonal antibodies when used in combination12. The 
rationale for combining PCI-[ZIP_CODE] with rituximab is to potentiate the clinical 
efficacy of these agents without increasing their toxicity. This is based on the 
different mechanisms of action and the non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_271179]. When 
used as single agent, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] typi[INVESTIGATOR_271180] a “compartment shift” of CLL 
cells from the tissues into the peripheral blood 7. Clinically, this is associated with 
a transient surge in lymphocyte counts and lymph node shrinkage during the first 
weeks of treatment. Because of this lymphocytosis, the patients treated with 
single agent PCI-[ZIP_CODE] often times do not achieve remissions, even though they 
are asymptomatic and display partial or complete responses at other disease 
sites. To improve the efficacy of PCI-[ZIP_CODE], rituximab is an ideal combination 
partner, because this antibody is very effective in clearing the blood stream of 
CLL cells, but less effective at eradicating disease in lymphatic tissues and bone 
marrow. As such, this protocol combines two agents with complementary single 
agent activity in different disease sites: PCI-[ADDRESS_330589] profile of these two agents also appears to be entirely 
different and non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; the toxicity of rituximab consists mainly of infusion 
reactions, nausea and late transient myelosuppression. PCI-[ADDRESS_330590] received prior treatment. Pharmacyclics will supply PCI-
[ZIP_CODE], commercial supply of rituximab will be used for this study. PCI-[ZIP_CODE] will 
be supplied as capsules containing 140 mg of PCI-[ZIP_CODE].  
 
4.0 Treatment Plan 
Rituximab (375 mg/m2) will be given intravenously on Day 1, Day 8 (+/- 3 days), 
Day 15 (+/- 3 days), and Day 22 (+/- 3 days), and then continued once every 4 
weeks only on Days 1 (+/- 7 days) during cycles 2 - 6 (+/- 7 days), see Study 
Calendar, unless patients experience toxicities that warrant early discontinuation 
 
 7 of the rituximab (as determined by [CONTACT_1963]). There will be no dose 
modifications of rituximab. PCI-[ZIP_CODE] will be started on Day 2 of cycle 1 at a 
dose of 420 mg (3 x 140-mg capsules) orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water (avoid GRAPEFRUIT JUICE due to CYP450 
3A4 inhibition) and will be continued daily. There will be no dose modifications of 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE]. The doses and schedule of PCI-[ADDRESS_330591] diary will be used to 
aid with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] administration compliance. Treatment duration will be 12 
cycles, and it will be possible to continue beyond 12 cycles if there is a significant 
benefit such as an ongoing PR or CR. Response will be evaluated after three, six 
and twelve cycles. (Each cycle consists of 28 days, see Study Calendar). 
 
Rituximab should be held for any Grade 4 toxicity or for any rituximab-related, 
clinically significant, unmanageable Grade 3 adverse events. Rituximab should 
be held until the adverse event returns to baseline or resolves complete. PCI 
[ZIP_CODE] should be held for any Grade 3 toxicity. PCI-[ZIP_CODE] should be held until 
the adverse event returns to baseline or resolves complete. After Cycle 1, if PCI-
[ZIP_CODE] is held for > [ADDRESS_330592] tumor lysis prophylaxis. Unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_271181]-
[ZIP_CODE] will be disposed per institutional policy. 
Concomitant Medication: Patients receiving Coumadin are ineligible to participate 
in this study. Patients who recently received Coumadin must be off this 
medication for at least 7 days prior to start of the study.   
 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2D6. Therefore strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6 are prohibited.  Once patients are on study 
they may acquire an illness that requires cocommitant therapy with a drug that 
inhibits these CYPs. In such cases, alternatives to strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors 
(such as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, and ritonavir) 
and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], fluxetine, paroxetine, and 
quinidine) should be sought if possible, for example milder CYP inhibitors.  
 
 [ADDRESS_330593] of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and CYP3A4/5 and 
CYP2D6 inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart.  This website is continually revised and 
should be checked frequently for updates. 
Concomitant Use of QT Prolonging Agents 
During the course of study drug treatment medications known to cause 
Torsades des Pointes should be avoided.  Medications known to cause QT 
prolongation may be used with caution. 
 Concomitant Use of Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants 
· Laboratory studies have shown that, in vitro, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] can prevent 
platelets from aggregating normally; the clinical significance of this finding is 
unknown at this time.  While serious bleeding has been uncommon in patients 
treated to date, it is possible that treatment with the study drug could increase 
the risk of bruising or bleeding, particularly in subjects receiving other 
antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. 
 
· Subjects receiving antiplatelet agents in conjunction with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
should be observed closely for any signs of bleeding or bruising, and PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
should be withheld in the event of any bleeding events.  
 
· Subjects requiring the initiation of anticoagulation with warfarin or related 
agents during the course of the study should have treatment with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
held, and PCI-[ZIP_CODE] should not be restarted until subjects are stably 
anticoagulated   During the co-administration of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] and anticoagulant 
therapy, the INR should be monitored carefully and subjects should be observed 
closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding. 
 
For the following hematologic toxicities:  
· Grade 4 ANC (< 500/µL) for > 7 days  
· Grade 3 or 4 Platelets (< 50,000/µL) in presence of significant bleeding  
· Grade 4 Platelets (< 25,000/µL)  
Gastrointestinal toxicities: 
· Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea if persistent despi[INVESTIGATOR_271182]/or anti-diarrheal therapy)  
or any other grade 4 or unmanageable grade 3 toxicities: 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_330594] supportive care 
medications are permitted.

will be used 13 (Appendix I). Responses will be assessed after 3, 6 and 12 cycles. 
 
9.0 Evaluation of Toxicity 
Adverse events are reported as per UTMDACC and Leukemia Phase 2-3 studies. 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an 
adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Im
portant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32). 
 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be 
 
 16 reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_271184], IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the 
d
efinition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy on Reportin g 
Serious Adverse Events”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all 
SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
 All life-threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related  to  the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in 
the IND Office.   
 
 The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be 
u
sed for reporting to the IND Office.  
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs 
consent until [ADDRESS_330607] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there 
has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_330608] be reported to the IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] 
(Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97102], Good Clinical 
 
 17 Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional 
Review Board policy. 
 
 The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and 
providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning the 
attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the trial 
 PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this 
protocol and protocol specific data will be entered into PDMs/CORe. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting 
AS PER UTMDACC AND LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA PHASE II-III STUDIES (APPENDIX C 
AND APPENDIX D), Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.03 for 
toxicity and adverse event reporting. A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.03 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.03. All 
adverse clinical experiences whether observed by [CONTACT_271199], must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of 
each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s 
outcome. The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its 
relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance. If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, 
the investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the 
test drug and about the patient’s outcome. Abnormal lab values are only 
significant if they require intervention or treatment. 
 
Events of Special Interest 
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of 
standard safety monitoring activities by [CONTACT_1034].  These events will be 
reported to the Pharmacyclics within [ADDRESS_330609]  
Major Hemorrhage 
 
 18 Defined as any hemorrhagic event, that is Grade 3 or greater in severity, or that 
results in one of the following: intraocular bleeding causing loss of vision, the 
need for a transfusion of two or more units of red cells or an equivalent amount of 
whole blood, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].  
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrhage will be captured as an event 
of special interest (see above). 
 
10.0 Statistical Design 
Endpoint and Design: The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess 
the activity of the combination of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor PCI-
[ZIP_CODE] and rituximab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) in high-risk CLL 
patients that have received prior therapy. Untreated CLL patients with high-risk 
disease based on the presence of a 17p deletion or TP53  mutation will also be 
eligible. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Denote the 
median (T) = m H, for the historical data (H) and m E, for the experimental (E) trial, 
where T is time to progression in month. We assume that, T is distributed 
exponentially with median m H, with the historical regimen and median m E, with 
the new treatment. Under a Bayesian model, we will further assume that m H, 
follows an inverse gamma (IG) prior with parameters (18, 85) reflecting the 
historical data (i.e., 20 patients with chromosome 17 abnormalities who had a 
median PFS of 5 months)6, and m E, follows IG(2.25, 6.25) with the same mean 
as m H, but with a much larger variance of [ADDRESS_330610] much greater uncertainty 
about PFS. Progression free survival is defined as the time interval from 
treatment to progressive disease or death, whichever happens earlier. Patients in 
complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) are all 
counted as progression-free.  Due to the characteristic activity of PCI-[ZIP_CODE], 
which typi[INVESTIGATOR_271180] a transient lymphocytosis during the first months of 
therapy7, which is not causing any symptoms and which is due to a re-distribution 
of CLL cells from the tissue compartments (bone marrow, secondary lymphatic 
tissues) into the peripheral blood, increases in lymphocyte counts can be 
expected (although in this combination with rituximab are less likely) and will not 
be considered as a sign of progressive disease. 
 
Interim Analysis on PFS: We will accrue 40 patients and will monitor the PFS 
continuously, accrual will be terminated early if Pr(m H + 2 months < m E | data) < 
 
 19 0.01.  The design operating characteristics based on 1000 simulations are 
summarized in Table 1. (Accrual of 40 patients with a rate = 3/month, 6 months 
additional follow-up). For example, the trial will stop early with 97.5% chance 
(23.3 patients in average) if the median PFS is 3 months, but stop early with 
7.8% chance (38.6 patients in average) if the median PFS is 6 months.

7 months  0.038  39.1 (40, 40)  
8 months  0.018  39.6 (40, 40)  
 
Interim Analysis on Toxicity: The probability of toxicity (grade 3 or 4) will be 
monitored based on the Bayesian model (beta-binomial) by [CONTACT_7702] a priori 
probability of toxicity following beta(1,1). The trial will be terminated if 
Prob(toxicity > 0.25 | data) > 0.90. Following this rule, the trial will be terminated if 
(# patients with toxicities)/(# patients evaluated) >=  2/3, 3/6, 4/9, 5/12, 6/15, 7/18, 
8/22, 9/25, 10/28,11/31, 12/35, 13/38, or 14/40. The operating characteristics for 
toxicity are summarized in Table 2.

 20 Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis will be calculated, including 
histograms or box-plots, proportions, range, means and standard deviations. A 
95% credible interval on response rate will be estimated based on a beta-
binomial distribution. Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon rank test will be used in 
univariate analyses of categorical (Stage, for example) and continuous variables 
(Age, for example), respectively. The data analysis will be performed based on 
the Intent- to-treat. Survival or times to progression functions will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity will be reported by [CONTACT_24975], frequency and 
severity. Worst toxicity grades per patient will be tabulated for selected adverse 
events and laboratory measurements.  The Department of Biostatistics will 
provide and maintain a website (“Clinical Trial Conduct”) for enrolling patients on 
this study and evaluating the efficacy monitoring rules described above. The 
Clinical Trial Conduct website resides on a secure server, and access is gained 
through usernames and passwords provided to personnel responsible for 
enrolling patients and updating patient data.  The website is accessed through a 
browser using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Personnel responsible for 
enrolling patients on trials will be trained in the use of the trial website, with 
emphasis on the importance of timely updating of follow-up times and recording 
of events. The monitoring rules described below will be automatically evaluated 
each time patient data are updated on the trial website. If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_271185], the study statistician, research nurse, and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_271186]. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_330611] be agreed to by [CONTACT_079] 
[INVESTIGATOR_271187]. Amendments should only be submitted to 
IRB/EC after consideration of Pharmacyclics review. Written verification of 
IRB/EC approval will be obtained before any amendment is implemented. 
Protocol Deviations 
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviation from the protocol for a 
subject, a deviation will be made only for that subject. A decision will be made as 
soon as possible to determine whether or not the subject (for whom the deviation 
from protocol was effected) is to continue in the study. The subject’s medical 
records will completely describe the deviation from the protocol and state the 
 
 21 reasons for such deviation. In addition, the Investigator will notify the IRB/EC in 
writing of such deviation from protocol. 
Investigator Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations. Investigators must 
enter study data into MDACC’s PDMS. The Investigator will permit study-related 
monitoring visits and audits by [CONTACT_262515]’s ORERM, Pharmacyclics  or its 
representatives, IRB/EC review, and regulatory inspection(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, 
TPP), providing direct access to the facilities where the study took place, to 
source documents, to CRFs, and to all other study documents. The Investigator, 
or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some 
time during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow 
direct access to the subject’s records (e.g., medical records, office charts, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) for source data verification. The data 
collection must be completed prior to each visit and be made available to 
MDACC ORERM and the Pharmacyclics  representative so that the accuracy 
and completeness may be checked. 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Approval 
The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance with the general 
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The review of this 
protocol by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including 
the methods used for obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance 
with principles enunciated in the declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, Title 21 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 50 Protection of Human Subjects 
and Part 56 Institutional Review Boards. The Investigator will be responsible for 
preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/EC and obtaining written 
approval for this study. The approval will be obtained prior to the initiation of the 
study. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the 
date of approval, protocol number and version, or amendment number. Any 
amendments to the protocol after receipt of IRB/EC approval must be submitted 
by [CONTACT_26492]/EC for approval. The Investigator is also 
responsible for notifying the IRB/EC of any serious deviations from the protocol, 
or anything else that may involve added risk to subjects. Any advertisements 
used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_5040]/EC prior to use. 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_330612] or his/her designee 
prior to any study related procedures as per GCPs as set forth in the CFR and 
ICH guidelines. Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the 
subject’s entry into the study and the informed consent process should be 
recorded in the subject’s source documents. The original consent form signed 
and dated by [CONTACT_271200]’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files. 
Study records requirements 
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the 
conduct of the study and the distribution of the study drug, that is copi[INVESTIGATOR_271188] (original documents, data, and records (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553]; clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries 
or evaluation checklists; pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from 
automated instruments; copi[INVESTIGATOR_27602]; microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or 
magnetic media; x-rays; subject files; and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical study; 
documents regarding subject treatment and study drug accountability; original 
signed informed consents, etc.)) be retained by [CONTACT_197012] (generally [ADDRESS_330613] marketing approval). The 
Investigator agrees to adhere to the document/records retention procedures by 
[CONTACT_12142]. 
 
Premature Discontinuation of Study 
The responsible local clinical Investigator, as well as Pharmacyclics, has the right 
to discontinue this study at any time for reasonable medical or administrative 
reasons in any single center. Possible reasons for termination of the study could 
be but are not limited to: 
1. Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality. 
2. Inaccurate or incomplete data collection. 
3. Falsification of records. 
4. Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
 
 
 
 23 12.0 Optional Correlative Laboratory Studies 
Optional correlative laboratory studies will be done before study entry (within 7 
days of Day 1), and after 1 week (+/- 3 days), 2 weeks (+/- 3 days), 4 weeks (+/- 
3 days), and after cycles 3, 6, and 12. Also, to better understand mechanism of 
failure to respond to therapy with PCI-[ZIP_CODE], samples will be collected and 
examined in patients who fail to respond to therapy at the time of treatment 
failure (as determined by [CONTACT_1963]) or at the time of relapse. The 
aim of these laboratory studies is to determine changes in CLL cell surface 
markers, responsiveness of the leukemia cells to B cell receptor stimulation, and 
plasma chemokine levels. For these studies, two 8 mL tubes of EDTA blood will 
be collected within 7 days of Day 1, and after 1 week (+/- 3 days), 2 weeks (+/- 3 
days), 4 weeks (+/- 3 days), and after cycles 3, 6, and 12. (approximately 1 
tablespoon per timepoint). In collaboration with our colleagues from the German 
Cancer Research Center  in Heidelberg (DKFZ Heidelberg, M.D. Anderson sister 
institution network project)  and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_011] 
([CONTACT_271202]), we will assay for mutations within the CLL cells in patients 
responding or not responding to therapy with PCI-[ZIP_CODE]. For these studies, four 
8 mL tubes of EDTA blood (approximately 2 tablespoon per timepoint) will be 
collected at study entry (within 7 days of Day 1) and at the time of treatment 
failure (as determined by [CONTACT_1963]) or at the time of relapse . Also, a 
sputum sample will be collected during follow- up. Samples collected as part of 
the optional procedures will be stored at [CONTACT_271201]'s laboratory and then sent to 
the DKFZ and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for biomarker testing.  Before 
samples are sent to the DKFZ  and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, patient 
names and any personal identifying information will be coded to protect patients’ 
p
rivacy.

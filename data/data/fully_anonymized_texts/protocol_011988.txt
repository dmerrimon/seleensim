   1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a curative potential for many 
hematological diseases including malignant, nonmalignant, and autoimmune disorders.  
However, the potential benefit of HSCT is directly offset by [CONTACT_825065] -versus -host 
disease (GvHD) , which may lead to significant transplant associated morbi dity and mortality. 
The risk of GvHD is directly proportional to the degree of HLA -disparity between the donor and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. For this reason, HLA -matched sibling transplants are associated with optimal 
outcomes.  
 
Only 25% of patients have an HLA -identical sibling1. As a result, the majority of patients require 
an alternative donor source, usually from an unrelated adult donor. For more than 20 years the 
National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has been recruiting volunteer donors for patients 
without HLA identical siblings. However, many patients, especially patients from ethnic minority 
backgrounds, frequently lack a full matched donor. Due to the fact that there are only 600,000 
registered African American adult donors compared to the 8 million white registered donors, 
African Americans are less likely to find HLA -matched unrelated donors2. By [CONTACT_825066], 
approximately 6% of African Americans have an HLA -matched donor by [CONTACT_825067]3.  
 
Haploidentical HSCT is an alternative for patients who do not have a fully HLA -matched donor. 
Almost all patients have an available HLA -haploidentical donor, which may include a parent, 
sibling, or child. However, early attempts at performing T cell –replete haploidentical 
transplantations using conventional preparative regimens have been associated with very high 
rates of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection.[ADDRESS_1143979] often been associated high rates of infectious 
complications and non- relapse mortality (NRM).
5,[ADDRESS_1143980] recently, outcomes after T cell –
replete HLA -haploidentical HSCT u sing post-transplantation cyclophosphamide have been 
found to be equivalent to those of  match -related donor (MRD) and matched unrelated donor 
(MUD) transplantations.[ADDRESS_1143981] for 
curative intent  with an available familial haploidentical (4 to 6 out of 8 HLA loci -matched) donor.  
A reduced intensity  preparative regimen will be used in the protocol .

ClinicalT rials.gov ;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC 
Institutional s tudies as outlined in Appendix B . All Adverse Events that occur during protocol 
intervention and are coded as either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 
24 hours (regardless of grade), or grade 5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC using the using the 
SAE console in WISER.  
 
All WFBCCC Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) staff members assisting a Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_380210], documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for DSMC reporting are 
responsible for informing a clinical member of the DSMC as well as the entire committee via the 
email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.  
 
6.4 WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be 
promptly reported to the IRB, according to institutional policy. Reporting to the IRB is required 
regardless of the funding source, study s ponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or 
marketed drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, 
biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, 
surveys, observations or other interactions with research subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other 
applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others. The Principal 
Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated 
problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_825057] a change in the risks and/or benefits to study 
particip ants, and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related 
documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a site where the study 
has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (internal events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 
7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the 
event.  
 Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting 
the same study that has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (external events) must be reported to 
the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team 
becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential benefit of the 
research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or informed consent process/document in order to insure the safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.  
7.0 Response Crite ria 
  
Relapse of disease after transplant  will be determined by [CONTACT_825070], cytogenetic,  and 
molecular testing specific for the hematological malignancy of the patient.

ClinicalT rials.gov ;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
  GvHD  will be determined by  [CONTACT_825071] F and /or histological 
 grading from biopsy.   
 
 Disease free survival will be defined as time from registration to death from any cause or 
 relapse of disease.  
  Non-relapse mortality  will be defined as t ime from registration to death due to anything other than r
 elapse of hematological malignancy.  Patients who relapse will be treated as a competing risk.  
 
 Overall survival  will be defined as t ime to death due to all causes.  
8.[ADDRESS_1144006] -transplant cyclophosphamide is 0.60 . We 
will calculate the proportion of subjects alive with no relapse disease at 12 months and the corresponding 95% confidence interval using the  normal approximation for binomial proportions.  
With 24 patients, we would need 16 or more patients for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval to be above 0.60.  If the  lower bound of the confidence interval is above 0.6, we can be 
confident that the true proportion is also above 0.60.  We will accrue up to two patient s per month  for 
one year. Once each participant has been in the study for one year, we will test our primary 
hypothesis. P atients will then be followed for an additional two years. We do not  anticipate any drop 
outs.  
 
We will monitor patients continuously throughout the study  at regular clinic visits after transplant . If at 
any time six participants experience death or relapse within the first [ADDRESS_1144007] a corresponding 95% confidence interval  using the normal 
approxim ation for binomial proportions.   Additionally, w e will treat disease free survival as a censored 
outcome. The survival function will be estimated and plotted using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 
Additionally, we will calculate the rates  of acute and chronic Gv HD, overall survival,  and relapse (or 
death)  in our study population at twelve months . To evaluate relapse- free mortality, we will estimate 
the cumulative incidence function in the presence of relapse.

calculated the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825058] a 
Bayesian design.   The study will stop if the probability of the true NRM rate is greater than the 
anticipated rate (assumed 0.2) is more 0.90.   We use a Bet a distribution (alpha=1.0, beta= 1.5) as 
the prior distribution for the probability of non -relapse mortality, and we will start monitoring for safety 
when four deaths are observed.

 Appendix C – Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements   
 
 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC ) Serious Adverse 
Event  (SAE)  Notification  SOP Date:  02/11/2021  
 
Mandatory DSMC  SAE Reporting Requirements in WISER  
This document describes reporting requirements of adverse events from WFBCCC Investigator 
Initiated interventional trials to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ). A trial is 
considered a WFBCCC Investigator I nitiated interventional trial if the following criteria  are met: 
 
1) The Principal Investigator (PI) of the trial is a member of a department at the  Wake  Forest 
University Baptist Medical Center.  
2) WFBCCC is considered as the primary contributor to the design, implementation  and/or  
monitoring of the  trial.  
3) The trial is designated as “Interventional” using the Clinical Research  Categories 
definitions provided by [CONTACT_380236] 4  documentation.  
(https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/DataGuide#dt4 ) 
 
There are two distinct types of WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials based on where 
patient enrollment occurs.  These  include:  
 
1) Local WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials where  all patients are 
enrolled from one of the WFBCCC sites. These include the main outpatient  Cancer Center 
clinics (located in Winston -Salem)  as well as WFBCCC affiliate  sites located in Bermuda Run 
(Davie Medical Center), Clemmons, Lexington, High Point,  or Wilkesboro.  
2) Multi -Center WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials  where  
patients are enrolled from other site s in addition to WFBCCC sites.   
There are  three  types of trials that are included in this  category:  
a. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380237] (NCORP) that are 
conducted at multiple sites where the PI [CONTACT_832] a member of a department at the Wake 
Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
b. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380238] [CONTACT_832]  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
c. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380239] [CONTACT_832]  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
 
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur on any patients  enrolled on 
WFBCCC Investigator Initiated Interventional t rials must be entered into the WISER  system. The only 
exception to this requirement is for patients enrolled on NCORP trials at  non- WFBCCC sites. AEs and 
SAEs for NCORP patients enrolled at WFBCCC sites must be entered into the WISER system. Once these 
AEs and SAEs are entered in WISER, certain actions must  be taken regarding the reporting of specific 
Adverse Events to the  DSMC . 
   
Protoco l Version Date: 03.12.[ADDRESS_1144020] Transplant Cyclophosphamide for GvHD Prophylaxis: A  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_825054] # [ZIP_CODE]  
ClinicalT rials.gov ;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention (defined below) and are coded as either 1) 
unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours (regardless of grade) , or grade 
5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC  using the using the SAE console in WISER.  
 
A research nurse or clinical research coordinator when made aware that an adverse  event  meets one 
of the above criteria has occurred on a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated  interventional trial, is responsible 
for informing a clinical member of the DSMC  by [CONTACT_648] (or in- person)  about  the adverse event. The 
nurse/coordinator should contact [CONTACT_825073], as well as all associated toxicities to be recorded along with the SAE. In 
addition, this nurse or coordinator is responsible for entering the  adverse  event information int o the 
SAE console in WISER.  Once the adverse event has been  entered into the SAE console an email 
informing the entire DSMC  will be  generated.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any staff member on the study team for  a WFBCCC Institutional 
Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_380215],  
documentation,  grading  and assignment  of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. However, 
when an AE event as described above  is observed , it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event 
to be sure that it  is reported to the  DSMC . 
 
What is considered during protocol  intervention ? 
During protocol intervention is considered to be the time period while a patient is on  study  treatment or 
during the time period within [ADDRESS_1144021] study treatment (even if patient  begins a new (non- study) 
treatment during the 30 days). This window of [ADDRESS_1144022] that a shorter window can be used 
to identify  events.  If it is a trial sponsored by [CONTACT_380241] a longer window for 
monitoring of SAEs, then the longer window of time specified by [CONTACT_825074].  
 
What is considered as an Unexpected Grade 4  event?  
Any grade 4 event that was not specifically listed as an expected adverse event in the  protocol should be 
considered as unexpected. A grade 4 adverse event can be considered to  be unexpected if it is an event 
that would not be expected based on the treatment being  received  or if it is unexpected based on the 
health of the patient. In either case, if there is  any uncertainty about whether a grade 4 adverse event is 
expected or unexpe cted it should  be reported to  DSMC . 
 
DSMC  notification responsibilities of the person (e.g., nurse) handling  the reporting/documenting of the SAE in  
WISER:  
1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the  DSMC  
according to the schedule as listed below (page if  necessary).  
2. Enter  a new SAE  into the SAE  module that is located  in the Subject>> CRA  Console  in WISER 
WITHIN [ADDRESS_1144023] knowledge of the event. Information can be  entered and  saved, but 
the DSMC  members will not be notified  until a  date  is entered  into the   DSMC  Notification Date 
Field. This will ensure that all persons that need to be made  aware  of the event (i.e., PI, study 
team members and  DSMC  members) will be  notified; remember to file a copy of the  
confirmation.  
3. Document that the appropriate person(s) on the DSMC  has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Indicate  the name [CONTACT_825076][CONTACT_825075] l Version Date: 03.12.[ADDRESS_1144024] Transplant Cyclophosphamide for GvHD Prophylaxis: A  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_825054] # [ZIP_CODE]  
ClinicalT rials.gov ;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 field in the SAE  console  of the particular  subject.  
4. Document whether or not the protocol should be suspended based on the  discussion  with the 
DSMC  clinician. This is the major function of the email notification. Enter  whether the protocol 
should be suspended in the Event Narrative  Field.  
5. Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of DSMC  regarding any new developments or 
information  obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting  process.

Definition of  Unavailable: 
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_380246] [ADDRESS_1144028] with the next  DSMC  clinician  listed in the table above on the 
particular day the SAE is being reported . Allow up to  30 minutes for the new DSMC  clinician to respond to 
a phone call or page before  contac ting the next  member  in the table . These times (30 minutes) are a 
general guideline. Best judgment as a clinical research professional should be used giving considerations 
of the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact 
[CONTACT_380247]. If  the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as 
appropriate  and proceed with submitting the DSMC  notification form. It is important to take reasonable  
steps and to document that som e type of contact [CONTACT_380248] . 
 
DSMC  CLINICAN  RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the  DSMC  clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events  as they are 
reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and  the members of DSMC . 
The review will include but not be limited to the information reported;  there  may be times when 
additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be  made  and further communi cation 
directly with the investigator may be warranted. DSMC  reserves  the right to disagree with the 
Investigator's assessment. If DSMC  does not agree with the Investigator,  DSMC reserves  the right  to 
suspend  the trial pending  further  investigation.  If there  is any immediate danger or harm that could be 
present for a future patient based on the  information  provided  in the DSMC  report  then an immediate  
suspension  of enrollment should  be considered.

 AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS  REPORTS  
If all pertinent information is unavailable with the initial submission, once the additional  information is 
available do not submit a new report. Rather, go to the original email that  was sent to the DSMC  and 
using that email “reply to all”. Entitle this new email “ Amendment for (list date of event and patient ID)” 
this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the  additional information being reported. This 
information needs to be entered into WISER as  well. To do this, go to the Subject console and click SAEs 
on the  left column. Click on  the appropriate  SAE number  that needs  updating.  Then  click  Update.  This

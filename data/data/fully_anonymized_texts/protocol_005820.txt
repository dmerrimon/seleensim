1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
The overall aim of the study is: 
1. To develop a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that treats adolescent binge/loss-of-control 
(LOC) eating and test whether this new CBT for adolescent binge/LOC eating is superior to an 
active control group.
Hypothesis 1: Adolescents randomized to CBT will have a greater reduction in binge/LOC eating 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_17771]) than adolescents in the active control group. 
Hypothesis 2: Adolescents randomized to CBT will have a greater reduction in weight (BMI z-score 
using measured height and weight) than adolescents in the active control group.
2.Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
Development and evaluation of the treatment is expected to occur over 6 years (including follow-up 
and data analysis). 
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Binge eating and obesity often co-occur in adulthood (1) and during adolescence (2-5), and both 
carry public health costs (6). Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most common formal eating 
disorder among adolescents (7). Adolescent binge eating is associated with concurrent body image 
concerns, depression and externalizing behaviors, and prospective depression, substance use and 
self-harm (8, 9). Binge eating is highly associated with obesity and obesity-related health problems 
(7, 9-11). Among adolescents with overweight/obesity, 31% have loss-of-control eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(LOC; feeling loss of control while eating any amount of food) (12); 22% have full binge-eating 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (feeling loss of control while eating an unambiguously large amount of food) (2). Youth 
with binge eating and those with LOC have similar psychopathology and both groups show more 
psychopathology than youth with overeating alone (13). LOC also has more predictive significance 
in obesity development than overeating alone (10, 14). Adolescent obesity is associated with more 
frequent medical visits (15), increased cardiovascular risk factors (16), diabetes (17), asthma (15), 
depression, anxiety and behavior problems (18) during adolescence, and adult obesity (19). Thus, 
adolescents who binge eat are vulnerable—because of their weight and eating behaviors—to health 
problems and psychosocial impairment. 
Because binge/LOC eating in adolescence is both a precursor to adult obesity and a distinct source 
of health problems and psychosocial impairment, treating LOC during adolescence (14) could 
reduce immediate and long-term health consequences. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has a 
strong evidence base for adult BED (20-25). However, there are no well-established treatments for 
adolescent binge/LOC eating (26) with one exception (27). Hilbert et al (27) applied adult CBT to 
adolescents aged 12-[ADDRESS_509184] unique social, cognitive and emotional needs 
because of their developmental stage; these unique needs require unique treatment approaches 
(28). Specifically, adolescents might not have the cognitive or emotional capacity to identify 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page 3 of 34problems that are readily-apparent to parents, which suggests a need for collaboration, education, 
and multiple-informant assessment. Moreover, the clinician’s work with the adolescent is only part 
of treatment (28). The family context—parental mental health, home life and stressors, and the 
home food environment—influence adolescents through parenting practices related to food and 
parent modeling of health behaviors. This suggests a need to engage support to facilitate 
improvements in adolescent outcomes (29).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_403727], adolescent treatments are understudied (26, 28). Early 
evidence suggests that interpersonal psychotherapy might have promise for youth LOC; however, 
effects are modest and superiority over active control groups (e.g., health education) is unclear (30-
34). Notably, interpersonal therapy has been tested in children (not adolescents) with LOC (30-32). 
A cognitive-behavioral adaptation for adolescents with recurrent binge eating (with or without 
purging) had a small sample and used a delayed-treatment control (35); treatment focused on 
eating but not weight, was minimally tailored to adolescence, and minimized parental support 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_403728] (29, 36).
Because of the evidence for CBT for adult BED (20-22), developi[INVESTIGATOR_403729]/LOC 
eating is a critical clinical research task. Adolescence is characterized by [CONTACT_403769], psychosocially, and cognitively. The chief task of adolescence is to develop autonomy 
across life domains, including establishing health habits that will endure into adulthood (37). 
Adolescents strive for independence yet remain under the authority of their parents who still 
purchase and prepare most meals, who still seek to guide adolescents’ psychosocial development, 
and who are gatekeepers to health services (38). Parents’ attempts to help can, at times, be 
misguided and paradoxically exacerbate eating/weight problems, for example, when focusing on or 
criticizing weight (39-45). Thus, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_403730]/LOC eating. Other target areas for 
tailored intervention include eliciting appropriate peer support, copi[INVESTIGATOR_30399]-related bullying 
(46), identifying and challenging maladaptive eating/weight thought patterns in the context of peer 
and parent messages (47, 48).
A developmentally-appropriate CBT needs to be developed and tested because of unique 
adolescent needs such as complex parent-teen relations (29, 36, 49), peer influences on eating and 
weight (50), and executive function deficits and growth (51, 52). To do this, the current study will 
make use of rigorous treatment development methodology and test the new treatment in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_403731]/LOC eating to an active control group. 
4.Research Plan:  Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and 
lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
There are two phases of this protocol, based on the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46747] 
(53-55). First is the treatment-development phase , in which materials are developed. This 
involves focus interviews with target patients and administering treatment to an open series of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403732]. Second is the initial efficacy pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. This involves 
an RCT comparing the treatment developed in the first phase to a control condition.
Thus, focus interviews will be completed first and can be concurrent to or followed by [CONTACT_403770]. Participants who complete the focus interview will have the option of transitioning to the 
open series to receive treatment. Alternatively, participants can be recruited directly for the open

Treatment-Development Phase. CBT for adolescent binge/LOC eating will be developed by 
[CONTACT_403771]-based treatments for adults with obesity and BED (Grilo et al., 23, 56). 
A working version of the clinician manual will be written specifying session format, detailed session-
by-session content (unique, essential, recommended, proscribed treatment elements), primary and 
secondary treatment goals, and treatment materials. 
“Focus interviews” will be conducted with adolescents and their parents based on the method 
described by [CONTACT_403772] (57). Briefly, participants will be given a copy of “Overcoming Binge Eating,” 
a book that describes cognitive-behavioral therapy for binge eating in a self-help format, and then 
will be interviewed by a research clinician about the aspects of the treatment that they believe 
would work well for adolescents and the aspects of the treatment that they believe need to be 
adapted. Focus interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Participants who complete the focus 
interviews will have the option of participating in the “open series” of patients (see below) but will 
not be eligible for the RCT. 
Treatment (see “adolescent treatment,” below) will be conducted with an open series of patients 
(N=5) to elaborate and refine the manual. Patients enrolled in the treatment-development phase will 
all receive active treatment. Patients and their parents will be asked to provide feedback about the 
new adolescent CBT in semi-structured interviews. Open-ended questions will explore preferences, 
acceptability of session content, and perceived benefits and costs to treatment parameters. 
Feedback from patients will refine protocols.
Initial Efficacy Testing. CBT for adolescent binge/LOC eating will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] N=50 adolescents 
(randomly assigned to CBT n=25, or control n=25). Research clinicians with doctoral training in 
psychology will administer CBT and control conditions under the supervision of the PI. To 
demonstrate treatment acceptability (sessions attended; retention; patient/clinician ratings), 
feasibility, and efficacy, parents and adolescents will complete assessments (baseline, Month 1, 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page [ADDRESS_509186], 3 month follow-up) for CBT and control conditions.
Format and Content of Treatment. The 16-session treatment (4 months; weekly sessions) will be 
delivered by [CONTACT_403773], supervised by [CONTACT_978]. 
Participants will be audio-recorded if they consent to this procedure. Audio recordings will be for the 
purpose of evaluating treatment fidelity, as well as part of monitoring research-clinicians in the 
delivery of the treatment as specified in the protocol. 
Adolescent Treatment.  Adolescent therapy (see table) will have five stages and will occur during 
both the treatment-development and RCT phases of the study: 1) Orienting to treatment and 
establishing a therapeutic foundation; 2) Specific behavioral strategies and their implementation; 3) 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_403733]; 4) Integrated executive function skills; and 5) Relapse 
prevention planning to maintain health behaviors. As in general adolescent therapy (58), parents 
will have some involvement in therapy but the focus will be on adolescents. Parents will attend 
sessions monthly, during which they will learn about binge/LOC eating, collaborate to  enhance 
adolescent awareness, identify parent and family factors that could inhibit change, and help the 
adolescent establish behavioral strategies that maximize improvement. Adolescents will teach 
parents what they have learned to increase self-efficacy and positive communication. Other 
developmentally-tailored content includes using tangible therapeutic tools, setting communication 
strategies and boundaries with parents, eliciting peer support and parent health-behavior support, 
and focus on both short- and long-term health goals. Executive function techniques will be taught as 
skills to reduce impulsivity, increase behavioral inhibition, improve planning, and promote long-term 
benefits in the context of health decision making, as has been done in anorexia nervosa treatment 
research (59-61). Executive function skills are expected to enhance therapeutic gains from 
behavioral and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262].
Active Control. The control condition (see table) will address eating behaviors and nutrition, thereby 
[CONTACT_403774] . The active control will be 4 months with mailed 
publicly-available information (weekly to match CBT; e.g., USDA healthy recipes, list of local 
recreation areas and activities) and monthly assessments (parent and adolescent attendance will 
be matched to CBT).

Yale Teen Power Advisory Board. Adolescents who have an interest in eating disorders, body 
image, and/or weight stigma will form the Yale Teen Power Advisory Board. The only requirement is 
that their age be 12-19 years old to correspond (approximately) to the age of participants in the 
clinical trials. There is no requirement that the adolescent be experiencing any eating disorder 
currently or in the past, and participants will not be considered ineligible unless there is a 
safety/privacy concern (current patient, current mental health problem that may worsen with 
discussion of eating disorder symptoms as they would be discussed in a classroom or educational 
setting; in our experience, this is exceedingly rare and easily identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403734]). The 
teen advisory board will convene on Zoom and be completely voluntary. 
General activities: 
 
To establish group rapport, the Yale Teen Power Advisory Board will engage in general activities 
that are initiated by [CONTACT_403776]/or focused on education, outreach, and advocacy.
Focus groups:
Adolescents will meet on zoom to participate in a focus group to provide feedback on future 
intervention development with teens in mind, and study findings. Adolescents will be paid for their 
participation ($10 per focus group per person plus a prize incentive, e.g., Teen Power tennis ball).
Focus groups will specifically address conducting treatment development research and 
disseminating results:
Recruitment and retention of adolescents in studies.
Feedback on potential community engagement activities (e.g., social media live events; 
workshops; health fairs) to increase awareness of clinical trial findings and their meaning.
Examining and providing their perspective on all aspects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403735] (de-identified; not 
individual level) and results. 
Focus groups will be with study investigators/staff. Specific questions to begin discussion will 
include:
Which finding from the study is the most surprising to you? Least surprising?
Do the findings from the study reflect what you thought would happen if your peers were in a 
treatment study?
Is there a finding that you would want to know more about?
What do you think we should research next?
Which findings would you most want to share with others?
Who would benefit from learning about the study findings? How should we tell them?

recording, they can participate in general activities and can provide written responses to the focus 
group questions that will be shared anonymously with the group, but cannot be present at the focus 
group.
Assessments. Parents and adolescents will be assessed. At the beginning of treatment, 
adolescents will undergo a clinical assessment to confirm eligibility and to inform the course of 
treatment. Assessment batteries are guided by [CONTACT_403777] (e.g., QEWP, EARLY, BRIEF, Kirby, PSS) (62-66). As well as established 
measures, acceptability (sessions attended; retention; patient/ clinician ratings of content), and 
adherence (e.g., homework completion), will be assessed.  We will also gather clinical data on the 
patient’s medical history prior to the study, which we will update as indicated in Table 2. 
Assessments will be the same for the open-series of patients during the treatment development 
phase as well as during the RCT phase, except that there will be no follow-up to the open-series of 
patients. 
Assessment Training: Independent outcomes assessors will receive training in diagnostic interviews 
from investigators following well-established protocols used in previous projects. Once interviewers 
are certified in the measures (MINI and EDE), they will receive ongoing supervision to ensure 
consistent use and prevent drift.

Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview (67) for adolescents (10), the questionnaire version 
(EDE-Q) (68), and Questionnaire for Eating and Weight Patterns (QEWP-5) (69, 70) will assess 
disordered eating thoughts and behaviors (including binge/LOC eating). The EDE/EDE-Q and 
QEWP show good concordance (71-73), reliability (intra-class correlation .95-.99) and validity (74, 
75). 
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Version 7.0 (MINI) (76) is a brief structured interview 
for Axis I psychiatric disorders. Validation and reliability studies have supported the MINI, including 
good convergence with SCID (76). The MINI requires much less time than the SCID and reduces 
participant burden while providing adequate psychiatric data to characterize patients and determine 
exclusion criteria. 
Short UPPS Scale (S-UPPS) is a reliable (α=.74-.88) 20-item measure of impulsive behavior, 
including negative urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of premeditation, sensation-seeking, and 
positive urgency (77).
Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory (AEFI) is a brief questionnaire assessing executive 
functioning ability, such as attention, self-control, and self-monitoring. The construct validity and 
reliability are considered adequate (78).
Kirby [CONTACT_403778] (79) will measure reward-based decision making by [CONTACT_403779]; this is related to adult weight loss (63, 80) and youth 
binge eating (52). The Kirby [CONTACT_403780] 5-weeks (r=.71) and 1-year (r=.63) (79). 
Sensitivity to Punishment/Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ) (81)  assesses 
reinforcement sensitivity, has been validated with people with eating disorders, and has a reliability 
of .75-.83.
EARLY is a 2-item questionnaire about self-weighing frequency and scale access (64, 82, 83).
Pubertal Development Scale (84) is a brief scale (7 items) for adolescent to self-report their pubertal 
status. It has shown concordance with parent- and teacher-report and is accessible to youth.
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely-used, brief measure of depression (85) 
developed with 6000 adults, validated with 2291 adolescents, showing good sensitivity and

Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is used extensively and is a reliable (α=.88) measure of 
global self-esteem (87, 88) and has been used in work with adolescents and research on childhood 
obesity (89).  
Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (90) is a widely used measure of self-compassion and is reliable 
(α=.77-.78)
Perceptions of Teasing Scale (POTS) is an assessment of whether an individual has been teased 
and how teasing affected them (91). Reliability for the subscales ranges .66-.90.
Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) (92) is a 6-item measure of resilience with good reliability (α=.80-.91). 
Weight Bias Internalization Scale-Modified (WBIS) (93) is an 11-item measure of weight-based self-
stigma for children and adults across the weight spectrum. It is reliable (α=.90), has strong construct 
validity, and relates to eating pathology, body image, and self-esteem.
Weight-related Victimization is an unpublished measure developed by [CONTACT_403781] 
(which specializes in weight-related discrimination and stigma). These items examine different 
negative experiences related to weight for school-aged youth. It also examines how the weight-
related victimization affects the child.
Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) (94) will assess parent feeding practices (Restriction, Pressure 
to Eat, Monitoring) and attitudes (Perceived Responsibility, Concerns about Child Weight). The 
CFQ is reliable (α=.65-.91) and valid for work with diverse parents (95) seeking weight loss 
treatment for their children (96). 
Perceived Stress (PSS) (97) has a reliable total score (α=.83), 6-week temporal stability (r=.81) and 
validity associated with health behaviors including eating (98). 
CHAOS Scale (99) measures environmental processes within familial households, including 
perceive chaos, hubbub, and order. CHAOS has a reliable total score (α=.79) and a 12-month test-
retest stability (r=.74).
Accommodation and Enabling Scale for Eating Disorders (AESED) (100) is a 33-item caregiver 
measure assessing family accommodation to the eating disorder. The measure is reliable (α=.77-
.92). FASA-DE is a new version of the Family Accommodation Scale for Anxiety Disorders (FASA) 
(101) with adaptations specific to eating and weight that is being developed.
Fat Talk Questionnaire (FTQ) (102) is a measure of negative discussions about weight that the 
parent engages in; there are three subscales including fat talk about themselves (self), their child 
(child) or people with obesity (obesity). The measure has excellent reliability (α=.93).
Anthropometric measures: Height will be measured to the nearest 0.25 inch using a stadiometer or 
reported by [CONTACT_7078]/child. Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 pound using a digital scale 
provided to the patients for their home use. Height/weight data will calculate BMI (66). Adolescent 
BMI data will use CDC growth charts (age/sex-normed) to calculate BMI percentile, BMI z-score, 
and expected change in BMI (103). 
Fitbit scale: All adolescents determined to be eligible will be given a Fitbit Aria Scale that they will 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page 10 of 34be allowed to keep during and after the study. The scale is a smart scale that displays weight and 
syncs to Fitbit accounts that the study team will create for each  participant. The adolescent patient 
and their parent will be asked to weigh themselves on the scale at each study data collection 
timepoint. 
Ratings of Session Content. Patients and parents will be asked open-ended questions about the 
treatment during the treatment-development phase (examples listed below). Patients and parents 
will also rate session content on likert scales during both phases of the study. 
What did you not like about this treatment?
What would you change?
What was helpful about this treatment? 
What would you make sure to keep in the treatment?
What were challenges in this program that were difficult to overcome?
What advice would you give to someone starting treatment? To a clinician?

Participants will be interviewed during an initial intake by a study clinician. The semi-structured 
investigator-based Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview (child version) will be used to 
determine binge/LOC eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_403737]-disorder psychopathology. The 
EDE along with the MINI psychiatric interview will also determine whether participants have any co-
existing psychiatric conditions that require referrals, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136293]/different 
treatment.
Final determination of eligibility will be from the PI. 
10.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
The primary risks of the treatment development research and pi[INVESTIGATOR_403738], the assessment procedures, and unknown treatment efficacy.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established treatment for psychiatric conditions and health 
behavior change. CBT is established and widely-used in research and clinical settings, for both 
youth and adults. The only foreseeable risks include some mild discomfort or embarrassment when 
discussing eating patterns, weight, or body image concerns. Previous controlled clinical trials 
conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403739]. Any troublesome effects would be readily identifiable by [CONTACT_403782]. Thus, the risks of the CBT interventions 
are judged to be minimal.
Research assessments are noninvasive and should add no substantial risk. The major 
disadvantages are the time taken to complete them and potential for a breach of confidentiality. 
Completion of the assessment interviews and surveys may cause some mild anxiety or 
embarrassment to some participants. Past experiences of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403740]. Careful efforts aimed at maintaining confidentiality will be 
made (as described below). 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page 12 of 34There is a chance that participants’ eating concerns and overweight may fail to improve or may 
worsen during the study. Participants will be withdrawn from the study if their clinical condition 
deteriorates to a significant degree, and they will be provided with appropriate referrals.
11.Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
The study clinicians will be carefully trained and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. All study clinicians and study 
staff will have IRB and ethics training; because of their educational experience and training (e.g., in 
psychology), they can reasonably be expected to identify potential problems and to take appropriate 
action as medically indicated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_403741]. The 
detailed assessments repeated during the course of treatment will allow for additional and ample 
opportunity to identify difficulties. In the event that a participant experiences undue distress, 
resources are available. If a study participant experiences any psychiatric symptoms or distress 
(e.g., depressive symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of study participation they will receive short-
term treatment and support from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403742] (which includes psychologists) 
and will be connected with a local emergency department and their physician or a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_403743].
Participation may be in-person or remote (telehealth). For participants who participate remotely (i.e., 
during the COVID pandemic), all participants will complete a “Telehealth Safety Plan” with their 
clinician at session 1. This plan, recommended by [CONTACT_403783], provides standard language around what to do in 
an emergency and what to do if a telehealth session is disconnected. The Telehealth Safety Plan 
also includes an interactive worksheet for the clinician to do with the participant to identify 
personally-relevant ways to get help. The participant and the clinician will both keep a copy of this 
plan. The plan will not be retained after the participant finishes the study.
Potential participants will be informed of alternative treatments, and if indicated or requested, 
appropriate referrals will be provided. Potential participants will also be informed that they may drop 
out of the study at any time.
To ensure confidentiality, all research records will be kept in locked files in the Department of 
Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. All research personnel will be trained and supervised around 
confidentiality issues. The training will include formal NIH or Yale IRB modules with testing 
certification as well as HIPAA guidelines to follow around confidentiality. All participants will be 
assigned a study number. Subsequently, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_403784] (e.g., John Smith [adolescent] = JSMI-A). A list of numbers and the 
corresponding names will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a locked research file. Any 
information published as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit identification of any 
participant. All information collected will remain confidential except when we are legally required to 
disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or 
elderly person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. 
Fitbit scale confidentiality: Study staff will create Fitbit accounts for participants when they are given 
the scale. Study ID, rather than name, will be used in the account. The most conservative privacy 
settings will be selected. Participants will be told, as described in the consent form, that their data 
will be accessed by [CONTACT_403785]. Study staff will 
access the accounts created for the study to collect weight data, which will be recorded in study 
databases at Yale. After the follow up phase is completed, participants will be allowed to keep the

to study staff at data collection timepoints.
Focus interviews will be transcribed and audio records will be deleted at the end of the study. Other 
data will be stored in locked cabinets for [ADDRESS_509189] a 
responsibility for protecting human subjects, including the Yale IRB (Human Investigation 
Committee), may have access to the research records. Additionally, the funding agency (NIH) may 
have access to the research records. 
12.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this 
study? Minimal risk
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the

IRB periodically during regular reporting periods. In addition to the DSMP, the Yale IRB reviews all 
aspects of the study protocol (including progress and problems) minimally once per year.
Monitoring for the safety of participants and the integrity and quality of data will be the responsibility 
of the PI, the study team, and the Yale IRB (Human Investigation Committee).

and the NIH.
Risk Assessment 
This is a behavioral (NON-medication) RCT that does not involve multiple sites, treatment blinding, 
or high-risk interventions. Although the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403748] (adolescents 
12-17 years old), the risks associated with the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], including the cognitive-
behavioral treatment and assessment protocols, are judged to pose minimal risks to participants. 
Therefore, we provide the following plan for monitoring the safety of participants and the integrity 
and quality of data: 
Measurement and Reporting of Data Integrity and Quality 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the 
safety reviews. During the review process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_205562], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment.
The PI, in consultation with [CONTACT_136399] (Primary Mentor), will provide a summary of the DSMP report 
to the NIH as part of the annual progress report and to the Yale IRB on a yearly basis as part of the 
annual re-approval process. The DSMP reports will include Subject accrual, Treatment completion 
rates, Interim analyses, and Adverse and serious adverse events. These reports will be discussed 
with the mentoring team during regular meetings and sent to the Safety Monitor for review. The 
frequency of data review is summarized in the following table:

[ADDRESS_509192] (IRB) and/or the Safety Monitor have the authority to stop or 
suspend the study or require modifications.
Subject Accrual 
Subject accrual reviews will help to assure that subjects are being enrolled (accrued) at a rate 
necessary to meet the recruitment goals in general and with regard to racial/ethnic diversity. 
Subject accrual rates will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403750]. 
Treatment Completion Rates 
Retention, attrition and completion rates will be carefully tracked and reviewed. This will be done 
quarterly to highlight any possible concerns and will be reviewed formally with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403751]. Differential dropout across treatments and/or higher than expected dropout will be 
reviewed to determine whether any problems are present and what, if any, corrective action needs 
to be taken. “Trigger points” for corrective action, as described below, include: 35% (“low alert”), 
40% (“mid alert”), 45% (“high alert”), and 50% (“extreme alert”). With early alerts to problems, action 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page 15 of 34would be taken to avoid higher level alerts; if a higher-level alert should arise, more drastic actions 
would be taken.
It is possible that baseline differences between the treatment conditions, excessive attrition, and/or 
missing data will limit the value of the data analysis, and hence knowledge to be gained from this 
study. For these reasons, interim analyses will be conducted twice yearly. Baseline differences, if 
present, will be considered in relation to potential effects on the power to detect differences in the 
primary outcomes. If these effects were to develop and be sizeable, alterations to the randomization 
schedule would be considered. Such effects would be evaluated and discussed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403752], and plans would be communicated to the NIH and Yale IRB. To address excessive 
attrition and missing data, the following actions would be taken at the “trigger point” for each level of 
alert: 
1) Low-level alert (35%): Review of potential problems by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_403753]. 
2) Mid-level alert (40%): Meeting between PI [INVESTIGATOR_403754]. 
3) High-level alert (45%): Meeting between PI [INVESTIGATOR_403755]. 
4) Extreme-level alert (50%): In the unlikely event that a 50% dropout rate occurs prior to the 
mid-study time point, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403756]. 
It is possible that other situations could occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. Any concerns 
would be discussed with appropriate parties (PI, Mentors, Safety Monitor, NIH, Yale IRB).
Measurement and Reporting of Adverse Events
Data on adverse events will be collected on an ongoing basis. Adverse events data will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403757] (see Table 
above). 
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event 
that such problems occur, Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening 
and unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and 
possibly, probably, or definitely related) or UPI[INVESTIGATOR_324039] a temporary or permanent 
interruption of study activities will be reported immediately (if possible), followed by a written report 
within [ADDRESS_509193] 
through regular study meetings, and via email as they are reviewed by [CONTACT_978].
Attribution of Adverse Events: 
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_85048]:
a) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
b) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
c) Possible: Adverse event may be related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
d) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the study treatment or assessment 
procedure.
e) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to the study treatment or assessment 
procedure.

The following scale will be used to grade the severity of adverse events (should they occur) during 
the study:
a) Mild adverse event
b) Moderate adverse event
c) Severe adverse event
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
In addition to grading adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event will be considered serious if it results 
in any of the following outcomes:
a) Death;
b) A life-threatening experience that results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
c) A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
d) A congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
e) Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this definition. 
Plan for reporting events to the Yale IRB that are unexpected AND related AND involve risk of harm 
to subjects or others:
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_403758], experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following 
criteria:
1) Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol 
and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; and
2) Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]); and
3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse 
events.
All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements described above 
will be reported to the IRB in summary form at the time of continuing review. If appropriate, such 
summary may be a simple brief statement that events have occurred at the expected frequency and 
level of severity as previously documented. 
Plan for reporting adverse events to the mentors, Safety Monitor, study team, and funding agency: 
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified:
Primary Mentor (Grilo) and Co-Mentor (Silverman); 
All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol; and
National Institutes of Health.

Study participant safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_403786] [INVESTIGATOR_403761]/or requested. If a study participant experiences any 
psychiatric symptoms or distress (e.g., depressive symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of study 
participation they will receive short-term treatment and support from the study treatment team 
(which includes psychologists) and will be connected to a local emergency department and their 
physician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136313].
Other Potential Issues Relating to Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_403762]: 
1) New Information: It is unlikely that any new information would become available during this 
trial that would necessitate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. If new data become available, these will be 
evaluated. 
2) Limits of Assumptions: It is possible that baseline differences between the treatment 
conditions, excessive attrition, and/or missing data could limit the value of data analysis. 
Baseline differences across treatment groups, if present, will be evaluated twice yearly and 
considered in relation to potential effects on the power to detect differences in the primary 
outcomes. If these effects were to develop and be sizeable, alterations to the randomization 
schedule would be considered. Any plans to alter the randomization scheme would be 
communicated to the NIH. 
3) Limits of Rules: There are other situations that could occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_403763]/or including a section on the safety report entitled “Other situations that have 
occurred since the last safety report that warrant discussion” to allow for communication of 
concerns. 
13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND AIMS
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between treatment and control 
groups using chi-square tests for categorical variables (e.g., sex) and ANOVAs or Kruskal-Wallis 
tests for continuous variables (e.g., BMI z-score). Continuous variables will be examined for 
adherence to normality using probability plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. If normality is not 
satisfied and transformations do not achieve acceptable normality, alternative strategies (e.g., 
nonparametric) will be considered. Dropouts and completers will also be compared. Analyses will 
be intent-to-treat. Outcomes will be tested at the α=0.05 threshold. 
Overall analysis strategy. Descriptive statistics will quantify change and mixed-effects models 
(106, 107) will compare treatments through post; 3-month follow-up will be exploratory. These 
models allow for different numbers of observations per participant, use all available data on each 
participant, account for clustered data observations, and are unaffected by [CONTACT_403787]. 
A further advantage is the capacity to test and account for individual-difference contributions to 
treatment outcomes (108). This strategy provides flexibility in modeling the correlation structure of 
the data. In models for each outcome, we will include fixed effects of time and treatment and their 
interaction, and random subject-level effects. Because we cannot a priori predict the shape of the 
response over time, we will first treat time as categorical and then test for polynomial trends. We will 
consider different error structures (e.g., compound symmetry, autoregressive) and select the best-
fitting structure based on information criteria. Data on all participants enrolled in the study will be 
used in mixed models. We will compare dropout patterns and if there are concerns of informative 
dropout and/or informative intermittent missing data, we will use pattern mixture models to perform 
sensitivity analyses to main analyses.
Primary Aims. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page [ADDRESS_509194]-treatment on clinical outcomes, including: (a) reduction in binge/LOC eating frequency 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_403788]), and (b) reduction in weight (evaluated by [CONTACT_44207] z-score). Significant time-
by-treatment effects with significantly less adolescent binge/LOC eating and significantly reduced 
weight in adolescent CBT relative to the control condition will be considered supportive of these 
aims. Parallel analyses will also assess binge/LOC frequency reduction using the EDE; because 
this interview is only administered at baseline and post, this analysis will, by [CONTACT_108], occur among 
completers. Adolescent CBT is hypothesized to yield reduced binge/LOC eating frequency and 
weight reduction (i.e., weight loss or less excess weight gain) compared to the control group. 
Primary Aim [ADDRESS_509195] the acceptability and establish the feasibility of adolescent CBT. Descriptive 
statistics will quantify clinician/patient treatment ratings, sessions attended, and retention, and 
clinician adherence/competence through ratings of recorded sessions.
Secondary Aims. 
Secondary Aim 1 is to explore the efficacy of adolescent CBT relative to active control: (a) 
reduction in disordered eating thoughts and behaviors (EDE-Q), (b) improvements in executive 
function (S-UPPS, Kirby), (c) improvement in psychosocial functioning (reduced depression, PHQ; 
improved self-esteem, RSES). 
Secondary Aim 2 is to explore the durability and maintenance of treatment effects during short-
term follow-up. 
Secondary Aim 3 is to explore potential predictors of primary outcomes. Following Kraemer’s (109) 
conceptual/statistical model for predictors, we will explore whether baseline characteristics predict 
treatment effects by [CONTACT_403789] 
(specified above), including (a) adolescent executive function (S-SUPPS, Kirby), (b) self-weighing 
(EARLY), (c) parent BMI and disordered eating behaviors (EDE-Q/QEWP), and (d) parent feeding 
practices and attitudes (CFQ). Grilo et al (25) used this analytic strategy in earlier work. 
 
Power Analysis and Justification of Sample Size.  Results are anticipated to yield significant 
impact by [CONTACT_403790]. Power estimates 
for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403764] (n=25) and control conditions (n=25). 
Assuming a two-sided test at α=0.[ADDRESS_509196] 80% power to detect clinically meaningful 
between-subjects (d=0.8) and within-subject effects within each group (d’=0.58). Even assuming 
20% dropout, we still have 80% power to detect clinically meaningful effects (d=0.9 between-
subjects and d’=0.[ADDRESS_509197]). While power is limited given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248], such 
effects are similar to effects observed in a prior study (31) that compared LOC eating between 
youth who received either interpersonal therapy or were in a control group. Thus, we have a 
reasonable chance of finding statistically significant differences between CBT and control, even in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

After initial screening and preliminary determination of eligibility, study clinicians (who have 
completed IRB and ethics training) will meet with potential participants for an initial intake 
appointment. At the intake, study clinicians will discuss the study and all procedures, treatments, 
and risks and obtain written informed consent from one parent and assent from the adolescent. All 
prospective participants will be free to decide whether or not to participate and enrolled participants 
are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Alternative treatments (both psychosocial and 
pharmacological options) will be discussed and referrals offered if requested. Written informed 
consent from parents, and assent from adolescents, will be obtained after they have the opportunity 
to discuss and address all questions with a study clinician and/or the PI. As talk therapy or 
educational materials on healthy eating are minimal risk, and both the treatment and active control 
conditions are likely to provide some direct benefit to the adolescent, only one parent signature [CONTACT_403792].
7. Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining 
consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed. 
With all participants, we will describe the study verbally during the consent process and allow 
participants to ask any questions they might have. To ensure understanding, we will use open-
ended questions with all participants to ask that they paraphrase the nature of the research and 
what they are being asked to do as part of the study, and also summarize the potential risks and 
benefits of the study. 
8. Non-English Speaking Subjects: Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving 
non-English speaking subjects. If enrollment of these subjects is anticipated, translated copi[INVESTIGATOR_20885].  n/a

Confidentiality & Security of Data:
1. What protected health information (medical information along with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected and used for the research?   
Height, weight, medical and psychosocial history will be collected and used for research.
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/13/2024Page 23 of 34HIPAA identifiers to be collected: 
 Names 
 All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State, including: street address, city, county, precinct, zip codes and their equivalent 
geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current publicly-available data from the Bureau of the 
Census: (1) the geographic unit formed by [CONTACT_120826] 20,000 
people, and (2) the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 
000. 
 Telephone numbers
 E-mail addresses
  All elements of dates for dates related to an individual, including: birth date
2. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? 
To ensure confidentiality, all research records will be kept in locked files in the Department of 
Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. All research personnel will be trained and supervised around 
confidentiality issues. The training will include formal NIH or Yale IRB modules with testing 
certification as well as HIPAA guidelines to follow around confidentiality. All participants will be 
assigned a study number. Subsequently, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_403784] (e.g., John Smith [adolescent] = JSMI-A). A list of numbers and the 
corresponding names will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a locked research file. Any 
information published as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit identification of any 
participant. All information collected will remain confidential except when we are legally required to 
disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or 
elderly person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. 
Data will be stored in locked cabinets for [ADDRESS_509199] a responsibility for 
protecting human subjects, including the Yale IRB (Human Investigation Committee), may have 
access to the research records. Additionally, the funding agency (NIH) may have access to the 
research records. 
3. How will the digital data be stored? ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive  ☐Portable Hard  Drive   ☒Secured Server  
☐Laptop Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of  the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
See above, the patients will only be identified by a number on any digital data files. Individually 
identifiable health information will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996.
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a 
device cannot be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]

SECTION V: P OTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
The study may have no direct benefit to the subject for their participation in this study.  The 
cognitive-behavioral treatment is known to be helpful to some adults with binge-eating disorder and 
obesity, but we do not know if it will be help teens with binge eating. We anticipate that some of the 
knowledge from this study will be used to improve treatments for adolescents and to increase our 
understanding of binge eating.
         S ECTION VI: R ESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
Alternatives include community referrals for interpersonal processing therapy or weight 
management by a pediatrician. 
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
Parents and adolescents will be paid for assessments (each: Mo. 1=$25; Mo. 2=$25; Mo. 3=$25; 
Post=$50; Follow-up=$25). 
Participants who complete the focus interview will receive $20 each.
3.Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects. 
Psychological assessment and treatment will be provided at no cost to participants, their insurance, 
health plan benefits nor other third party payer.

risk research that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws).
a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
Yes. Referrals for treatment will be made.
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
As this study is behavioral (non-medication), there is minimal risk of injury. If the 
participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this research study, referrals for 
treatment will be made. If a study participant experiences any psychiatric symptoms or 
distress (e.g., depressive symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of study participation 
they will receive short-term treatment and support from the study treatment team (which 
includes psychologists) and will be connected to a local emergency department and their 
physician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136313].
c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
If the participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this research study, the 
treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_136395](s). 
d. Who will pay for this treatment? 
The participant or participant’s insurance carrier will be billed for the cost of this 
treatment. There are no plans to compensate the participant for physical or mental 
disability, lost wages, or any other losses or damages occurring over the long term or if 
an injury becomes apparent after participation in the study has ended. However, by 
[CONTACT_4912], the participant is not waiving or giving up 
any legal rights to seek compensation. Participants who believe they have been injured 
should contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_97318]. 
e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]?

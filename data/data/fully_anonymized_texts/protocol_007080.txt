decade, surpassing those related to heroin, and are the leading cause of drug overdose in much of the U.S. In Seattle -King County, 75% of drug overdoses involved pha rmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_50953]/or heroin in 2009. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], heroin and pharmaceutical, are preventable and reversible. Research indicates that drug users and their partners can be successfully trained to recognize and reverse overdoses with naloxone (an o pi[INVESTIGATOR_780277] “antidote”).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_780278], education  and inte rvention programs with naloxone 
(OOPE N) in [ADDRESS_1072577] yet been implemented for pharmaceutical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780279]..  
Unique to this setting is the potential to identify high risk pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], a 
population that is difficult to locate and engage. I nterventions using brief behavior change 
counseling (BBCC) have been shown to significan tly improve health behaviors such as alcohol 
use and injury, to increase entry into drug treatment as well as to reduce costs. Evidence is promising, but limited, regarding the impact of BBCC on opio id related risk behaviors.  
This prospective, multi -site, randomized trial will study the effectiveness of an interv ention that 
combines OOPE N with BBCC for both heroin users (n=500) and pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_780280] (n=500). The primary outcome is subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], 
ascertained by [CONTACT_780330] 3, 6 and 12 months as well as via 
administrative  records for up to 24 months ( i.e. medical records, ambulance responses, and 
death certificates). Hypotheses to be investigated include that the intervention recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780281]: 1) lower rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], 2) reduced drug use and overdose risk  behaviors, 3) 
more appropriate health care utilization, and 4) lower total health care costs.  We will also 
explore whether the intervention impacts HIV risk behaviors.  
Introduction  
This research proposes the first prospective, clinical trial to test the effectiveness of an 
intervention to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_780282].  
Naloxone distribution programs for heroin users are widespread and descriptive studies have 
been conducted, but prospective, randomized studies  necessary to prove effectiveness have 
not been conducted. To date no research has been published on how to prevent overdoses among pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], now the largest group represented in fatal drug overdoses 
nationally.  The intervention combine s two widely used interventions  for related health 
behaviors that have not previously been combined: 1) opi[INVESTIGATOR_780283], education  
and intervention with naloxone (OOPE N) for heroin users, and 2) brief behavior change 
counseling (BBCC) which has been shown to prevent future harms for a range of substances.  
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_1072578] surpassed those related to heroin both 
locally and throughout much of the [LOCATION_002]. Health care utilization and costs associated 
with caring for those with problematic opi[INVESTIGATOR_780284].  
Recent, local data indicate the following:  
• Of 256 drug caused deaths in Seattle -King County, Washington in 2008, 195 involved 
pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or heroin. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_780285], driven by [CONTACT_780331][INVESTIGATOR_780286].   
• Non -fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_780287] 16% of heroin users, with 41% reporting 
witnessing an overdose,  in the prior year  according to a [ADDRESS_1072579] lower overdose rates than non -users.  
• Heroin related visits to the Harborview Medical Center (HMC) emergency department (ED) 
in [ADDRESS_1072580] 768 for pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_780288] (case types included: drug abuse, overmedication, adverse 
reaction, and seeking detox). The rate of ED visits for non- medical uses of pharmaceutical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780289] U.S. 
Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) in 2007 and Seattle ranked fourth nationally for heroin
i. 
• Naloxone (opi[INVESTIGATOR_780290]) was administered approximately once a day  in Seattle by [CONTACT_780332][INVESTIGATOR_780291] 2011. Almost all are transported to the HMC ED.  
• On August 22, [ADDRESS_1072581]:  
1) Lower rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_411048]-fatal and fata l overdose   
2) Reduce  drug use , in appropriate medication use,  and other overdose risk behaviors  
Secondary  Aims  
The secondary aims  are to test whether those who receive the intervention compared to 
standard care have:  
3) M ore appropriate health care utilization (e.g. fewer emergency department vis its and 
admissions to inpatient care)  
4) Lower total health care costs  
5) Determine the  prevalence of HIV risk behaviors among heroin and pharmaceutical op ioid 
users at risk for overdose  and whether the inter vention impacts these behaviors.

intervention that combines OOP EN with BBCC for heroin users (n=500) and pharmaceutical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780279] (n=500). The study will take place at Harborview 
Medical Center (HMC) , University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) , and Evergreen 
Treat ment Services . The primary outcomes are subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], ascertained by 
[CONTACT_6270]-report interviews at 3, [ADDRESS_1072583]  24 months and self- reported drug use and other overdose ri sk behaviors. 
Secondary outcomes include: health care utilization , direct  health care costs  and impact on HIV

9) Have non -expi[INVESTIGATOR_780298] -home naloxone at home, on their person, or in their possessions.  
Participation in the study is not appropriate for subjects under care for terminal illness, as 
known reduced life expectancy may skew study results, and the use of high doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_780299].  
Potential  Subjects Identified  
Some subject will be identified through prescreening of intake records and medical history for 
patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , including  those admitted for overdose, or in transit to the ER for 
overdose. In the emergency departments  several large monitors display information related to 
admission. Some subject s initially seen in the ER will be admitted to the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], but will 
be listed in ER medical records for  the past [ADDRESS_1072587] experienced overdose, exhibit physical 
symptoms of drug use (such as abscesses or track marks), present for care with symptoms of 
pain without apparent injury, or exhibit signs of overmedication (such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_780300]) for 
admissions unrelated to drug use or overdose. Clinical staff will also be asked to look for 
subjects  who use opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], have a high number of prescriptions or prescribers  for 
controlled substances (such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_54234]) , or high emergency room utilization 
or admissions.  
If a potential subject is appropriate and medically stable clinical staff may either inform the 
subject of the availability of the study  or confirm that research staff may make the initial 
approach with subjects . A study flyer will also be made available to clinical staff. If patients 
express interest , we will appro ach the potential subject.

morphine equivalent dose  if the only opi[INVESTIGATOR_780301] m (not including 
subjects in opi[INVESTIGATOR_207659]) .   
Subjects who endorse the broader question about having thoughts of being better off dead or 
of hurting oneself will be asked 5 follow -up questions related to active suicidal ideation using 
the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI). Subjects with MSSI values above cut -off levels 
will be excluded and referred to clinical staff for further care.  
We hope to afford as much privacy as possible for subjects who would like to hear more about the s tudy. Screening data will be kept for all subjects  whether eligible or not and whether 
enrolled or not . 
Obtain Informed Consent 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who wish to continue further with 
the study. Subjects will also be asked to complete HIPAA authorization agreements for medical records information from their ED or inpatient visit along with medical care and drug treatment 
records from secondary data sources.  
Baseline Assessments  
Eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments and provide information on person al 
information and health:

demographic information related to subject’s resources and social stability.  
2) Overdose Risk Assessment: This assessment is used to determine the potential for 
future overdose based on prior overdose history, current drug use practices and s ocial 
context for current drug use. This assessment is not standardized but is compi[INVESTIGATOR_780302].  
3) World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL -BREF). This is a short assessment to 
measure general health  and physical, social and emotional functioning.  
4) World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO -ASSIST v.3). This is a multi- item tool to determine areas of substance use and 
misuse. This assessment battery screens for recent and lifetime use of a variety of 
substances, including illicit drugs, alcohol, pharmaceuticals and tobacco products.  
5) Age of First Use: Subjects are asked to provide the ages they first used a variety of 
substances.  
6) HIV Risk Assessment Battery: This assessment is used to determine the potential for 
contracting HIV, hepatitis and other blood -borne illnesses based on drug use and sexual 
use behaviors.  
7) Overdose History: This assessment will collect information related to any prior overdose 
that the subject has experienced or witnessed.  
8) EQ-5D-3L: This validated quality of life measure asks about problems in mobility, self -
care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression and overall health.  
Locator information:  
Subjects will be asked  to provide a number of sources to ensure they can be contact[CONTACT_5365] 3, [ADDRESS_1072589] 
naloxone and, if not, what happened to any naloxone that wa s given to them.  
Secondary Data Sources  
Secondary data on health care and drug treatment utilization will be obtained from Washington 
State (separate IRB action pending) using the following sources:  
• Treatment and Assessment Report Generation Tool ( TARGET ) for drug treatment 
admissions data   
• The Comprehensive Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772094] (CHARS)  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780303]’s  
Medic [ADDRESS_1072590] information on cause of death 
from the King Co unty Medical Examiner’s Office.  If a su bject cannot be located we will also 
check this source to see if they have died and if so to obtain data on the  cause of death.  If we 
are unable to locate a subject during the course of the study or at final follow -up we will utilize 
the King County Jail Inmate Look -up Service. At no time will subjects be contact[CONTACT_780334].  
Intervention Description  
Standard care for patients  who have used opi[INVESTIGATOR_780304].  Standard care 
would not include OOP EN and BBCC intervention s as specified in this grant.  After baseline data 
are obtained subjects assigned to the intervention undergo the following procedures:  
A brief behavior change counseling (BBCC) session  
• Conveys subjects’ risk for overdose, based on the baseline measures  
• Engages them in a reflective discussion of the pros and cons of their current patterns of use  
• Has the patients identify behavior change(s) they are interested in making to improve their 
health  
• Encourages them to share opi[INVESTIGATOR_780305], friends, housemates, and/or drug using partners.  
Education and training on opi[INVESTIGATOR_780306] (OOP EN) 
• Subjects will view a training video on study laptops that reviews : 
o Information on risk factors for overdose and how to prevent and reduce the risk of 
overdose  
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 11 of 22 o How to recognize an opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]  
o The importance of calling 911  
o How to intervene in an overdose  
 Positioning a victim in rescue position  
 Brief overview of rescue breathing  
 Training on how and when to administer naloxone  
• Subjects will be given a study brochure that covers  the information in the video  and review s 
the Washington State 911 Good Samaritan overdose law which provides immunity from 
prosecution  for drug possession charges to overdose victims and by[CONTACT_780335] .  
• Prescribing and dispensing overdose rescue kits including 2 do ses of intra -nasal naloxone, a 
disposable rescue breathing mask, and disposable gloves.  
• Subjects in the intervention group will be informed that they may have one replacement of 
the naloxone kit (2 doses) during the [ADDRESS_1072591] the in tervention to take 30 -45 minutes on average based on our experience and that 
this is feasible and reasonable for subjects and interventionists.  
Fidelity assessment for the BBCC will be done with the  shortened Motivational Interviewing 
Treatment Integrity ( MITI ) instrument.

   Brief Behavioral Change Counseling (BBCC)  
The BBCC will be conducted according to the demeanor and guidelines of Motivational 
Interviewing (MI), a style for counseling patients about sensitive behaviors  and for giving them 
information to enhance their health and safety  in a non- judgmental manner. MI has been 
widely implemented in brief intervention studies for drug use and other  behavior change. MI is 
non-confrontational and respectful of subjects’ autonomy to discuss or not discuss sensitive 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_780309] 4 elements:  
1) The interventionist will show to the patient an approximately 8-minute video on 
overdose prevention , recognition and intervention, which subjects will view on a laptop  
while they are using  headphones. The interventionist will debrief the video with 
subjects and answe r questions.  
2) Next, the interventionist will review with subjects their overdose risk . This task involves 
informing subjects of the “good news” about overdose  risks they are NOT incurring in 
their current behaviors  for the purpose of reinforcing and hopefully continuing more 
positive health behaviors  (e.g., not inappropriately  mixing other drugs or alcohol with 
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 13 of 22 opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]). Next, the interventionist will respectfully and in a neutral tone review with 
subjects the behav iors that currently place them at risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_89737] (e.g., using 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780310] a long period of abstinence).  
3) From the video and risk feedback, the interventionist will segue into an open discussion 
of any changes subjects are thinking  of making to increase their safety from overdosing. 
If at any time during the interview, subjects indicate that they would prefer to quit opi[INVESTIGATOR_780311], the interventionist will help with these 
referrals . The discussion will  culminate in a summary of healthy  changes, if any, that 
subjects  intend to make. Subjects  will take with them a handout that has been 
customized to summarize any changes subjects indicate that they want to make.  
4) Finally, the Overdose Prevention Kit will b e shown to the patient. This involves a hands 
on demonstration of how to set up and administer the naloxone  nasally , with the goal of 
subjects’ learning this well enough to be able to use or teach significant others to 
administer naloxone  to the subjects, if ever needed. The entire intervention is 
conducted in a Motivational Interviewing style of counseling. The interventionist will 
then summarize the conversation . 
All interventions will be audio recorded if subjects permit, allowing the trainer/supervisor of the 
interventionists to monitor MI and overdose education fidelity throughout the course of the 
study.  
Study Medication  
The medication, naloxone, is being used for an indicated condition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_293279]. The 
specific formulation of Naloxone we plan to use is a 2mg/ml- 2ml syringe that is made by 
[CONTACT_780336], [LOCATION_004] (NDC # 00548336900).  
The device used to deliver the medication nasally is a mucosal atomizer device (MAD300). The 
mucosal atomization device is licensed fo r intranasal atomization of prescription medications.   
At usual doses, naloxone is relatively free of adverse effects. Because the duration of action of naloxone may be shorter than that of the narcotic being reversed, patients being treated for opi[INVESTIGATOR_780312].  Administration of naloxone to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
dependent patients may provoke an acute withdrawal syndrome (including body aches, diarrhe a, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], sweating, yawning, nausea or 
vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness, and increased blood pressure). 
Withdrawal reaction are not life  threatening.  Agitation 
and paresthesia have been infrequently reported with the postoperative use of naloxone hydrochloride injection.  
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_1072595] never 
been documented with naloxone.  We will ask about allergic reactions to naloxone during the 
baseline interview and at each of the three follow up interviews. Any allergic reactions will be reported to the University of Washington’s human subjects division and the sponsor the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  
Several articles have been published showing  the effectiveness of nasally administered 
naloxone in overdose situations and the comparability of effect between intranasal administration with other routes of administration fo r naloxone. The intra -nasal route of 
delivery of naloxone with a mucosal atomization device has been used in 1,000’s of reversals safely and effectively by [CONTACT_780337].  
According to the naloxone package insert “ When administered in usual doses and in the 
absence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_560678], it exhibits essentially no 
pharmacologic activity.” Its use on an unconscious person who did not use opi[INVESTIGATOR_780313].  
There is n o known mechanism by [CONTACT_780338][INVESTIGATOR_780314]. Nothing has ever been published that suggests such a conversion 
of naloxone has been accomplished and discussions with professors in schools of medicine ([CONTACT_780354]) and pharmacology ([CONTACT_780355]) at the University of Washington indicated no evidence that naloxone has ever been modified in such a way as to facilitate its being 
abused. According to the naloxone package insert:  “ NARCAN is an essentially pure opi[INVESTIGATOR_238310],  i.e., it does not possess the "agonistic" or morphine -like properties characteristic of 
other opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500]. “  
Subjects will be educated about withdrawal reactions. The overdose intervention training and all education materials will clearly and strongly encourage calling [ADDRESS_1072596] 
clinical and research expertise relevant to the study.  They are not directly involved in the study. 
They will meet during the period of study planning, one month after the study is initiated and 
quarterly from then on.  The committee will receive regular reports on the progress of the 
study, including the number and characteristics of subjects and those who declined to 
participate.  Any serious adverse events (SAE) will be discussed with the committee to 
determine if the risks of SAE could be modified by [CONTACT_772135].  Other 
reports will be provided as the committee requests.  
The committee will include two physicians: Andy Saxon, MD a psychiatrist at the Veterans 
Affairs Puget Sound Health Care Network, where he is the medical director of addiction 
treatment services, he is also a Co -Investigator for medication studies for the Pacific Northwest 
Node of NIDA’s Clinical Trials Network and conducts clinical trials and medical trainings on 
Suboxone - a medication which contains naloxone.  The other physician member is Matthew 
Golden, MD the director of HIV/STD programs for Public Health - Seattle & King County and 
Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington. An additional committee 
member will have expertise in community based substance abuse treatment and the

Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 16 of 22 Adverse event reporting   
The risks expected from trials employing behavioral interventions are presumed minimal and 
the medication being prescribed for possible future use is designed to be used to prevent a 
fatal overdose with side effects being rare . However, given the nature of ongoing drug and/or 
medication use the population studied in this trial is possibly at risk for an overdose.  Adverse events (AEs)  will be categorized as serious or non -serious, as related or not related to the study, 
and as expected or unexpected. An AE is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial. Stable chronic conditions, such as substance abuse, which are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen, are not considered AEs. 
Common, minor ailments and complaints will be excluded from any type of documentation.  
These may include: colds, flu’s, cuts, scrapes, coughs, headaches, stomach complaints, and general fatigue.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as any fatal event, any immediately life threatening 
event, any permanent or substantially disabling eve nt, any event that requires or prolongs 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any event requiring 
intervention to prevent any of the previously listed serious events. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780317]’s (e.g. emergency room visit for a non - study -
related injury that does not result in admittance). Normal childbirth and pre -planned elective 
procedures are not considered SAEs. AE/SAE’s will be elicited by [CONTACT_364337]/research 
interviewers at each assessment visit by [CONTACT_780340] (using the Adverse Events Worksheet).  
Disclosure of an AE/SAE may also occur in an unsolicited manner to a research or clinical staff 
member. The interviewers should be focused on gathering data to aid in determining study 
relatedness. Study -relatedness will be determined by [CONTACT_780341]. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the AE/SAE log and entered into the 
secured project database. AEs that are not study related do not require any further paperwork 
documentation besides the AE Log. In this study, potential AEs that may be related to the study 
would be an increase in emotio nal distress in relation to discussion of past or current drug use 
behaviors or side effects of naloxone.   
University of Washington Adverse Events reporting requirements  
The term adverse event is generally used to refer to any untoward or unfavorable medic al 
occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject's 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the  subject's participation in 
the research. Adverse events encompass both physical and psychological harms. They occur 
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_1072598] commonly in the context of biomedical research although, on occasion, they can occur in 
the context of social and behavioral research.  
Unanticipated problems, in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related  documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics 
of the subject population being studied;  
2. related or there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]; and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
The adverse event report form is to be used to report an adverse event where there is a 
reasonable probability that the event was attributable to a study procedure. The UW IRB 
defines reasonable probability as "more likely than not" - that is, there is a g reater than 50% 
likelihood of the even t having been caused or partially caused by [CONTACT_780342].  
Per HSD policy the form is required to be submitted as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_1072599] database. Data are backed up nightly so there is minimal risk of data loss. Any 
edits to previously  saved data are fully tracked in an electronic audit table and include the 
date/time stamp and user ID of the person making the edit. Ongoing data monitoring will be 
the responsibility of the research coordinator.  
Confidentiality  
We will obtain a federal C ertificate of Confidentiality (CoC), protecting participants against 
disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., drug use). The Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) office that issues the CoC will be advised of any changes in the CoC application information.  
Participant records will be kept confidential by [CONTACT_780343] , secure separate storage of any documents that have 
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 18 of 22 participant identifiers, and secure computing procedures for enter ing and transferring 
electronic data.  
Study  monitoring  
The monitoring of study records  will be conducted on a regular basis by [CONTACT_10117] . The purpose of these visits is to encourage and assess regulatory compliance and 
to document the integrity of the trial progress. Monitoring activity will assure that submitted 
data are accurate and in agreement with source documentation and will also review regulatory/essential documents such as correspondence with the IRB. Areas of particular concern will be participant informed consent, protocol adherence, safety monitoring, IRB reviews and approvals, regulatory documents, participant records, study drug accountability, and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_780318]. The research coordinator 
will ensure that  staff are trained and able to conduct the protocol appropriately and that study 
procedures are properly followed. If additional training of study personnel is needed, project 
staff will undertak e or arrange for that training.  
Data monitoring  
Study data will be entered by [CONTACT_772140], study specific 
laptop computers.  Data will be captured using the REDCap electronic data capture system  
which uses a secure co nnection to local REDCap servers located at ITHS.  Only authorized users 
will be allowed access to the data entry system and no identifiable data will be entered into 
REDCap.  Research staff will use password protected UW works for data entry.  
Data completi on will be verified when study interviews are completed. Baseline data and study 
arm assignment will be captured by  [CONTACT_772141] .  
Data will be managed by [CONTACT_536746] [INVESTIGATOR_780319], w ho will access 
study data from  desktop computer s connected via local area network to computer servers that 
are in a locked room in a locked office suite at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute (ADAI). 
Similarly, follow -up interview data will be entered dir ectly into password protected, study 
specific laptop computers using REDCap, with data uploaded to servers at ADAI weekly .   
Health services and cost data will be obtained, cleaned and made into analytic data sets by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Sears. Data will be transferred sec urely and stored on ADAI servers which are backed up nightly. 
The research coordinator will be responsible for the integrity of all study data and will prepare regular reports for the [ADDRESS_1072600] of the intervention on non -fatal overdose. 
For the  study of each opi[INVESTIGATOR_780320] (heroin and pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) the number of 
subjects needed in each arm of the study (intervention and comparison) to achieve power of 
0.[ADDRESS_1072601] a decline in the overdose rate from 20% to 10% at a confidence level  of 0.05, is 
219 subjects. To increase power somewhat and account for potential loss to follow up, we plan 
to enroll more subjects, 250 in each arm of each study, for a total of 500 heroin using subjects 
and 500 pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], non -heroin using subj ects. Other outcomes to be analyzed 
include drug use and services utilization. Data on brief interventions in ED’s shows declines in 
drug use and ED utilization of at least 40%. Specifically in Washington State, the Screening and 
Brief Intervention Referra l and Treatment (SBIRT) found a 45% reduction in average days of 
drug use among high risk heroin users who received a brief intervention in an ED (from 15.8 days to 8.7 days in the prior month) and 41% reduction among high risk pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_780321] (12.8 to 7.5 days).   
Assumptions behind the power estimate are based upon an annual rate of non- fatal heroin 
overdose estimated to be a median of 25% across studies and for fatal overdoses 
approximately 1%. For the purposes of this sample size estimate we  are conservatively 
assuming a total annual overdose rate for heroin users of 20%.  We believe that a reduction of the OD rate by 50% may be possible based on the potential for additive effects of the OOP EN 
and the BBCC interventions. Preliminary data on o verdose rates for pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_780322] v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 20 of 22 abusers (no regular heroin use) indicates a rate approximately half that of heroin users based 
upon analyses conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Banta -Green of interviews from 1,661 clients entering 
methadone maintenance treatment whic h indicate a lifetime  overdose rate for pharmaceutical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2458] (25%) that is half the rate of heroin abusers (49%). These findings were 
extrapolated to a 50% lower rate of annual  overdose, the validity of which cannot currently be 
determined, but wi ll be ascertained at the conclusion of this proposed study. We are assuming 
an annual overdose rate of 10% for pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], or 20% over two years which is the amount of time over which follow up via administrative data will be collected. Th e power 
estimates above therefore address one year overdose rates for heroin and [ADDRESS_1072602] 24 months via administrative  data. Because randomized controlled studies are designed 
to account for potential confounding factors by  [CONTACT_780344], measured and 
unmeasured, equally across comparison and intervention gro ups, the  initial unadjusted analysis 
will be a logistic regression analysis comparing the probability of opi[INVESTIGATOR_780323]. To examine differences in the time to overdose and to account for time varying 
covariates, such as overdose  risk factors, survival analyses will be conducted with the outcome 
time to overdose(s). A Cox proportional  hazards model will be used to investigate the possible 
association between these factors and event time. We  will use sandwich standard error 
estimates in  all statistical tests. Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be conducted to 
examine the association between predictors and moderators and of the odds of overdose  
occurrence. Predictors will include treatment assignment and overdose risk factors  such as 
concomitant drug  use, interruption in tolerance and homelessness. Potential effect 
modification will be assessed by [CONTACT_780345][INVESTIGATOR_780324]. F or the pharmaceutical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_780325], effect modification by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_780326];  opi[INVESTIGATOR_780327] i nclusion criteria subjects met.  
Aim [ADDRESS_1072603] whether the intervention group has more appropriate health care utilization and lower total health care costs . We will analyze utilization for three separate outcomes: ED 
visits, outpatient visits, and  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780328] . For these analyses we will use a rate modeling  
approach (negative binomial or Poisson regression, with an exposure adjustment should there be a need to  account for differing  amounts of follow -up time) . We will examine health care 
costs (combined hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780329]) from the health care sys tem perspective.  
 Mean -per-month health care costs will be  calculated for both pre - and post -randomization 
periods for each individual. We will assess the difference in  health care costs across the two 
study arms by [CONTACT_780346] -randomization mean healt h care costs on  study arm, and 
controlling for pre -randomization mean health care costs (which should reduce variance and  
increase power) along with other important covariates. We expect that [ADDRESS_1072604] -Squares (OLS) regression to model 
mean cost differences, but will use Generalized Linear Models (GLM) models to examine the 
sensitivity of OLS results . In addition,  we will calculate unadjusted and adjusted cost offsets by 
[CONTACT_780347] e intervention to health care  costs and comparing average monthly total 
costs of services for the intervention group to the average for the  standard care group.  
Aim [ADDRESS_1072605] care group received take -home naloxone and overdose prevention 
and intervention training i.e. “crossed over”. If so, it is possible that this intermediate group might be more similar to the intervention than the standard care group. Crossovers will be 
iden tified by [CONTACT_780348], such as  “Did you possess or have ready access to naloxo ne 
during the past 3/6 months?”  If there is a group that crossed over, post -hoc analyses will 
compare overdose rates at two years for the cross over group compared to e ach of the other 
two study arms. Completion level of administrative data will be assessed by [CONTACT_780349], in broad categories, were 
Project OOPEN Study Protocol v1.9 8 -22-2014  Page 22 of 22 obtained at non- HMC or non -UWMC facilities or ambulance s ervices not in Seattle -King County. 
This will allow for an evaluation of ascertainment bias , that is, how complete data based on 
HMC/UWMC  and King County ambulance data are and whether there are differential levels of 
data comp letion by [CONTACT_780350] t. 
Missing data and dropouts  
Missing data will be minimized by [CONTACT_780351]. However, missing 
data are inevitable and could lead to biased results.  Baseline data values and study arm assignment will be examined to determine the relationship with missingness. Sensitivity 
analyses will be conducted that assume any person lost to follow up had constant levels of drug 
use based upon their most recent measurement point. This will provide some guidance as to 
the amount of bias possib ly introduced by [CONTACT_11368].

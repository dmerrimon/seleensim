      1.[ADDRESS_1198341] blood tr ansplantation in hema tologic malignancies 
 
Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells  derived from bone marrow and       
peripheral blood of sibling and unrelated donors has been us ed successfully to treat 
patients with high-risk or recurrent hema tological malignancies.  However, bone 
marrow transplants (BMT) are limited by [CONTACT_859824] (HLA) 
matched donors and the high risk of gr aft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after 
transplantation.  Although there are more th an 10 million registered donors worldwide, 
more than 30% of patients requiring transpla nts are unable to find a matched donor.
[ADDRESS_1198342] decreased surv ival secondary to severe GVHD (80%) and 
opportunistic infections.[ADDRESS_1198343] blood (UCB) is now being used for 
transplants.  Unrelated UCB tr ansplants have a high rate of engraftment with a low risk 
of acute GVHD even in the 1-2 HLA mis-matched setting in children3-5 and adults.6  
However, delayed engraftment and associ ated treatment-related toxicity and 
opportunistic infections result in high treatment-related mort ality in adults.  Laughlin et 
al emphasized the importance of nucleated cell dose in hematopoietic recovery while 
HLA compatibility played a less significan t role.  Clearly demonstrated was an 
increased event-free survival rate in patient s who received grafts containing more than 
1.2 x 105 CD34+ cells per kilogram.[ADDRESS_1198344] of HLA matching on  survival, with 6/6 
matches faring better than 5/6 or 4/[ADDRESS_1198345] apparent at lower cell doses (<2.5 x 107 total nucleated cells per kilogram), 
emphasizing the effect of cell dose relative to HLA match.[ADDRESS_1198346] tried to en hance recovery by (1) in vitro  expansion of cords;8 (2) infusion 
of multiple cords;9 or (3) combination of cord blood transplant with cells from other

4        11/19/[ADDRESS_1198347] a higher su rvival than single 
grafts.10 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_859810], Barker et al showed 
that combined transplantation of two partia lly matched UCB units resulted in a median 
time to neutrophil engraftment of 23 days (range 15-41).[ADDRESS_1198348] was 
eliminated.   While total nucleated nor CD34+ cell counts nor  HLA match predicted 
which donor would predominate, the predom inating unit had a significantly higher 
CD3+ dose (p<0.01).  Nucleated cell and CD 34+ dose in the predominating unit were 
significantly associated with speed of neutrophil recover y.  With a median follow-up of 
10 months (range 3.5 months-2.5 years), di sease-free survival (DFS) was 57% at one 
year, with 72% of patients a live at one year if transpla nted in remission or chronic 
phase.[ADDRESS_1198349] transplantation 
using a reduced intensity conditioning regi men of fludarabine, melphalan, and rabbit 
antithymocyte globulin  (rATG, Thymoglobulin).10  The median time to neutrophil 
engraftment was 20 days (range 15-34).  Th e 100 day transplant-related mortality was 
14%.  Chimerism analysis showed predominance of one cord by [CONTACT_2006] +100 in 79% evaluable patients.  In 85% of these patients, the first cord infused predominated.  With a median follow-up of 7 months (range 2- 16 months), the overa ll survival was 79%, 
and the DFS was 64%.  Two patients (both with MDS complicating aplastic anemia) 
experienced primary graft failure.

Haploidentical transplantation, the transpla ntation of stem cells from a partially 
matched related donor (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a parent, child or sibling) has been explored starting in 
the early 1980’s.  Initial studies were charac terized by a high incidence of graft failure, 
immunodeficiency, and GVHD.2  The administration of massive doses of CD34-
selected (thus T-cell depleted) stem cells ca n prevent  graft rejection, perhaps through a 
veto mechanism, and assure reliable engraftment without excessive GVHD.[ADDRESS_1198350] blood transplantation.  
Their observations indicated that initial rapid engraftment was obtained from the 
haploidentical T-cell depleted graft; subsequent hematopoies is resulted from the cord 
blood which appeared to permanently repl ace the haploidentical hematopoiesis.[ADDRESS_1198351]  Blood Transplantation Symposium17 and in a 
recent publication18.  His group has transplanted 28 pati ents with advanced hematologic 
malignancies.  The median age was 30 (16- 63) and weight 67 (43- 87) Kg.  The basic 
IRB#:  14736B    
5        11/19/2012 conditioning regimen was fluda rabine, cyclophosphamide, tota l body irradiation (TBI), 
and equine antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM), with modifications in 6 patients.  The 
UCB units had 2.37 (1.31-3.7) x107 TNC/Kg and 0.11 (0.035-0.37) x106 CD34+ 
cells/Kg and were 0-[ADDRESS_1198352] party donor was an 
HLA haploidentical relative for 24 (mother fo r 4; also father, sibling, son, nephew), a 
higher HLA mismatched (mm) relative for 3, and a fully HLA mm unrelated donor for 
1.  All 3rd party cells were extensively T-cell depleted so that the infused cells 
contained a median of 2.31 (1.05-2.58) x106 CD34+/Kg and 0.25 (0.05-0.98) x104 
CD3+/Kg. 
 
Initially, post-transplant ci rculating granulocytes were  predominantly from the 3rd party 
donor in all patients except th e four receiving maternal CD 34+ cells.  Analysis of DNA 
polymorphisms showed initial predomin ance of the 3rd party donor both in 
granulocytes and mononuclear  cells and subsequent progressive replacement by [CONTACT_859825].  Excluding the 4 patients who received maternal mobilized peripheral blood cells, 
the corresponding data was: median time to ANC>0.5x109/L was 9.5 days (9-17); CB-
ANC>0.5x109/L was 22 days; and full CB chimerism 54 days; median time to platelets 
>20x109/L and >50x109/L was 30 and 54 days, respec tively.  The 4 who received 
maternal cells had no significant engraftmen t of these cells, although 3 had exclusive 
UCB chimerism, 2 of which reached fu ll UCB engraftment (days 20 and 36).  
Replacement of the 3rd party graft by [CONTACT_859826]-derived immune system or im munization to minor histocompatibility 
antigens.18 
 
20 of 27 (74%) patients had acute GVHD (a -GVHD) of any grade after day [ADDRESS_1198353]- 
transplant; 4 of 27 (14.8%) reach ed grade III-IV.  Most of  the patients with a-GVHD 
responded to corticosteroid therapy.  Ther e were two deaths pr imarily related to a-
GVHD, one occurred in one of two patients who did not receive ATG as part of the 
preparative regimen.  DNA analysis of sk in biopsies of GVHD lesions showed UCB 
DNA in several instances, but in no case were third party donor cells  detected.  Only 4 
out of 20 patients at risk developed manifestions of chronic GVHD (c-GVHD), which 
was limited in all.     
 
[ADDRESS_1198354] been reported related to the procedure (toxicity 2; graft failure 1; GVHD 
>II 2; opportunistic infection 3) .  The 2 deaths due to toxici ty occurred in patients who 
received 1.2 Gy TBI without fludarabine.  One developed multi-organ failure and the 
other veno-occlusive disease.  Two of the d eaths due to opportunistic infection were 
due to CMV; the other from toxoplasmosis.  With a median follow up of 10 months (1-
75) for all patients and 16 months (3-75) fo r the 20 living (9 surv iving >2years), the 4 
year overall survival is  67% for the whole group.[ADDRESS_1198355] transplants provide an additional source for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).  Partia lly matched UCB transplants have already 
been shown to engraft with reduced acute GVHD.  The major limitation to UCB 
IRB#:  14736B    
6        11/19/2012 transplants is delayed engraftm ent which is related to nucleat ed cell dose.  Our patient 
population is relatively older, has advanc ed disease, and often suffers from 
comorbidities.  Prolonged neutropenia is not tolerated, and intensive conditioning is necessary to induce durable disease contro l.  We are therefore interested in 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_859811] a patient  population with more advanced disease.  
 
For patients transplanted in remission, we will use a conditioning regimen of fludarabine-melphalan because it is relativel y well tolerated and effective in assuring 
engraftment and preventing GVHD.
 11, 19    
 
For high risk patients, we will use either fludarabine-thiotepa-TBI20 or busulfan-
fludarabine21, as currently evaluated at University of Chicago. 
 
Correlative studies will include those related to engraftment and i mmune reconstitution. 
 
The essential differences between our proposed study and the Spanish study will be the following: 
 
1. Patient selection. The median age in our studies is usually over 50, more than two 
decades older than in the Spanish studies.  Age-related differences in the immune 
system may profoundly affect our outcomes.  2. Differences in conditioning regimen, which are influenced by [CONTACT_859827].   
2.4 Preliminary Data as of February 2012 
 
We published our initial experience with reduc ed intensity conditioning of this regimen 
(Liu, Blood, Oct 2011 pre-published online). Over all, this regimen has been promising 
with early engraftment in th e majority of subjects and cord-blood predominance later. 
We also had shifted from TBI based regimens  for active disease to an alternative non-
radiation approach of diseas e reduction before transplant with chemotherapy and then 
at the nadir of cytopenia, using reduced inte nsity conditioning.  This  is an approach we 
have used for matched donors with success.

17        11/19/2012 8.0    CRITERIA FOR STUDY EVALUATION 
 
 Event Free Survival 
 
Relapse will be recorded by [CONTACT_859830]. The molecular 
detection of MRD will not be taken into account  for the definition of clinical recurrence. 
The diagnosis of disease recurrence will be ba sed on clinical and pathological criteria. 
 
 Toxicity 
 
Toxicity will be scored acco rding to NCI-CTC criteria.   
 Acute GVHD will be scored according to the criteria proposed by [CONTACT_267135][INVESTIGATOR_20360]. 
(Appendix F).
[ADDRESS_1198368] Disease:  I. Diagnosis and 
Staging Working Report (A ppendix G and Appendix H).
24  
 
 Definitions of Engraftment 
 
Myeloid engraftment will be defined as th e first day in which the ANC is > 500/mm3 for 
three consecutive days.  Cytogenetic and chim erism studies will be performed to confirm 
donor origin. 
  
Platelet engraftment will be defined as th e first day the platelet count is > 20,000/mm3 
without transfusion support for seven consecutive days.  
 
Failure to engraft will be de fined as lack of ev idence of hematopoietic  recovery (ANC < 
500/mm3 and platelet count < 20,000/mm3) by [CONTACT_4475] +35, confirmed by a biopsy revealing 
a marrow cellularity < 5%.  Graft failure will also be defined as initial myeloid 
engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] +35, documented to be of  donor origin, followe d by a drop in the 
ANC to < 500/mm3 for more than three days, inde pendent of any myelosuppressive 
drugs, severe GVHD, CMV, or other infection.   
There may be rare cases in which the haploide ntical transplant is rejected, but the 
cord transplant engrafts with delay.  Loss of established haploi dentical engraftment 
will be considered graft failure.  
 
Graft rejection will be defined as graft failure with documentation of return of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859817]/or chimerism studies. 
 Chimerism studies will be used to determine the percentage cord vs  haploidentical donor 
engraftment. 
IRB#:  14736B    
18        11/19/2012 9.0    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The primary endpoint of this tria l is the rate of e ngraftment (which is the opposite of graft 
failure).  Up to 53 patients will be enrolled in  the trial.  Graft failu re will be monitored 
using the group sequential procedure described in O’Brien and Fleming25 to test the null 
hypothesis that the graft failure ra te is < 10%, against the alternative that the rate is > 10%.  
Four interim analyses will be performed after n=10, 20, 30, and [ADDRESS_1198369] been 
enrolled, followed by a final analysis at n=[ADDRESS_1198370] has 80% power if the true  graft failure rate is 20%. 
 
GVHD is the secondary endpoint, and we are partic ularly interest ed in monitoring high risk 
extensive GVHD.  We will revi ew the data after the first 5, 10, 15, and 20 patients with 
successful engraftment and without evidence of  relapse reach their 18-month landmark.  
Evidence that the rate of high-risk, extensive GVHD in this subset of patients is >40% will 
lead to consideration for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Specifica lly, if 4 of 5, 6 of 10, 9 of 15, or 11 of 20 
such patients develop high-risk, extensive GVH D at any time prior to 18 months, we will 
consider terminating the trial.  The probab ility of having these many poor outcomes (or 
more) if the true rate of GVHD is 40% is 0.087, 0.17, 0.10, and 0.13, respectively.   
 Given the heterogeneity of the patient population included, one cannot formulate 
expectations regarding overall  survival and progression-fre e survival (PFS).  Unless the 
above described monitoring boundaries are exceede d, the protocol will continue to accrue 
until [ADDRESS_1198371] been enrolled.  At th e conclusion of the study, 95% confidence 
intervals will be generated for PFS, the incide nce of graft failure, and the frequency of 
active and extensive GVHD.  Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free and overall 
survival rates will be cal culated, both overall and fo r the good and high risk groups 
separately, and the median progression-free and overall survival times and their associated 
95% confidence intervals derived using the method described in Brookmeyer and 
Crowley.
26  Descriptive statistics related to the fr equency of adverse events and of changes 
in laboratory values  will be generated. 
 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be established to review the 
data and make recommendations regarding the c ontinuation or discontinua tion of the trial.   
 Addendum: As of March 2010, [ADDRESS_1198372] been observe d (Rich etal, ASH ab stract 3114, 2009). The 
protocol is being modified for use of th e Miltenyi column because of market supply 
reasons. But the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859818].  
Addendum [ADDRESS_1198373] majority  of subjects received fludarabine, melphalan 
IRB#:  14736B    
19        11/19/2012 conditioning for AML/MDS. Of  [ADDRESS_1198374] 45 
subjects receiving reduced in tensity fludarabine melphalan (Liu, Blood 2011).  Only four 
of 45 had graft failure (lack of haplo and cord blood engraftment). The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859819] [ADDRESS_1198375] been low and below the 40% chr onic GVHD considered for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. 
The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV GVHD was 24% and for cGVHD 6 % at one year. 
 Since the safety of this approach has been established based on low graft failure and low GVHD, overall survival and progression free su rvival become more of  interest. One year 
overall survival was 55% and progression free -survival 42%.  The majority 29 (64%) had 
AML and MDS.  In addition, 21/45 (47%) had high risk disease defi ned as refractory, 
untreated relapse. Expanding our sample size will allow us to generate OS and PFS estimates in those by [CONTACT_814865] (high-ri sk versus standard/low ) and for those with 
AML/MDS.  A better estimate of efficacy is essential as future studies are now being 
planned including a randomized trial. An additional [ADDRESS_1198376] risk 
disease and 41 with high-risk disease (assumi ng the proportion in the first 45 subjects is 
maintained). This will also result in en rolling approximately 55 to 56 subjects with 
AML/MDS and of those, we estimate [ADDRESS_1198377] risk disease. Generating 
estimates in the cohort of MDS/AML with standa rd risk disease has emerged as essential as 
this represents the most co mmon transplant indication. 
 
10.0   DATA AND PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT  
 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE Patients will be re viewed weekly during admission by [CONTACT_859831] r standard endpoints. After discharge they 
will be reviewed at least once a month. 
 DATA ENTRY Data must be entered into the Protocol Data Management System before 
a course of therapy can be given.  A brie f explanation for required but missing data 
should be recorded as a comment. 
 ACCURACY OF DATA COLLECTION The Study Ch airman will be th e final arbiter of 
toxicity should a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_41221]. 
 
IRB#:  14736B    
20        11/19/2012 11.0   CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL 
 At patient request. 
 Clinical progression. Such patients may be tr eated on other treatment protocols or at the 
investigator’s discretion. Such  patients will continue to be monitored for end-points 
relating to engraftment, GVHD and immune reconstitution. 
12.0   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
      
 Any unexpected, life-threatening an d/or serious (grade 3 or 4)  toxicity or grade 3 or 4 
GVHD will be reported immediately to the Study Chairman.  The Chairman will be 
responsible for notifying the Surveillance Committee.   
 
 Expected toxicities are those listed in th e consent form and include regimen-related 
toxicities, myelosuppression, opportunistic in fections such as CMV reactivation, or 
GVHD.  These will not be routinely repor ted to the IRB even if they require 
admission. 
 
 On the other hand, such toxicities will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_859820] e High Risk Protocol Committ ee of the Cancer Center. 
 
 All deaths that are not due to the disease recurrence will be reported to the IRB.

protocol with the results of Haploidentical stem cell transplant at Peking Institute of 
Hematology in Beijing.  The analysis will focus on the AML/MDS population first. The main purpose of the analysis is to compare th e patient characteristics, pre-transplant co-
morbidities, and outcomes of transplant fr om these two centers; including neutrophil, 
platelet engraftment; progression free survival , overall survival, incidence of acute GVHD, 
and chronic GVHD et al. In a ddition, we would like to comp are the immune re-constitution 
after these two types of transplant.  The datase ts will be shared between the University of 
Chicago and the Peking institute of Hemato logy in Beijing without  identifiable patient 
information (coded), each patient will be mark ed by [CONTACT_859832].  Both centers have IRB approval for the transplant protocol. The IRB has 
approved the Peking Institute of Hematology retrospective review.

BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION 
 
 
BUSULFAN 
 
AVAILABILITY 
Commercially available in 60 mg/ 10 mL ampuls. 
  
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Store ampuls under refrigeration at 2oC to 8oC.  The diluted solution is stable for up to 8 hours at room 
temperature (25oC), but the infusion must also be completed wi thin that 8-hour time frame.  Dilution of 
busulfan injection in 0.9% sodium chloride is stable for up to 12 hours under refrigeration (2oC to 8oC), 
but the infusion must also be completed within that 12-hour time frame. 
 
PREPARATION 
Dilute busulfan injection in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or dext rose 5% in water per institutional 
pharmacy guidelines.  
ADMINISTRATION 
Intravenous busulfan should be administered via a central venous catheter per institutional guidelines. 
 TOXICITY 
Severe myelosuppression with marrow ablation, alop ecia, and mild nausea/vomiting are expected.  
Alopecia may not be completely reversible.  Live r toxicity, including severe and possibly fatal veno-
occlusive disease (<5%), may occur.  Pulmonary toxicity  is rare.  Darkening of the skin may occur and 
may last several months.  Seizures may occur (<5%).  Anti-seizure prophylaxis should be administered 
per transplant guidelines.  Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], eg. Clonazepam (Klonopin ) 1 mg PO TID, may be used.  
Busulfan causes immunosuppression with the risk of opp ortunistic infection even after resolution of 
neutropenia.  Busulfan is expected to cause near ly universal infertility in the doses used, although men 
may occasionally father children.  Grade III mucos ities, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, hemorrhagic 
cystitis, “hand-foot syndrome” with neur opathic pain has also been reported.

rashes, myalgia, headache, agitation, hearing lo ss, transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_22621], 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (may be life-threateni ng), peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary toxicity.  
(Both pneumonia and hypersensitivity r eactions have been reported.  Fatal pulmonary toxicity has been 
described, especially when fludarabine was used in  combination with pentostatin.  Severe, fatal CNS 
toxicity presenting with loss of vision and progressive deterioration of mental status was encountered 
almost exclusively after very high doses of fludarabine.   Such toxicity has only been rarely demonstrated 
at the 25-30 mg /m

TACROLIMUS  (Prograf, FK506)  
 
AVAILABILITY 
Tacrolimus is commercially available as an injection (5 mg/mL; 1 mL ampuls) and as oral capsules (0.5 
mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg).   STORAGE & STABILITY 
Store tacrolimus capsules and injection at controlled room temperature, 15
oC-30oC (59oF-86oF).   
 PREPARATION – FOR IV USE 
Tacrolimus injection must be diluted prior to IV in fusion with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose 
injection to a concentration of 4-20 mcg/mL.  Soluti ons should be prepared in non-PVC plastic or glass.  
Tacrolimus injection and diluted solutions of the dr ug should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
Oral therapy should be started as soon as possibl e as per protocol and 8 to 12 hours after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_765238].  Oral doses will be administer ed twice a day.  The conversion from IV to oral 
therapy should take into account concom itant medications (such as voriconazole). 
 
TOXICITY 
In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experi enced anemia, 8% to 32% experienced leukocytosis, 
and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia.  Rare  cases of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have 
been reported.  Chest pain was reported in 19%.  Mild to moderate hypertension is a common adverse 
effect associated with tacrolimus therapy.  Antihy pertensive therapy may be required.  The most common 
adverse effects of tacrolimus have involved the cen tral nervous system, and include headache (37% to 
64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%),  paresthesia (17% to 40%), and dizziness (19%).  
Tremor and headache may respond to dosage reduction.  Visual changes, agitation, anxiety, confusion, 
seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus, neur opathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal 
dreams have been reported in 3% to 15%.  Hype rkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to 29%) 
hypophosphatemia (49%) and hypomagnesemia (16% to  48%) have been associated with tacrolimus 
therapy.  Hyperuricemia has been reported in >3%.  Gastrointestin al adverse effects included nausea 
(32% to 46%), vomiting (14% to 29%), anorexia (7% to 34%), constipation (23% to 35%), and diarrhea 
(37% to 72%).  Nephrotoxicity was reported in 38% to 52% of liver and kidney transplant patients, 
respectively.  Hematuria h as been reported in greater than 3%.  Abnormal liver function tests have been 
reported in 6% to 36% of patients; ascites in 7% to 27%.    Other effects reported in clinical trials include pain, fever, asthenia, back pain, and peripheral edema.  The 
incidence of hyperglycemia was 17% and may requi re therapy with insulin.  Other less frequently 
occurring effects include abscess, chills, peritonitis, a nd photosensitivity reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been 
reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus.  T acrolimus injection contains cremophor 
which in other drugs has been associated with  anaphylaxis.  Because tacrolimus is an 
immunosuppressant, the risk of opportunistic infections is increased.

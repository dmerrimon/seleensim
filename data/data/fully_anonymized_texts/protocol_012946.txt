SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209498
Protocol Title: A Randomized Phase 3 Open Label Study of Nivolumab vs Temozolom ide Each in Combination with 
Radiation Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Adult Subjects with Unmeth ylated MGMT (tumor O-6-methylguanine DNA 
methyltransferase) Glioblastoma
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS-936558) [ADDRESS_902249] , or Temozolomide 75 mg/m2orally daily during 
radiation therapy followed by 4 week  break then 6 (28-day) cycle s temozolomide dosed on Days 1-5 at 150 mg/m2in 
cycle 1 increasing to 200 mg/m2as tolerated up to 6 cycles. 
Study Phase: 3
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with radiation therapy plus nivolumab (RT + nivolumab ) will improve over all 
survival (OS) compared with radiation therapy plus temozolomide (RT + TMZ) in subjects w ith newly diagnosed 
unmethylated MGMT glioblastoma (GBM).
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
To compare OS of nivolumab plus radiation therapy (RT + nivolum ab) versus RT + TMZ in subjects with newly-
diagnosed GBM and unmethylated MGMT tumors after surgical resec tion.
Secondary Objectives:To compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS ) of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ
To estimate OS rate at 24 months (OS[24]) of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ (final analysis only)
To evaluate, in newly diagnosed, unmethylated MGMT GBM, any relat ionship between OS or PFS and tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) in the RT + nivolumab arm compared to th e RT + TMZ control arm
Study Design: This study will enroll subjects with newly-diagnosed GBM, following surgical resection of the tumor. After informed 
consent is obtained, subjects will enter the screening phase. T umor tissue will be evaluated for MGMT methylation 
by a central laboratory assay.  
 The screening number assigned in the 
CA209498 interactive voice response system (IVRS) will be the same subject number entered by [CONTACT_215298]209548 IVRS. Those with an MGMT status of me thylated or indeterminate may be eligible to 
randomize in the CA209548 study. In orde r to randomize approximately [ADDRESS_902250]-surgery (within 24 hours 
preferred). When ready to begin study treatment, subjects will proceed to the treatment phase of the study. All subjects who enter 
the treatment phase, ie, all randomized subjects, will be follo wed for safety and tolerability, tumor progression and 
survival. A contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed 4 weeks a fter completing radiation therapy, then every 
8 weeks ( ±7 days) until progression regardless of treatment schedule. Tum or progression will be assessed using

Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria (RANO). Additi onal assessments will be performed for cognitive 
function, neurologic function, biomarkers, and patient-reported q uality of life outcomes. 
After cessation of study treatment for any reason, all randomiz ed subjects will enter a follow up phase. In the 
short-term, visits are defined for reporting of treatment-relat ed adverse events. All subjects in whom disease 
progression had not been detected at the time study treatment is stopped will be followed closely for progression with 
contrast enhanced MRI every 8 weeks ( ±7 days). After progression, subsequent treatment will be reporte d. All
randomized subjects MUST be followed for survival (primary endp oint).
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet regularly during th e study to ensure that subject safety is carefully 
monitored.
Study Population : Subjects must meet all eligibility criter ia specified in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of the protocol, 
including the following:

Study Assessments:
Safety Evaluation: Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for [ADDRESS_902254] recovered to ba seline or are deemed irreversible by [CONTACT_093].
Efficacy Assessments: Post-operative baseline MRI following con sensus recommendations must be obtained prior to 
randomization. It is strongly recommended that this scan be obta ined < 72 hrs or > [ADDRESS_902255]. Tumor imaging assessments following recent co nsensus recommendations will occur 4 weeks 
(±7 days) after completion of radiotherapy (baseline MRI) then eve ry 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until disease progression.
Per RANO, assessment of disease progression during study requires that MRI scan be performed >12 weeks after RT; 
it is therefore recommended that second on-treatment scan be pe rformed at least [ADDRESS_902256]-treatmen t Follow Up visits 1 and 2 (~[ADDRESS_902257] dose). Survival status 
will be assessed every 3 months ( ±14 days) after follow up visits are completed, and may be compl eted via telephone 
or in person visits.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: Approximately 550 subjects will be randomized to the two arms ( RT + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ) in a 
1:[ADDRESS_902258] 390 events (ie, death) to provide 90%  power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 with an 
overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided). This translates to an observed HR of 0.82 (medi an OS of 13.0 vs 15.8 months) 
or less resulting in a statistically significant improvement. 
The secondary endpoint of only PFS will be tested hierarchically.

Endpoints: The primary endpoint is OS. OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
death due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date. OS will be followed 
continuously while subjects are on study drug and every 3 months ( ±14 days) via in-person or phone contact [CONTACT_667942]-up phase of the study.
The secondary endpoint of PFS is defined as the time from randomi zation to the date of the first documented tumor 
progression or death due to any ca use. Subjects who die without  a reported progression will be considered to have 
progressed on the date of death. Subjects who did not have dise ase progression or die will be censored at the date of 
last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study t umor assessment and did not die will be censored at 
the randomization date. Subjects who started any subsequent ant i-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to initiati on of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Subjects who 
had surgical resection post start of study treatment will be cen sored at the last tumor assessment date prior to initiation 
of surgical resection. PFS will be determined by [CONTACT_667943] 24 months, is define d as Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 24 months. 
An additional secondary endpoint is OS and PFS assessed in the TMB-high population, as assessed in the TMB assay 
where the numerical cut-off for high versus low will be specifi ed in the statistical analysis plan. Definition for OS and 
PFS for this endpoint will be the same as defined earlier.
Analyses:
The analyses of primary endpoint of OS and secondary endpoints of PFS and OS[24] will be base d on all ra ndomized 
subjects. If superiority in OS is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing approach for the secondary endpoint
of PFS will be used to preserve a study-wise type I error rate a t 0.05. OS[24] will be estimated using Kaplan Meier 
method. OS and PFS will also be estimated for the TMB-high popul ation.
OS and PFS distribution in all randomized subjects will be comp ared between treatment groups using a two-sided 
stratified log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and correspondi ng two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
estimated in a Cox pr oportional hazard model using treatment as  a single covariate stratified by [CONTACT_667944].
OS and PFS curves will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier prod uct-limit method. Median OS and PFS along with 
the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs using the log-log transform ation will be computed. 
OS [24] and the corres ponding 95% CIs using the log-log transfo rmation w ill be computed after all subjects have 
follow-up of at least 24 months. OS and PFS in the TMB-high popu lation will be estimated usi ng the Kaplan-Meier 
method.

3.1 Study Design and Duration
This study will e nroll subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), followi ng surgical 
resection of the tumor. After informed consent is obtained, sub jects will enter the screening phase . 
Tumor tissue will be evaluated for MGMT methylation by a centra l laboratory assay.

Date: 15-Nov-[ADDRESS_902267] be obtained pri or to 
randomization. It i s strongly recommended that this scan be obt ained < 72 hrs or > [ADDRESS_902268]. There is no require ment that this baseline scan be  
performed on a “qualif ied” machine (a qualified MRI is one that m eets the Imaging Manual  
specifications and has been validated with the required phantom  scan). If a post-operative MRI is  
not available, a high-quality, contrast-enhanced CT scan may be performed initially, but in this  
case a contrast-enhanced MRI must  be performed prior to randomiz ation (> [ADDRESS_902269]-op  
preferred).
Subjects with a central laboratory result of unmethylated MGMT may continue in the screening  
phase, in which eligibility f or randomization will be documented and bas eline demographic and  
disease informati on submitted; f or details, see Section 3.1.1.
When ready to begin study treatment, s ubjects will proceed to t he treatment phase of the study;  
for details, see section 3.1.[ADDRESS_902270]-enhanced MRI should be performed 4 weeks ( ±7 days) after completing radiation  
therapy, then every 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until progression regardless  of treatment schedule or do se 
delays. Tumor progression will be assessed using RANO criteria described in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_902271] enhanced MRI ever y 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until  
progression. After progression, subjects MUST be followed for sur vival (primary e ndpoint);  
subsequent treatments will be reported. For det ails on the fol
low-up phase, see section 3.1.3 .
Baseline and all subsequent scans will be submitted to a blinded  independent radiology review  
committee (BIRC) for archiving, once the subject is randomized and throughout the study period.
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet regularly during th e study to ensure that subject  
safety is carefully monitored, see Section 7 .

3.1.1 Screening Phase
Subjects will provide consent for enrollment and tumor submissi on in the peri-operative period, 
so that MGMT status can be determined.  Consent for randomizati on and study treatment may be 
deferred until MGMT unmethylated status and eligibility is esta blished (or be obtained 
concurrently). However, consent for tumor submission only may b e obtained pre-operatively based 
on a clinical/radiographic diagnosis of GBM. The clinical circu mstances should be considered 
with respect to the timing of consent.

Figure 3.1.1-1: Screening and Randomization
Following informed consent, subjects with histologic diagnosis of GBM and no evident exclusions 
will be enrolled via a call to an IVRS system, in order to obtain  a subject number, after which 
tumor tissue will be submitted to the central laboratory. For d etails, see Table 5.1-[ADDRESS_902272] cannot be randomized until the result of the central laboratory MGMT is entered into the IVRS. Subjects without  a confirmed result of
unmethylated MGMT will be considered screen failures and will n ot be eligible for randomization. 
If the assay result is methylated or indeterminate MGMT, they m ay be enrolled onto another BMS 
study (if available) based on the same MGMT assay.
It is expected that corticosteroid therapy w ill be tapered to the maximum extent possible during 
this phase. Subjects who cannot tolerate tapering of steroids t o < 20 mg prednisone or < 3 mg 
dexamethasone per day (or equivalent) are not eligible for rando mization.
RT should begin within 42 days of surgi cal resection, but may be delayed if clinically required. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the time from screening procedure to treatment should no t exceed 28 days, but may be 
longer if clinically indicated. If repeat resection to improve tumor control is performed for newly-
diagnosed GBM prior to any other therapy (eg, upon referral to r esearch site), the 42-day interval 
should restar t at the time of this second surgery and a new pos t-operative MRI must be performed.Schema: Screening and Randomization

3.1.2 Treatment Phase
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization and Initiation of TreatmentAfter eligibility has been confirmed, subjects who are clinical ly ready to begin study treatment (ie, 
recovered from surgery) will proceed to the treatment phase of the study via a second call into the  
IVRS system. At this call, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive radiotherapy plus nivolumab  
(RT + nivolumab) or ra diotherapy plus temozolomide (RT + TMZ).
Randomization will be prospectively balanced (ie, stratified) a ccording to post-operative MRI  
finding of “complete” versus “partial” resection. For the purposes  of this study, a complete  
resection will be defined as ≤[ADDRESS_902273] tumor  
surgical region following surgical resection. A partial resecti on is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_902274]-enhancing tumor tissue on T1 images following surgical  resection. Resections with a  
residual of between > 5 and < 10 mm of enhancement will be defined as partial or complete by [CONTACT_2924]’s best clinical judgment.
The total time elapsed from diagnostic surge ry to initiation of RT s hould not ex ceed 42 days,
including a maximum of 7 days fro m randomization to initiation o f RT; however, treatment may  
be delayed if clinically required. Subjects in the RT + nivoluma b arm should begin nivolumab  
within 7 days after randomization, and may be given at any time pr ior to RT start, as clinically  
appropriate. Subjects randomized to the RT + TMZ arm will begin combination  
chemoradiotherapy on the same day, within 7 days after randomizat ion, as clinically appropriate.
See sections 4.5.1 and4.5.2 for details of dosing for nivolumab and temozolomide; for an ov erview 
of the treatment phase, see Section 3.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy s hould begin after substantial recovery from surg ical res ection, preferably not  
more than 42 days after surgery; however, treatment may be delayed  if clinically required.  
External-beam RT to a total dose of 60 Gy will be administered in daily doses of  2 Gy, typ ically  
on a 5 days on / 2 days off schedule as appropriate for scheduli ng, over 6-7 weeks. Patients  
considered clinically inappropriate for full dose RT (60 Gy ±5%) are not eligible, eg, due to older  
age, tumor location. RT is administered to the post-operative t umor volume plus a 2-[ADDRESS_902275] be obtained if not part of

Certain surgically-implanted devices (pacemaker, deep brain sti mulator, met allic implants, etc.)  
are incompatible with MRI imaging. The local imaging facility a nd investigator should determine  
the appropriate precautions or guid elines that should be instituted for subjects with tattoos, bod y 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_193578]. For ot her locally performed imaging , it is the local imaging facility’s  
responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes (eg, a llergy history, diabetic history and  
renal status, other contr aindications), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen for  
each subject. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an indivi dual subject in this study rests with  
the site radiologist, the investigator, and the standard set by [CONTACT_667947].
In accordance with TMZ labeling, valproic acid should not be us ed concomitant with TMZ; at  
investigator discretion, alternative anticonvulsants should be used.

[IP_ADDRESS] Continuing Nivolumab with Suspected Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of subjects tre ated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_215280], eg, due to inflammatory 
reaction simulating progression (“tumor flare” or pseudoprogres sion). Subjects on the RT + 
nivolumab arm may, at investigator discretion, continue nivoluma b in the setting of suspected 
progression until progression is confirmed. [Note: this is not the same as confirmation of 
progression occurring within 12 weeks after RT, which applies t o both treatment arms.] 
Communication with the BMS Medical Monitor is strongly encouraged. If the investigator 
believes that the subject continues to derive clinical benefit by [CONTACT_43893], the subject 
should continue assessments according to Table 5.1-2 .
Subjects may continue nivolumab beyond initial (susp ected) progression only if they meet the 
following criteria:
•Subject is toler ating nivolumab

•Treatment will not delay intervention to prevent imminent compl ications, eg surgery for relief 
of symptomatic intracranial mass effect 
•Investigator-assessed overall clinical benefit
Radiographic assessment should be rep eated after suspected progress ion as clinically required in 
order to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tum or size  or continued progression. 
If possible, perfusion images s hould also be obtained. All MRI scans should be submi tted to the 
imaging vendor as soon as possible. 
Re-operation should be considered, if lesion is surgically acce ssible, to differentiate immune-
treatment effects from progression. The BMS Medical Monitor sho uld be consulted. Potential for 
clinical benefit s hould be b alanced by [CONTACT_2085] j udgment as to whether the sub ject is clinically 
deteriorati ng and unlikely to receive benefit from continued treatment wit h nivolumab. Nivolumab 
treatment should be discontinued permanently upon confirmation of RANO-assessed progression 
but prolonged observation (eg, 3 months) may be required, as su ggested in Okada et al.40
[IP_ADDRESS] Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is cons idered an immuno-oncology agent 
in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs assoc iated with immuno oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxici ty. Management Algorithms have  been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
The above algorithms are found in Appendix 1 and in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Nivolumab-Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infus ion or hypers ensitivit y reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headach e, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like  reactions. All Grade [ADDRESS_902314] udy medical monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criter ia. Infusion reactions should b e graded according to NCI CTCAE

•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are r ecommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_902315] 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusion inter ruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophy lactic medications indicated for ≤24 
hours):•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution o f symptoms. Corticosteroid 
and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appro priate. If the infusion is 
interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, th e rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symp toms recur, then no further BMS-
936558 will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol [ADDRESS_902316] 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up t o 25 mg of Sol uCortef or equivalent) may be  used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prol onged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_52202]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi [INVESTIGATOR_317399] (eg, renal impairment,

Temozolomide (TMZ) will be dosed at 75 mg/m2once per day continuously throughout RT,  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 42 days and with a maximum of 49 days. See Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 for dose modifications  
during concomitant RT + TMZ dosing. After completion of RT, ther e will be a 4-week break.  
Subjects will receive 6 cycles of temozolomide daily x 5 days e very 28 days.

0 150 mg/m2/day Dose during Cycle 1
1 200 mg/m2/day Dose during C2-6 in absence of TMZ-related toxicity
Source: adapted from Temodar ®package insert (PI)
In the first maintenance cycle TMZ is given at a dose of 150 mg /m2, and then increased to  
200 mg/m2in cycle 2 as follo ws: If, during the first cycle, all non-hema tologic AEs observed were 
grade ≤2 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting) and with platelets ≥100 x 109/L and ANC ≥1.5 
x109/L, then the temozolomide dose should be escalated to dose leve l 1 and this dose should be
used as the starting dose for subsequent cycles. Doses of TMZ ar e not precise but are adjusted  
based on tolerance; rounding of up to 10% is entirely acceptable.  
If treatment after cycle 1 has to be delayed because of ongoing non-hematologic AEs of grade ≥2, 
then no escalation is possible. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, then the dose should not be  
escalated in further cycles based on AEs (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]-2 ). If there was a prior dose reduction 
during the concomitant period with  RT, then dose -1 should be t he starting dose for subsequent  
cycles. Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 describes dose levels during temozolomide m onotherapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria to Start Temozolomide Maintenance Cycles 
Maintenance treatment begins f ollowing a 4 week treatment break  after RT. TMZ treatment may  
begin if blood count (obtained within the pri or 3 days) shows ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet c ount 
≥100 x 109/L and any Grade ≥3 non-hematologic AE (except alopecia) must have resolved to  
grade≤1). If AEs persist, treatment should be delayed by 1 week for up  to 4 consecutive weeks.

5.4.1 Suspected Progression
In order to distinguish potential tr eatment eff ects (or “pseudoprogression”) from progressive 
disease and thus to minimize premature discontinuation of nivol umab or temozolomide, subjects  
who initially meet radiologic criteria for disease progression,  but are tolerating study drug, may
continue receiving study drug until confirmation of progression  with an MRI performed  
approximately 8 weeks later. If possible, MRI perfusion images s hould also be obtained. If a  
determination cannot be made after an 8 week interval, then tre atment may continue until either  
progression is confirmed or regression is observed, consistent w ith either pseudoprogression or  
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Nov-[ADDRESS_902338] be confirmed by  
[CONTACT_215328] 8 weeks after the initial radio logical assessment of progression.  
Prior to 12 weeks after RT, progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if the re is 
new enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high -dose region or 80% isodose line)  
or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopat hologic sampling.39Note: in the  
absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progressi on, clinical decline alone is not  
sufficient for definition of progressive disease. If the follow-up assessment confirms that progression has occur red, the date of progression will  
be the date at which progression was first determined. If the follow-up assessment does not confirm  
progression, then the original time point response will be asse ssed as SD.

5.6.1 Tumor Samples
Tumor specimens will be obtained  from consenting subjects prior  to treatment to characterize  
immune cell populations and expression of selected tumor marker s. Tumor tissue (block or slides)  
must be available for submission prior to randomization. If a bl ock is not available, a minimum of  
twenty (20) unstained slides of good quality is required. In si tuations where on-treatment biopsies 
or surgeries are performed, tumor sample should be sent for cen tral pathology reading.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor sample collection details
Collection of tumor tissue at diagnostic surgery is required for  study eligibility. If clinically  
appropriate, additional biopsies obtained at any time, eg, if p rogression is suspected, may also be  
collected. 
Biopsy samples from ne urosurgical resections should be fixed in 10% Neutral-buffered formalin  
for 24 – [ADDRESS_902339] es should not be shipped in  
formalin as the temperature and length of fixation cannot be co ntrolled during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
In order to provide adequ ate tissue for MGMT testing and explorat ory analyses, two paraffin 
blocks are requested (1 minimum). If only slides are available,  they should be unstained, have a
recommended tissue section thickness is [ADDRESS_902340] be p ositively charge d. Slides should  
be shipped refrigerated at 2-8 °C.
An assessment of tissue quality by a pathologist is strongly en couraged at the time of the  
procedure. The tumor tissue that is obtained will be divided in  the following priority order: 1) into  
formalin for fixation and paraffin-embedding, 2) into RNALater for RNA/DNA extraction.Sample shipments should include a completed requisition form co ntaining co llection d ate, 
collection method, primary/met, site, fixation conditions, and a copy of Pathology report, if
available.

Testing will be performed using a centralized RT-PCR assay. Det ails regarding MGMT testing are 
provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
 
 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Characterization of T cell repertoire
As described a bove, DNA sequenci ng may be pe rformed on pre-and post-treatment tum or tissue 
to assess the composition of the T cell repertoire. DNA will be  isolated from either the FFPE tumor 
block or from RNAlater or equivalent preparations.

analyzed for thei r ability to bind the MHC I and MHC II protein s using prediction al gorithms, such 
as NetMHC. Evaluating the ability of tumor mutations to bind MHC  molecules will provide 
evidence that these mutations are serving as antigens that are recognized by [CONTACT_667955].

A Data Monitoring Committee w ill be established to  provide oversight of safety and eff icacy 
evaluation of the entire study and to provide advice to the spo nsor regarding actions the committee 
deems necessary for the continuing protection of subjects. The DMC will be charged with 
assessing such actions in light of an acceptable benefit/risk p rofile for nivolumab. The DMC will 
act in an advisory capacity to BMS and w ill monitor s ubject safety and evaluate the available 
efficacy data for the study. The oncology therapeutic area of B MS has primary responsibility for 
design and conduct of the study. The DMC will meet at least eve ry 6 months or more frequently 
as needed on an ad-hoc basis. Information regarding DMC membership, responsibilities, and 
procedures are detailed in the DMC charter. The DMC will be inf ormed should a safety signal 
emerge and may convene an ad-hoc meeting on its own initiative. The DMC will review all 
available data (safety and efficacy) at each meeting. At the co nclusion of each DMC meeting, the 
committee will provide the sponsor with a recommendation to con tinue, modify, or terminate the 
study protocol ba sed upon their review. Ultimately, decisions r egarding the study protocol will be

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open label, multicenter study of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ 
in adult ( ≥18 years) subjects with newly diagnosed GBM subjects with unmeth ylated MGMT 
tumors.
Primary objective of the st udy is to compare the OS of RT+ nivolumab versus RT+TMZ in subje cts 
with newly diagnosed GBM subjects with unmethylated MGMT tumors after surgery.The sample size for this study is based on the following assump tions:
1) OS follows exponential distribution
2) Median OS in RT + TM Z arm is 13.0 months (Weller 2009
34)
3) Hazard ratio (HR) of arm RT + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ is 0.72, tr anslated to median OS 
improvement of 5.0 months (13.0 months vs 18.0 months for arm RT + TMZ and arm RT +
nivolumab, respectively)
At least 390 events (ie, death) provides 90% power to detect a h azard ration (HR) of 0.72 with an 
overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided). This translates to an observed HR of 0.82 (median OS of 
13.0 vs 15.8 months ) or less resulting in a statist ically signif icant improvement.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is OS. OS is  defined as the time between th e date of randomization and the  
date of death due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known alive  
date. OS will be followed continuously while subjects are on st udy drug and every 3 months ( ±14 
days) via in-person or phone contact [CONTACT_667958]-up phase of the study.

8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The first secondary objective (comparing PFS between arm RT + nivolumab and RT + TMZ) will 
be measured by [CONTACT_667959]. PFS is defined as the time from rando mization t o the date of 
the first documented tumor progression or death due to any caus e. Subjects who die without a 
reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. Subjects who did 
not have disease progression or die will be censored at the dat e of last tumor assessment. Subjects 
who did not have any on study tumor assessment and did not die will be censored at the 
randomization d ate. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy wi thout a prior 
reported progression will be censored at the last tumor assessm ent prior to initiation of the 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy . Subjects who had surgical resect ion post start of study treatment
will be censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to initi ation of surgical resection. PFS will 
be determined by [CONTACT_667960] (Section 5.4.3 ). 
The secondary objective (estimate the overall survival r ate at 24 months (OS[24]) of RT + 
nivolumab) will be Kaplan-Meier probability of survival at 24 m onths. 
The secondary objective is OS and PFS assessed in the TMB-high p opulation, as assessed in the 
TMB assay where the numerical cut-off for high versus low will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Definition for OS and PFS for this endpoin t will be the s ame as defined 
earlier.

8.4 Analyses
8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics w ill be summarized for  all ra ndomized subjects by 
[CONTACT_1570], as randomized, using descriptive statistics.
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
The analyses of primary (OS) and secondary (PFS, OS[24]) endpoints wi ll be based on all 
randomized sub jects. Safety summaries will be b ased on all treated subjects . If superiority in OS 
is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing approach for  the secondary endpoint of PFS will 
be used to preserve a familywise type I error rate at 0.05. 
The formal statistical testing for PFS w ill take place onl y if OS is s tatistically significant.
Secondary  endpoints of OS [24] and OS and PFS in  the TMB-high population w ill be estimated 
using the Kaplan Meier method.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Primary Endpoint
The distribution of OS in all randomized subjects will be compar ed in arms RT + nivolumab and 
RT + TMZ at the final analysis via a two-sided, log-rank test, st ratified by [CONTACT_667961].  The Kaplan-Meir produ ct limit met hod w ill be used to es timate the 
survival curve in each arm inc luding medians and its 95% CI, OS rates at pre-specified time points.
The HR and the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs will be estimate d in a Cox proportional hazards 
model with treatment arm as a s ingle covariate stratified by [CONTACT_667962] 
(complete or partial surgical resection at baseline).
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Secondary Endpoints
The comparison of PFS will be based on a two-sided log-rank tes t stratified by [CONTACT_667963] (complete surgical or partial resection at  baseline). The details of the testing 
procedure will be specified in the SAP. OS[24] will be estimated  when all censored subjects have 
had follow-up of at least 24 months. OS and PFS in the TMB-high  population will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional details for the analy sis of OS [24] e ndpoint w ill be 
included in SAP.

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual life style of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly or less effective contraception’s must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.

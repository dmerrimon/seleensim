ABSTRACT 
Brentuximab vedotin (previously known as SGN35; currently marketed under the brand name [CONTACT_541087]) is 
an antibody-drug conjugate containing an anti-CD30 murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody 
(cAC10; brentuximab) linked to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE; vedotin). After binding CD30, a 
transmembrane receptor highly expressed in both Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL), brentuximab vedotin is internalized and MMAE is released into the cytoplasm where 
it causes M-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Brentuximab vedotin has been evaluated in adults, at the 
MTD of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks. The observed complete response ( CR) rate was 34% among patients 
with HL (95% CI, 25-45%) and 53% (95% CI: 40-67%) among patients with ALCL. The most common 
treatment related toxicity was peripheral sensory neuropathy (44%). Based partly on these results, the FDA 
has approved brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of patients with refractory HL or ALCL.  
 
This COG trial will study brentuximab vedotin in the context of a novel combination regimen, with 
gemcitabine, for pediatric patients with high-risk relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. The primary 
objectives of this study are to define the appropriate dose of brentuximab vedotin when given in 
combination with gemcitabine, to describe the toxicity associated with this regimen, and to determine the 
CR rate among patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with this combination. Exploratory objectives 
include describing the proportion of patients able to mobilize stem cells after treatment with this regimen 
and describing the relationship between disease response and changes in serum TARC and miRNA profiles. 
 
Part A  will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory HL in a phase 1 dose finding study of brentuximab 
vedotin in combination with gemcitabine. Gemcitabine will be administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day 
cycle at a fixed dose. Brentuximab vedotin will be investigated at a starting dose of 1.4 mg/kg administered 
on day 1 and escalated if tolerated. As of amendment 4, Part A was completed. 
 
Part B  will evaluate the response rate in patients with HL to the combination of gemcitabine and 
brentuximab vedotin at the dose defined in Part A.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS) 
 
1.1 Primary Aims 
 
1.1.1 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 
dose of  brentuximab vedotin in combination with gemcitabine administered every 
three weeks to children with relapsed or primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL). 
 
1.1.2 To define and describe the toxicities of b rentuximab vedotin in combination with 
gemcitabine administered on this schedule. 
 
1.1.3 To determine the CR rate after treatment with four cycles of gemcitabine with 
brentuximab vedotin among patients with relapsed or refractory HL. 
 
 
1.2 Secondary/Exploratory Aims 
 
1.2.1 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in 
combination with gemcitabine within the confines of a Phase 1 study. 
 
1.2.2 To describe the overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of therapy among 
patients with relapsed or refractory HL. 
 
1.2.3 To describe the proportion of patients with HL able to mobilize an adequate yield 
of CD34+ stem cells after gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin. 
 
1.2.4 To describe the relationship between disease response among patients with HL and 
changes in TARC during treatment, and to determine if specific miRNA profiles 
correlate with response to treatment. 
 
1.2.5 To describe the frequency of the FcγRIIIa-158 V/F polymorphism among patients 
who experience pulmonary toxicity on this protocol. 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Introduction : Relapsed/Refractory HL. 
A minority of patients with advanced stage HL will fail to achieve a CR with first-line 
t
herapy, and as many as 30% of those who initially respond will subsequently relapse. 
Multiple second-line chemotherapy regimens have be en associated with high overall 
response rates for patients with refractory or relapsed HL, and have been the subject of 
recent reviews.1,2 Some patients with low-risk relapses (limited-stage initial disease and 
late relapse more than one year after completion of therapy) may be cured with 
conventional chemotherapy alone. For those patients with primary refractory disease or

10 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
higher risk relapse (early relapse; advanced stage disease), long-term disease-free survival 
remains relatively low.  
High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) appears to significantly 
improve outcome relative to treatment with standard-dose chemotherapy alone for patients 
with refractory disease or high-risk relapses. However, lack of a CR after reinductio n 
therapy, indicated by [CONTACT_541039], portends an increased risk of 
relapse after ASCR.3-6 Therefore, it is critically important to identify a retrieval regimen 
that will maximize the CR rate for patients with relapsed or refractory HL prior to ASCR. 
 
Patients with second or subsequent relapse, or recurrence after ASCR, will be excluded 
from this Phase I/II trial due to the concern that this more heavily treated patient population 
will be at an increased risk of hematologic toxicity from this experimental regimen. 
 
2.2 Gemcitabine/Vinorelbine 
The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 
combination chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/Vinorelbine (GV) for pediatric patients with 
relapsed/refractory HL (76% overall response rate by [CONTACT_541040]; 45% CR by [CONTACT_541041]).7,8 Successful mobilization of stem cells for subsequent autologous transplantation 
has also been demonstrated following this regimen.9 The COG HL Committee is interested 
in further developi[INVESTIGATOR_541021] (1) as a backbone for testing novel retrieval strategies and (2) for 
incorporation within therapeutic protocols for patients with newly diagnosed HL. 
Compared to alternative intensification and retrieval regimens, this combination offers the 
advantage of avoiding the addition of agents that are associated with late treatment 
sequelae, such as anthracyclines or alkylators. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_705312] through a mechanism similar to vinorelbine. However, a greater overall response 
rate has been described after treatment with brentuximab vedotin (76%, with 34% CRs) 
than has been reported for vinorelbine (50%, with few CRs).10-12 The clinical study of the 
combination of gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin is further supported by [CONTACT_541042]30 targeting will sensitize lymphoma cells to gemcitabine.13,14 
 
2.4 Preclinical Studies with brentuximab vedotin 
Brentuximab vedotin (previously known as SGN35) is an antibody-drug conjugate 
containing an anti-CD30 murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (cAC10; 
brentuximab) covalently linked to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE; vedotin) by [CONTACT_541043]-cleavable peptide linker. CD30 is a transmembrane receptor highly expressed in 
both HL and ALCL. After binding to CD30, brentuximab vedotin is internalized and is 
transported to lysosomes, where the peptide linker is selectively cleaved, releasing MMAE 
into the cytoplasm. Like vinorelbine, MMAE exerts its antineoplastic effect through 
inhibition of tubulin polymerization, leading to M-phase arrest and apoptosis. 
 
2.5 Adult Studies of brentuximab vedotin 
The safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin has been evaluated in adults with HL or 
ALCL, using the MTD of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks. Treatment related toxicity included 
peripheral sensory neuropathies (44%), fatigue (42%), nausea (41%), diarrhea (34%), 
pyrexia (31%), neutropenia (21%) and vomiting (20%). Among 102 patients with HL, the 
observed ORR was 76% (95% CI 65-83%), with a CR rate of 34% (95% CI 25-45%).15 
The median time to objective response was 5.7 weeks (range, 5.1 to 56 weeks), and the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
11 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
median time to CR was 12 weeks (range, 5.1 to 56 weeks). Among the 102 patients 
enrolled, the median number of cycles on this study was 9 (range, 1 to 16 cycles), the mean 
number of cycles was 10. 
 
Following the recommended intravenous (IV) dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks, maximum 
concentrations were typi[INVESTIGATOR_41959]. A multi-exponential decline 
in brentuximab vedotin serum concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of 
approximately 4 to 6 days. Exposures were approximately dose proportional. After 
multiple-dose administration of brentuximab vedotin, steady-state was achieved by 21 
days, consistent with the terminal half-life estimate. Minimal to no accumulation was 
observed with multiple doses at the q3wk (every 3 weeks) schedule.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Brentuximab vedotin is being investigated for use in earlier lines of therapy for adults with 
HL. Ongoing studies include a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating 
brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of HL patients at high risk for relapse after 
autologous stem cell transplant (SCT), a phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of retreatment with brentuximab vedotin, a phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of brentuximab vedotin in patients with CD30-positive NHL, a phase 2 study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in patients with CD30-positive non-
lymphomatous malignancies, a phase 1 study evaluating the safety of brentuximab vedotin 
in combination with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) or AVD 
(doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) for patients with newly-diagnosed HL, and a phase 
[ADDRESS_705313] been no pediatric-specific trials of brentuximab vedotin. Nine patients on the 
early phase trials of brentuximab vedotin were less than 18 years old (5 HL, 4 ALCL; age 
range 12-17 years).[ADDRESS_705314]. All nine patients were 
treated with brentuximab vedotin as a single agent on either phase I or phase 2 trials, given 
either weekly (0.8-1.2 mg/kg/dose from between 6-9 doses) or every three weeks (1.2 – 
1.8 mg/kg/dose for 6-26 cycles). S ix of these were treated with 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 
for a median of 15 cycles.16

2.7 Pulmonary Toxicity 
 
2.7.1 Pulmonary toxicity due to gemcitabine is rare  
When gemcitabine is administered alone, severe pulmonary toxicity is rare 
(~1%).17 Gemcitabine induces pulmonary toxicity at greater frequency only when 
combined with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541022], such as bleomycin.18 
No cases of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema were observed among pediatric 
patients treated with gemcitabine and vinorelbine on AHOD0321.8 
 
2.7.2 Pulmonary toxicity after gemcitabine with SGN30  
It is possible that the combination of gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin will 
be associated with unacceptable pulmonary toxicity. Grade 3-5 pneumonitis was 
observed among five adults (aged 36-62) out of 23 treated with the unconjugated 
anti-CD30 antibody (SGN30), in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.19 Of note, all five patients with pulmonary 
toxicity had a V/F polymorphism in the FcγRIIIa gene (p = 0.008). 
 
Nevertheless, clinical data suggest that pulmonary toxicity may be less frequent 
among pediatric lymphoma patients treated with the combination of gemcitabine 
and brentuximab vedotin. The dose of the unconjugated anti-CD30 antibody 
(SGN30) that was associated with pulmonary toxicity (12 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 
of each 21-day cycle, a total of 24 mg/kg/cycle) was significantly higher than the 
phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg/cycle, given every 3 weeks). No 
clinically meaningful pulmonary toxicity signal has been associated with 
brentuximab vedotin monotherapy at this dose.15,20  
 
2.7.3 Pulmonary toxicity from brentuximab vedotin in combination with bleomycin. 
Severe pulmonary toxicity has been described in 10 of 25 patients treated with 
brentuximab vedotin in combination with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, 
and dacarbazine (ABVD).21 Patients presented with cough and dyspnea. Interstitial 
infiltration and/or inflammation were observed on plain films and/or computed 
tomography of the chest. Five patients had a maximum severity ≥ Grade 3 (3 with 
Grade 3 and 2 with Grade 4). Most patients responded favorably to corticosteroid 
therapy. In contrast, no further pulmonary toxicity was observed among patients 
treated with brentuximab vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine 
(AVD),22 suggesting that brentuximab vedotin can be successfully combined with 
chemotherapy agents not frequently associated with pulmonary toxicity. 
 
2.8 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
In January 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to health 
care professionals noting that three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) have been described among patients treated with brentuximab vedotin, including 
two diagnosed with PML after the FDA approval of brentuximab vedotin for patients with 
relapsed/refractory lymphoma. A mechanism by [CONTACT_541044]. Due to the serious nature of PML, a new Boxed Warning highlighting this 
risk has been added to the drug label. The FDA recommends that healthcare professionals 
suspend brentuximab vedotin dosing if PML is suspected, and discontinue the drug therapy 
if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.

Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_705315] is an objective with 
greater clinical relevance than maximizing ORR. 
 
2.10 Background for Exploratory Correlative Studies 
  
2.10.1 TARC as a biomarker for response among patients with HL 
Hodgkin’s Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_541023] a background of 
reactive inflammatory cells, consisting of a dense infiltrate of T cells, histiocytes, 
eosinophils, and plasma cells. These inflammatory cells support the HRS cells by 
[CONTACT_541045]-survival factors. HRS cells 
appear to attract these cells to the microenvironment by [CONTACT_541046] 2 helper T 
chemokines and cytokines, such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine 
(TARC, or CCL17).23 Serum levels of TARC correlate with disease activity in 
patients with HL.24-26 Recent data from University Medical Center Groningen, 
(n=60) showed that using plasma TARC, response to chemotherapy can be 
assessed after one cycle of chemotherapy in both early and advanced stage HL 
patients.27 In this study, plasma will be collected from patients prior to the start of 
therapy and at the end of each cycle to determine if TARC can provide an early 
measure of disease response in pediatric HL. 
 
2.10.2 Prognostic value of circulating miRNA  
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene 
expression via post-transcriptional suppression of mRNA translation. Recently, it 
has been shown that tumor cells release miRNAs into the circulation where they 
can be detected in serum or plasma.[ADDRESS_705316], ovarian and colorectal cancer and even in other diseases states such 
as acute myocardial infarction.29 Previous work has identified differential 
expression of 38 circulating miRNAs (including miR-9, miR-19a and miR-20a) in 
adult HL patients compared to tissue derived from reactive lymph nodes,30 and 30 
miRNAs in microdissected HRS cells compared to CD77+ progenitor cells.31 
miRNAs appear to regulate several growth pathways involved with H/RS cell 
proliferation, including p21 and NF- κB.32,33 We propose to explore the significance 
of circulating miRNA in pediatric HL patients by [CONTACT_541047]. 
 
2.10.3 FcγRIIIa-158 receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
The FcγRIIIa receptor 158 valine (V) allotype displays a higher affinity for human 
immunoglobulin G1 and increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC).34 As described above ( section 2.7 .2) this polymorphism was present in 
five of five patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 pulmonary toxicity after 
treatment with SGN30 in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.19 To determine if there is a similar association 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
14 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
between FcγRIIIa (V/F) heterozygosity and pulmonary toxicity after treatment 
with gemcitabine plus brentuximab vedotin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
will be banked for retrospective analysis. If pulmonary toxicity is observed during 
this trial, analysis of this SNP will be performed on all patients with available 
sample.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_705317] two cycles, patients with CR are allowed the option of going off protocol 
therapy for stem cell transplantation (See Section 8.4 ). Patients with PD will be removed 
from protocol therapy. All other patients will continue on therapy to cycles three and four. 
 
After every subsequent response evaluation (i.e. after cycle 4, and every subsequent even-
numbered cycle), patients without PD have the option of either continuing treatment or 
going off protocol therapy for alternative treatment, such as stem cell transplantation. 
Therapy may otherwise continue for up to a total of 16 cycles (approximately 12 months 
from study enrollment). 
 
2.12 Amendment Expanding Enrollment at Dose Level 2 (August 2013) 
As of August 2013, [ADDRESS_705318] been treated on AHOD1221: three at dose level 1 and 
six at dose level 2. None of the patients treated at dose level 1 experienced dose limiting 
toxicity. Two patients treated at dose level 2 experienced non-hematologic dose limiting 
toxicity. One patient presented to the emergency room with suspected sepsis and was found 
to be hypotensive, requiring medical management (Grade 3 hypotension). This patient was 
subsequently demonstrated to have pre-existing, steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency , 
which likely contributed to the hypotension. The other patient developed asymptomatic 
Grade [ADDRESS_705319] treatment cycle, which decreased 
to eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_2006] 21 of the cycle. Both patients had resolution of all toxicity, 
and continued on study treatment with dose reduction as prescribed by [CONTACT_990]. We 
therefore plan to accrue an additional six patients at dose level 2 to further evaluate toxicity. 
 
 
2.13 Amendment Opening Phase 2 (Part B) 
Six patients enrolled in the dose level 2 expansion cohort. None of these six patients 
experienced a non-hematologic dose limiting toxicity (DLT). One of these was found to be 
ineligible for evaluation of hematologic DLT, because filgrastim was administered during 
the first cycle of therapy in preparation for stem cell harvesting. None of the five remaining 
patients experienced a hematologic DLT.  
 
After Amendment 3, criteria were defined for the evaluation of the dose level 2 expansion 
cohort (See Section 11.4 ). Per this section, dose level 2 is determined to be the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
15 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), because the number of DLTs in this expansion cohort 
did not exceed one. Phase 1 (Part A) can close and the protocol can proceed to Phase 2 
(Part B). Patients treated on the Phase 1 component at dose level 2 will be included in 
analysis of response for Part B provided that they are eligible and evaluable for response.

4.0 PATIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01). All clinical and laboratory data required for 
determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available in the patient’s 
medical or research record which will serve as the source document for verification at the 
time of audit. 
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within [ADDRESS_705328] be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy. Laboratory tests need not be 
repeated if therapy starts within seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility. If a post-
enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are older than [ADDRESS_705329] be re-checked within 48 hours prior to 
initiating therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine. If the 
recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not receive protocol therapy and 
will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging studies must be obtained within 14 days 
prior to start of protocol therapy (repeat the tumor imaging if necessary).  
 
 
Clarification in timing when counting days: As an example, please note that if the patient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the protocol requires waiting at least 7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.

5.3 Dose Escalation Schema  
 
PART A: Per amendment 4, Part A was completed.  
Phase 1 dose-finding study (Phase 1 Consortium plus limited institutions) 
 
5.3.1 Inter-Patient Escalation for Brentuximab vedotin  
Per amendment 4, Part A was completed . 
The starting dose will be 1.4 mg/kg with dose levels for subsequent groups of 
patients as follows. 
 
Dose Level  Brentuximab vedotin  
Dose (mg/kg)  Maximum Dose  of 
Brentuximab vedotin  
  1* 1.4 140 mg  
2 1.8 180 mg  
*starting dose level 
 
There will be no escalations beyond dose level 2 (1.8 mg/kg). 
 
5.3.2 Intra-Patient Escalation Per amendment 4, Part A was completed.  
 
Part A : Patients treated at dose level 1 (1.4 mg/kg) who have not experienced DLT 
in any cycle of therapy, and who do not have a CR after two cycles of therapy are 
allowed to escalate to dose level 2 (1.8 mg/kg) for all subsequent cycles. At the 
discretion of the treating physician, they may also continue treatment at dose level 
1. 
 
Part B: No intra-patient escalation of phase in the phase 2 portion of the study as 
patients will be treated at the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose as established 
in Part A. 
 
PART B: Phase 2 component of the study (COG Groupwide) 
 
5.3.3 Patients on Part B of the study will be receive brentuximab vedotin at 
1.8 mg/kg/day (the recommended phase 2 dose as determined in Part A). 
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events 
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any suspected or confirmed 
dose-limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair. 
 
Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)   
D
LT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to protocol therapy. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose-
escalation will be the first cycle of therapy. 
 
Dose limiting hematological and non-hematological toxicities are defined differently.

­ Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting of < 3 days duration 
­ Grade 3 or 4 fever < 5 days duration 
­ Grade 3 infection < 5 days duration 
­ Grade 3 rash < 5 days duration 
­ Grade 3 pruritis < 5 days duration 
­ Grade 3 fatigue < 5 days duration 
­ Grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory abnormalities that resolve within

Note: Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will not 
be considered a dose-limiting toxicity. 
 
5.4.2 Hematological Dose Limiting Toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological dose limiting toxicity is defined as: 
 
In patients evaluable for hematologic toxicity (See Section 4.1.7 .1): 
Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that does not resolve to an 
ANC of ≥ 500/ L and platelets ≥ 20,000/ L within 7 days after the next 
scheduled dose of brentuximab vedotin.

(Grade 4 neutropenia that does not resolve to an ANC of ≥ 500/mL within 7 days 
of the next scheduled dose of brentuximab vedotin) should receive the same dose 
of brentuximab vedotin in the next cycle with myeloid growth factor support. Each 
subsequent course of brentuximab vedotin with gemcitabine, after the first, should 
begin no sooner than Day 21 of the preceding course, and should not begin unless 
the ANC is ≥ 750/mL. GCSF may be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily 
beginning on day 9, and continuing for a minimum of [ADDRESS_705349]-
nadir neutrophil count increases to ≥ 1,500/mL. Note that higher doses of GCSF 
(10-16 micrograms/kg/day) are recommended for use during cycles (post cycle 2 
or higher) when stem cell collection is being attempted (See Section 8.4.3 ). The 
use of Neulasta is not allowed. 
 
If neutropenia meeting the definition for DLT in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  recurs after 
myeloid growth factor is added, then the patient should be given a reduced dose of 
brentuximab vedotin for subsequent cycles, 1.2 mg/kg, maximum dose 120 mg. If 
neutropenia recurs in a patient that has received a dose level reduction but has not 
received myeloid growth factor, then myeloid growth factor should be 
administered or the patient should be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.1.2 Patients who experience thrombocytopenia meeting the definition for DLT in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  after dose reduction or neutropenia meeting the definition for DLT 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  after addition of myeloid growth factor and one dose reduction, 
must be removed from protocol therapy.

6.2.4 Dose modifications for infusion reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis, were uncommon 
(approximately 12%) in adult studies with brentuximab vedotin. Infusion 
interruption for IRR treatment generally led to the successful completion of the 
dose and continued treatment with brentuximab vedotin with or without IRR 
prophylaxis, according to the clinical judgment of the investigator. Although the 
experience with IRRs related to brentuximab vedotin is limited, in part due to the 
low incidence observed to date, data support brentuximab vedotin administration 
by [CONTACT_541054].   
If IRR symptoms develop, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate 
medical management instituted. The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after 
symptom resolution. Premedication with diphenhydramine should be administered 
for subsequent infusions in patients who have experienced a prior IRR. Dosing of 
diphenhydramine can be according to institutional standards, or 1 mg/kg PO  or IV 
(
maximum of 50 mg). If anaphylaxis occurs, brentuximab vedotin should be 
immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate medical management 
instituted. 
 
Suggested dose modification for infusional reactions to brentuximab vedotin 
Therapy modifications for patients who develop infusional reactions to 
brentuximab vedotin should be:

6.2.6 Dose modifications for pulmonary toxicity 
Pulmonary toxicity requiring modification of therapy will occur for dyspnea ≥ 
Grade 3, hypoxia ≥ Grade 3 and ≥ Grade 3 pneumonitis that is attributable to the 
treatment regimen. Dose modifications will also be considered for Grade 2 
pneumonitis (See below). Factors to consider in assessing the attribution include 
the presence of left atrial hypertension, congestive heart failure, infection, 
metabolic abnormalities, or cancer related causes (e.g. malignant pericarditis). 
Upon occurrence of pulmonary toxicity, as defined above, study therapy 
should be held, and the Study Chair and Research Coordinator should be 
notified within [ADDRESS_705355] appropriate dosing or duration of 
treatment. Administration of 100 mg of oral or intravenous prednisolone in single

Version Date: 11/18/2015 
daily or two divided doses has been reported to improve symptoms in adults with 
pulmonary toxicity secondary to gemcitabine.46 The suggested dose for patients on 
AHOD1221 who develop pulmonary toxicity is methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV 
every 12 hours for a minimum of seven days. 
 
Patients who develop pulmonary toxicity, Grade ≥ 3, attributed to the treatment 
regimen will be taken off protocol therapy. Patients who develop Grade 2 
pneumonitis that resolves to Grade ≤ 1 may be retreated with the study regimen, 
after discussion with the Study Chair. CTEP will be notified within 7 days of study 
chair notification of each instance of pulmonary toxicity. The Study Chair will 
consult with CTEP, the study statistician, and DVL leadership (Part A : As of 
amendment 4, Part A was completed ) or Hodgkin committee leadership (Part B) 
to review the history of the affected patient and the pulmonary toxicity for the trial 
as a whole before proceeding with the recommendation to resume protocol therapy 
at a lower dose. Failure to discuss a case of pulmonary toxicity will lead to 
suspension of accrual. 
 
6.2.7 Dose modifications for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating 
disease of the brain that is caused by [CONTACT_204896] (JCV). It typi[INVESTIGATOR_541026]. Presenting features 
may include altered mental status, motor deficits such as hemiparesis or ataxia, 
visual disturbances, or higher cortical dysfunction such as dysphasia or agnosia. 
Seizures have also been reported in PML patients (approximately 20%). Cognitive 
decline without accompanying deficits in motor or sensory function is uncommon. 
Optic nerve involvement, fever, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_541027]. In addition, peripheral neuropathy, which has been reported with 
brentuximab vedotin treatment, is not commonly reported with PML. 
 
If PML is suspected, a diagnostic work-up should be performed. The work-up may 
include, but is not limited to the following: 
Neurologic examinations and neurology consultation, as warranted 
Brain MRI. Features suggestive of PML include presence of unifocal or 
multifocal lesions, mainly of the white matter, which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_257316]-
enhancing and do not have mass effect. 
PCR analysis. JCV DNA, detectable in CSF or in a brain biopsy, is suggestive 
of PML. 
 
Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be held if PML is suspected. If PML is confirmed, 
brentuximab vedotin should be permanently discontinued.

7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy 
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, 
immunomodulating agents (with the exception of corticosteroids) or biologic therapy may 
NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these treatments are administered 
the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents 
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study. 
 
7.3 Supportive Care 
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary , with the exception that corticosteroids should 
not be used as antiemetics . For general Supportive Care Guidelines see

Version Date: 11/18/2015 
7.5 Concomitant Medications 
No other cancer chemotherapy or immunomodulating agents can be used.   
Corticosteroid therapy is permissible as supportive care, with the exception that 
corticosteroids should not be used as antiemetics. Examples of indications for 
corticosteroid use include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Treatment or prophylaxis for anaphylactic reactions or for treatment of pulmonary 
toxicity (See Section 6.2 ).  
Clinical sepsis and signs of severe septic shock, if relative adrenal insufficiency is 
suspected.  
Diffuse rash or pruritis (may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_90541]) 
Asthma exacerbation. 
 
NSAIDs should be used with caution, due to one reported occurrence of Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome (SJS) noted in a patient utilizing brentuximab vedotin and a short course of an 
NSAID. The cause of SJS is unknown. 
 
Patients should be monitored for potential drug-interaction when administered drugs 
known to be a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer with SGN-35. See Appendix VIII  for a 
list of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.

8.3.2 Central Review of Imaging Studies (Parts A and B): As of amendment 4, Part 
A was completed. The below information is for Part B.  
Central review of images will be performed to validate data reporting for quality 
assurance. Real time FDG-PET central review can be requested on a case- by-case 
basis for clarification or adjudication of conflicting institutional imaging studies 
which may be helpful for clinical assessment (See Section 12.2 ). 
 
The following imaging studies and corresponding radiology reports should be 
submitted to IROC Rhode Island (QARC) at the following time points: 
 
 Pre-study Neck/Chest/Abdomen/pelvis CT; FDG-PET scan 
 Post cycle 2 Neck/Chest/Abdomen/pelvis CT FDG-PET scan 
 Post cycle 4 Neck/Chest/Abdomen/pelvis CT; FDG-PET scan 
 Neck/Chest/Abdomen/pelvis CT; FDG-PET scan at progression (if 
different from the time points above). 
 
Submission of Diagnostic Imaging data in digital format is required. Digital files 
must be in DICOM format. These files can be submitted via sFTP. Information for 
obtaining an sFTP account and submission instructions can be found at 
www.QARC.org . Follow the link labeled digital data. Alternatively, if sFTP is not 
feasible, the imaging may be burned to a CD and mailed to IROC RI (QARC) at 
the address below. Multiple studies for the same patient may be submitted on one 
CD; however, please submit only one patient per CD. Sites using Dicommunicator 
may submit imaging via that application. Contact [CONTACT_389924] (QARC) with questions 
or for additional information. 
 
For FDG-PET imaging, the transferred imaging data should include uncorrected 
and attenuation-corrected PET projection data, as well as the reconstructed PET or 
PET/CT images used by [CONTACT_6759] a response assessment. If low 
dose CT was used for attenuation correction, the acquired CT images should also 
be submitted. The imaging data submitted for central review must allow the study 
to be reconstructed and displayed in transaxial, sagittal and coronal formats using 
standard reconstruction techniques. Reconstructed MPEG clips and similar types 
of reconstructions will not be accepted. CT and MRI images similarly should be 
submitted in a format that either includes properly reconstructed multi-planar 
viewing formats in soft tissue and bone windows, or includes the thin-section axial 
acquisition data from which multi-planar reconstructions can be re-created.

8.4 Mobilization and Collection of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells 
 
8.4.1 Description of Studies 
One of the secondary aims of this study (See Section 1.2.3 ) is to document the 
proportion of patients able to mobilize sufficient stem cells after treatment wit h 
gemcitabine and brentuximab. This is a clinically relevant question because most 
patients eligible for this study will eventually go on to high-dose chemo with stem 
cell rescue. However, it is not yet proven that stem cells can be collected from 
patients treated with this regimen. 
 
Autologous peripheral blood stem cells will be collected from consenting patients 
(both Parts A and B) after any cycle of therapy. Patients who had bone marrow 
involvement at the time of study enrollment must undergo repeat bone marrow 
biopsies (at least two sites) prior to stem cell collection. Stem cells will not be 
collected until the bone marrow biopsies are negative for disease involvement. 
Stem cells may be collected following ANY cycle of therapy, subsequent to the 
demonstration of negative bone marrow biopsies and at least [ADDRESS_705360] operating procedures should be used for the collection 
procedure. The following sections present suggested guidelines. See also 
Appendix IV . 
 
8.4.2 Catheter Use 
PBSC may be collected using a large bore double lumen central venous catheter 
that will allow the flow rates required for apheresis. Depending on institutional 
practices, an appropriate double-lumen leukapheresis-grade catheter may be 
placed prior to cycle 1 and used for medication administration, intravenous fluids, 
and transfusions, in addition to the apheresis procedure. Alternatively, a temporary 
peripherally inserted central leukapheresis-grade catheter can be placed prior to 
peripheral blood stem cell collection and removed following completion of the 
leukapheresis. 
 
8.4.3 Stem cell mobilization with chemotherapy and G-CSF 
During the mobilization cycle, treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) should be started one day after the second dose of gemcitabine (i.e. 
on day 9). G-CSF should be administered daily, subcutaneously (preferred) or 
intravenously, at a dose of 10-16 micrograms/kg/day, and continuing until 
completion of PBSC collection. It is critical that G-CSF be given daily until PBSC 
collection is complete. If the WBC is > 60,000, decrease G-CSF dose to 5 
micrograms/kg/day. The PBSC collection should be t imed with the neutrophil rise. 
Institutions which time collections using circulating CD34 cell counts will 
generally begin when the CD34+ count is > 10 cells/µL. These guidelines are 
summarized in the table below. The use of Neulasta is not allowed.

8.5.[ADDRESS_705361] DNA to 
examine FcRIIIγ polymorphisms in the event of brentuximab pulmonary toxicity. 
We hypothesize that TARC expression will correlate with reduction in tumor 
volume and may be a surrogate marker for early PET response. We also 
hypothesize that specific miRNA profiles will correlate with response to therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thymus and Activation-Related Chemokine ( TARC )

9.0 DRUG  INFORMATION 
 
Please see Appendix IX  for known drug interactions associated with the drugs used in this 
study. 
 
9.1 Brentuximab vedotin 
(SGN35, AdcetrisTM, NSC#749710, IND# 117117)    (11/9/2015) 
 
9.1.1 Structure and molecular weight  
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
consisting of three components: the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for 
human CD30, the microtubule disrupting agent MMAE, and a protease-cleavable 
linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. Approximately 4 molecules of 
MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Brentuximab vedotin is produced 
by [CONTACT_541057]. The 
antibody is produced by [CONTACT_541058] (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small 
molecule components are produced by [CONTACT_293852]. Brentuximab vedotin 
has an approximate molecular weight of 153 kDa. 
 
9.1.2 Supplied by: 
[CONTACT_95695], Inc. and the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis 
(DCTD), NCI. 
 
9.1.3 Formulation 
The agent is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white preservative-free lyophilized 
cake or powder in individually-boxed single-use vials containing 50 mg 
brentuximab vedotin per vial. 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
43 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
9.1.4 Storage 
Store vial dry under refrigeration at 2-8°C (36-46°F) in the original carton to 
protect from light until reconstitution and use. 
 
9.1.5 Solution Preparation 
Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing 
solutions. 
 
Please note that the dose for patients weighing greater than 100 kg should be 
calculated based on a weight of 100 kg. 
Preparation consists of 2 steps: dilution of the stock solution and dilution of the final 
solution. 
Step 1 : Make a 5 mg/mL concentration . Use vials from the same Lot number for 
each dose . 
1. Reconstitute the 50 mg lyophilized powder SGN-35 with 10.5 mL Sterile 
Water for Injection, USP. Final concentration is 5 mg/mL (Note: total 
volume is 11 mL). 
2. Swirl the vial gently. Do not shake. 
3. Let the reconstituted vial settle for one minute to eliminate bubbles. The 
reconstituted solution should be colorless, clear to slightly opalescent and 
should NOT have visible particulates. 
4. Store the reconstituted vial under refrigeration (2° – 8° C) and protect from 
light if not used immediately. Discard after 8 hours. 
Step 2 : Further dilute the IV solution . 
1. Withdraw the calculated amount of drug from the 5 mg/mL reconstituted vial 
in step 1. 
2. Inject the required amount of drug into 0.9% NS, Lactated Ringer’s Solution, 
USP, or dextrose 5% in Water (D5W), USP to a final concentration between 
0.4 – 1.8 mg/mL .  
3. SGN-35 solution is compatible in polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl 
acetate (EVA), polyolefin, or polyethylene. 
4. Do not shake. Gently invert the syringe or bag to mix. 
5. The prepared syringe or IV bag is to be stored at refrigeration (2° – 8° C) and 
must be used within [ADDRESS_705363] reconstitution (or sooner per 
institutional practice for agents without a preservative). Protect the prepared 
IV solution from direct sunlight if not used immediately. 
6. Prior to administration, inspect the syringe or IV bag for discoloration or 
floating particulates. Do not use the IV solution if the solution is discolored 
or/and have particulates. 
 
9.1.6 Stability :  
The stability testing of the intact vials is ongoing. Reconstituted agent must be 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
44 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
diluted and administered within 24 hours. 
CAUTION: The single-use lyophilized dosage form contains no antibacterial 
preservatives. Therefore, the reconstituted product (from Step 1) should be 
discarded within 8 hours after initial entry/puncture. 
 
9.1.7 Administration 
Infuse the prepared IV solution over 30 minutes. Do not mix with other medications. 
Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Do not use an in-line filter for the IV 
administration. The syringe or IV bag does NOT need light protection during the IV 
administration. 
Potential drug interaction : In vitro data indicates that the active metabolite of 
SGN-35, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a substrate and an inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 but is neither a sensitive substrate nor a strong inhibitor/inducer of 
CYP3A4. However, patients should be monitored for potential drug-interaction when 
administered drugs known to be a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor/inducer with SGN-35. 
In vitro, MMAE is a substrate of P-gp transporter and is not an inhibitor of P- gp. See 
A
ppendix VII  for a list of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors. 
Patient Care Implications : 
New signs and symptoms of CNS system abnormalities may indicate 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
Tumor lysis syndrome, particularly in patients with highly proliferative 
tumors or high tumor burden prior to treatment. 
Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Refer to 
protocol for the management of infusion-related reactions. 
Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as tingling or numbness 
of the hands, feet, or any muscles weakness. 
Steven-Johnson syndrome 
High fever (≥ 100.5 ° F) or other signs of potential infection.

never previously associated with either agent. 
 
 
9.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained.) The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP supplied investigational agents. The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF). If there 
are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP supplied investigational 
agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_243607].

9.5 Gemcitabine 
2’-deoxy-2’,2’ difluorocytidine monohydrochloride, LY18801,Gemzar®) NSC #613327  
 
9.5.1 Source and Pharmacology 
Gemcitabine  exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA 
synthesis (S-phase) and also blocking the progression of cells through the G1/S-
phase boundary. Gemcitabine  is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_541059] (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. 
Gemcitabine  diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for 
catalyzing the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA 
synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_14192] a reduction 
in the concentrations of deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. Gemcitabine 
triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the 
intracellular concentration of dCTP (by [CONTACT_14193]) enhances the 
incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA. After the gemcitabine 
nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the 
growing DNA strands. After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA 
synthesis. DNA polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the gemcitabine nucleotide 
and repair the growing DNA strands. In CEM T lymphoblastoid cells, gemcitabine 
induces internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, one of the characteristics of 
programmed cell death. Gemcitabine  pharmacokinetics are linear and are described 
by a 2-compartment model. Gemcitabine half-life for short infusions (< 70 minutes) 
ranged from 42 to 94 minutes, and the value for long infusions varied from 245 to 
638 minutes, depending on age and gender, reflecting a greatly increased volume of 
distribution with longer infusions. The lower clearance in women and the elderly 
results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose. The volume of 
distribution was increased with infusion length. Volume of distribution of 
gemcitabine was 50 L/m2 following infusions lasting < 70 minutes, indicating that 
g
emcitabine, after short infusions, is not extensively distributed into tissues. For long 
infusions, the volume of distribution rose to 370 L/m2, reflecting slow equilibration 
of gemcitabine within the tissue compartment. The maximum plasma concentrations 
of 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) (inactive metabolite) were achieved 
up to 30 minutes after discontinuation of the infusions and the metabolite is excreted 
in urine without undergoing further biotransformation. Over one week, 92% to 98% 
of a gemcitabine dose is excreted in urine. Unchanged drug constitutes only a small

49 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
portion of urinary excretion (about 5%), the remainder being dFdU. The metabolite 
did not accumulate with weekly dosing, but its elimination is dependent on renal 
excretion, and could accumulate with decreased renal function. 
 
9.5.2 Formulation and Stability 
Gemcitabine is available as a 200 mg white, lyophilized powder in a 10 mL size 
sterile single use vial and a 1 000 mg white, lyophilized powder in a 50 mL size sterile 
s
ingle use vial. Store at controlled room temperature (20°-25°C, 68°-77°F). 
Excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F). 
 
9.5.3 Guidelines for Administration 
See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol. 
 
To reconstitute, add 5 mL of NS to the 200 mg vial or 25 mL of NS to the 1000 m g 
vial. Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each yield a gemcitabine  concentration of 
38 mg/mL which includes the accounting for the displacement volume of the 
l
yophilized powder. The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 mL or 
26.3 mL, respectively. Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 
200 mg or 1 000 mg of gemcitabine , respectively. The appropriate amount of drug 
m
ay be administered as prepared or further diluted with NS to concentrations as low 
as 0.1 mg/mL. Gemcitabine solutions are stable for 24 hours at controlled room 
t
emperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Solutions of reconstituted gemcitabine should 
not be refrigerated, as crystallization may occur. After reconstitution with NS, the 
pH of the resulting solution lies in the range of 2.7-3.[ADDRESS_705367] shown that cellular accumulation of the active 
metabolite of gemcitabine is saturated at plasma concentrations above 10 to 20 
μM36,37, a concentration that is exceeded when gemcitabine is infused faster than 6 
to 10 mg/m2/min.37,38 Accumulation of higher intracellular dFdCTP concentrations, 
which may result in an enhanced antineoplastic activity, cannot be achieved by 
[CONTACT_541060], but only by [CONTACT_541061]. Prolonged infusions are well-
tolerated39-44 and may provide increased clinical benefit over bolus administration. 
Gemcitabine should therefore be infused over 100 minutes for this study.45

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration 
 
Part A: Phase 1 dose-finding component  
As of amendment 4, Part A was completed.  
 
Part B: Phase 2 component 
This study includes Part A (Phase 1) and Part B (Phase 2). During Part A, two dose levels 
of brentuximab vedotin were tested: 1.4 mg/kg (dose level 1) and 1.8 mg/kg (dose level 2). 
Initially, three evaluable patients were enrolled on dose level 1 and six on dose level 2. 
Since amendment #2, an expansion cohort of [ADDRESS_705371] been enrolled onto dose level 
2 using the revised definitions for dose-limiting toxicity. This cohort was evaluated 
separately from the six patients initially enrolled at dose level 2 for the purpose of 
determination of the MTD. None of these six patients experienced a non-hematologic dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT). One of these was found to be ineligible for evaluation of 
hematologic DLT, because filgrastim was administered during the first cycle of therapy in 
preparation for stem cell harvesting. None of the five remaining patients experienced a 
hematologic DLT. Per Section 11.4 , dose level 2 is determined to be the recommended 
phase 2 dose, because the number of DLTs in this expansion cohort did not exceed one.  
 
Patients treated on the Phase 1 component at dose level 2 will be included in analysis of 
response for Part B provided that they are eligible and evaluable for response. Part B will 
accrue up to 41 patients evaluable for the primary response endpoint. Considering a 15% 
rate for ineligible/invaluable patients, Part B may enroll a maximum of [ADDRESS_705372]-relapse 
(AHOD00P1 and AHOD0521) was 27-30 patients per year excluding the initial 6 months 
delay for IRB approvals. Part B will be conducted COG group- wide. Given that certain 
relapsed patients with favorable prognosis will be excluded from participation on the study, 
we estimate it would take about 2 .5-3 years to complete accrual for Part B (up to 41 
response evaluable patients).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_705373] 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and had the appropriate 
toxicity monitoring studies performed are also considered evaluable for Adverse 
Effects. Patients who are not evaluable for Adverse Effects at a given dose level 
during Cycle [ADDRESS_705374] of patients 
experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy. In the event that 
two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse 
Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
53 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
patients will be considered if all of the following conditions are met:  
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose-related 
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible 
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable 
 
Expansion will proceed according to the rules of the 3+3 design ( Section 11.3 ): 
Three additional patients will be studied. If none of the initial three additional 
patients experiences DLT, the dose will be escalated.* If one of the initial three 
additional patients experiences DLT, expansion to a total of 12 patients will 
continue. If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose-
limiting toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.* 
 
*If the expansion occurs in the last dose level, the recommended phase 2 dose 
has been defined and Part A will be closed. 
 
11.3 Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD (Part A)  
As of amendment 4, Part A was completed. 
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_705375] dose level. 
 
11.3.2  If none of these three patients experience DLT, then the dose is escalated to the 
next higher level in the three subsequent patients. 
 
11.3.3  If one of three patients experiences DLT at the current dose, then up to three more 
patients are accrued at the same level. 
 
a)  If none of these three additional patients experience DLT, then the dose is 
escalated in subsequent patients. If there are no further dose escalations, then 
the RP2D has been confirmed. 
 
b)  If one or more of these three additional patients experiences DLT, then patient 
entry at that dose level is stopped. (See Section 11.2.2  for exception to rule). 
Up to three more patients are treated at the next lower dose (unless six patient s 
have already been treated at that prior dose). 
 
11.3.4 If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose 
level, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped (see 
Section 11.2.2  for exception to rule). Up to three more patients are treated at the 
next lower dose (unless six patients have already been treated at that prior dose). 
The highest dose with less than two DLTs out of six evaluable patients will be the 
estimated MTD. 
 
11.3.5 Using this dose escalation scheme, the probability of escalating to the next dose 
level, based on the true rate of DLT at the current dose, is given by [CONTACT_541062]: 
 
 True Adverse Effects at a Given Dose  
 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 
Probability of 
Escalating  .91 .71 .49 .31 .17 .08 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
54 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
Thus, if the true underlying proportion of toxic events is 30% at the current dose, 
there is a 49% chance of escalating to the next dose. 
In addition to determination of the MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities 
will be reported. 
 
11.4 Evaluation of Expansion Cohort at Dose Level 2 Using Revised DLT Definitions 
(Amendment #2) 
 
11.4.1  Three additional patients are studied at Dose Level 2.  
 
11.4.2  If none or one of these three patients experience DLT, then up to three more 
patients are accrued at the same level. 
 
11.4.3  If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at Dose Level 2, 
then the MTD has been exceeded, and the study will be closed to accrual (See 
Section 11.2.2  for exception to rule). 
 
11.4.5 If ≤ one patient out of six experiences DLT, the MTD/RP2D has been defined. 
Part A will be closed and the study will continue to Part B. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_705376] disease evaluations performed as 
indicated in Section 8.1 . Disease response will be assessed according to the evaluation 
criteria in Section 12.0 , and will be reported descriptively. 
 
All these analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature. 
 
11.6 Study Design for Part B 
The primary aim for the Phase 2 component is to evaluate the CR rate among HL patients 
treated with 4 cycles of gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin. In the adult Phase I and II 
trials, Brentuximab vedotin alone had an estimated CR by [CONTACT_541063] 34% in HL patients. 
Six of 9 pediatric patients included in these trials achieved CR (2/5 HL and 4/4 ALCL ).16 
In the prior COG study on the combination of Gemcitabine/Vinorelbine (AHOD0321), CR 
by [CONTACT_541064] 6/25 (24%) evaluable patients at the end of treatment, and CR by 
[CONTACT_541065] 6/13 patients (46%) after [ADDRESS_705377] 
to achieve a CR rate of about 60% after 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin among HL 
patients, and will consider the study unsuccessful if the data suggests a CR rate that is 
significantly lower than 60% (such as 40%). The study adopts a Simon 2-stage MinMax 
rule: reject this combination and terminate the study if [ADDRESS_705378] this combination if 20 or fewer CR are observed in a 
total of 41 evaluable patients. Type I error and type II error are both 0.1; in other words, 
this rule will reject gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin 10% of the time when the true 
CR rate is 60%, and 90% of the time when the true CR rate is 40%. The expected sample 
size is 33.8 if the true CR rate is 40% and is 40.7 if the true CR rate is 60%. 
 
Patients treated on the Phase 1 component, at dose level 2 (1.8 mg/kg) for brentuximab 
vedotin used in the Phase 2 component, will be included in Part B provided that they are 
eligible and evaluable for response (See Section 11.8 ). Enrollment will be stopped after 
Stage 1 to evaluate response for Stage 1 enrollments, and will only reopen to Stage 2 when

Version Date: 11/18/2015 
sufficient responses for Stage 1 are observed. However, if sufficient responses for Stage 1 
are observed prior to reaching Stage 1 accrual target, enrollment will not be stopped after 
Stage 1 and will proceed directly to Stage 2.  
 
The two stage design for Part B is illustrated below: 
 
 Cumulative Number 
of Responses  Decision  
Stage 1: Enter 28 evaluable  
patients  Up to 11  Terminate the trial because the 
agent is ineffective.  
12 or more  Proceed to Stage 2 . 
Stage 2: Enter 13  additional  
evaluable  patients  Up to 20  Terminate the trial because the 
agent is ineffective.  
21 or more  Terminate the trial because the 
agent is effective.  
 
11.7 Methods of Analysis for Part B 
All patients treated on the phase 1 component, at dose level 2 (1.8 mg/kg) of brentuximab 
vedotin used in the Phase 2 component, will be included in the analyses provided they are 
eligible and evaluable for the particular endpoint (response, toxicity, etc. ). CR and ORR 
after [ADDRESS_705379] 1 dose of gemcitabine or brentuximab vedotin will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_541066]. The proportion of patients who were able to 
mobilize sufficient stem cells after treatment with gemcitabine/brentuximab vedotin will 
be estimated. Plasma level of TARC will be considered a continuous variable, and be 
summarized by [CONTACT_541067], standard deviation, median, 
and range. Plasma level of TARC after each cycle or the change in level of TARC from 
baseline will be compared between patients with CR vs. < CR by [CONTACT_1192]-sample t-test or two-
sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. Specific miRNA levels in serum will also be considered 
continuous variables and summarized by [CONTACT_208257]. The association 
between response and miRNA profile will be explored by [CONTACT_541068]. < CR by 2-sample tests such as 2-
sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Among patients who experience any pulmonary 
toxicity, the frequency of the FcγRIIIa-158 V/F polymorphism will be described. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_705380] PD. Primary 
endpoint for Part B is CR by [CONTACT_541069] 4 cycles. 
Complete responders are those who achieve CR any time during/after [ADDRESS_705381] 4 cycles. A 
response of CR or PD prior to 4 cycles will be considered to be carried on as the 4-cycle 
response. Evaluable patients are those with disease evaluation after 4 cycles (including 
those do not actually complete [ADDRESS_705382] a carried-over response of CR/PD), and 
those who complete at least [ADDRESS_705383] disease evaluation after 2 cycles. In other 
words, a patient who had a response of non-CR/PD after cycle 2 but somehow did not 
complete 4 cycles per protocol and went off protocol prior to cycle 4 without a CR/PD will 
be considered evaluable and included in the analysis as non-CR.

Version Date: 11/18/2015 
In addition, all patients treated on Part A, at the dose selected for use in Part B (1.8 mg/kg), 
will be included in the final evaluation of response, provided they meet all eligibility 
criteria for Part B and are evaluable for response, as defined above. 
 
Primary endpoint/analyses will be based on central review of response which will not be 
performed real time; treatment/clinical decisions will be based on institution assessment of 
response. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_705384] 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin or gemcitabine 
will be evaluable for toxicity and included in the toxicity tables and summaries. In addition, 
all patients treated on Part A, at the dose selected for use in Part B (1.8 mg/kg), will be 
included in the final toxicity summaries, provided they meet all eligibility criteria for Part 
B and are evaluable for toxicity, as defined above. 
 
Monitoring for Excessive Pulmonary Toxic ity during Part B. The incidence of brentuximab 
vedotin-related pulmonary toxicity will be monitored in all patients treated with at least 
one dose of gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin at the Phase 2 dose level (1.8 mg/kg) 
of brentuximab vedotin on either Phase [ADDRESS_705385] one dose of the combination; the maximum 
number of patients for the analysis, which is the maximum number of patients on the study 
that can be treated at the final dose of brentuximab vedotin combining Phase 1 and 2, is 
likely 60 patients (up to 48 patients from Phase 2 plus 12 patients from Phase 1 per 
Amendment #2, unless the Phase 1 component at the final dose expands to 12 additional 
(total 18) patients according to Section 11.2.2  per Amendment #2 or there are Phase 1 
patients at the final dose level who received one dose of combination but were not 
evaluable for DLT). Pulmonary toxicity will be defined by [CONTACT_27926] ≥ Grade 3, hypoxia ≥ 
Grade 3 or pneumonitis ≥ Grade 2. There must be no evidence of other etiologies, including 
left atrial hypertension, congestive heart failure, infection, metabolic abnormalities, or 
cancer related causes (e.g. malignant pericarditis). A Bayesian rule is adopted for this 
monitoring. The prior distribution for the rate of pulmonary toxicity p is a Beta distribution 
with parameters α=1 and β=19. This Beta distribution for the rate of pulmonary toxicity p 
has a mean of 5%; the support for p ≤ 10% is 86%. If given the observed data at interim 
monitoring, the posterior probability of p ≥ 5% is 0.[ADDRESS_705386] 2 years and once every year thereafter. Operationally, it will require, for example, ≥ 
2/6, ≥ 3/20, ≥ 5/41, ≥ 5/54, or ≥ 6/[ADDRESS_705387] 4 patients with pulmonary 
toxicities at the end with 41-54 patients or 5 patients with pulmonary toxicities with 55-60 
patients. With a sample size of n=45, if the true rate of toxicity is 5%, 10%, or 15% 
respectively, the chance of observing 5 or more patients with pulmonary toxicities are 7%, 
47%, and 83% respectively.

of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one hand and 
the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other. If 
differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, accrual 
may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those differences 
more fully. 
 
11.11 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates 
Per Amendment #2, the Phase 1 part of the study may accrue a maximum of 24 patients. The 
Phase 2 part of the study may accrue a maximum of 48 patients. The maximum enrollment 
for the study is therefore 72 patients.  
 
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_705389] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). 
 
12.[ADDRESS_705390] the recent work of the International Lymphoma Working Group’s 
revised recommendations for malignant lymphoma.47,48.  
 
Establishing strict CT size criteria for presumptive lymphomatous nodal enlargement is 
complicated by a number of factors, including substantial size overlap between benign 
reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and malignant lymphadenopathy, interobserver 
measurement variability, obliquity of node orientation to the scan plane, multiplicity of 
criteria for size measurement (volumetric vs. bidimensional vs. unidimensional; short axis 
vs. long axis), variability of normal nodal size with body region and age. For children and 
younger adolescents, there are no established size limits for normal lymph nodes. 
Furthermore, in children reactive hyperplasia is common in the cervical, axillary, 
mesenteric, and inguinal regions, and may be associated with nodes up to 1.5-[ADDRESS_705391] lymphomatous involvement, such as contiguous nodal 
clustering or matting, and nodal FDG avidity.  
 
With these caveats in mind, the nodal size criterion used by [CONTACT_541070]. Bulk disease will continue 
to be defined as a contiguous extramediastinal  nodal aggregate that measures > [ADDRESS_705392] transverse diameter (transaxial measurement), a mediastinal mass where the tumor 
diameter is > 1/3 the maximal thoracic diameter, and/or macroscopic splenic nodules. For 
visceral organs (such as liver, spleen, kidney) any focal mass lesion large enough to 
characterize is considered due to lymphomatous involvement unless the imaging 
characteristics indicate an alternative nature (e.g., cyst, hemangioma, abscess, etc.). 
Lesions too small to characterize are considered indeterminate unless follow-up studies 
allow characterization or tissue sampling is performed.  
 
Measurable disease indicates the presence of at least one measurable lesion. Superficial 
lesions (e.g., palpable lymphadenopathy) may be measurable by [CONTACT_461]. A 
measurable lesion by [CONTACT_541071] a lesion that can be accurately measured in [ADDRESS_705393] 1 cm diameter. 
Lymph nodes are considered abnormal if the long axis is  1.5 cm, regardless of the short 
axi
s. Lymph nodes with a long axis measuring between 1.1-1.5 cm are only considered 
abnormal if their short axis is  1.[ADDRESS_705394]. All measurable 
lesions, up to a maximum of 6 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, will 
be measured as target lesions at baseline and followed for response. Target lesions will be 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
59 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
selected on the basis of size (i.e., largest lesions) and suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements by [CONTACT_541072]. Lesions will be recorded with size expressed 
as the [COMPANY_003] (product of perpendicular diameters). The [COMPANY_003] is obtained by [CONTACT_541073], and serves as a surrogate measurement of tumor volume, assuming the mass has 
a sp
herical or ellipsoid shape. The S[COMPANY_003], or sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters, is obtained by [CONTACT_541074]. 
 
Non-measurable assessable lesions include permeative bone lesions, malignant ascites, 
malignant pleural/pericardial effusions, pulmonary or cutaneous lymphangitic spread, and 
lesions too small to accurately measure in [ADDRESS_705395] of FDG PET imaging issues listed in Section 15  should be adhered 
to as much as possible in this clinical trial to allow for the uniformity of inter- and intra-
patient FDG PET imaging and analysis needed for this study. 
 
On FDG-PET imaging, the level of tumor uptake is assessed subjectively by [CONTACT_137459], in concordance with the International Working Group criteria.47,48. Semi-
quantitative assessment of response by [CONTACT_541075] 
(SUV) is not utilized in this study. However, SUV measurements will be available for all 
PET scans and can be incorporated into reports as per routine clinical practice. 
 
Part B:  Central review of all imaging studies will take place at regular intervals, but not 
on a real-time schedule. Real time FDG-PET central review can be requested on a case-
by-case basis for clarification or adjudication of conflicting institutional imaging studies 
which may be helpful for clinical assessment. Central review will include a visual 
qualitative assessment of tumor FDG PET positive or negative uptake based on the five-
point Deauville scale 49 relative uptake to normal organ FDG activity (1 - no activity above 
surrounding background, 2 ≤ mediastinal blood pool, 3 ≤ liver and > mediastinal blood 
pool, 4 - moderately increased above liver, 5 – markedly increased compared to liver). 
Investigational imaging studies also incorporating semi-quantitative PET tumor SUV-
based assessments will also be performed. 
 
12.2.1 Lymph Nodes or Nodal Masses: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG-PET negative is defined as: 
a. For moderately sized or large residual masses (≥ [ADDRESS_705396]) regardless of their location, mild and 
diffusely increased FDG uptake with intensity lower than or equal 
to that of mediastinal blood pool structures (i.e. Deauville scale 1 
or 2) should be considered negative. When possible use the 
ascending aorta or aortic arch for reference mediastinal blood 
pool. 
b. For smaller residual masses or normal sized lymph nodes (< [ADDRESS_705397]), any FDG uptake less than 
that of surrounding background activity.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
60 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG-PET positive is defined as: 
a. For moderately sized or large residual masses (≥ [ADDRESS_705398]) regardless of their location, mild and 
diffusely increased FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of 
mediastinal blood pool structures (i.e. Deauville scale 3, 4, or 5) 
should be considered positive. When possible use the ascending 
aorta or aortic arch for reference mediastinal blood pool. 
b. For smaller residual masses or normal sized lymph nodes (< [ADDRESS_705399]), any FDG uptake more than 
that of surrounding background activity. 
 
12.2.2 Lung Nodules: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG-PET positive is defined as: 
a. For new lung nodules that are ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_705400], FDG uptake exceeding that of mediastinal blood 
pool structures (i.e. Deauville scale 3, 4, or 5) should be 
considered positive. When possible use the ascending aorta or 
aortic arch for reference mediastinal blood pool. 
b. For new lung nodules < 1.[ADDRESS_705401], due to partial volume averaging effects, any uptake is 
considered positive. 
 
12.2.3 Hepatic and Splenic Lesions: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG-PET positive is defined as: 
a. For hepatic or splenic lesions ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_705402], FDG uptake greater 
t
han or equal to that of normal liver or spleen parenchyma(i.e. 
Deauville scale 4, or 5), respectively, should be considered 
positive. 
b. For hepatic of splenic lesions < 1.[ADDRESS_705403], FDG uptake greater 
t
han that of normal liver or spleen parenchyma (i.e. Deauville 
scale 4, or 5), respectively, should be considered positive. 
c. In the absence of focal splenic involvement at diagnosis, diffusely 
increased splenic FDG uptake greater than normal liver 
parenchymal FDG uptake but in the absence of focal lesions seen 
on CT will not be considered for FDG-PET response assessment. 
This is a modification of the IWG criteria as data regarding the 
threshold and significance of this finding is still limited in the 
published literature and potentially complicated by G-CSF effects. 
To balance the competing needs of maintaining time intensity of 
chemotherapy cycles and minimizing the G-CSF effects on FDG-
PET interpretation, the FDG-PET scan should be obtained at the 
specified time points (See Section 8.1 ).

61 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
12.2.4 Bone Marrow FDG Uptake: 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG-PET positive is defined as: 
a. Focal or multifocal FDG uptake in bone marrow. Diffusely 
increased bone marrow FDG uptake, regardless of level of uptake 
– including more intense than liver, is not considered positive. A 
negative bone marrow FDG-PET does not exclude bone marrow 
involvement or preclude a bone marrow biopsy assessment. 
 
12.3 Response Criteria 
Note:  In the instance where there is widespread intense diffuse bone marrow uptake 
secondary to recent G-CSF administration (or other circumstance where the FDG bio-
distribution is abnormal such as brown adipose tissue uptake) the FDG PET studies may 
not be of sufficient quality to adequately assess for response to therapy. In those 
circumstances CT criteria only should be used to assess for response to therapy. See Table 
12.3 below for additional clarification of response criteria definitions.  
12.3.1 Complete Response (CR): 
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and 
disease-related symptoms if present before therapy.  
2. For patients with bone marrow involvement pre-treatment, negative bone 
marrow biopsies from at least two sites.  
3. HL is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid. Pre-treatment PET scans are required. At sites 
where the PET scan was positive before therapy, a  post-treatment residual 
mass of any size is permitted as long as it is  PET negative. 
4. The spleen should be normal in size and shape; and pre-therapy nodules should 
have resolved. If the spleen was originally a site of involvement, there should 
be no persistent/residual focal FDG uptake in the spleen. (For assessment of 
diffuse spleen FDG uptake refer to comments on Hepatic and Splenic Lesions 
in Section 12.2.3 .) 
5. New FDG-PET positive lung nodules in patients without established 
pulmonary lymphoma at baseline prior to initiation of therapy and evidence of 
complete response at all previously known disease site should be considered 
negative for lymphoma regardless of size or uptake because these typi[INVESTIGATOR_541030]. 
 
12.3.2 Partial Response (PR) 
1. At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters 
(S[COMPANY_003]) of up to [ADDRESS_705404] 2 perpendicular dimensions; 
if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are involved.  
2. There should be no increase in the size of other lymph nodes. 
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by 50% in their S[COMPANY_003] or, for single 
nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
4. There should be no measurable disease involving other organs.  
5. No new sites of disease. 
6. At sites where the FDG-PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-
treatment PET is positive at one or more of the previously involved sites.

Version Date: 11/18/2015 
12.3.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectivel y 
documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
13.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner 
at scheduled times during a trial. (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in 
the data collection packet for this protocol). Additionally, certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 
 
13.2 Determination of reporting requirements 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event 
including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the 
prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; and 3) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_293830]. 
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label. Brentuximab vedotin (IND #117117) is the investigational agent in this 
study. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.

13.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner 
 
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_705405] access to a copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2:  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE. 
 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows: 
Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite. 
Note: This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_705406] dose of treatment 
and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be 
reported according to the instructions above. 
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those that 
have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. An 
adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, 
when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in the current 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), as listed in the 
drug information section of the protocol, or as posted as an update on the protocol 
page of the COG Member’s website.  
Step 5:  Review Table A in this section to determine if: 
there are any protocol-specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring; and/or 
there are any protocol-specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.

13.6 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events 
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data 
submission forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP-AERS reporting. 
 
13.6.1 If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported. 
 
13.6.[ADDRESS_705412] severe grade should be reported. 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
69 
Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_705413] (most severe) grade 
of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.6.4 The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the resolution 
date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade). If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing." 
 
13.6.[ADDRESS_705414] be reported 
each course it recurs.  
 
13.7 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681] 
 
13.7.1 Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP-AERS reporting (See  Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data 
form packet (See Section 14.1) . 
 
13.7.[ADDRESS_705415] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the 
FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry 
sponsored trials). 
 
13.7.[ADDRESS_705416] responsible for 
oversight of the patient. 
 
13.8 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS 
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients on NCI-sponsored trials following their chemotherapy for cancer must be 
reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) via CTEP-AERS and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm 
reporting requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet). Submit the 
completed CTEP-AERS report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring afte r 
treatment for cancer on NCI-sponsored trials.  
Note: The AML/MDS Secondary Reporting form is no longer available on the CTEP 
website. In lieu of this form, AML/MDS events are now to be reported via CTEP-AERS 
(in addition to your routine AE reporting mechanisms). In CTCAE v4.0, the event(s) may 
be reported as either:   
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy,  
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome, or  
3) Treatment-related secondary malignancy.  
Non-treatment related cases of AML/MDS for CTCAE v4.0 should be reported using 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) - Other, 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
70 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
specify.” 
To grade a non-life-threatening event for “Myelodysplastic syndrome”, use “Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) - Other, specify” where 
the specified term is MDS.  
Note:  If a patient has been enrolled in more than one NCI-sponsored study, the CTEP-
AERS report must be submitted for the most recent trial. 
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
 
13.9 Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal 
When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and faxed along with any 
additional medical information to ([PHONE_2124]. ( Appendix VII ). The potential risk of 
exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should be documented in the “Description 
of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report. 
 
13.9.1 Pregnancy 
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_705417] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AERS as 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (Pregnancy) 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC and 
reported as Grade 3. 
 
There is a possibility that the sperm of male patients treated on studies 
involving possible teratogenic agents may have been damaged. For this 
reason, pregnancy in partners of men on study should also be reported and 
followed as described in this section. 
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy 
Information Form” should be used for all follow-ups. If the baby [CONTACT_521474] a birth defect or other anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report is 
required 
 
13.9.2 Fetal Death 
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_293861]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after expulsion 
from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
 
 Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss)” under the 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.  
 
 A fetal death should NOT be reported as “Fetal death,” a Grade 5 event 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
71 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as 
currently CTEP-AERS recognizes this event as a patient death. 
 
13.9.3 Death Neonatal 
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life” that is felt by 
[CONTACT_128748]/intervention, should be reported expeditiously. 
 
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General 
disorders and administration- Other (neonatal loss)” under the General 
disorders and administration SOC. 
 
Neonatal death should NOT be reported as “Death neonatal” under the 
General disorders and administration SOC, a Grade 5 event. If reported as 
such, the CTEP-AERS interprets this as a death of the patient being 
treated. 
 
13.10  Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse 
events on the COG case report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP-
AERS reporting. 
 
Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form 
(CRF) within the study database. For this study, routine reporting will include all 
toxicities reported via CTEP-AERS and all Grade 4 and higher hematologic 
Adverse Events, all Grade 3-4 and higher non-hematologic Adverse Events, and 
all respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], peripheral neuropathy, and skin of any grade.

policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase [ADDRESS_705421] the interests of 
patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy 
scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 
6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC 
from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
74 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study 
statistician to prepare study reports for review by [CONTACT_6802]. The DSMC will 
provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the 
Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study 
unchanged. Data and Safety Committee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web 
site. 
 
14.4.2 Monitoring by [CONTACT_541077] A.  This is for Part A only. As of amendment 4, Part A was completed.  
The study chair will monitor the study regularly and enter evaluations of patients’ 
eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In 
addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_541078], Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly 
conference call. 
 
 
15.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, respon se assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
As of Dec 2009, only CT and MRI guidelines are posted on the COG website so the imaging 
representative on the study committee should be contact[CONTACT_541079]. The following COG website 
posted materials may be useful: 
 
CT and MRI guidelines are available on the COG Member site at: 
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/reference/RefMaterial/DiagnosticImagingGui
delines_MRI&CT.pdf  
 
For PET scan guidelines please refer to the NCI guidelines for the recommended set of procedures 
for the acquisition and analysis of 18F-FDG PET scans of patients participating in NCI-sponsored 
diagnostic and therapeutic clinical trials, which can be found at the following link: 
http://imaging.cancer.gov/reportsandpublications/publications/Clinical-Trials-Guidelines  
 
The following guidelines are recommendations but follow generally accepted standards for FDG 
PET or PET/CT imaging protocols, allowing for individual institutional variations. However, the 
following generally accepted FDG PET issues and items should be adhered to as much as possible 
in this clinical trial to allow for uniformity of inter- and intra-patient FDG PET imaging and analysis 
needed for this study: 
1) PET/CT, in place of stand-alone PET imaging, should be performed if at all 
possible for anatomical correlation, especially on the follow-up PET imaging. 
2) Patients should be fasted for at least 4 hours before [18F]FDG administration. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
75 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
3) After FDG injection, the patient is kept at rest in a warm room through imaging 
to minimize FDG uptake in activated brown adipose tissue or other physiologic 
FDG artifacts. 
4) PET imaging should begin at 60 ± 10 min after injection of [18F]FDG. 
5) For follow-up PET imaging of the same patient, all attempts should be made to 
image the patient on the same PET/CT scanner. 
6) Patient ’s measured height and weight on the day of the PET scan be recorded for 
each imaging session. 
7) The following PET parameters should be recorded for each imaging session: 
a. Patient’s weight and height 
b. [18F]FDG dose and time of administration 
c. Start time of PET imaging 
d. Serum glucose level (or verify that level is less than 200 mg/dL) 
8) DICOM PET/CT or PET images be available for transfer to COG for Phase II 
central review.50 
 
Please refer to the American College of Radiology (ACRIN) PET Core Laboratory Standard 
Operating Procedures, which is also adapted from the NCI consensus recommendation,50 at the 
following web link for more detailed information, unless otherwise specified below. 
(http://www.acrin.org/CORELABS/PETCORELABORATORY/PETSOPS/tabid/484/Default.aspx) 
 
15.1 Pregnancy 
All female patients ≥ [ADDRESS_705422] 4 hours before [18F]FDG administration. Total 
parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids containing glucose should also be discontinued 
for at least 4 hours before the study. The patient should be well hydrated (oral or 
intravenous fluid administration) before administration of FDG. Fluids administered for 
hydration should not contain glucose. 
 
It is suggested that the patient ’s measured height and weight on the day of the PET scan be 
recorded for each imaging session. 
 
If intravenous access is not already in place, this should be obtained, typi[INVESTIGATOR_541032], for patient hydration (if needed), determination of serum glucose and 
FDG administration. Good hydration is required as the primary route of FDG excretion is 
renal. The patient should drink water or receive intravenous fluids after injection to 
promote urinary FDG excretion. 
 
Venous serum blood glucose will be measured and recorded just prior to injection of the 
FDG and must be ≤ 200 mg/dL. Diabetic patients should be scheduled in the morning after 
an overnight fast before the first meal, and the dose of insulin should be titrated 
appropriately in consultation with the patient ’s referring physician to keep the serum 
glucose ≤ 200 mg/dL at the time of scheduled FDG injection. If the serum glucose is 
significantly elevated (> 200 mg/dL) then the test should be rescheduled if at all possible 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
76 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
with better glucose control or, if necessary, insulin can be used to achieve normoglycemia. 
After regular insulin the patient should wait 2-4 hours (with ultrashort acting glucose 1-2 
hours) prior to administration of FDG in order to minimize physiologic skeletal muscle and 
myocardial FDG uptake. 
 
In patients with tumors in the pelvis, placement of a Foley catheter is recommended. 
Patients in whom a Foley catheter is not placed should be asked to void immediately prior 
to imaging in order to minimize bladder activity and to reduce their radiation exposure. 
 
15.3 F DG Dosing and Injection 
[18F]FDG is administered intravenously at a dose of 0.140 to 0.200 mCi/kg with a minimum 
dose of 1.[ADDRESS_705423] in a warm room until imaging. After voiding the 
bladder, whole-body imaging should begin at 60 ± 10 min after injection of [18F]FDG. For 
serial scans of the same patient it is important to start the PET scan with the same delay 
time after injection of the FDG radiotracer. Therefore, it is recommended that all 
subsequent PET scans have approximately the same delay time (± 10 min) as the baseline 
scan. 
 
It is suggested that the net injected FDG dose and time of injection should be recorded. 
The peripheral IV or central line injection site location should also be recorded. 
 
15.4 P ET Scanning Protocol 
A whole body PET imaging protocol is utilized, covering the area from the base of skull/top 
of the ears to the proximal/ mid-thigh, just below the pubis. If there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_541033], skull, or skull contents, the volume that is imaged 
may be expanded. The patient will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with arms comfortably positioned 
above the head if at all possible (to limit attenuation of the thorax), or at the side of the 
patient if necessary. Scans should proceed upward from the pelvis to diminish the effects 
of accumulation of FDG activity in the bladder. 
 
Transmission scanning matching the areas covered by [CONTACT_541080]. This will be done after injection 
of FDG. If positron-emitting transmission sources are used, we recommend 2-3 minutes 
per bed position for segmented attenuation correction. With a dedicated NaI PET system, 
attenuation correction should be done with a Cs-137 source per manufacturer 
recommendations. With a combined PET/CT scanner, attenuation correction should be 
done with CT data per manufacturer recommendations. If the COG institution routinely 
adjusts the CT dose used for attenuation correction it can be adjusted to mA based on 
weight of patient using the following guidelines if at all possible to limit the CT radiation 
dose to the patient: 
 
0 to 100 lbs.  use 40 mA   201 to 300 lbs. use 120 mA 
101 to 150 lbs.  use 60 mA   301 to 400 lbs. use 160 mA 
151 to 200 lbs.  use 80 mA 
 
The 511 KeV-annihilation photons, produced by [CONTACT_541081], 
are imaged. Because of the short physical half-life of 1.8 hours and the high photon energy 
of 511 KeV, FDG imaging may follow bone or gallium scintigraphy, or a MUGA study on 
the same day (which use lower energy photons) or FDG imaging may be performed on the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
77 
Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_705424] 5 minutes per bed position for BGO, LSO, and 
GSO systems operated in the 2-D mode; at least 3 minutes per bed position for BGO, LSO, 
and GSO systems operated in the 3-D mode; and at least 6 minutes per bed position for 
NaI systems. Images will be corrected for scatter, random events, and dead-time losses 
using manufacturer's software. Bed positions should be overlapped to avoid large changes 
in sensitivity at the joints between the bed positions. 
 
It is suggested that the following acquisition parameters should be recorded: start time of 
emission scan  and type of transmission scan.  
 
It is recommended that PET images be reconstructed with and without attenuation 
correction. It is also recommended that for serial scans of the same patient, image 
reconstruction techniques and parameters be consistent across all scans, including filters 
and application of the attenuation map. 
 
15.[ADDRESS_705425] methods and tested for pyrogenicity and 
radiochemical purity on each production run, or purchased from nuclear pharmacies 
licensed to sell FDG. The radiochemical purity of the FDG should be > 90%. [18F]FDG 
should be produced in a GMP facility according to FDA required standard-operating-
procedures for clinical use. 
 
15.7 P ET Imaging Quality Control Standards 
FDG-PET imaging will be performed using "state- of-the-art" equipment (either a dedicated 
NaI, BGO, LSO or GSO full-ring PET system), which will have a field of view appropriate 
for body imaging (10 cm), high resolution (FWHM 6.0 mm), high sensitivity, and post-
injection transmission capability. 
 
Daily and monthly steps will be taken to assure quantitative accuracy of PET imaging 
studies and reliable imaging results at all performance sites. Daily quality assurance 
includes a simplified chi-square test to assure consistent performance of the PET scanner. 
The calculation provides a quantitative means of monitoring drift of the scanner electronics 
with time. A blank scan is also performed daily for later attenuation correction. Either of 
these measurements may be viewed routinely as an additional measure of performance. A 
liquid-filled or standardized sealed-source cylinder phantom is used monthly to validate 
the quantitative accuracy of the images against a dose calibrator. The dose calibrator is 
itself calibrated daily against standards for constancy and annually for accuracy using 
NIST-traceable standards. Each month, fine gain calibration of all detectors in the PET 
system will be performed, followed by [CONTACT_541082]. 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
78 
Version Date: 11/18/2015 
Transmission scans, each 2-3 minutes in duration for segmented attenuation correction, 
will be obtained with a rotating Ge-68/Ga-68 rod source emission scan (alternatively, 
attenuation measurement may be performed with a Cs-[ADDRESS_705426] data from a 
combined PET/CT scanner, in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations). An 
algorithm to correct for activity in the field of view should be used for processing of these 
post-injection transmission images, if provided by [CONTACT_55899]. Then the corresponding 
emission images can be obtained as appropriate (time per bed position for specific detector 
crystal type and acquisition mode detailed above in the PET Scanning Protocol section). 
Alternatively, the individual emission and transmission scans may be acquired in 
alternating fashion. The PET images will be reconstructed by [CONTACT_541083]-provided 
reconstruction algorithms, using either filtered back projection with a Hanning filter 
(frequency cutoff 0.[ADDRESS_705427] [Nq] = 0.3 cycle/pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]) or the manufacturer’s 
recommended iterative reconstruction algorithm with an appropriate filter.  
 
Segmentation of transmission images should be used for attenuation correction. Emission 
data will be corrected for randoms, dead-time and scatter using vendor-provided 
algorithms. Multiple-bed position studies must be corrected for radioactive decay. The 
emission images will be reconstructed both with and without attenuation correction.

APPENDIX IV : GUIDELINES FOR PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) 
COLLECTION PROCEDURE (AS OF AMENDMENT 4, PART A IS CLOSED. THIS IS ONLY 
FOR PART B.) 
 
Personnel  
PBSC should be collected by [CONTACT_541085]. The 
collection team should consist of at least one physician and two or more individuals experienced in the 
collection of apheresis components and in the management of apheresis donors. At least one person should 
be experienced in the management of children. The PBSC collections should be performed in a facility with 
a pediatric intensive care unit and adequate provision for the emergency care of children. 
 
Apheresis machine 
The Cobe Spectra or the Fenwal CS 3000+ is recommended because the continuous flow centrifugation 
devices are better tolerated in pediatric patients than discontinuous flow machines. Institutional SOPs for 
the apheresis procedure should be followed. 
 
Priming 
Priming of the machine prior to collection should be with ACD and saline according to manufacturer's 
directions. For patients less than 20-[ADDRESS_705431] possible time. Catheter size 
and/or tolerance of the citrate anticoagulant may be the rate-limiting factors in children. The following 
guidelines are the whole blood flow rates that can be expected to be achieved in children: 
< 2 years (< 15 kg) 20-30 ml/min 
2-5 yrs (15-20 kg) 30-40 ml/min 
>5 years (> 20 kg) 40-60 ml/min 
 
PBSC Collection Methodology 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_541035] 2-3x total blood volume (TBV) of 
donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. This volume will vary, however, and with extended large volume apheresis the cell 
collection can plateau and begin to decline. For optimum collection, twice TBV should be the minimum 
volume processed. Repeated leukaphereses should be performed daily for a maximum of [ADDRESS_705432] components to 
be infused following myeloablative therapy, 1-5 collections are generally required . L arge volume 
eukapheresis procedures are those in which the volume of whole blood processed per procedures is >4-5x 
TBV (>15L TBV). Protocol-specific collection goals may be met with a single collection procedure. 
 
Collection Goals 
The collection goal for autologous PBSC intended to rescue a patient following myeloablative therapy 
(total, all collections) is a minimum of 2 X 106 CD34+ cells/kg. It is suggested that the optimum collection 
goal should be 5 x106 CD34+ cells/kg, stored in at least 2 alliquots of cells, with 2-3 x106 CD34+ cells/kg 
stored as backup for delayed engraftment. 
  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . AHOD1221  
87 
Version Date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_705433] operation of the apheresis device. Care is required 
to ensure that the connections between the patient and the machine are not covered with blankets. Vital 
signs should be taken and recorded, and observations recorded periodically in compliance with institutional 
policy. 
 
Recommended laboratory tests should include of the following: 
Pre-apheresis: WBC, differential; hematocrit, platelet count, serum calcium. 
Post-apheresis: Hematocrit, platelet count, serum calcium. 
 
Vascular Access  
Continuous flow centrifugation machines require two sites of vascular access. Recommended methods of 
achieving this access include: two peripheral venous lines, two central venous lines, one peripheral and one 
central venous line, or one double lumen central venous catheter. One arterial line (for withdrawal) with 
one venous line (for blood return) is acceptable. 
 
PBSC MOBILIZATION WITH CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS GROWTH FACTOR 
Filgrastim administration should begin 24 hours after the second gemcitabine dose in a cycle of 
chemotherapy, at an increased dose of 10-16 mcg/kg/dose until completion of peripheral stem cell 
collection (See Section 8.4 ). Filgrastim should be discontinued after collections are complete. 
 
PBSC COMPONENTS 
Each PBSC collection should be monitored with the following: 
Culture for bacterial and fungal contamination 
Nucleated cell count and differential 
CD34+ cell enumeration 
 
Each PBSC collection should be processed and cryopreserved on the day of collection. Processing and 
cryopreservation methods to be employed should be those demonstrated to reproducibly result in successful 
hematopoietic reconstitution following marrow ablative therapy. 
 
Positive selection for CD34+ cells, if employed, must be done using a device and reagents approved by [CONTACT_541086].

APPENDIX X : YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS 
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY (Part B only) 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A Study of Brentuximab Vedotin and Gemcitabine for Children with Hodgkin Disease  
 
1. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have Hodgkin disease that didn’t 
get better with treatment or that has come back after treatment. Hodgkin disease is a type of cancer 
that grows in the tissues in your body that make and store white blood cells. White blood cells help 
protect your body against infections. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new 
ways to help people who are sick.  
 
2. Children who are part of this study will be will be treated with chemotherapy. Everyone in this 
study will be treated with two chemotherapy drugs used to treat Hodgkin disease. These drugs are: 
brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine. After every 2 cycles of treatment, we will look at changes 
on scans (called CT and PET scans) to measure how the cancer is responding to therapy.  
 
3. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that your cancer 
will go away but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
4. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that the study treatment may not get rid of 
your cancer as well as a non-study treatment. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet 
know about. 
 
5. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
6. As part of this study, we will collect additional blood. These studies will help us better understand 
Hodgkin disease and why some people respond to treatment better than other people. The blood 
draws would be taken when other standard blood tests are being performed.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY (Part B only) 
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
 
A Study of Brentuximab Vedotin and Gemcitabine for Children with Hodgkin Disease  
 
1. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have Hodgkin disease that either 
didn’t get better with your treatment or came back after the end of treatment. Hodgkin disease is a 
type of cancer that grows in the tissues in your body that make and store white blood cells. White 
blood cells help protect your body against infections. A research study is when doctors work

drugs are: brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine. After every 2 cycles of treatment, we will look at 
changes on scans (called CT and PET scans) to measure how the cancer is responding to therapy.   
 
3. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is to get rid of the 
cancer for as long as possible.  
 
4. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that the study treatment may not get rid of 
your cancer as well as a non-study treatment. This could increase the chance of the cancer returning. 
Also, the use of brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine may cause complications. Other things may 
happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
5. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being

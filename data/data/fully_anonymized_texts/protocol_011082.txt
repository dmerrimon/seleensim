Hypothesis : Individualized health coaching including strategies to address poor resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_621290], frailty, and/or negative affect will be an effective therapeutic strategy at improving self -
management while in the pre -transplant state.  
 
Aims, purpose , or objectives:  We will conduct a randomized, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_621291] -management abilities 
compared to tra nsplant candidates who receive standard pre -transplant care.  We will also explore the 
relationship between self -management and pre -transplant risk factors such as uncertainty, resilience, frailty, and 
affect.  
 
Background : The ability to adhere to complex medical regimens is critical to achieving successful transplant 
outcomes, as non -adherent patients may experience graft failure or death following transplantation. Since 
potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_621292], identification of candidates who will adhere to complex post -
transplant regimens is critically important and emphasized by [CONTACT_571612]. When selecting candidates for 
transplant, physicians attempt to sub jectively predict post -transplant adherence because tools that reliably 
predict future adherence are lacking. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_621293] -transplant, non -adherence is 
common following transplant. As a result, new strategies for predicting fut ure non -adherence are necessary. 
Self-management ability, defined as “taking responsibility for one’s own behavior and well -being” involves the 
patient’s ability to manage their medical condition, their emotions, and their social roles. Self -management 
ability can be measured objectively, and it may be improved through interventions such as health coaching. 
Understanding self -management and related factors such as uncertainty, resilience, frailty, and affect may lead 
to an intervention for optimizing pre -transplant risk factors and adherence post -transplant.  
 
Study Design and Methods  
 
This is a randomized, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_621294], MN examining the 
effects of a health coaching intervention on the self -management ability of patients awaiting heart or lung 
transplant. The relationship between self -management and pre -transplant risk factors such as uncertainty, 
resilience, frailty, and affect will also be explored. Patients on the active or deferred waiting list s or with a 
waiting list status of “temporarily inactive” will be approached for recruitm ent in the Transplant Clinic at a 
routine clinical follow -up appointment (occurring every 1 to 3 months) or by [CONTACT_87068]. All participants 
will complete a written consent  form in  person via email -PTRAX, phone or by [CONTACT_2319] . After consenting, patients 
will schedule a research visit to complete baseline measures including questionnaires, a hand grip strength test, 
a timed gait speed test  over a distance of 15 feet , Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and a 60 -second 
body composition scan. A body composi tion analyzer (InBody 770) will be used to determine body composition 
(body mass, fat mass, and fat -free mass) via electrical impedance . Participants will also receive an activity 
monitor at their baseline visit to be worn for 5 -7 days. In addition; partic ipants will be given a pedometer to 
track their steps throughout the study.  If participants are unable to schedule a research visit, they may be mailed 
the questionnaires or sent via Redcap ( electronically ) and activity monitor  will be sent via the mail , which will 
be returned in postage -paid envelopes. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups while completing 
their baseline measures. Participants in one group will continue to receive the standard pre -transplant care for 
[ADDRESS_827100] a second time. All participants will also be asked to wear an 
activity monitor again for 5 -7 days. At th e end of the intervention, participants will be asked to complete a 
qualitative/satisfaction survey by [CONTACT_347709]. Follow -up testing will be completed within [ADDRESS_827101] -protected REDCap database. Questionnaire data, 
measurements, and abstracted data (age, type of tran splant, 6 minute walking distance, race, ethnicity, 
psychological assessment information, marital status, height, weight, date of listing, primary diagnosis, etc.) 
will be kept in a password -protected REDCap database on our secure network. Audio files from  health coaching 
sessions will also be stored in a password -protected folder on our secure network.  
 
Study Measures:  
Participants will complete the following testing, SPPB measures, and wear an Actigraph at baseline and after 
completing the intervention ( or in an equivalent time -frame if a control patient).  
1. Hand grip strength test: Hand grip strength will be measured using a Jamar Digital Hand Held 
Dynamometer. Participants will complete the grip strength test [ADDRESS_827102]: The participant’s gait speed will be measured using a stopwatch as the participant walks 
a distance of 15 feet at a self -selected walking speed. The average of 3  trials will be calculated and adjusted for 
sex and height. To determine the participant’s SPPB score, the results of the gait speed test will be prorated for 
4 meters (13.1 feet). The best of 3 trials will be used to calculate the participant’s SPPB score . 
3. Short physical performance battery (SPPB): The SPPB consists of a gait speed test over 4 meters (13.1 
feet), timed repeated chair stands, and [ADDRESS_827103]: See #2.  
b. Timed repeated chair stands: Participants will be asked if they feel safe to stand from a chair without the 
use of their arms and without assistance. If the participant feels safe to stand from a chair without the use of 
their arms and without assistance, they will be asked to complete 5 repeated chair stands. The  participant’s 
SPPB score will be determined by [CONTACT_621297] 5 repeated chair stands.  
c. Balance testing: The participant’s balance will be tested in side -by-side, semi -tandem, and tandem 
stands. In the side -by-side stand, participants wil l stand with their feet as close together as possible. In the semi -
tandem stands, participants will stand with one heel touching the big toe of the opposite foot. In the tandem 
stands, participants will stand with the heel of one foot in front of the toes of the other foot (as if on a balance 
beam). Participants will be asked to hold each position for up to 10 seconds.  
4. Body composition scan: Participants will stand on the InBody 770 body composition analyzer, which 
determines body composition by [CONTACT_621298] (i.e., sending an electrical signal through the body). 
Height, weight, BMI, skeletal muscle mass, percent body fat, and segmental lean mass will be recorded. 
Participants with a pacemaker, an implantable cardioverter -defibrillator (ICD), or an  automated ICD (AICD) 
will not be able to complete this body composition scan. Those patients will have their height and weight 
collected. BMI will be calculated.  
5. Activity monitoring: Participants will receive an Actigraph activity monitor to be worn on  the wrist for 
5-7 days. The activity monitors are capable of measuring the number of steps taken, the number of calories 
 
  Page  4 of 7 
 burned, the intensity of physical activity, the amount of sedentary time, and other variables. Participants will 
receive a prepaid add ressed envelope to return the activity monitor.  
6. Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D): Participants will answer 2 questions from 
the CES -D about their level of exhaustion.  
7. Self-reported weight loss: Patients will be asked whether they intentionally lost [ADDRESS_827104] to trend 
the weight over the prior year’s time.  
8. Demographic information: Patients will be asked to self -report their sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, 
education level, and the relationship of their primary caregiver post -transplant.    
9.         Questionnaires:  
Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (lung disease only)

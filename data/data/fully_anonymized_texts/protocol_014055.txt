Ixazomib
Title of Protocol: An Open -Label, Rollover Protocol for 
Patients Previously Enrolled in [COMPANY_005] -Sponsored 
Ixazomib Studies EudraCT No.:
2016 -001681 -28
Study Number: C16027 Phase: 2
Study Design:
This is an open -label, multicenter, rollover study to provide continued access to ixazomib and/or other combinational 
study drugs from the designated ixazomib parent protocols when the patient has no other means to access study 
treatment. The study will al so evaluate the long -term safety profile of ixazomib. 
The patient population will consist of patients who have previously received and tolerated a defined study regimen in 
a designated [COMPANY_005] -sponsored ixazomib clinical study, and in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_347316], may benefit from continued therapy with 1 or more of the study drugs from a parent protocol (eg, 
response to therapy or stable disease without evidence of disease progression). 
Patients may be enrolled provided they have not met any of the discontinuation criteria in a parent study. Patients will 
enter this study on the same dose, schedule of study drug(s), and combination regimen that they were receiving at the 
time of rollover from the parent study, or according to the required dose modification from a parent study. For those 
patients who received ixazomib dosing based on body surface area (BSA) per the parent study, the dose may be 
rounded. The dose may also be rounded for thos e patients who convert from BSA -based dosing to fixed dosing with 
approval from the Medical Monitor. No new anticancer agents can be started or added. Note that for patients whose 
study therapy in a parent study includes a placebo, the placebo capsule will be discontinued; crossover to ixazomib is 
not permitted. 
Following enrollment, patients may receive study treatment until they experience disease progression, clinical 
deterioration in the investigator’s judgment, experience an unacceptable toxicity, wit hdraw consent, pursue an 
alternative therapy, meet other study -specified reasons for discontinuation of study drug, or until the patient is 
transitio ned to ixazomib/other therapy through commercial channels. 
Patients participating in a designated parent s tudy will enter the rollover study when they have completed the end of 
treatment (EOT) visit in the parent study and when the rollover study is active at the investigative site. Following their 
provision of informed consent to continue receiving treatment in the rollover study, patients will be provided with 
study medication. Patients should enter the study within a maximum of [ADDRESS_431627] dose of study drug(s) in 
the parent study or as agreed upon by [CONTACT_347339]/designee so to minimize an y treatment disruption to the 
patient. Local safety -related laboratory evaluations and vital sign measurements will be performed according to the 
schedule of events as presented in this rollover study and accordingly will only be recorded in the electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) prior to the first dose of ixazomib in the rollover study, at the end of study, and as spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_093]. Electrocardiogram assessments will only be performed as clinically indicated. During 
treatment, do sing modification decisions will be made per the parent study. Systemic treatment with strong 
cytochrome P -450 (CYP)3A inducers is prohibited for patients receiving ixazomib during the study. The procedures 
prohibited in the patient’s parent study are prohibited during this study. Prohibited medications due to 
co-administration of other agents in the ixazomib regimen are prohibited as per the prescribing information for the 
co-administered agent(s).
It is recommended that disease assessments are performed p er standard of care. 
At the time of discontinuation of study drug(s) in this study, an end -of-study  (EOS) visit will be scheduled and will 
occur prior to the initiation of any new therapy, or within [ADDRESS_431628] response obtained 
during this rollover study, and the investigator assessment of date of progression will be captured in the eCRFs. 
Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,

CONFIDENTIALVersion 5.0, effective date 27 November 2017 [1]. 
The lo ng-term safety and tolerability of ixazomib will b e monitored. The following adverse events (AEs) will be 
reported from the first dose of study drug for this study through [ADDRESS_431629] dose of study 
drug and recorded in the eCRFs and serious adverse events ( SAEs) will also be r eported directly to the Sponsor (see 
Section 10.2). The following AEs that are ongoing at the time of entry into the rollover study will be recorde d in the 
eCRFs as baseline AEs .
All SAEs.
All ≥Grade 3 AEs.
≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.
New primary malignancies.
Any AE resulting in dose modification or discontinuation of any study drug.
Any other AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28670] a clinically significant event.
The above AEs will be followed until resolution, until the AE becomes chronic or stable, or is determined to be part of 
the underlying disease process, or until the patient attends the EOS visit and discontinues the study.
Thetransfer of patients between sites is allowed with the approval of the sponsor’s clinician/designee (eg, in the case 
of site closure, patient moves, etc).
Primary Objective:
To provide continued access to ixazomib and/or other study drugs from an ixazomi b parent study. 
To evaluate the long -term safety profile of ixazomib. 
Subject Population: Patients on study drug(s) at the closure of an ixazomib parent study, and who are likely to derive 
benefit from continued study therapy.
Number of Subjects:
The estimated number of patients to be enrolled is 
approximately 250. Number of Sites: 
The number of countries and sites is not currently 
specified as this study is open to all countries and sites 
with qualifying patients from prior 
company -sponsored ixa zomib studies
Dose Level(s):
Patients will enter this study on the same same dose, 
schedule of study drug(s), and combination regimen that 
they were receiving at the time of rollover from the parent 
study, or according to the required dose modification from a 
parent study. No new anticancer agents can be started or 
added. Note tha t for patients w hose study  therapy in a 
parent study includes a placebo, the placebo capsule will be 
discontinued; crossover to ixazomib is not permitted. 
For those patients who received ixazomib dosing based on 
body surface area (BSA) per the parent stud y, the dose may 
be rounded. The dose may also be rounded for those 
patients who convert from BSA -based dosing to fixed 
dosing with approval from the Medical Monitor. Route of Administration:

treatm ent of m ultiple myelo ma (MM), pl asma cell  dyscrasias, amylo idosis, lympho ma, 
nonhematologic malignanc ies, and lupus nephrit is. Inhibit ion of the 20S proteasome has been 
validated as a therapeuti c target for the treatm ent of malignancies using VELCADE®(bortezomib) 
for Injecti on, [COMPANY_005] ’s first-in-class proteasom e inhibitor [2]. 
Oral ixazomib in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone was first approved by [CONTACT_33104] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November [ADDRESS_431634] 1 prior therapy  [
3,4].It has since been approved in 
over 65 countries globally.
Ixazo mib (MLN2238) refers to the bio logically active boronic acid form of the drug substance. 
The drug substance is administered as a stable citrate ester, designated as ixazo mib citrate 
(MLN9708). Under physio logical condi tions, ixazomib citrate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_126847] c acid, i xazo mib. Ixazo mib is a pept ide boronic acid that is structurally 
different fro m bortezomib.
Detailed informat ion rega rding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxicology of MLN9708 may be 
found in the ixazo mib IB.
Phase 1, phase 1/2, and phase [ADDRESS_431635] been conducted in MM, relapsed and/or refractory  
systemic light -chain amylo idosis (RRAL), solid tumors, and lympho ma. In addit ion, phase 1 
studi es were conducted in patients with renal impairment who had relapsed and/or refractory  
multiple myelo ma (RRMM) or advanced so lid tumors (Study C16015), in pat ients with hepati c 
impairment who had advanced so lid tumors or hematolog ic malignancies (Study  C16018), and in 
an absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretio n study  in pat ients with advanced so lid 
tumors or lympho ma (Study  C16016). Phase 3 trials in RRMM (C16010), newly diagnosed 
multiple myelo ma (NDMM) (C16014), and RR AL (C16011) have addit ionally been co mpleted. 
Phase 3 trials o f ixazo mib as maintenance therapy fo llowing autol ogous stem  cell transplantati on 
(C16019) or in pat ients who did not receive ASCT (C16021) are ongoing.
Ixazo mib had been available as an IV and oral formulat ion (during the early development of 
ixazo mib); however, only the oral formulat ion is currently being developed for commercializat ion. 
Regardless of the route of administration, in the twice -weekly dosi ng schedule, ixazomib is given 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_431636] been studied during the clinical development of

4.1.1 Risk: Benefit Assessment
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks
The ri sks (i dentified and potential) have been assessed in clinical and nonclinical studies and are 
detailed in the current versio n of the IB. The emerging safet y profile indicates that oral ixazo mib is 
generally well tolerated and, while some potential toxicit ies may be severe, the predominant 
toxicities are l argely reversible, able to be monitored by  [CONTACT_347346], and 
manageable by [CONTACT_347347], discontinuation, or standard supportive care. It is possible that 
ixazo mib will have toxicit ies that were not predicted fro m its evaluation in nonclinical studies or 
previously observed in ongo ing clinical studies. T o mit igate the inherent risks in clinical studies o f 
ixazo mib, patients are monitored closely for anticipated toxicit ies. Guidance for the management 
of adverse events (AEs) and procedures for reducing doses are provided (see Sect ion 8.3and 
Secti on 8.7), and drug dosage can be reduced either by  [CONTACT_347348]. Further information is provided in th e IB.
Risks associated with ixa zomib therapy have been ident ified fro m ongoing clinical studies as well 
as the registrational trial o f ixazo mib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the treatment of 
patients wi th MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy  (see the current IB and the United 
States Prescribing Informat ion (USPI) for further informat ion). These include blood and 
lymphat ic system disorders (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia [all reversible]), 
gastrointestinal toxicit ies (diarrhea, nausea, vo miting, and const ipation), general disorders 
(fatigue, peripheral edema, and pyrexia), metabo lism and nutri tion di sorders (decreased appetite), 
nervous system disorders (dizziness, dy sgeusia, peri pheral  neuropathy  [generally  Grades 1 or 2]), 
psychiatric disorders (insomnia), ski n and subcutaneous tissue disorders (rash [very  comm on], 
severe dermal events [rare]).
Refer to the current IB for the list of potential risks of ixazo mib.
[IP_ADDRESS] Benefits
Ixazo mib in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone was approved by [CONTACT_347349] [ADDRESS_431637] 1 prior therapy 
[3,4] . The exploration of other therapeutic areas is ongoing. To date, activit y in MM has been see n 
with single -agent ixazo miband wi th ixazo mib combined with established therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In addit ion, 
single
-agent activit y has been observed in relapsed amylo idosis and indo lent non-Hodgkin 
lympho ma. This study will provide continued access to ixazo mib and/or other combinat ional study 
drugs from the designated ixazomib parent protocols when the patient has no other means to access 
study  treatm ent. Qualified patients who have been deriving benefit in an ixazo mib parent protocol 
will receive treatment in this study  until they are transit ioned to ixazomib/other therapy  through

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is an open -label, mult icenter, rollo ver study  to provi de cont inued access to ixazo mib and/or 
other study  drugs fro m a designated ixazo mib parent study (ie, Studi es C16003, C16005, C16006, 
C16007, C16008, C16010 Global, C16011, C16013, C16014 Global and Korean Cont inuat ion, 
C16017, C16020, C16029, and C16047) when the patient has no other means to access study 
treatm ent. The study  will also evaluate the l ong-term safet y profile o f ixazo mib in those patients 
who continue to receive ixazo mib. The pat ient populat ion will consist of patients who have

continued therapy  with 1 or m ore of the drugs from a parent protocol (eg, patient demonstrates 
response to therapy  or stabl e disease wi thout evi dence o f disease progressi on). 
Patients may be enrolled provi ded they  have not met any  of the di scont inuat ion criteria in their 
parent study . Pati ents will enter this study  on the sam e ixazomib dose, schedule of study  drug(s), 
and co mbinat ion regimen that they were receiving at the time of r ollover fro m the parent study, or 
according to the required dose modificat ion from a parent study  (Secti on 8.1). For those patients 
who received ixa zomib dosing based on BSA per the parent study, the dose may be rounded. The 
dose m ay also be rounded for those patients who convert from BSA -based dosing to fixed dosing 
with approval  from the Medical Monitor. No new ant icancer agents can be started or added. Note 
that for patients whose study therapy in a parent study includes a placebo, the placebo capsule will 
be discont inued; crossover to ixazo mib is not permitted.
Following enro llment, patients may receive study drug(s) until they experience disease 
progression, clinical deterioration in the invest igator’s judgment, experience an unacceptable 
toxicity, withdraw consent, pursue an alternat ive therapy, meet other study -specified reasons for 
discontinuat ion of study drug, or until the patient is transit ioned to ixazo mib/other therapy through 
commercial channels . 
Patients parti cipating in a designated ixazomib parent study  will enter the rollo ver study  at the 
time
-point when they  have co mpleted the EOT visit in the parent study  and when the rollo ver 
study  is act ive at an invest igative site. Fo llowing their provi sion of informed consent to receive 
treatm ent in the rollo ver study , pati ents will be provided with study  medicat ion. Pati ents shoul d 
enter the study wit hin [ADDRESS_431640] dose of ixazo mib/oth er study drug(s) in the parent study 
or as agreed upon by [CONTACT_347339]/designee so to minimize any treatment disruption to the 
patient. Local safet y-related laboratory evaluat ions and vital sign measurements will be performed 
according to the sched ule of  events as presented in this study  and accordingly  will only be 
recorded in the electronic case report forms (eCRF) prior to the first dose of study  drug in the 
rollover study , at the end of study , and as spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_3170]. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments will only be performed as clinically indicated. During 
treatm ent, dosing modificat ion decisio ns will be made per the parent study. For pati ents receiving 
ixazo mib, systemic treatment with strong cy tochrome P -450 (CYP)3A i nducers (rifabutin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenyto in, phenobarbital), or use of St. John’s wort) is prohibited during the 
study . The procedures prohibited in the patient’s parent study  are prohibited during this study . 
Prohibited medicat ions due to co -administrati on of other agents in the ixazo mib regimen are 
prohibited as per the prescribing information for the co -administered agent(s).
It is recommended that disease assessments are performed per standard of care. 
At the time of discont inuat ion of study  drug(s) i n this study , an end -of-study  (EOS) vi sit will be 
scheduled and will occur prior to the init iation of any new therapy, or within [ADDRESS_431641] itute Commo n Termino logy Criteria
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5.0, effect ive date 27 November 2017 [1]. 
The l ong-term safet y and tol erabili ty of ixazo mib/other study  drug(s) will b e monitored. The 
following AEs will be reported from the first dose of study drug in this study through [ADDRESS_431642] ly to the Sponsor (see Sectio n
 10.2). The fo llowing AEs that are ongoing at the time 
of entry  into the rollo ver study  will be recorded in the eCRFs as baseline AEs .

Nausea or Vomiting
Prophylaxis wit h standard ant iemetics, including serotonin [ADDRESS_431654] ions, etc ; these other causative agents should be discont inued and 
alterative agents considered if medically  necessary .
Symptom atic m easures such as a ntihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically  in subsequent cy cles. The 
use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day  or equivalent) is permitted. 
Management of a Grade 3 rash may require IV antihistamines or corticosteroids. Administration of 
ixazo mib (and other causative agent if given in co mbinat ion) should be modified and re -initiated at 
a reduced level fro m where rash was noted (per parent study ). In line wit h clinical pract ice, 
derm atology consul t and bi opsy of Grade [ADDRESS_431655] ic measures should also be considered if a patient has previously 
developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcoho l-free emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_347322]). 
The rare risks of Stevens -Johnson syndro me, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN), drug reaction wit h 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), and pemphigus vulgaris h ave been 
reported in onco logy studies when ixazo mib (or placebo) was given wit h conco mitant medications

CONFIDENTIALthat are known to cause rash (eg, Bactrim, lenalidomide, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]), and/or in the setting of 
confounding treatment -emergent AEs. These severe, potentiall y life-threatening or deadly  
condi tions may  involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be clinically managed 
according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are 
encouraged at the discretion of the invest igator. Study medicat ions should be discontinued in the 
event of severe, potentially life -threatening rash. Addit ional information regarding these react ions 
can be found in the IB.
Thrombocytopenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly according to st andard clinical pract ice. 
Thrombocy topeni a may be severe but has been manageable with platelet transfusio ns according to 
standard clinical pract ice. Ixazo mib administration should be modified according to dose 
modificati on recommendat ions in the parent stu dy when thrombocytopenia occurs. Therapy can 
be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platel et counts. Thrombotic microangiopathy  
(TMA), including thrombotic thrombocy topeni a purpura and hemo lytic uremic syndrome, are 
rare, serious blood disorder s that cause low levels of platelets and red blood cells and result in 
blood clots in small blood vessels. Symptoms may include fat igue, fever, bruising, nose bleeds, 
and decreased urinat ion. These disorders, including fatal cases, have been reported in pa tients 
receiving ixazo mib. If TMA is suspected, consider withdrawal o f the suspected causative agent 
and manage according to standard medical pract ice.
Neutropenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly with addi tional testing, as appropri ate, according to 
standard clinical pract ice. Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor 
support is not required but may be considered according to standar d clinical pract ice. Ixazo mib 
administration should be modified according to dose modificat ion recommendat ions in the parent 
study  when neutropenia occurs. Therapy  can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC). 
Fluid Deficit
Dehydrat ion should be avo ided because ixazo mib may cause vo miting, diarrhea, and dehydrat ion. 
Acute renal failure has been reported in patients treated with ixazomib, commo nly in the setting of 
the previously  noted gastrointestinal toxicit ies and dehydrat ion.
Fluid deficit should be prompt ly corrected before administration of study drug and as needed 
during treatment to avoid dehydrat ion.
Hypotension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope have been 
reported wi th ixazo mib. Blood pressure should be closely mo nitored as per standard of care while 
the pati ent is on study  treatm ent, and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the 
setting of conco mitant symptom s such as nausea, vomit ing, diarrhea, or decreased appetite. 
Patients taking m edicati ons or di uretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypotension or 
hypertensio n) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, including considerat ions

Transverse Myelitis
Transverse myelit is has been reported with ixazo mib. It is not known whether ixazo mib causes 
transverse myelit is; however, because transverse myelit is happened to a patient receiving 
ixazo mib, the possibilit y that ixazomib may have contributed to the transverse myeli tis cannot be 
excluded. Transverse myelit is should be managed according to standard medical practice.
Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of invest igational drug, 
to or by a study subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual subject according 
to the study  protocol . Overdose has been reported in patients taking ixazo mib. Symptoms of 
overdose are generally consistent with the known risks of ixazo mib. Reports of accidental 
overdose have been associ ated wi th serious adverse events, such as nausea, lung infect ions 
including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_347323], m ultiple organ failure, and death. If overdose occurs, consider

treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicin al 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change fro m baseline.

Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the

more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see

Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined as a 
substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when,

CONFIDENTIALbetween an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT synony mous. The general  term  severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is 
based o n patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does 
not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a w hite blood cell count of 1000/mm3
to less than 2000 i s considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness 
(not intensit y) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.

Adverse Events
The fo llowing AEs spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question 
from study  personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_298334], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropri ate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion10.3 for the period 
of observati on). 
All SAEs (see Sect ion 10.1.2 ).
All ≥Grade 3 AEs (see Section 10.1.2 ).
≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy .
New primary malignancies. 
Any AE result ing in dose modificat ion or discont inuat ion of any  study  drug.
Any other AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator is a clinically significant event. 
Any clinically  relevant deteri oration in laboratory  assessments or other clinical finding is 
considered an AE, but should only be recorded in eCRF if meet ing any of the above criteria . Whe n 
possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be noted as 1 
comprehensive event.
Regardless of cau sality, SAEs (as defined in Sect ion

Severit y (toxi city grade) for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will  be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0, effect ive date 27 November 2017 [1]. The cri teria are 
provi ded in the S tudy Manual.
Relationship of the event to study drug administration (ie, its causalit y) will be determined by [CONTACT_4175] y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug?”

CONFIDENTIALAppendix DAcceptable Methods of Contraception
The fo llowing informat ion is based on (and in line with) the informed consent form for ixazo mib.
Female patients: Unless the patient cannot have children because of surgery or other medical 
reasons (had an effect ive tubal ligat ion, had the ovaries or the uterus removed, or is 
postm enopausal), the patient must use [ADDRESS_431703] ive methods of birth control fro m thetime of signing 
the informed consent form through the ent ire study drug treatment period (including interruptions 
in treatment) and for [ADDRESS_431704] ive (see examples below).
Highly Effective Methods Other Effective Methods (Barrier Methods)
Intrauterine devices Latex or nonlatex condom with or without a 
spermicidal agent
Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/oral contraceptives, 
injectable contracepti ves, contraceptive patches, or 
contraceptive implants)Diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with a 
spermicide; sponge with a spermicide
If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using [ADDRESS_431705] use birth control methods as directed above, unless the patient completely avo ids 
having heterosexual intercourse.
Male patients: We do not know if using ixazo mib will affect sperm. Therefore, because o f 
potenti al risk, the pati ent shoul d not get a partner pregnant during the study drug treatment period 
(including interruptions in treatment). Even if the patient is surgically sterilized (ie, had a 
vasectomy ), the pati ent m ust agree to use an appropriate method of barrier contraception (late x or 
nonlatex condo m with or wi thout a spermicidal agent) during the ent ire study  drug treatm ent 
period and for 90 days after completing study  drug treatment, or the pati ent shoul d com pletely 
avoid having heterosexual intercourse.
Highly Effective Methods Other Effective Methods (Barrier Methods)
Vasectomy Latex or nonlatex condom with or without a spermicidal agent
Diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; sponge with 
spermicide
If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using 2 effective methods at the same time is 
recommended.
All patients (male or female) : If the pati ent or a partner becomes pregnant during this study , the 
patient m ust tell the study  doctor immediately. The doctor will advise the patient of the possib le 
risks to the unborn child and discuss options for managing the pregnancy  with the pati ent. For 
female patients who become pregnant while on this study , the study  drug will  be stopped 
immediately , and the pregnancy will be followed unt il conclusio n.

antihistamines or corticosteroids. Administration of ixazo mib (and other causative 
agent if given in co mbinat ion) should be modified and re -initiated at a redu ced level 
from where rash was noted (per parent study ).
In line with clinical practice, dermatology  consul t and bi opsy of Grade [ADDRESS_431731] ic measures should also

returned at the next available on -site clinic visit. Any excursio ns in temperature 
shoul d be reported and deal t with on a case -by-case basis. 
Rationale for Change:
To add clarificat ion to thi s protocol .
Change 15:Added language regarding alternat ive methods for administe ring study  
procedures/assessments when it is not possible for the patient to come to the study  site due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic.
The primary  change occurs in Section 9.4Study  Procedures : 
Added text: In acknowledgement of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], local, state or national government restrictions, 
or other site- related factors caused by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_431737] to the safety of the study participants and site personnel for 
patients to continue. In evaluating such requests, the investigator/st udy site staff 
will give the highest priority to the safety and welfare of the patients. Patients 
must be willing and able to continue taking study medication and remain 
compliant with the protocol. For patients that are impacted by [CONTACT_25963] -19 
pandemic, any procedures not conducted per the study protocol will be 
documented in the eCRF. 
Alternative methods should be considered for performing the assessments by 
[CONTACT_79098] (eg, remote assessment, 
having lab assessment performed at a facility closer to the patient’s home, etc.) If 
a patient misses an in -person study visit, the investigator/study team staff will 
speak directly with the patient by [CONTACT_63195] (eg, a 
computer -based video communicati on) during each visit window to assess 
subject safety and overall clinical status. During this contact [CONTACT_10970], the 
study site physician or other qualified site staff should at minimum conduct AE 
collection and an assessment of clinical symptoms. Other study assessments may 
be collected remotely as is feasible and may involve audio or video recording. 
Assessments/procedures that cannot be completed during the protocol -specified 
window because a site visit is done remotely (eg, hematology, clinical chemistry, 
concomitant medications/procedures) are waived.

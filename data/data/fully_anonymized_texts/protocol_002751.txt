 1.0 Study Summary  
 
Title:  
 
Background:    
Invasive mechanical ventilation is common in the ICU. Approximately 25% of 
patients in the Vanderbilt MICU require invasive ventilation at some point during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   Protocols for low tidal volume ventilation, daily spontaneous 
awakening trials, and  daily spontaneous breathing trials have significantly shortened the 
duration of mechanical ventilation and improved patient outcomes.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_456837], the period of time following extubation remains high risk.  Around 25% 
of patients develop r ecurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_456838] 15% require 
reintubation.  Reintubation is an independent predictor of increased mortality.   
Post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456839] -invasive ventilation or high flow 
nasal cannula appears to re duce the reintubation rate, but utilization remains low.  
Whether implementation of a protocol identifying patients who may benefit from post -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456840] a specific physician 
order decreases reintubation rates remain unknown.  To determine the effect on 
reintubation rate of a protocol for post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], we propose a 
three phase study: an initial pe riod of observation of current practices; an intervention 
period comparing protocolized post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456841]; and 
(if protocolized post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456842]) 
a dissemination period  during which the protocol will be extended to all patients and 
post -intervention practices and outcomes will be observed.  
 
Primary Aim:  
• To compare the effect of protocolized post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], 
versus usual care, on the rate of reintubation within 96 hours ( 4 days) of 
extubation.

Group Assignment :  Patients’ treatment group will be determined by [CONTACT_456917], 
with the MICU divided into two clusters, based on geography (front hall and back hall).  
Geographical group assignment is designed to align with the rooms covered by [CONTACT_456918][INVESTIGATOR_456847]. Based on MICU admitting protocols, 
patients are arbitrarily assigned to the first available room with no intentional 
movement/placement of patients by [CONTACT_456919], amount of nursing needs, or 
other c linical factors.   To control for any potential bias created by [CONTACT_456920], the groups will undergo five cross -overs so that 
each bed will spend half of the study in the protocolized post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456848].

 2.0 Background  
 
Invasive mechanical ventilation is common in the ICU. Approximately, 25% of 
Vanderbilt MICU patients require invasive mechanical intubation at least once during 
their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Protocols for low tidal volume ventilation, daily spontaneous 
awakening trials, and daily s pontaneous breathing trials have significantly shortened the 
duration of mechanical ventilation and improved outcomes for these patients.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_456850], the period of time following extubation remains high risk.  Around 
25% of patients experi ence post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1444] 11 to 15% of patients 
require reintubation after their first extubation.1–3  In patients identified to be at high 
risk, reintubation rates may be as high as 28%.2,4  Reintubation is associated with 
increased rates of nosocomial infection5 and is an independent predictor of mortality, 
with a relative risk ranging from 3.29 -5.34 and an absolute mortality ranging from 19 - 
50%.3,6,[ADDRESS_583734] 20 years.8–10 
Based on unadjusted, retrospective data from our ICU, reintubation is associated 
with a relative risk of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138581] 4.5 (absolute rate of mortality of 28.8%, 
compared to 6.0%).  The prevention of complications following extubation is a k ey focus 
of critical care research and quality improvement.1–3,11,[ADDRESS_583735] -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456851] -invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.  Use of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_456852], however, remains low.

NIV prevents intubation and decreases mortality in patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_456853].13,[ADDRESS_583736] -extubation “rescue” NIV (applied when a patient 
develops respi[INVESTIGATOR_456854]) delays the time to

  [ADDRESS_583738] -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456855].4,17  A subsequent trial of pat ients who were hypercarbic on their pre -
extubation spontaneous breathing trial showed that 24 hours of prophylactic NIV 
decreased 90 day mortality from 31% to 11%.18  National guidelines for management 
following e xtubation were recently updated to include a recommendation for NIV in 
patients at high risk of reintubation.19 
 
2.2 Prophylactic high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) following extubation  
 
HFNC is an apparatus that delivers flow rates up to [ADDRESS_583739] pressure, 
with dead space washout, decreasing the work of breathing while al so improving 
patient comfort and secretion management.20–[ADDRESS_583740] -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_81407] (NIV or HFNC) – and post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456856]19.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the utilization of any form of post -

recom mendations may take as long as [ADDRESS_583744] -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456860], but currently (1) no validated protocols exist and (2) the effect of 
such a protocol on reintubation in our patient population is unknown.  
We propose a three -phase  study: an initial period of observation of cu rrent 
practices, an intervention period comparing a respi[INVESTIGATOR_456861] -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456841], and (if protocolized post -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456842]) a dissemination 
period during which the protocol will be extended to all patients and post -intervention 
practices and outcomes will be observed.

NIV may be discontinued at any point if felt by [CONTACT_456924].  Patients may take breaks of one hour to eat or drink or for comfort. 
Patients who have one of the contraindications listed above or are unable to tolerate 
NIV for more than 4 hours should be placed on high flow nasal cannula. Sedatives to 
increase tolerance to NIV will be discouraged.  NIV will be continued until 5AM the day 
following extubation (the time at which spontaneous breathing trials are initiated on 
mechanically ventilated patients in our intensive care unit).  If a patient is felt to be 
stable for transfer out of the ICU prior to 5AM the day following extubation, NIV can be

8.0 Risks and Benefits:  
 
For mechanically ventilated patients who are undergoing extubation in the  
MICU , there are currently no established risks or benefits to protocolized post -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. At this time, there is no reason to believe that 
participation in this study would expose patients to greater medical risks or benefits 
than th ose experienced by [CONTACT_456928] a part of 
routine care.  The greater benefit of the study would be to society in the form of 
improved understanding of safe and effective patient care for patients following 
extubation.  
 A potential risk to patients participating in this study involves the collection of 
protected health information (PHI).  In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum 
amount of PHI necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data 
will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) only accessible by [CONTACT_473].  
After publication, a de -identified database will be generated to protect participant 
privacy.

9.[ADDRESS_583766], a critical care nurse, and usually a pulmonary and 
critical care fellow or attending, in addition to continuous invasive or non -invasive 
monitoring.   
Additionally, study personnel will  be readily  available to answer questions at any 
time during the study course.  If any healthcare provider participating in the patient’s 
care believes that the study interventions cannot be safely performed, the study

Study Title:  Protocolized Post -Extubation Respi[INVESTIGATOR_456836]/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  [ADDRESS_583767] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event 
therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an intervention, whether or not the incident is considered 
related to the intervention.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) will be defined for this trial as any unexpected and 
untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening (d efined as an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it would have been more severe)  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
e. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
f. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
g. Important medical event that requires an intervention to prevent any of a -f 
above.  
 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_456903] a daily basis.  He will be available at any time for questions from the clinical 
team or bedside nurses, who will also be monitoring the patients continuously for 
adverse events and serious adverse events.  Serious and unexpected adverse events 
associated with study interventions will be recorded in a case report form in the study 
record and reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_583768] , 
and death. These events will be recorded as study outcomes and monitored by [CONTACT_197121].  However, in the absence of an imbalance of the above events 
between study groups, these events are expected in the routine performance of critical

 care medi cine and will not be individually recorded and reported to the IRB as serious 
and unexpected adverse events, unless the investigators or clinical team believe the 
event was related to the study intervention.  
 
10.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the following circumstances:  
• The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn for safety 
considerations.  
• There is a significant protocol violation in the judgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of ever y withdrawal will be recorded in the patient study records.  
Follow -up will be performed for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or 
any other safety parameter.  Follow -up will also be performed for all patients who end 
participation in the  protocol for another reason, but who also have an adverse event or 
other safety parameter that could have led to discontinuation.  Follow -up will be 
conducted until the condition has resolved, until diagnosis of the adverse event or 
safety parameter is de emed chronic and stable, or as long as clinically appropriate.  This 
follow -up will be documented in the patient study record as well.   
 
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION ( 9/12/17):  
 Review of 12 months of data obtained during a previo us prospective trial 
enrolling a similar population of patients in the same ICU demonstrated a reintubation 
rate of 12. 1% within [ADDRESS_583769] 
suggested that it may reduce the relative risk of reintubation by 49 to 66% in high risk 
patients.4,[ADDRESS_583770]  suggested that it may 
reduce the rate of reintubation by 81% in high risk patients and 60% in low risk patients 
and is non -inferior to NIV in high risk patients12,25,29.   We estimate that the initiation of 
a protocol for post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456904] 55% (equivalent to an absolute risk reduction of 6. 655%).

  [ADDRESS_583771] -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_456905] ( 8.3%  of patients in retrospective 
cohort) , which we expect to continue, we estimate that our sample size should be 
increased by 10% to [ADDRESS_583772] cluste r cross -over (12 months), we will examine the 
enrollment rate, the reintubation rate in the usual care arm, and the rate of utilization 
of post -extubation  respi[INVESTIGATOR_456906].  Using 
these statistics, we will re -calcula te the sample size needed for a power of 0.[ADDRESS_583773] the ability to extend 
the trial by [CONTACT_8622] 6 months (two additional intervention periods with cross -overs at 
month 18 and 21).   
 
SAM PLE SIZE UPDATE  (1/4/19):  
As a cluster -randomized, multiple -crossover trial, the intervention portion of 
PROPER has been designed to enroll for a fixed duration to ensure that each cluster 
spends an equal amount of time receiving each treatment group.  The trial has been 
approved to enroll for 18 months, from 10/1/2017 to 3/31/2019.  The total number of 
patients enrolled will depend on the rates of mechanical ventilation in the MICU  during 
the fixed time period of the trial.  Based on retrospective data, w e estimated that 
approximately 630 patients would be enrolled under the planned study duration.  The 
number of patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the MICU  has increased over the 
duration of the trial, however, and we now anticipate between 720 and 740 patients will 
be enrolled during the planned study period.

 Statistical Analysis:  
 
Trial profile:  
We will present a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram to detail 
the movement of patients through the study. This diagra m will  include total number of 
patients meeting inclusion criteria, number excluded and  reason for exclusion, number 
enrolled and randomized in the study, number  followed, and number analyzed.  
 
Baseline Characteristics:  
To assess for baseline differences between the groups, we will summarize in 
Table 1 the  distribution of baseline variables across the study arms. Categorical variables 
will be reported as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables as either  
means with SDs or medians with interquar tile ranges. Variables reported will  include 
Demographics (age, gender, race, BMI, co -morbidities), indication for intubation, active 
illnesses at the time of extubation, severity of Illness  (APACHE II score), ICU length of 
stay, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], a nd duration of mechanical ventilation (prior to first 
extubation)  
 
Analyses:  
We will develop and make publicly  available prior to the conclusion of enrollment a 
complete statistical analysis plan.  This will detail an approach to the primary analysis 
which  adequately accounts for the intra -cluster, intra -period, and intra -cluster -intra -
period correlation observed in the study environment (if applicable).  We will analyze 
the effect of group assignment on all secondary.  We will evaluate for heterogeneity of  
treatment effect between pre -specified baseline variables, group assignment, and 
outcome using formal tests of interaction.  We will perform “per -protocol” and “as -
treated” analyses assessing the impact of contamination.

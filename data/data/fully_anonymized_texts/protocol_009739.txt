[ADDRESS_214593] SUMMARY  
Cangrelor is an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor utilized as a bridge to achieve adequate platelet 
inhibition until oral P2Y12 inhibitors achieve their full antiplatelet effects in patients undergoing 
coronary stenting. Although in this setting the potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor prasugrel  is 
commonly utilized, there is very limited data on the optimal approach for switching between 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In particular, ruling out a drug -drug interaction (DDI) is critical to this extent as 
the presence of a DDI would tran slate into reduced or abolished antiplatelet effects exposing 
these acute patients to an increased thrombotic risk. There is a n unmet  need to better elucidate  
pharmacodynamic profiles associated with the transition from cangrelor to prasugrel therapy. Of 
note, prasugrel has recently gone off patent and the availability of a generic formulation will 
favorably impact its use. Pharmacodynamic  studies provide some support on the safety of 
administering  prasugrel at the start of cangrelor infusion . However , the available data does not 
allow to rule out a DDI given that there was no comparator arm in which prasugrel was either 
given alone or at the end of cangrelor infusion . The methodological approach for this assessment 
should rely on comprehensive pharmacod ynamics investigations aimed to assess levels of P2Y12 
receptor inhibition, pharmacokinetic investigations to assess systemic levels of the drug/drug 
metabolite, and mechanistic investigations by [CONTACT_181843] P2Y12 receptor gene 
expression. The overarching aim of this investigation is to rule out a DDI when cangrelor and 
prasugrel are concomitantly administered in patients undergoing coronary stenting .

 BACKGROUND  
Cangrelor is an intravenous adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue that directly and  
reversibly inhibits ADP binding to the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y 12 receptor subtype in a 
dose-dependent manner, achieving immediate potent platelet inhibition after a bolus dose  [1,2]. 
The cangrelor binding site at the P2Y [ADDRESS_214594] to controversy and is not 
clearly defined  [3,4]. Nonetheless, cangrelor is associated with high levels of receptor occupancy 
and prevents ADP binding. Cangrelor is promptly inactivated through dephosphorylation by 
[CONTACT_181844] a very short plasma half -life (3 -6 minutes)  [1-4]. Therefore, recovery of 
platelet function is rapid (~60 minutes) after discontinuation of cangrelor infusion  [1-4].  
Cangrelor was approved for clinical use based on the results of the CHAMP ION 
(Cangrelor versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition) 
PHOENIX trial, which showed that cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of ischemic events, 
driven by a reduction in stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, with no significant increase 
in severe bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) [5]. Given 
the different pharmacological properties of cangrelor and the oral P2Y [ADDRESS_214595] investigated the potential for drug-drug interaction ( DDI) when these agents are 
concomitantly administered  [6-12]. These potential DDI are concerning as they can result in 
reduced platelet inhibition and subsequent lack of protection from thrombotic complications in 
the peri -PCI pe riod. In a study conducted in healthy volunteers, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181818]  [6]. This reflects the fact that clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181819] P2Y 12 receptors if already largely occupi[INVESTIGATOR_181820]. In turn, the plasma 
concentrations of the unbound clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181821] 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
[ADDRESS_214596] of the active 
metabolite has already been eliminated from the circulation  [6]. In contradistinction, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]’s antiplatelet effects a re not diminished when it is administered after cangrelor 
infusion, because of the very fast offset of action of cangrelor and subsequent availability of 
P2Y 12 receptors for binding by [CONTACT_8311][INVESTIGATOR_181822]  [6]. Accordingly, acr oss the 
CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_181823], a clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181824] (LD) was administered always 
immediately after discontinuation of cangrelor infusion  [5,13-15]. 
Although cangrelor was approved based on a trial in which clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181825], in real -
world  clinical practice cangrelor is more commonly utilized in high -risk patients undergoing 
PCI, in whom the newer generation P2Y 12 inhibitors (i.e, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are 
recommended over clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  [16,17,18 ]. Recommendations on how to transition fro m 
cangrelor to oral treatment with ticagrelor and prasugrel largely derive from pharmacodynamic 
(PD) studies  [3,4,8,9 ]. Unlike that observed with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], no interaction was shown when 
transitioning from cangrelor to ticagrelor, allowing for a more ver satile use of ticagrelor with 
respect to timing of administration in relation to the start of cangrelor therapy  [8]. The presence 
of an interaction between clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181826], but not between ticagrelor and cangrelor is 
probably the result of differ ent half -lives of these drugs, as well as the different sites and types of 
binding to the P2Y 12 receptor  [3,4,6 -8,11,12] . Ticagrelor reversibly binds the P2Y [ADDRESS_214597] from the ADP -binding site and has a half -life of 6 -12 hours. Althoug h it is unknown 
whether ticagrelor can bind with the P2Y 12 receptor during cangrelor infusion, its half -life 
(which exceeds that of the duration of cangrelor infusion) is such that drug is still systemically 
available to bind with the P2Y 12 receptor after discontinuation of cangrelor infusion  [3,4,8 ]. 
Version 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 Based on these observations, ticagrelor can be administered before, during, or after cangrelor 
infusion  [3,4,8 ]. 
The transition from cangrelor to prasugrel is associated with transient recovery of platelet 
reactivity, in particular within 1 hour after cangrelor discontinuation , which could be explained 
by a DDI similar to that described for clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [9]. However, it was observed that recovery of 
platelet function was attenuated when prasugrel was administered 30 minutes before sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_181827]  [9]. Accordingly, it is recommended that prasugrel be administered at the end 
of cangrelor infusion or 30 minutes prior to discontinuation of infusion  [3,4,9 ]. However, 
recently the ExcelsiorLO AD2  (Impact of Extent of Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -Induced Platelet Inhibition 
during Elective Stent Implantation on Clinical Event Rate - Advanced Loading Strategies) study 
showed that prasugrel [ADDRESS_214598] -cangrelor, with only rare cases of high platelet 
reactivity ( HPR ) [19]. Moreover, there were no differences with levels of platelet reactivity and 
HPR rates compared with those observed with ticagrelor , which was also given at the start of the 
cangrelor infusion . These observations may be attributed to relatively higher concentration and 
longer half -life of prasugrel’s active metabolite compa red with that of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  [20-23]. 
However, ExcelsiorLOAD2  was not powered to test the non -inferiority on PD effects between 
prasugrel and ticagrelor, but only for the comparison of prasugrel versus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Moreover , 
whether similar findings would be observed with longer infusions of cangrelor (e.g., up to 4 
hours) is unknown. Therefore, a lthough the PD results of this study provide some support on the 
safety of administering  prasugrel at the start of cangrelor infusion, the trial design does not allow 
to rule out a DDI given that there was no comparator arm in  which prasugrel was either given 
alone or at the end of cangrelor infusion  [24]. Moreover, pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments, 
Version 2.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 pi[INVESTIGATOR_181828] a DDI, were not performed. Accordingly, recommendations on timing 
of prasugrel administration in cangrelor treated patients remain unchanged.   
 
STUDY RATIONALE  
Guideline s recommend the prefere ntial use of new generation P2Y 12 inhibitors, including 
prasugrel , over clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181829]-risk patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing 
PCI [16-18]. Since high-risk patients undergoing PCI is a setting in which cangrelor is frequently 
used, there is a n unmet  need to better  elucidate  PD profiles associated with the transition f rom 
cangrelor to prasugrel therapy. To date the uptake of the newer oral P2Y [ADDRESS_214599] been conducted in patients with stable coronary 
artery disease, and current recommendation s are based on assessments conducted in patients not 
undergoing PCI [9]. Importantly, acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) and PCI are both known to 
affect  PK and PD profiles of antiplatelet agents. Overall, these observations strongly underscore 
the need to conduct dedicated investigations to rule out a DDI when transitioning from cangrelor 
to prasugrel and to define the optimal approach for transitioning therapy in real -world high-risk 
patients, including ACS patients , undergoing PCI.  The methodological approach for this 
assessment should rely on comprehensive PD assessments aimed to assess level s of P2Y 12 
receptor inhibition, PK assessments to assess systemic levels of the drug/drug metabolite, and 
mechanistic assessments by [CONTACT_181845] P2Y 12 receptor gene expression. In particular, 
different levels of P2Y 12 receptor gene expression can m odulate the PD effects of oral P2Y 12 
receptor inhibitors at a given level of drug exposure defined by [CONTACT_181846].

 STUDY AIM  
The aim of this investigation is to rule out a DDI when cangrelor and prasugrel are 
concomitantly administered in high-risk patients undergoing coronary stenting.  
 
REASERCH PLAN  
Study design  
The Switching Antiplatelet Therapy -6 (SWAP -6) study will be a prospective , 
randomized, open label PD and PK study conducted in high-risk patients undergoing PCI . 
Patients presenting w ith a non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE -ACS), including unstable 
angina (UA) and NSTE -myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or with stable CAD but deemed at 
high risk undergoing  an invasive management strategy as part of their standard of care will be 
screened. The s tudy will be performed at the Division of Cardiology of University of [LOCATION_012] 
Health , Jacksonville , [LOCATION_012] . Patients will be screened by [CONTACT_8288], who will 
verify that all candidates meet inclusion and exclusion criteria , and obtain their  written informed 
consent to participate in the study  prior to undergoing their diagnostic invasive evaluation to 
define coronary anatomy . Results from blood tests performed within the last 90 days will be 
considered valid for screening purposes. If these are not available, a blood sample will be 
collected for the screening phase.  
After undergoing invasive diagnostic evaluation of coronary anatomy, patients 
undergoing PCI will be considered eligible for randomization. Using a computer -based 
randomization sy stem, patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of the following 
treatment arms: a) prasugrel only administered at the start of PCI  (group 1) ; b) cangrelor plus 
prasugrel concomitantly administered at the start of PCI  (group 2) ; c) cangrelor administered at 
Version 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 the start of PCI plus prasugrel administered at the end of the cangrelor infusion  (group 3) . 
Prasugrel will be used in line with FDA recommendations using a 60mg LD followed by a 10mg 
daily maintenance dose started 24 hours a fter LD administration  [25]. Cangrelor will be used at 
the FDA recommended dose using a 30 μg/kg bolus followed by 4 μg/kg/min infusion  [26]. 
Study drugs will be administered before passing of the guidewire . The duration of cangrelor 
infusion will be 2 hou rs or until the end of PCI (whichever is longer) . All patients will be on a 
background of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457] (325 mg loading dose followed by 81 mg daily maintenance 
dose). Patients will be managed according to standard of care.  The interventional procedure w ill 
also be performed according to standard of care with choice of anticoagulant (heparin or 
bivalirudin) at the discretion of the operator. PK and PD assessments will be conducted at 7 time 
points: baseline, 30 minutes after administration of randomized t reatment, end of PCI  (defined as 
when the guide catheter is removed at procedure  completion) , 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours and 4 
hours after administration of randomized treatment . Figure 1 illustrates the overall study design. 
In patients in which the infusion will be maintained for more than 2 hours (until the end of PCI), 
the [ADDRESS_214600] an open -label design, laboratory per sonnel will be blinded 
to treatment assignments. During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] , major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and urgent revascularization proce dures) , serious adverse events (bleeding and 
other adverse events) , as well as non -serious adverse events  considered to be study related will 
be collected . After completing the study, decisions on medical management, including the choice 
and duration of antiplatelet therapy will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

Labora tory assessments will include the following : 
1. VerifyNow PRU assay  
2. VASP -PRI assay  
3. Total Thrombus -Formation Analysis System (T -TAS)  
4. PK 
5. P2Y12 gene receptor level expression  
 
Description of laboratory assays  
1) VerifyNow PRU: The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection system 
which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance (Acc riva, San 
Diego, CA) and will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described 
[27-30]. The assa y is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents for the 
pathways of interest. The VerifyNow PRU assay, by [CONTACT_8293]+PGE1, measures changes 
in platelet function specific to P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. The assay is based upon the ability of 
activated platelets to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen -coated microparticles aggregate in proportion 
to the number of GP IIb/IIIa receptors expressed. Microbead aggregation is more rapid and 
reproducible if platelets are activated; therefore the reagents ar e incorporated into the assay 
channel to induce platelet activation without fibrin formation. Light transmittance increases as 
activated platelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads. The instrument measures this 
change in optical signal and reports  results in P2Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU).  
2) Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP):   VASP phosphorylation (VASP -
P) is a marker of P2Y12 receptor signaling. VASP will be assessed the ELISA VASP -P kit 
(Biocytex Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) as pr eviously described [31-33]. After a first step of parallel 
Version 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
12 
 whole blood sample activation with PGE1 and PGE1+ADP, platelets from the sample are lysed, 
allowing released VASP to be captured by [CONTACT_2017] -human VASP antibody, which is coated in the 
microtiter pl ate. Then, a peroxidase -coupled anti -human VASP -P antibody binds to 
phosphorylated serine 239 antigenic determinant of VASP. The bound enzyme peroxidase is 
then revealed by [CONTACT_181847] a predetermined time. After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_181830] n, absorbance at 450 nm is directly related to the concentration of VASP -P contained in 
the sample.PGE1 increases VASP -P levels by [CONTACT_8291]. Binding of ADP 
to P2Y12 leads to Gi -coupled inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Therefore, the  addition of ADP to 
PGE1 -stimulated platelets reduces PGE1 -induced VASP -P levels. If P2Y12 receptors are 
successfully inhibited, addition of ADP will not reduce the PGE1 -stimulated VASP -P levels. The 
platelet reactivity index (PRI) will be calculated after  measuring VASP -P levels.  
3) Total Thrombus -Formation Analysis System (T -TAS):  T-TAS is an automated microchip flow 
chamber system for  the quantitative analysis of the thrombus formation process under blood flow 
conditions. T -TAS allows measurement of thrombus formation using the PL -chip (Diapharma, 
West Chester Township, OH) [ 34]. The PL -chip contains 25 capi[INVESTIGATOR_181831] (width 40 μm, 
depth 40 μm) coated with type I collagen and is specifically designed for quantitative analysis of 
platelet thrombus formation, including platelet adhesion and aggregation, granule secretion, and 
thrombus growth in the absence of coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. In measurements using 
the PL -chip, a blood sample collected in a hirudin containing blood sampling tube. The platelet 
aggregates gradually increase in size and, in the process, occlude the capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], resulting in an 
increase in flow pressure. In the present study, total platelet -derived thrombogenicity is 
expressed as the area under the flow pressure curve fo r the first [ADDRESS_214602] -chip tested at a 
Version 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
13 
 flow rate of 18 μL/min (PL18 -AUC10). Low PL18 -AUC10 reflect reduced thrombus growth and 
rapid breakdown of the thrombus.  
 
3) Pharmacokinetic (PK) assay : Determination of prasugrel’s active metabolite concentra tion in 
plasma will be performed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
according to standard protocols as previously described [ 27,35]. Blood will be draw n into 
standard EDTA tubes and within 30 seconds a derivatizing agent (3’ -methoxyp henacylbromide) 
will be added to capture and stabilize the active metabolite. The geometric mean area under the 
concentration -time curve through the sampling time of the last quantifiable prasugrel’s active 
metabolite concentration (AUC[[ADDRESS_214603]]) will be calculated and the maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) of Pras -AM will be recorded.  
4) P2Y 12 gene receptor level expression : Gene expression in platelets  will be performed using 
standard protocols. In particular,  purified platelets are dissolved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) 
and total RNA will be  extracted using RNA minipres kit (Zymos research) according to 
manufacturer’s protocol.  P2Y 12 mRNA expression will be measured with real -time PCR using 
SYBR green and s pecific primers as previously described [ 36].   
 
Study endpoints, sample size calculation and statistical analysis  
 The primary end point of the study will be the non-inferiority in PRU measured  at 4 
hours of cangrelor plus prasugrel concomitantly administered at the start of PCI  versus  prasugrel 
only administered at the start of PCI  (group 2 vs. group 1). Non-inferiority will be  assessed using 
a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in mean PRU between the two arms. Under the 
assumption of [ADDRESS_214604] 
Version 2. 
May 3, 2021  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
14 
 deviation of 50 PRU, a sample size of 2 2 patients per group will allow  for the 95% CI to stay 
within ± 45 PRU with a 90% power and alpha=0.05. Cons idering a 25% data attrition rate due to  
GPI [CONTACT_3225], hemolysis , drop out  or technical problems , 28 patients per group will  need to be 
randomized in order to  ensure complete available data for analysis.  Considering the 3 arms of 
treatment up to 84 patients will need to be randomized. The sample size of this study was 
established according to results of previous PD investigations [28,37]. In line with previously 
reported investigation s, 45 PRU was chosen f or the noninferiority margin for the upper 95% CI 
limit of the difference [29,30 ]. Group [ADDRESS_214605] of care for the transition from cangrelor to prasugre l. However, t he 
study will be powe red to assess non inferiority  of group 2 vs. group 1. Therefore, all other end 
points will be considered exploratory and will include  the comparisons of PD and PK 
parameters , and P2Y 12 gene receptor level expression  between all treatment arms at each time 
points, as well as the comparisons of rates of high on -treatment platelet reactivity (HPR). HPR 
will be defined as PRU>208 and PRI>50%, in line with consensus definitions [ 38].  
Conformity to the normal distribution will be  evaluated for continuous variables with the 
Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. For baseline characteristics, continuous variables will be  expressed as 
mean ± SD or median [IQR]. One -way analysis of variance or Kruskal -Wallis test will be  used to 
compare continuous variables. Chi -squared test will be used  to compare categorical variables 
among groups. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method with a general linear model, with 
treatment as the main effect and baseline values of platelet reactivity as a covariate, will be used 
to evaluate the primary end point as well as all between -group comparisons at each time point. 
Least -square mean (LSM) differences in PRU between group 1 and group 2  and the 
corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference will be  obtained to asses s non -inferiority based 
Version 2.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
15 
 on the ANCOVA model. Given the exploratory nature of comparisons for secondary end points, 
correction for multiple comparisons will not be performed. A 2-tailed p value of <0.05 will be  
considered to indicate a statistically signifi cant difference for all the analyses performed. 
Statistical analysis will be  performed using SPSS version 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
Illinois).   
The safety population will include all randomized patients exposed to study medication. 
The PD population will include all patients with PD data and without a major protocol deviation 
thought to affect significantly the PD  and PK of cangrelor or prasugrel . The PD population will 
be used for analysis of all primary and secondary end points . Erroneous ly treated patients (eg, 
those randomized to one treatment but actually given the other) will be accounted for based on 
the actual treatment received.  
 
Publication Strategy/Additional Information   
Subjects will be identified with a number and data collecti on sheets will all be stored in a 
locked area. Data will be kept for [ADDRESS_214606] (months 1 -17): we expect to 
randomize 5 subjects monthly and complete enrollment in 17 months (total: 84 subjects 
randomized). Months 18-[ADDRESS_214607] available major cardiovascular meeting (e.g. AHA, ACC, 
ESC), and final manuscript will be submitted to publication to one of major cardiovascular 
journals (e.g. JACC, Circulation, European Heart Journal).

[ADDRESS_214608] of cangrelor was bleeding. 
Severe/moderate bleeding occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving cangrelor, as compared to 0.6% 
of those receiving placebo. Other side effects include dyspnea (1.3%), worsening  renal function 
(3.2% of patients with severe renal impairment), and hypersensitivity (0.05%) [ 5]. In clinical 
trials, the most common clinical side effects of prasugrel were blurred vision, dizziness, 
headache, nervousness; infrequent events included intr acranial hemorrhage (0.79%) and severe 
neutropenia (< 0.1%). The most important adverse effect associated with the use of prasugrel is 
bleeding (2.4%) [39]. However, both cangrelor and prasugrel are standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_181832].  
All clinical events described above, if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and urgent revascularization procedure with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_181848]. Bleeding data will be collected using BARC definitions [ 40]. Clinical 
events will be evaluated by a local committee, comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), 
not directly involved in the research. In the event of a report of a serious a dverse event the local 
committee will meet and antiplatelet treatment management will be managed according to 
physician recommendation.

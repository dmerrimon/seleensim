1.0  OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
• To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of  bemcentinib  
administered with the standard dose of docetaxel in patients with NSCLC . 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To determine the response rate, progression -free survival and overall survival of  bemc entinib  
therapy in combination with docetaxel in patients with NSCLC.  
• To determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of  bemcentinib  alone and in combination 
with docetaxel . 
• To assess the PK of docetaxel in combination with  bemcentinib . 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES  
2.1  Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer -related deaths worldwide with an estimated incidence of 
1.6 million cases resulting in 1.4 million deaths in annually .1  Non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
represents 80 -85% of cases, and adenocarcinoma is the most common histology .2  The majority of NSCLC 
patients present with advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to surgical resection.  Platinum -
based combination chemotherapy has reached a therapeutic plateau with a median overall survival (OS) of 
7.4 to 9.9 months.   
2.2  Second -Line Chemotherapy for Advanced NSCLC  
There exists a critical need to improve second -line therapy for advanced non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Currently, three  drugs are FDA approved for this indication: docetaxel, pemetrexed, and 
erlotinib. In unselected lung cancer populations, these agents have radiographic response rates less than 
10%, median progression -free survival ranging 2.2 -2.9 months, and median overa ll survival ranging 6.7 -
8.3 months.1-3 In 2014, clinical practice has evolved to the point that use of pemetrexed is restricted to 
nonsquamous histology (based on differential efficacy according to histology that has been attributed to 
differential levels and activity of thymidylate synthase) and is commonly used as a first -line and/or 
maintenance agent rather than a second -line agent. Regarding erlotinib, its current clinical use is largely 
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  9   
 
 
   restricted to patients with activating epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) gene mutations, where it is 
commonly employed as first -line therapy. As a result, both on protocol and in standard practice, docetaxel 
has emerged as the predominant second -line therapy for this challenging disease.   Recently, the addition of 
the vascular endothelial growth factor  receptor (VEGFR) monoclonal antibody ramucirumab to docetaxel 
chemotherapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes slightly.3 
2.3  Axl  
Axl is a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor  tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulate 
multiple cellular processes.  These include cell survival, proliferation, and migration.  Mer and Axl share 
the natural ligand Gas6, which binds Axl with 3 -10 fold greater intensity than Mer.4  The role of these RTKs 
in normal physiology appears related to clearance of apoptotic cells, cytokine secretion, platelet 
aggregation, erythropoiesis, and natural killer cell differentiation and maturation.5-8   
 
The oncogenic potential of Axl has been attributed to autocrine and paracrine functions.  In addition to 
signaling through canonica l PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways, Axl may also mediate tumor -stromal cell 
interactions, resulting in modification of the inflammatory response and angiogenesis.9,10  Recently, Axl 
has also been implicated in epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes metastasis and 
giving cells the ability to migrate through extracellular matrix and intravasate into blood vessels.11   
In non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Axl expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, lymph 
node involvement, and higher disease stage.[ADDRESS_963901] been detected at high levels in 
more  than 50% of NSCLC cell lines.[ADDRESS_963902] highly phosphorylated (ie, activated) RTKs in NSCLC cell lines and tumors.14,[ADDRESS_963903] cancer ,17 and esophageal adenocarcinoma .18 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_494514] (EMT) is a 
common mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy, including resistance to docetaxel. Axl activation causes 
EMT19, while inhibition of Axl can reverse mesenchymal phenotype, thereby [CONTACT_709012].  
2.4   Bemcentinib  (BGB324)  
 
Bemcentinib  (BGB324) is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein 
kinase receptor that is over -expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has been identified as a marker  
of a poor prognosis in patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

non-clinical and clinical data available on bemcentinib .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Inhibition of Proliferation of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells  
The anti -proliferative activity of  bemcentinib  was demonstrated in a panel of human NSCLC cell lines by 
[CONTACT_144284].  As summarized in Table 2, bemcentinib  
inhibited proliferation of several human lung cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 0.4 - 0.8 μM; the anti-
proliferative effect was dose -responsive (not shown).

The ability of bemcentinib  to inhibit cell proliferation was investigated in a panel of 654 human tumor cell 
lines.  When administered at a concentration of 1µM, bemcentinib  inhibited proliferation by >50% in 48 of 
the cell lines tested, including 10/101 N SCLC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bemcentinib  and corticosteroids  
 
In an academic model of osteoporosis, bemcentinib  was administered in combination with high dose 
corticosteroids (12.5 mg/kg per day of prednisolone). In this research study, [ADDRESS_963904] is currently under investigation. 
The mice received very high levels of corticosteroids to induce rapid onset of osteoporosis – on a mg/kg 
basis, the corticosteroid dose was 20 -fold higher than a typi[INVESTIGATOR_708993]. Additionally, the dose of bemcentinib  used in this model was 50mg/kg , which is [ADDRESS_963905] year, it has 
been established that effects of steroids are not exacerbated by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of bemcentinib .

   However investigators are encouraged to follow their local guidelines for monitoring i f a patient 
requires treatment with high dose steroids. If required, additional advice on the concomitant use 
of steroids with bemcentinib  should be obtained from the appointed study Medical Monitor. (See 
Sections 6.5.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] of IB, version 12.)  
2.4.2  Clinical Studies with Bemcentinib  
There has been one previous clinical study conducted with  bemcentinib  (Protocol BGBC001).  This study 
explored the effect of a single administration of  bemcentinib  in healthy male volunteers.  Eight dose levels 
(50 mg,  100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg) were evaluated under fasted 
conditions in cohorts of four subjects (32 subjects in total).  Seven of these subjects went on to receive a 
single administration of the same dose of  bemcentinib  under fed conditions.  
In general, exposure to  bemcentinib  was well tolerated with all toxicities being spontaneously reversible 
and predominantly gastrointestinal in nature.  No serious adverse events were reported.  Adverse events 
judged as related to bemcen tinib are summarized in Table 3.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ECG Findings  
In light of the recoverable, non -adverse decreases in heart rate and corresponding increases in the RR 
interval durations observed in the cardiovascular study in monkeys, each subject in Study BGBC001 
underwent serial ECG assessment after administration of  bemcentinib .  The overall pattern indicated that

   bemcentinib  administration was accompanied by a variable increase in QTcF, the magnitude of which was 
related to systemic exposure.  The maximum QTcF recorded was Grade 1 in severity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bemcentinib  Pharmacokinetics  
 
In Clinical Study BGBC004  (A Multi -Center Open -Label  Phase  I/2 Study  of bemcentinib  in Combination  
with Erlotinib  in Patients  with Stage  IIIb or Stage  IV Non-Small  Cell Lung  Cancer ), plasma concentration 
profiles of bemcentinib  have been modelled (first -order absorption, one -compartment disposition) from 
seven  patients administered 600  mg/200 mg bemcentinib  as monotherapy . In general, the PK model 
adequately fitted the individual pla sma profile, with generally good precision of estimated parameters.  
PK parameters, at steady state, for seven  patients administered 200 mg bemcentinib  daily are summari zed 
in Table 4.

chimera causes synergistic cell death in cell lines exposed to docetaxe l. Similarly, Axl inhibition with R428 
increases cell susceptibility to other antimitotic agents, such as inhibitors of Aurora kinase and polo kinase.  
The anti -tumor activity of R428 in combination with docetaxel was evaluated in the human MDA -MB231 
xenogr aft model.  Treatment was initiated when tumors reached 100 -200 mm3.  Mice were treated with 
vehicle control, R428 alone at 125 mg/kg orally 5 times a week, docetaxel at 10 mg/kg once a week 
intravenously or combination of the two. While neither treatment alone had significant effect on tumor 
growth in this docetaxel -resistant tumors, combination of R428 and docetaxel resulted in significant 
(p<0.005) anti -tumor activity.[ADDRESS_963909] cancer, respecti vely.21,22 Axl is known to cause activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. This process is 
inhibited by R428.  
Given excellent syner gistic effect of docetaxel and Axl inhibition in NSCLC and a good tolerance of A xl 
inhibitor, bemcentinib , the current phase I trial of the combination of docetaxel and bemcentinib  was 
designed.

Administration of bemcentinib  three times per week is expected to achieve a similar weekly steady state as 
a 7 days per week daily dosing. As shown in Figure 2B, administration of 467 mg bemcentinib  three times 
per week (a total of 1400 mg a week) should achieve  a similar steady as 200 mg bemcentinib  daily 
administrat ion (a total of 1400 mg a week).  Therefore, administration of 100 mg bemcentinib  thrice weekly 
(300 mg a week) is expected to  achieve a similar steady state as administration of 43 mg bemcentinib  daily 
(300 mg a week).  
 
2.5.3  Study Design  
This is a multi -center, open -label Phase I study on  bemcentinib  in combination with docetaxe l in advanced 
NSCLC. The study will be conducted at up to 2 clinical sites in the US.   
The study is designed to determine the maximum dose of bemcentinib  that can be safe ly administered in 
combination with docetaxel.   It is anticipated that a minimum  of two bemcentinib  dose levels will be 
evaluated, with up to approximately 12 patients enrolled  (6 per cohort if expansion required) in the dose -
escalation phase .  Including a n expansion cohort, a maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled on this trial.  
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients will be allowed to continue receiving bemcentinib  in 
combination with docetaxel until disease progression.   
The starting dose o f docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2 given IV every 21 days , with dose de -escalation  to 60 
mg/m2 IV q21 days if the starting  dose exceeds the MTD . The dose of bemcentinib  will be escalated in a 
standard 3+3 fashion until an MTD or the RP2D is reached.   At the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 
an additional 18-24 patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort, for a total accrual of 30 patients .

   administration  starting with Cycle 1. Specifically , treatment -emergent neutropenia durin g 
Cycle 1 led to myeloid growth factor use starting in Cycle 2 for nine of 19 patients. 
Although the degree of observed neutropenia did not necessarily constitue a dose limiting 
toxicity, it became apparent that serial administration of this regimen would not be 
practical . In modifying the protocol, it was also recognized that some patients may not 
tolerate or require ongoing myeloid growth factors over time, either because they are less 
susceptible to cytopenias or undergo treatment dose reductions for non -hematologic 
reasons. Accordingly, allowance has been made for discontinuation of growth factors with 
subsequent treatment cycles.   DRUG  INFORMATION  
After registration, all eligible patients will receive the combination regimen of  bemcentinib  and docetaxe l 
as described in the study design .  
3.1  Bemcentinib

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND RULES FOR DOSE ESCALATION /DE-ESCALATION  
Rules for dose escalation , de-escalation , dose expansion, and termination of escalation are given below.  
Patient enrollment, adverse events relevant to dose escalation, and toxicity follow -up will be recorded in a 
Phase [ADDRESS_963928] been met.  The Phase 1  Tracking 
log is m aintained at the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and is kept current on a weekly basis.  
Toxicity will be assessed and reported on all patients who begin to receive treatment.  Patients who do not 
complete the first cycle (for any reason other than toxicity  or tolerability of the regimen) and who do not 
experience toxicity will not be counted as having successfully completed one cycle and will be considered 
unevaluable  for toxicity.  All patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.  
A standar d 3 + 3 design will be used; the usual rules for dose escalation, expansion, and de -escalation will 
apply based on patients who are “evaluable for toxicity .”  Dose escalation decisions will be based on 
toxicities  observed during cycl e 1 (7-day lead -in plus  21-day combination period) of treatment.     
For all patients receiving more than one cycle of therapy, toxicities will continue to be monitored and 
recorded; for all patients who are classified as not “evaluable for toxicity, ” all toxicities will be moni tored 
and recorded.  
6.1  Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03 (See Appendix  B) during the first cycle of treatment ( 7-day lead -in plus 
21 days  of combination therapy ) for the purposes of establishing the MTD and RP2D of bemcentinib  in 
combination with the standard dose of docetaxel.  DLTs will include:   
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_708998] 
• Any other Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity that is considered to be clinically significant and 
causally related to bemcentinib  or the combination of docetaxel + bemcentinib  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
• Grade 4 neutropenia persisting for seven days or more  (despi[INVESTIGATOR_708999])  
• Treatment discontinuation or dose reduction for more than [ADDRESS_963929] complete one 21 -day cycle of treatment 
before a dose -escalation evaluation is made.  To be co nsidered as informative to support dose escalation of 
the loading dose ( Days -7, -6, and -5), a patient must receive three loading doses.  To be considered as 
informative to support dose escalation of the daily dose, a patient must miss no more than 3 dail y doses 
(including the lead -in period).  Patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.

[ADDRESS_963930] treatment c ycle will be used in the decision to 
dose escalate, expand, or de -escalate.  
Treatment will be discontinued if a patient experiences a DLT which does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or 
baseline (if higher) prior to the next cycle , or wh ich, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_156700], is likely to recur on 
subsequent treatment.  
6.2 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which none or only one patient 
experienced DLT attributable to the study protocol, when at least six patients were treated at that dose level 
and are evaluable for toxicity.  The MTD  is one dose level below the lowest dose tested in which [ADDRESS_963931] 6 patients will be treated at the MTD.   
Once the MTD has been established (and presumably this will be the do se selec ted for further phase 2  
testing —ie, recommended phase 2 dose [RP2D] ), up to an additional 12 patients will be treated at that dose 
level.  The experience of patients treated in  this expan sion cohort  will be used to (a) better estimate the true 
proportion o f patients who cannot complete the first c ycle of therapy at the MTD, (b) obtain additional 
preliminary activity  data (c) obtain additional pharmacokinetic data, and (d) obtain additional 
pharmacodynamic da ta. 
6.3 Dose Escalation /De-Escalation  Schedule  
The docetaxel dose will be fixed at the standard intravenous dose of 75 mg/m2 every 21 days , or 60 mg/m2 
every 21 days if de-escalation or dose reduction occurs .  
The dose levels of bemcentinib  are presented in Table 5; in each dose level, a loading dose of  bemcentinib  
will be administered during the first three  days of the run-in period prior to Cycle 1  (Days -7, -6, and -5), 
followed by a lower daily maintenance dose during the remainder of the run -in period and thro ughout 
continuous [ADDRESS_963932] 
3+3 study design as described below.  A minimum of 6 patients will be treated at the MTD or RP2D.

NOTE:   Cohort -1 (and potentially Cohort -2) will be enrolled only if Cohort 1 dosing exceeds the 
maximum tolerated dose.   
 
a. If Cohort -1 is enrolled without exceeding the MTD, bemcentinib  may be dose escalated to 400 mg 
daily on Days -7, -6, and -5, then 200 m g daily on subsequent days  (Cohort 2A) . 
 
b. If Cohort -1 or Cohort 2A is enrolled without exceeding the MTD, a subsequent cohort with 
docetaxel dose re -escalated to 75 mg/m2 every 21 days with concurrent myeloid growth factor 
support every cycle will be enrolled.  
 
*If dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is experienced during or at tributed to (ie, occurs shortly after) the 3 -day 
loading period, dose de -escalation will occur as follows without adjustment of daily maintenance dose:  
 
Level 1:  loading dose x 3 days  
Level -1:  loading dose x 2 days  
Level -2:  loading dose x 1 day  
Level -3:  no loading dose; initiate treatment with standard daily dose  
 
This is a single -arm phase [ADDRESS_963933] 3+3 schema with 
a planned expansion cohort of up to 12 additional patients at the recommen ded phase 2 dose (RP2D).  At 
least [ADDRESS_963934] receive all three days of the loading dose an d 
miss no more than 3 daily doses in Cycle 1 in order to be considered as informative to support dose 
escalation.  
The decision to dose escalate (or not) will be made by [CONTACT_709015] (SMC).  
Minutes of the SMC meeting will be recorde d and circulated for final approval before being placed in the 
Trial Master File (TMF).  The decision to dose escalate will be based on the safety and tolerability of  
bemcentinib  observed in the first cycle of treatment.   
Three patients will be treated a t each dose level unless DLT criteria are exceeded.  If 0/[ADDRESS_963935] 
and the next lower dose cohort will be explored, according to the Table 6 . The maximum dose at which no 
more than one out of three or one out of six patient experienced DLT, will be nominated as the MTD.  A 
recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) will be established; the RP2D may be lower than the MTD but will 
not be higher than the  MTD.  A minimum of 6 patients will be treated at the RP2D.

   NOTE: DLTs experienced during or attributed to (ie, occurs shortly after) the 3 -day loading period will be 
interpreted and responded to independently of DLTs occurring during daily maintenance dosing.  Separate 
dose de -escalation levels will be applied (see Table 8A).   
If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn for reasons other than DLT prior to completing Cycle 1, the patient 
will be replaced for the purposes of evaluation of MTD.  The operating ch aracteristics of the 3+3 dose

NOTES : 
 
• If treatment -related toxicity has not resolved to Grade ≤1 or to baseline (with the exception of 
alopecia) within 14 days, discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_709020].  
• Dose reduction below 100 mg daily is not possible  (a single capsule contains 100 mg bemcentinib).  
• If bemcentinib dose has been decreased to 100 m g daily, it may be reescalated to starting dose of 
200 mg daily following adequate recovery from toxicity per investigator discretion.   
 
If one week or more elapses without administration of bemcentinib , the loading doses for the cohort to 
which the patie nt is assigned should be repeated when treatment is re -initiated.

In clinical study BGBC001, evidence of bemcentinib  exposure -related QTc F prolongation was observed.  
In order to reduce the risk of QTc F prolongation, efforts should be made to maintain the patient’s serum 
potassium levels at >4 mmol/L during treatment with bemcentinib  and for 2 weeks following 
completion of therapy.  Serum calcium and magnesium should be measured and reasonable efforts 
made to maintain at normal levels throughout treatme nt.  Patients with a QTc F of >480 ms should be 
closely monitored until the QTc F falls below 480 ms ; electrolytes  should be measured and corrected as 
necessary.  
 
Triplicate 12 -lead ECG, 5 minutes apart, after resting for ≥10 minutes in supi[INVESTIGATOR_709001] (pre -dose). On Cycle [ADDRESS_963959] ECGs performed according to this schedule . 
  
If a patient experiences QTc F prolongation despi[INVESTIGATOR_709002],  
bemcentinib  dosing should be  modified as out lined in Table 8.  
 
QT interval will be corrected using Friderica’s calculation

Notes:  
• Electrolytes should be measured at the time of reporting QTc prolongation, and regularly until the QTc has returned to 
baseline.  Any clinically significant electrolytes should be corrected. The mean QTcF value from  triplicate ECG  readings 
should be used when considering dose modification  
• Treatment interruption for bemcentinib -related toxicity should be limited to 14 days  
• Dose reduction below 100 mg daily is not possible (a single capsule contains 100 mg bemcentinib)  
• Patients being considered for dose reduction  or permanent discontinuation of bemcentinib may be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor

   Each cycle of chemotherapy may be delayed until the ANC is ≥ 1500 cells/μL and the platelet count is ≥ 
100,000 cells/μL and hepatic function is acceptable. Institutional standard practices may be used to adjust 
doses for toxicity. However, in the absence of such standard practices, suggested dose adjustments for 
docetaxel -related hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities are provided in Table 9 and Table 10, 
respectively.  
 
Table 9. Dose Adjustments for Docetaxel -related Hematologic Toxicities * 
 
Situation  Recommended 
Docetaxel Dose  
First epi[INVESTIGATOR_709003] 1 dose level  
Second epi[INVESTIGATOR_709004] <500/mm3 reduce one dose level  
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or bleeding associated 
with thrombocytopenia  reduce one dose level.  
ANC= absolute neutrophil count  
 
NOTE:  due to the occurrence of neutropenia considered dose -limiting or neutropenia complicating the 
feasibility of long -term treatment administration in earlier cohorts,  starting with patients enrolled on 
protocol Version 5.0 or later, patients receiving docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and/or bemcentinib  maintenance 
dose of [ADDRESS_963960] receive myeloid growth factors (eg, G -CSF, preferably pegylated G -CSF).  In 
certain cases, myeloid growth factors may be omitted from subsequent treatment cycles. Examples  
include intolerance of myeloid growth factors, dose -reduction of docetaxel, or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] [based on 
available laboratory and clinical data] that patient would tolerate treatment and not develop severe 
neutropenia if myeloid growth factors were omitted.

In addition to the dose adjustments, patients may receive supp ortive care as necessary.23,24  Patients 
experiencing febrile neutropenia secondary to docetaxel chemotherapy may receive  granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor therapy in association with subsequent chemotherapy  doses. Erythropoietin may also be 
used as clinically indicated, along with other supportive  care.   
 
If Cohort -1 or Cohort -2 is enrolled without exceeding the MTD, a subsequent cohort with docetax el 
dose re -escalated to 75 mg/m2 every 21 days with concurrent myeloid growth factor support every cycle 
will be enrolled.  
 
Dose re -escalation may be considered on a case -by-case basis.

In cases where docetaxel  or bemcentinib is permanently discontinued for toxicity reasons, the other 
agent(s) may be continued provided that (a) the patient is tolerating their ongoing administration, and (b) 
there is evidence of ongoing clinical benefit.  
9.0 TOXICITY REPORTING AND ASSESSMENT  
It is the responsibility of each treating institut ion to report all adverse events to the clinical  monitor of this 
IND and the IND sponsor . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_709005]  
(see Section 9.3). 
 
In accordance with good clinical practices, all adverse events and all dose escalations will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_709021] (SPOC) Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  The 
SPOC DSMC will record these discu ssions and decisions in the SPOC Phase I tracking log.  This 
information will be made available as needed.  
9.1 Reporting Toxicities  
Using the Notificatio n of Toxicity form in Appendix C, report to the SPOC Consortium Manager (office 
phone: 806 -743-2690, cell p hone:  806 -773-4836 FAX: 806 -743-2691, e -mail: [EMAIL_13583]) 
within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event : 
• All serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• All dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs)  
• All unexpected adverse events deemed possibly, probably, or definitely  related to 
study drugs or procedures  
The SPOC DSMC will review all serious adverse events and unexpected adverse events in real time with 
other members of the DSMC by [CONTACT_709022].  This Phase I trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_709023], before any dose escalation, with each new event, or at least annually.  Meeting 
minutes will document these reviews and will be made available as needed.  A description of the SPOC 
DSMC is contained in the SPOC “Standard Operating Procedure for the SPOC DSMC.  
 
All toxicities should be reported, whether or not they are attributable to the study drugs .  All life -
threatening toxicities mandate a telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the event between the reporting 
institution’s principal investig ator (PI) and the PI’s or their designates of the other participating 
institutions.   
 
Any supporting documentation (i.e., laboratory, pathology, progress notes, discharge summary, autopsy, 
etc.) explaining the AE should accompany the submitted report.

discontinuation from the study, must be followed until any  of the following occur:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline status  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than study treatment or to factors unrelated to study 
conduct  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional informa tion can be obtained  
 
9.2.2  Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Expedited safety reporting within this clinical study complies with the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting (E2A),  investigational new drug 
(IND) application safety reporting (under 21CFR312.32), and with applicable local regulatory 
requirements.  
The sponsor of the IND assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the Regulatory 
Authorities and Institutio nal Review Boards (IRB).  Although this responsibility can be delegated, the 
sponsor of the IND retains ultimate responsibility for safety reporting.   
 
All SAEs that are unexpected and associated with the use of the investigational product are classified as 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and must be reported to the IRBs and Regulatory 
Authorities  within 7 calendar days if fatal or life threatening, or within 15 calendar days if non -life 
threatening and non -fatal.  The Sponsor/desig nee must also report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to all investigational sites.  
 
Any safety information from other observations that could change the risk -benefit evaluation of  
bemcentinib  should be promptly communicated to the Regulatory Authorities and IRBs.  Any other 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs associated with bemcentinib  should be reported as soon as the Sponsor becomes aware of them, 
including S[LOCATION_003]Rs which occur in another clinical study conducted by [CONTACT_709028], a publication, or which are transmitted to the sponsor by [CONTACT_709029].  
 
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  46   
 
 
   Other safety issues that also qualify for expedited reporting where they might materially alter the curre nt 
benefit -risk assessment of the bemcentinib  (sufficient to consider changes in the administration or in the 
overall conduct of the trial), include:  
• An increase in the rate of occurrence of an expected serious adverse reaction, which is judged to 
be clini cally important  
• Post-study S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occur after the patient has completed a clinical trial and are reported by 
[CONTACT_67852]  
• New events relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of bemcentinib  likely to affect 
the safety of the patients, such as:  
o An SAE which could be associated with study procedures and which could modify the 
conduct of the study  
o A major safety finding which differs from the underlying disease  
 
Expedited reporting is not usually required for reactions whi ch are serious but expected, and it is 
inappropriate to report events that are considered unrelated to the investigational product.  
 
The cause of death of a patient in a clinical study, unless it is associated with disease progression, is 
considered a SAE whether the event is expected or associated with the investigational agent.

[EMAIL_3487]  )  by [CONTACT_709030] a Pregnancy Notification For m. 
 
The reporting period for pregnancies will start with the first study -related procedure and end 28 days after 
the final administration of bemcentinib . 
 
Any female patients who become pregnant while taking part in the study will be withdrawn; a male pati ent 
whose partner becomes pregnant can remain in the study.  A patient who completes or withdraws from the 
trial before the full term of the pregnancy will be asked to consent to provision of follow -up information 
about the pregnancy and its outcome.  
9.3 Adverse Event s  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with its treatment.  An AE can t herefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  47   
 
 
   NOTE: Abnormal vital sign s that are considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_709031].  
9.3.1 Serious Adverse Event s 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any AE occurring at any dose that meets 1 or more of the following 
criteria as assessed by [CONTACT_709032]:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening event - an AE is considered to be life -threatening if either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor determines the occurrence of the event places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It does 
not refer to an AE that, if it occurred in a more severe form, may have resulted in death.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138820] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709007]  ≥24 hours .  Any pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709008].  
• Results in a significant incapa city or disruption of the ability to conduct normal life activities.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Important medical event - any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that when based upon 
medical judgment jeopardizes the pati ent and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed in the definition of “SAE.”  
NOTE:  If standard of care or institutional practice requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709009].  However, should an SAE develop during such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it will be considered 
and reported as such.  
NOTE:  All pregnancies occurring during this study are r eported in the same timeframe as SAEs.  If a 
pregnancy is confirmed during the study, the continued use of the study drug must be immediately 
evaluated.  When possible, all reports of pregnancy must be followed for information regarding the course 
of the p regnancy and delivery, as well as the condition of the newborn or other outcome.  Follow -up 
information concerning the outcome of the pregnancy will be provided by [CONTACT_709033] a timely manner and regardless of whether t he patient has discontinued participation in 
the study.  If the newborn is healthy, additional follow up is not needed.     
9.3.[ADDRESS_963965] for each AE (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related).  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_709034].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a 
relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product 
and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  Definitions of the relationship 
of an AE to the use of the study medication are as follows:  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly not related  to study treatment.  An AE for which suf ficient information 
exists to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to the study drug.  The etiology must be specified.  
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  48   
 
 
   • Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to study treatment.  The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_709035]’s clinical condition, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs 
administered to the patient and it does not follow a known response pattern to the study drug.  
• Possibly - The AE may be related  to study treatment.  The event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the time of drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study 
drug, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_185888] t he patient’s clinical condition, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the patient.  
• Probably - The AE is likely related  to study treatment.  The event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the time of drug administration, an d follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical condition, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the patient.  
• Definitely - The AE is clearly related to study treatment.  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug; follows a known response pattern to the drug; and, 
when appropriate to the protocol, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_1478] (de -challenge) 
and reappearance of the reaction after repeat exposure (re -challenge); and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
10.[ADDRESS_963966] c ycle, or who experience dose limiting 
toxicity.  Patients who complete one c ycle of treatment will be included in the analysis of tumor response.   
The outcome status (in terms of toxicity, response, reason off study, progression, and survival) of all eligible 
patients will be reported.  Patients who begin treatment will be accounted for in the summaries of toxicity.  
All patients who complete  the first course of treatment will be included in the analysis of survival and time -
to-failure.   
10.1 Key Definitions  
10.1.1  Measurable Disease  
• Measurable non -nodal lesions: those that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (LD) to 
be recorded as ≥[ADDRESS_963967] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  
• Malignant lymph nodes:  to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
measure ≥15 mm in the short axis (SA) when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  
• It is recommended that slice gaps not be utilized for the image acquisition procedures.  
• Superficial lesions (eg, skin lesions) on physical exam will not be considered radiographically 
measurable unless they are measurable on CT o r MRI.  
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  49   
 
 
   • All radiographic measurements should be taken and recorded in millimeters utilizing an electronic 
measurement method based on lesion boundary definition.  
• Lesions on chest X -ray will not be considered measurable.  
10.1.2  Non-Measurable Disease  
All other le sions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (LD<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes ≥10 
mm to <15 mm in the SA) as well as truly non -measurable lesions are considered non -measurable disease.  
Lesions considered truly non -measurable include:  leptome ningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].  
10.1.3  Target Lesions  
• Target lesions must be measurable lesions.  
• All lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all 
involved organs, will be identified as target lesions, recorded and measured at baseline, and followed 
consistently throughout the study.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (based on LD fo r non -nodal lesions or SA 
for lymph nodes), their suitability for accurate repeated measurements, and on their being most 
representative of the patient’s tumor burden.  
• A sum of the diameters for all target lesions will be calculated and reported for each t ime point.  The 
baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference by [CONTACT_709036].  
• Brain lesions that were previously irradiated cannot be recorded as target lesions.  Stable brain 
lesions post radiotherapy s hould be documented as non -target lesions.  At post -baseline evaluations, 
the brain lesions should be marked as “Not done” if a brain scan was not done, as follow -up brain 
scans are only required when clinically indicated.  
• Bone lesions should be recorded a s non -target lesions regardless of irradiation treatment status.   
10.1.4  Non-Target Lesions  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease, including any measurable lesions that were not selected as target 
lesions) will be identified as non-target  lesions  and indicated as present at baseline.  
• It is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item (eg, 
multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes or multiple liver metastases).  
• Measurements of these non -target lesions will not be performed, but the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of these lesions should be noted throughout follow -up assessments.  
10.1.5  New Lesions  
• The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (ie, not attributable to differences in scanning 
technique, change in ima ging modality, etc.).  
• If a new lesion is equivocal (ie, because of its small size), and follow -up imaging confirms that it is 
definitely a new lesion, the progression of that new lesion is from the time it was seen on the initial 
scan.   
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  50   
 
 
   • A lesion identifie d on a follow -up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
• A lesion that reappears at follow up after a PR or SD is not considered new.  The lesion’s LD (or SA 
for lymp h nodes) is added back into the sum of diameters.   
• A lesion that reappears at follow up after a complete response (CR) is automatically considered PD.  
10.1.6  Lymph Nodes  
• At baseline, lymph nodes with tumor burden will be considered as target lesions if the SA is  ≥ 15 mm.   
• At baseline, lymph nodes will be considered as non -target lesions if the SA is ≥10 mm and < 15 mm.  
• At baseline, lymph nodes will be considered as normal if the SA is <10 mm.  
• At follow up, a lymph node must measure ≥[ADDRESS_963968] that they can no longer be 
separated by [CONTACT_320205], the LD or SA of the merged lesion should be measured.  
10.2.4  Measurement of Small Lesions on Follow -up Scans  
Non-Nodal  
A non -nodal tar get lesion that is present but too small to measure (TSTM) accurately at evaluations after 
baseline (< 5 mm but greater than 0 mm in unilateral dimension) will be classified as TSTM and will be 
assigned a value of [ADDRESS_963969] 
actual size recorded (ie, ≥ 5 mm).  
Lymph Nodes  
A target lymph node should always have the actual SA measurement recorded, even if the lymph node 
regresses to <10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes a re included as target lesions, the sum 
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  51   
 
 
   of diameters may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having 
an SA of <10 mm.  
10.3 Response Criteria  
10.3.1  Target Lesion Response Criteria  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance (or no rmalization) of all target lesions.  
o Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in SA to <10 
mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking  as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.   
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is  the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  
• Non-evaluable (NE):  Patient time points that have inadequate or missing images, including the 
inability to visualiz e >25% of target disease.  
10.3.2  Non-Target Lesion Response Criteria   
• CR: Disappearance (or normalization) of all non -target  lesions.  All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (< 10 mm SA).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s).  
• PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.   
• NE: Patient time points that have inadequate or missing images, including the inability to visualize > 
50% of non -target disease.  
• No Disease (ND): No non -target disease noted.  The absence of non -target lesions at follow -up time 
points is designated as ND and not SD when there is no non -target disease noted at baseline.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_963970] PD overall.  
10.3.4  Response Assessmen t in Case of Missing or Technically Inadequate Scans  
If no lesions were identified at baseline in a specific body region (eg, chest, abdomen) and the scan of that 
body region is unavailable or technically inadequate at follow up, then the response assessme nt will be 
based on the scans of the other regions.  
10.4 Response Definitions  
10.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions  
 
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
22 July 2020  52   
 
 
   Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum LD  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):    At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD 
recorded since the treatment started or the appearance 
of one or more new lesions  
 
Stable Disease (SD):    Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started  
 
10.4.2  Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):    Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level  
 
 Incomplete Response/     
 Stable Disease (SD):     Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  
or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/ or 
unequivocal  progression of existing non -target 
lesions  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_390205], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by 
[CONTACT_463] (or study chair).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_963971] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the t reatment started).  The patient’s  best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria (see Section  10.4.4  ).

Note:  
• Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after disconti nuation of treatment.  
•  In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine n eedle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the 
complete response status.  
 
10.4.4  Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
 
Confirmation  
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_118116] [ADDRESS_963972] once after study entry at a minimum interval of 4 weeks.  
 
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is 
measured from the time measurement criter ia are first met for CR until the first date that 
recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression 
are met, taking as reference the smalle st measurements recorded since the treatment started.

22 July 2020  55   
 
 
   12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 General considerations  
This is a Phase I and pharmacologic study.  The South Plains Oncology C onsortium (SPOC) will be the 
coordinating center for this study; SPOC will be responsible for registering patients (Section 5.2 and 
Appendix A) and for maintaining a complete database of the study information (Section 14.0).  
12.2 Analysis of Clinical Endpoints  
The design of this Phase I trial is described in Section 6.0; the definition of MTD is given in Section 6.2 
and the rules for dose escalation are given in Sections 6.3.  
The toxicities observed at each dose level will be summarized in terms of ty pe (organ affected or laboratory 
determination such as absolute neutrophil c ount), severity (by [CONTACT_4652] v4 .0 and nadir or maximum 
values for the laboratory measures), time of onset (i.e., cycle number), duration, and reversibility or 
outcome.   
Tables wi ll be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects by [CONTACT_709038]. Toxicities will 
be reported for all patients receiving study drug. Baseline information (e.g., the extent of prior therapy) and 
demographic information will be presented to describe the patients treated in this Phase I study.  All 
responses will be reported.  Response rate with its 95% confidence interval will be estimated using the 
exact Binomial method. The response rate in this study population will be compared with that o f the 
historical control using the one -sample Binomial test. Progression -free survival and the overall survival 
will be summarized with Kaplan -Meier plots to describe the outcome of patients treated on this protocol.  
12.3 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Laborat ory Studies  
Pharmacokinetic data (i.e. plasma concentrations of  bemcentinib ) will be analyzed using compartmental 
and non -compartmental models using PCNONLIN™ version 4.[ADDRESS_963974] descriptive statis tics (means and standard deviations – possibly after transformation, if necessary 
- or medians and ranges). If appropriate, summary statistics will also be provided for the entire group of 
patients. The relative plasma levels of bemcentinib  will also be ta bulated and summarized. These levels 
will be compared with observed toxicities and clinical response in an exploratory manner. However, the 
heterogeneity of the patient population and the small number of patients treated at each dose make formal 
statistica l inference of these molecular studies unlikely.   
12.[ADDRESS_963975] one cycle of  bemcen tinib will be accounted for in the analysis; the reasons 
for going off study will be documented for each patient.  Baseline and demographic information will be 
documented for each patient.  Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type, severity,  time of 
onset, duration, reversibility, and outcome.  
Intention to treat analysis will be used to allow for drop -outs and withdrawals, so that data from all study 
participants will be analyzed.  This method will estimate without bias the effect of the trea tment policy on 
STU052015 -077, Gerber, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V5.0-07.23.20, Mod_23, 08 -17-20 (1)  Protocol version: 5.0 – dated 
[ADDRESS_963976] in patients who 
complete therapy.  
Depending on cohort expansion requirements, a total of 6-12 patients will be accrued to the dose-escalation 
phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], with another 18-24 patients accrued at the MTD for a total of 30 patients .  Since the trial 
population will be drawn from a multi -institution base, it is anticipated that accrual will be completed over 
18 to 30 months.  
12.6 Sample Size justification  
Enrolling 30 patients in the total study population will provide more than 80% power to detect an increase 
in response rate from 10% (historical control with docetaxel  monotherapy) to 25%, using the one -sample 
Binomial test with a one -sided alpha of 0.1.  If only those patients treated at the MTD are included 
(projected N=18 -24), we will have approximately 67% power to detect a similar increase in response rate , 
with a one -sided alpha of 0.1 .  The projected 15% absolute increase i n response rate is based on marked 
potentiation of taxane effects in in vitro models and a 50% improvement in tumor growth inhibition in 
preclinical xenograft studies.[ADDRESS_963977] complete the eligibility form an d the 
registration form and give (or FAX) copi[INVESTIGATOR_709010] (at 806 -743-2691).  The 
research nurse or data manager will call the SPOC Consortium Coordinator (at 806 -743-2690), and after 
verifying the eligibility, the SPOC Consortium  Coordinator will assign a study number, assign a dose, and 
register the patient onto the study.  See Appendix A (“Registration Procedures for Phase I Trials”).  
Informed Consent must be obtained before the patient is registered.  The FDA requires that both  the 
signature [CONTACT_709047]’s legally authorized representative, 
that the date be the actual date on which the form is signed, and that the informed consent process be 
documented in the physician’s progre ss notes or the nurse’s notes.  
13.1 Procedures for On -Study and Treatment Deviations.   
Any on -study or treatment deviations need to be discussed with and reported to SPOC and the Study Chair.   
14.0 RECORDS TO BE KEPT AND DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE  
14.1 Confidentiality of Records  
The original data collection forms will be stored at the originating institution .  A copy of all data forms will 
be maintained in secure files or electronically at the SPOC Operations Center.   
14.2 Patient Consent Form  
At the time of registration, will fax a copy of the  signed and dated informed consent and HIPAA documents 
to SPOC  (see registration procedures in Appendix A).

   14.3 Registration Eligibility Worksheet  
At the time of registration, the information requested on the On -Study/Eligib ility Form will be submitted 
to the Consortium Coordinator at SPOC as described in the Appendix A (“Registration Procedures for 
Phase I Trials”).  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_709039] .  All centers will submit data collected at their institution to the 
South Plains Oncology Cons ortium Operations Center (SPOC) .  A complete database will reside at SPOC.  
All data will be collected using SPOC data collection forms via the electronic database.  The original source 
data collection forms will reside at the orig inating institution in secure location.  
The data manager will complete the Registration Worksheet /Eligibility Form (a SPOC form which includes 
the eligibility checklist).  
Within two weeks of completion of the first cycle, the data manager must complete th e Phase I, Cycle I 
Toxicity form online.  
Within two weeks of registration, the data manager will complete and submit the On -Study Form in the 
database.  
Within two weeks of registration, the data manager will have electronically submitted to SPOC the 
follow ing information:  
 Treatment   
 Supplemental Data (if applicable)  
 Adverse Events  
 Response/Off -Study/Follow -Up  
Within two weeks of going off study, data manager will complete and submit to SPOC, the “Off -Study 
Summary” information.  
SPOC  may conduct on -site audits to verify submitted data against primary medical records and will provide 
periodic data summaries to the Protocol Chairman.  
15.0 MINORITIES AND WOMEN STATEMENT  
Patients of both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they m eet the eligibility 
criteria outlined in Section 5.0.  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism or disease response would be expected in one group compared to another.  Efforts will be made 
to accrue a representati ve sample.  However, since this is a Phase I trial, considerations for patient safety 
and a reluctance to expose patients either to a potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatment, will limit the 
total number of patients entered.  If differences in outcom e appear to be associated with gender or ethnic 
identity, then a follow -up study will be designed to investigate those differences more fully.

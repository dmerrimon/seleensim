1 INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon  for treatment of femoropopliteal  artery (SFA) in -stent restenosis (ISR) . 
1.1 CLINICAL  BACKGROUND  
In-stent restenosis remains a common problem , occurring in 20 -40% of patients within the first 
year following femoropopliteal artery stent placement.  Various tre atment modalities  have been 
utilized  for treatment  of SFA ISR;  including c utting balloons, additional stenting  and rotational 
or directional artherectomy , and laser . Although some treatments  have demonstrated initial 
technical  success, many add complexity to the interventional procedure, and all have 
documented  suboptimal patency rates at 12 months following treatment .1,2,3,4    
The principle mechanism in the development of primary atherosclerotic plaque in the SFA is 
thought to be quite different  from that of restenotic disease.  While white blood cells contribute 
considerably to primary plaque, restenotic lesions are  cellular, comprised mostly of smooth 
muscle c ells (SMC) .[ADDRESS_554075] of care treatment modalities for in ste nt 
restenosis are not proving to be effective over time.  The active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) 
of paclitaxel  on the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon is  known to inhibit smooth muscle cell 
proliferation and migration;[ADDRESS_554076] percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty ( PTA ).7,8 However,  only preliminary data is available  with DCBs in ISR.  
Medtronic’s In.Pact DCB has shown promising results in a single center registry trial9 using a 
similar DCB coated with the same paclitaxel API  [INVESTIGATOR_437286]® Drug Coated Balloon.   In 
summary, d espi[INVESTIGATOR_437287], few studies have been conducted 
regarding the effectiveness of endovascular interventions for ISR, and a durable treatment for

ISR remains elusive .10   The LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon is  being evaluated in this  clinical  
trial to provide a viable alternative to current standard of care.  
1.1.1 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE LUTONIX® DRUG COATED BALLOON  
[IP_ADDRESS]  THE LEVANT I FIRST IN MAN STUDY  
The LEVANT I trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) compared femoropopliteal treatment with the LUTONIX® 
Drug Coated Balloon to a standard PTA catheter (with and without stenting) in one hundred one 
subjects.  In the ITT population, the primary endpoint of mean late lumen loss at 6 months was 
significantly lower in the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon arm (0.46± 1.13) compared to the 
PTA arm (1.09±1.07), with a p value of 0.016, consistent with efficacy of LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon for this indication.  There were no unanticipated adverse device effects in the 
drug-coated balloon arm, and overall adverse event rates were similar to conventional uncoated 
balloon angioplasty. Secondary clinical endpoints trended in favor of the LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon arm, particularly TLR (12.8% vs. 22.2% in PTA arm) and target vessel 
revascularization (TVR) (12.8% vs. 32.6% ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  THE LEVANT [ADDRESS_554078] of care in a larger patient population at 
expanded clinical sites. Similar to LEVANT I, this study randomized treatment of patients with a 
symptomatic lesion in the SFA or popliteal artery to either the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon 
or standard balloon angioplasty.  Enrollment of 535 subjects (476 randomized - 2:1 DCB:POBA) ) 
was completed in July of 2012 and follow up is currently ongoing.     
Levant 2 met both pre -specified primary endpoints.   Primary patency for Lutonix DCB (65.2%) 
was superior to control PTA (52.6%, p= 0.015) at 12 months, demonstrating superior 
efficacy.   The primary safety endpoint success rate for Lutonix DCB (83.9%) was non -inferior to 
control PTA (79.0%, p = 0.005).    
Several seco ndary endpoints were also analyz ed but not hypothesis tested. Procedural success (< 
30% residual stenosis without SAE) was s imilar for Lutonix DCB and control PTA (88.9% vs. 
86.8%), demonstrating effectiveness at acute restoration of patency. Freedom from TLR was 87.7% 
for DCB compared to 83.2% for control PTA. The Rutherford scores, walking impairment (WIQ) 
scores, ABI, six mi nute walk test, and quality of life questionnaires each showed improvements 
from before treatment through 12 months in both treatment groups.  
Secondary safety endpoints were generally similar for Lutonix DCB and control PTA. These 
included, respectively, a ll-cause death (2.4% vs. 2.8%), amputation (0.3% vs. 0.0%), 
amputation -free survival (97.6% vs. 97.2%), thrombosis (0.4% vs. 0.7%), target vessel 
revascularization (TVR, 13.3% vs. 18.2%), cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (9.1% vs. 7.1%), and

major vascular c omplications (6.3% vs. 4.9%; defined as hematoma >5 cm, false aneurysm, AV 
fistula, retroperitoneal bleed, peripheral ischemia/nerve injury, transfusion).  Adverse events were 
similar for both treatment groups and consistent with historic data for the enrol led population 
with symptomatic PAD.  
Levant 2 successfully demonstrated superior efficacy and non -inferior safety of Lutonix DCB 
compared to control PTA.  
Levant 2 Continued Access ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and Safety ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) registries were initiated 
for collec tion of additional safety data after completion of Levant 2 enrol lment . Enrol lment  was 
completed on September 27, 2013.   A total of 657 subjects were enrolled at 63 sites across the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe (EU).  Clinical follow -up, monitoring, and CEC adjudications are 
ongoing.  
Together with the randomized study, n = [ADDRESS_554080] been treated with Lutonix DCB and 
followed for a mean duration of 438 days. There are no unanticipated device - or drug -related 
adverse events, the primary endpoint, as of this reporting date.  
Overall freedom from TLR for the all DCB -treated patients  was 97.0% (914/942) at 6 months 
and 92.5% (719/777) at [ADDRESS_554081] Class was improved at all time points compared 
to baseline; through 12 months, 87% of patients had an improvement in Rutherford Class, 72% 
by [ADDRESS_554082] Class without TVR was observed in 
79% of patients. These clinical endpoints compare favourably  to historic results and provide 
further support for the clinical benefit of Lutonix DCB.  
Taken as a whole, the Levant [ADDRESS_554083] 
PTA through 12 months with comparable safety and provides a reasonable assurance of safety 
and effectiveness.  
Further info rmation on the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon can be found in the Investigator 
Brochure.  
1.2 DEVICE  AND  STUDY  RATIONALE  
The drug coating on the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon contains  paclitaxel and drug carrier 
(excipi[INVESTIGATOR_437288] ) with a history of human safety for intravenous use.  Each 
component has been safely used in other products.  PTA catheters have been in commercial use 
for over 25 years, and the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon meets  international standards (e.g.

3 DEVICE  DESCRIPTION   
The LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  (Figure 1) is a standard PTA catheter with a drug coating 
on the balloon portion of the catheter.  The LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  is an over -the-wire 
type design wit h working length s of 100 and 130 cm  and is compatible with 0.035” guidewires.  
Marker bands are located at the proximal and distal ends of the balloons to assist in delivery and 
placement.   The balloon surface between the marker bands is coated with a spec ialized 
immediate release non -polymer based coating  formulation that includes the anti -proliferative 
drug – paclitaxel  - at a surface concentration of 2μg/mm2. 
 
 
FIGURE 1:  LUTONIX® DRUG COATED BALLOON  
 
All devices are provided sterile and for single -use only.  
3.1 INTENDED  USE  FOR  TRIAL  
The LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon is intended for use in percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty of restenotic lesions in  stented  femoropopliteal arteries that are ≥ 4.0 to ≤ 6.0mm in 
diameter.  
3.2 ACTIVE  PHARMACEUTICAL  INGREDIENT  (API) : PACLITAXEL  
Paclitaxel, discovered in [ADDRESS_554084], 
head and neck cancers and advanced forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma.  Paclitaxel is also approved for 
the prevention of restenosis.  Various dosages are used depending on target treatment and range

from multiple 300  mg IV infusions for  oncology therapy to a single maximal nominal dose of 
282 µg for devices that treat restenosis, such as coronary stents.  Please refer to the Investigator ’s 
Brochure for a more detailed review of paclitaxel.  
3.3 EXCIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]  (DRUG CARRIER ) 
The balloon coating includes small amounts of the well known excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (drug carrier)  
polysorbate and sorbitol, each approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as inactive 
ingredients in drug products for intravenous (IV) drug delivery.  
3.4 STUDY  DEVICE S AND  INSTRUCTIONS  
LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon s will be made available to all activated study sites.  Always 
confirm current site inventory supply prior to enrolling subjects into the study.  Please refer to 
the most current IFU for complete details on procedural use and preparation  of the device 
selected for patient treatment.   
[ADDRESS_554085] 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and are to be explained to the subject  and/or their legal 
representative prior to participating in the study. The LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon and 
standard uncoated percutaneous angioplasty catheters  used for pre -dilatation  are intended to be 
the only devices used for treatment of the target les ion.   
Due to the high similarity of the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  to other marketed balloon 
catheters, procedural use is not expected to significantly change or increase risks during the 
initial procedure.  However, it shares the risks of conventional  balloon  angioplasty treatment of 
patients with femoropopliteal disease .  
4.1.1 RISKS FOR PERIPHERAL CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURE  
Potential adverse events, which may be associated with a peripheral balloon dilatation 
catheterization procedure,  include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Additional intervention  
 Allergic reaction to drugs or contrast medium  
 Aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm  
 Arrhythmias  
 Embolization  
 Hematoma  
 Hemorrhage, including bleeding at the puncture site  
 Hypotension/hypertension  
 Inflammation  
 Occlusion  
 Pain or tenderness

 Pneumothorax or hemothorax  
 Sepsis/infection  
 Shock  
 Thrombosis  
 Vessel dissection, perforation, rupture, or spasm  
Patients undergoing an interventional procedure are often treated with courses  of thienopyridines 
such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_332574],  which may cause thrombocytopenic purpura and /or bleeding 
complications.   In rare cases, these drugs may cause a significant reduction in white blood cell 
count, which may in turn result in serious infections.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_332575] a common drug used before 
and after such procedures.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437289] (bleeding or non -bleeding).   Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437290] (whi ch may be minor, major, or life threatening).  If 
such conditions occur, the patient may require surgery, blood transfusion, or platelet transfusion.   
Any of the above could cause prolonged illness, permanent impairment of daily function or, in 
rare cases , death. Possible treatments could include, but are not limited to emergency PTA and 
vascular surgery.  It is expected that the fluoroscopy time of the interventional procedure will be 
similar to the time required for conventional percutaneous lower extrem ity interventional 
procedures and not pose additional risks to the subject  or lab personnel.   
4.1.2 ASSOCIATED RISKS FROM THE DRUG COATING  
The balloon coating includes the API [INVESTIGATOR_437291]-known  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
(drug carrier) that are approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as inactive 
ingredients in drug products for intravenous (IV) drug delivery. The anti -proliferative drug 
paclitaxel is a well understood API [INVESTIGATOR_437292] -
eluting stents (DES ).  The maximum total dose on the largest peripheral Lutonix PTA Catheter is 
less than 2% of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_437293] a single course of cancer therapy (300mg).   
Adverse  events that may  be associated with the pac litaxel drug coating  on the LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon :   
 Allergic /immunologic reaction  
There may be other risks associated with the drug coating that are unknown at this time.   
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies published in pregnant wom en or men 
intending to father children who have received paclitaxel in the studied  device.  Therefore 
women who are pregnant or inten d to become pregnant and men intending to father children will 
be excluded fro m the trial.   
4.[ADDRESS_554086] selection, thorough training of investigators, adherence to the pre -determined time points 
SFA ISR Investigational Plan    
Document:  CL0018 -[ADDRESS_554087] clinical status and regular clinical monitoring visits by [CONTACT_437301].  
Follow -up exams including duplex ultrasound will be performed to assess the target vessel 
patency  and assess overall patient status .  A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and an 
independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety of the subjects 
throughout the trial.  
4.3 POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in this study; however, it is possible that 
treatment with the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  may reduc e the potential for restenosis  of 
the stented  lesion, thereby [CONTACT_332612][INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or procedure(s).  
Additionally, information gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to others with 
the same medical con dition. As with all investigational medical devices, the long -term results of 
using the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon are not known at the present time. Alternatives to 
the use of the LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon for ISR  include standard  or cutting  balloon 
angioplasty , laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, restenting or  surgery  (vessel by[CONTACT_437302]) .  Lutonix believes that the risk for significant injury or death due to the 
LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon is extremely low, and the potential benefits of decreased need 
for reintervention is likely, but these potential risks and benefits have yet to be quantified.  
4.4 EARLY  TERMINATION  
Lutonix, Inc. ( Sponsor ) and the CEC will monitor the progression of the study.  If warranted, the 
study may be suspended or discontinued early if there is an observation of serious adverse 
reactions presenting an unreasonable risk to the study population.   
The Sponsor may terminate Investi gator and site participation in the study for issues including 
but not limited to the following issues:  
 Evidence of an Investigator’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards  
 Evidence of an Investigator or staff’s failure to comply with the protoco l 
 Inaccuracy or late submission of data forms and core lab images  
 Conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_36170]/or regulatory agencies  
 Evidence of safety concerns or protocol non -compliance  
 Change of staff at site that adversely impacts trial con duct   
Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site 
to be put on probation.  If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site 
will be as ked to withdraw from the study and their sit e may be replaced . 
In the event of study suspension or termination, the Sponsor  will send a report outlining the 
circumstances to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all Investigator s and Regulatory

6.2 LUTONIX® DRUG  COATED  BALLOON  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USE  (IFU)  
Always follow the current IFU for procedural information, preparation  and use  of the  
LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon .  Any devices found to be defective or that do not perform as 
expected should be returned immediately to the Sponsor  for evaluation and a Device 
Malfunction Form  must  be completed.  
A balloon compliance chart is included on each device product label.   
In or der to achieve the best procedural outcomes, the following steps should be completed:  
 The Lutonix DCB catheter should be advanced to the target site as fast as possible ( i.e. ~ 
30 seconds).  
 The DCB should be immediately inflated to appropriate pressure to ensure full wall 
apposition (balloon to artery ratio of  ≥1:1).   
 If the deployment of the DCB exceeds 3 minutes, the catheter requires replacement with 
a new unit.  
 Maintain the DCB inflation for a minimum of 2 minutes (120 seconds) . The balloon may 
remain i nflated as long as is required by [CONTACT_437304] a good 
angioplasty outcome.  
 For optimal results, the final percent stenosis should be 0 -20%.  
If more than one  LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  will be needed to treat the entire pre -dilated 
segment(s)/lesion(s), the combination of lengths available should be carefully considered 
beforehand to ensure complete coverage of the target lesions and, at the same time, reduce 
unnecessary vessel dilatatio n.  Per protocol, cumulative balloon length must be ≤ 26 cm. The 
IFU also contains detailed information on lesion coverage and minimal inflation times.  
6.3 BASELINE  ANGIOGRAM  
Digital Subtraction Angiography ( DSA )- or Cine - angiograms should be obtained per core lab 
guideline .  Standard off -line Quantitative Vascular Angiography ( QVA ) acquisition procedures 
will be followed for analysis at the independent Imaging Core Laboratory. All angiography 
procedures (both index  and non -scheduled) must be recorded in su ch a way that they are suited 
for off -line QVA.  For purposes of ensuring protocol compliance, all angiograms must be 
submitted to the core laboratory as soon after the case as possible.  Please refer to the trial 
specific Angiographic Acquisition Guideline s provided by [CONTACT_437305].  
6.4 IN-FLOW  LESION  TREATMENT  
Absence of inflow disease  (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by [CONTACT_437306]. Enrollment is allowed fol lowing complete successful treatment per 
SFA ISR Investigational Plan    
Document:  CL0018 -[ADDRESS_554096] practice of inflow  iliac artery lesions, with successful treatment defined as attainment of 
a residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death  or major vascular complication.  Treatment of 
aortic and common fem oral inflow lesions is not allowed.  
6.5 PRE -DILATATION  
Always refer to the current IFU packaged with the device  for complete pre -dilatation 
requirements.  
Lesion (s) pre-dilatation(s) is required for all  patients.  The pre -dilatation balloon should be a 
standard PTA balloon inflated to a diameter approximately 1 mm less than the reference vessel 
diameter (RVD).  Successful pre -dilatation is defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis 
< 50%.  Always limit the longitud inal length of the pre -dilatation balloon to avoid creating a 
region of vessel injury that is outside the boundaries of the area to be treated by [CONTACT_437307]® 
Drug Coated Balloon .  
6.6 TREATMENT  WITH  LUTONIX® DRUG  COATED  BALLOON  
If after pre -dilatation(s)  patients are determined to meet the criteria for enrollment , they will be 
treated with the L UTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon.  A stented segment with multiple stents may 
be treated per this protocol ; however, the stented area must be continuous .  
The Investigator sh ould determine the appropriate size of the balloon (s) to be used by [CONTACT_437308] (if possible) or by [CONTACT_13729]. Inflate approximately to RVD for as long as necessary 
to achieve an optimal procedural result.  Post-dilatations are allowed.  
In order to ach ieve the best procedural outcomes, the following steps should be completed:  
 The Lutonix DCB catheter should be advanced to the target site as fast as possible (i.e. ~ 
30 seconds).  
 The DCB should be immediately inflated to appropriate pressure to ensure full wall 
apposition (balloon to artery ratio of ≥1:1).  
 If the deployment of the DCB exceeds 3 minutes, the catheter requires replacement with 
a new unit.  
 Maintain the DCB inflation for a minimum of 2 minutes (120 seconds). The balloon may 
remain inflated as long as is required by [CONTACT_437304] a good 
angioplasty outcome.  
 For optimal results, the final percent stenosis should be 0 -20%.  
Please refer to the current LUTONIX® Drug Coated Balloon  IFU for detailed information on 
device use.  
6.[ADDRESS_554097]  TREATMENT  AND  PROVISIONAL  (BAILOUT)  STENTING  
There is no consensus or established objective criteria that are validated regarding the 
appropriate threshold for provisional SFA stent ing for ISR treatment .  In the absence of an 
SFA ISR Investigational Plan    
Document:  CL0018 -01  19 February 2016  
Revision 4.0   Page 22 of 51

distributed, reproduced, or divulged without the written consent of Lutonix, Inc.  
established threshold, the determination to bailout has previously been based on criteria that are 
either subjective or largely left to the discretion of the individual operator and his/her judgment.  
The current  trial design is intended to minimize the need for bailout stenting.  Due to the need 
within the medical community to establish validated criteria for provisional stenting, this trial 
will utilize more rigorous criteria for bailout stenting.  Specifically,  the trial will employ the 
additional requirement of a pressure gradient measurement to document an unsatisfactory 
balloon -only outcome (obtained by [CONTACT_437309]).   
If immediate procedural results ar e not satisfactory, e.g., residual stenosis >30% or flow -limiting 
dissection, then prolonged balloon dilations are recommended. Post dilatation may be performed 
using either the used Drug Coated Balloon (note that drug delivery occurs during the first 
inflation ONLY) or another plain angioplasty catheter, taking great care to avoid injury of a 
segment to which drug is not delivered . Stenting is allowed only in cases with flow -limiting 
dissection or stenosis >50% and documented pressure gradient refractory t o postdilatation and 
nitroglycerine administration.   
Table 1: Bailout Criteria  
Bailout Prevention  
 Treatment requirement prior to bailout stenting:  
 Prolonged (>2 minutes) balloon inflation(s)  
 Vasodilators and/or thrombolytic agents  per investigator discretion  
Bailout Criteria  
 Residual stenosis of  >50%  (based on careful in -lab review of angiograms including QVA if 
available)  or  major flow -limiting dissection  (Record angiography in 2 orthogonal views)  
and 
 Documented translesional pressure gradient of >20mmHg ( using ≤4F end -hole catheter) or 
>10mmHg (pressure wire)  measured immediately distal to the target lesion  
These criteria are set as the minimum baseline pressure gradient requirement for allowing bailout 
stenting ; however, bailout stenting is not required for pressures equal to or exceeding these 
thresholds (i.e. presence of a gradient at/above these thresholds does not require that the operator 
place a stent).  Rather, these thresholds are seen as minimum require ments for bailout stenting; 
below these thresholds, bailout stenting is not allowed.  
If the criteria for bailout stenting are fulfilled, placement of a bare nitinol stent (not DES) is 
permissible at the physician’s discretion.  
The angiographic core lab wil l be monitoring cases of bailout stenting throughout the course of 
enrollment for compliance to provisional (bailout) criteria listed in this section.

6.8 UNSCHEDULED  ANGIOGRAPHY/REVASCULARIZATION  
A DUS is required prior to any subsequent angiography of the in dex limb, and the images must 
be submitted to the DUS Core Lab.  A DUS at any time point post index procedure but prior to 
the re -intervention will suffice.  Clinical status should be evaluated prior to angiography, 
including physical exam, Rutherford clas sification and ABI. In the event that a subject undergoes 
repeat angiography after the index procedure is complete, all subsequent angiograms for the

forwarde d to the Angiographic Core Lab for review and analysis.  Attempts should be made to 
record the same views and angles as from the index procedure.    
[ADDRESS_554098]  
Lutonix (or its designee) reserves the right to attend index or DUS procedures in order  to ensure  
protocol compliance, proper device handling and adequate image capture.  
7.1 BLINDING  PLAN  
In order to minimize the introduction of bias into the study, a pre -specified blinding plan has 
been developed  for subjects randomized under protocol versions 2.0 and 3.0 .  All Duplex 
Ultrasound operators, core lab evaluators, and members of the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) 
will be blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment.  The study subject will be blinde d to 
treatment until the completion of the 12 month visit.  
All subjects enrolled under protocol version 4.0 or later will be treated with the LUTONIX® 
Drug -Coated Balloon; therefore a blinding plan is not applicable.  
7.[ADDRESS_554099] (for assessment of 
clinical and safety endpoints) should be established prior to performing the required DUS (for 
assessment of patency).

15 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
15.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN  
The SFA ISR study is a multi -center, single -arm trial comparing the LUTONIX® Drug Coated 
Balloon  to safety and effectiveness performance goals based on standard balloon angioplasty for 
the treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis .  The study will enroll patients presenting 
with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford Category 2 -4) and occlusion or ≥50% 
stenosis of a previously deployed bare nitinol stent (s) or drug -eluting stent if placed ≥ 6 months 
prior to the i ndex procedure  in the femoropopliteal artery that is appropriate for angioplasty.  
After successful protocol -defined pre -dilatation, subjects are treated with the LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon . 
The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness  and safety of the LUTONIX® Drug 
Coated Balloon  for treatment of SFA ISR by [CONTACT_437311] (OPGs) .  
Both primary endpoint criteria must be met in order for the study to be considered successful.  
15.2 ANALYSIS  POPULATIONS  
Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population: All subjects who have signed the Informed Consent Form and 
are determined by [CONTACT_437312]® Drug Coated 
Balloon  or standard PTA.  
As-treated (AT) population: All ITT subjects that were treated with the LUTONIX® Drug Coated 
Balloon .  This may also be referred to  as the Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population.  
Per-Protocol population (PP) : All AT (m ITT) subjects characterized by [CONTACT_437313] (procedurally correct as pre -specified) and the absence of major protocol violations  
(including violations of entry criteria) that if not met for a given patient may obscure the 
evaluation of efficacy in that patient .

analyses will be completed with the AT (mITT) population.  . 
PTA Population:  The set of subjects originally randomized to and treated with PTA under the 
previous v ersions of the protocol.    
The results of the PTA population will be listed or summarized separately  from the Lutonix DCB 
subjects  using descriptive statistics.

the binary primary patency endpoint , in which assumptions about missing data are varied from 
worst -case to best -case to examine at what point the missing data would alter the conclusion of 
the analysis.  These analyses will constitute sensitivity analyses of the effect of missing data on 
the study results.

<0.15, it will be considered evidence of a potential lack of homogeneity across the study sites, 
and additional analyses will be performed to explore the differences between sites t o assess their 
potential causes and whether or not they are clinically meaningful.  A non -significant site effect  
or a significant effect that is only quantitative and not qualitative on nature will be taken to 
support the pooling sites for the primary ana lysis.  Analyses may include testing for differences 
between sites for the covariates listed later in this section  and the use of modeling involving the 
covariates along with study site to determine if they potentially explain any lack of homogeneity 
acros s the study sites.  
In addition, a descriptive analysis that examines the impact of important covariates on study 
results will be performed. Baseline covariates are age, gender, smoking, obesity, 
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, total target lesion length (sum of core lab -reported 
lesion lengths of more than one), and maximum percent stenosis of subject target lesion(s) (via

core lab analysis), previous target lesion intervention, ABI of the target limb, and Rutherford 
grade.    Additional variables may be identified in the statistical analysis plan and will be 
identified prior to the completion of the study.  The covariates will be included in a logistic 
regression model in order to understand their potential impact on study results.  
An additional su pportive analysis of patients without bailout stenting will also be performed 
based on descriptive statistics, and data will further be presented for subjects without bailout 
stenting.  
15.5 PRIMARY  ENDPOINTS  
15.5.1  PRIMARY EFFICACY  ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND  
The primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency at 12 months.  Primary Patency is defined as 
Freedom from CEC -adjudicated Clinically -Driven TLR and from Core laboratory -adjudicated 
Binary Restenosis.  Binary restenosis  is based on threshold Doppler PSVR ≥ 2.5 (together with 
waveform analysis & color mosaic appearance) or based on angiographic ≥ 50% diameter 
stenosis  (if angiography is performed although not required per protocol).  
In order to establish an objective performance goal (OPG) for primary patency for this 
unco ntrolled study, results from three sources were considered:  a meta -analysis of published 
results, the LEVANT 2 randomized primary patency result, and the Lutonix SFA Global 
Registry primary patency findings.  Based on the evaluation of the data sources, a n OPG of 45% 
for primary patency was proposed for this study and the rationale is provided below.  
Meta -analysis results    
Estimated 12 -month primary patency response rates for PTA were 34.2% (95% CI = 29.5%, 
39.0%) and for DCB were 84.5% (95% CI = 78.2%, 9 0.7%).  These results would indicate a 
large treatment effect in ISR subjects and low expectations for PTA alone.   The large  range of 
responses in controlled  studies may be explained by [CONTACT_437314][INVESTIGATOR_014].    
Nonetheless, the results indicate the clear potential for an unmet need in treating ISR lesions with 
significant benefit in the use of DCB therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The performance of PTA from s ix publications is shown below.  Table [ADDRESS_554119] of care treatment of SFA ISR.  A very high 
restenosis rate is observed, with only 34% patency at 12 months.

the limited number of subjects treated in only three  studies.  Furthermore, the test device of the 
present study differs from the Lutonix DCB.

The LEVANT 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_437296] a randomized comparison of the primary patency at 12 
months in the PTA and DCB subjects.  The subjects were not ISR subjects, but LEVANT 2 
provides reference rates based on the primary patency meth odology proposed for this study.  
Response rates for primary patency were 52.6% (71/135) for PTA subjects and 65.2% (172/264) 
in DCB subjects.  These indicate a potential higher primary patency rate in PTA subjects and a 
potentially more model effect for p rimary patency in DCB subjects.  
Lutonix SFA Global Registry Results  
The SFA Global Registry was an open -label registry containing 691 subjects.  This study 
included a subset of subjects with one or more ISR lesions.  Overall site based primary patency 
response at 12 month was 80.5% (62/77) in ISR subjects and 82.7% (416/503) in non -ISR 
subjects.  A similar trend was observed in the TLR -Free response rate at 12 months which was 
91.5% (75/82) in ISR subjects and 94.6% (524/554) in non -ISR subjects.   
Selectio n of a n Objective Performance Goal  
The poor PTA alone results in the meta -analysis suggest that the ISR subjects may do very 
poorly with regard to primary patency.  However, given the wide range response rates, the 
pooled response rate of 34.2% may be over ly pessimistic even though the total number of treated 
subjects is 306.  A proposed OPG based for this study is 45% (this is slightly above the average 
of the LEVANT 2 PTA response rate and the meta -analysis estimate).  This OPG balances the 
poor response in ISR subjects observed in the meta -analysis with the higher PTA response from 
LEVANT 2.   
For sample size purposes, the DCB response rate is assumed to be 63.0% which reflects a small 
adjustment to the DCB reduction in the 65.2% response rate observed in  the LEVANT 2 study in 
line with the 2.2% difference in response rates for primary patency in ISR subjects in the SFA

The primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency at 12 months.  Primary Patency is defined as 
Freedom from Clinically -Driven TLR and from Binary Restenosis.  Binary restenosis  is 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_64741], blinded core laboratory based on threshold Doppler PSVR ≥ 2.5 
(together with wa veform analysis &  color mosaic appearance) or based on angiographic ≥ 50% 
diameter stenosis  (if angiography is performed although not required per protocol). Clinically -
Driven TLR is adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741].  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of subjects with Prim ary Patency ( π) in DCB 
subjects  is less than or equal to or greater than the primary patency OPG ( 45.0%) through [ADDRESS_554130] -index procedure.

H0: The proportion of Lutonix DCB subjects with Primary Patency is less than or equal to 
the OPG to 0. 45 (45.0%) at 12 months   (H0:  ≤ 0.45).  
H1: The proportion of Lutonix DCB  subjects with Primary Patency is greater than the OPG 
of 0.45 (45.0%) at 12 months  (H1:  > 0.45). 
The statistical analysis will be performed using an exact binomial test  with one-sided α=0.025  
based on the AT (mITT) population .  The response variable in each subject will be the presence 
or absence of at least one efficacy event ( core-lab adjudicated binary restenosis or CEC -
adjudicated clinically -driven TLR) from the time following the i ndex procedure through [ADDRESS_554131] 95%  
confidence intervals will also be repor ted. 
Sample Size Estimate :  The sample size estimation assumed the following:  
 The true 12 -month proportion in the Lutonix DCB subjects  is 63% 
 The Type 1 error,  = 0.0 25 (one-sided).  
 The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
 Based on exact binomial test 
 
The study evaluable sample size required for 90% power is 83 subjects . Allowing for up to 15% 
of subjects with missing  12 month efficacy endpoin t data, the required enrolled sample size is 98 
DCB  subjects  in order to obtain  83 subjects with 12 month follow -up.  The total study sample 
size of 127 includes 98 DCB subjects and 29 subjects previously treated with PTA.  
15.5.3    PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND  
The primary safety endpoint is a c omposite of freedom from all -cause perioperative (≤30 day)  
death and freedom at 1 year from the following: index limb amputation  (above and below the 
ankle)  index limb re -intervention, and index -limb-related death.   These events are called “safety 
events” in the following text.  
Data for this endpoint was not repo rted in the SFA ISR studies cited above  (Table 3 and Table 
4).  However, saf ety outcomes reported to date for DCB -treated in -stent and native 
femoropopliteal lesions appear similar in general.  It is therefore assumed that safety outcomes 
after DCB treatment of SFA ISR are similar to those observed in the LEVANT2 clinical study, 
84.9% for DCB compared to 79.0% for control PTA.  
Restenosis is common after use of currently available  devices . A safety OPG target of 69.0% is 
proposed for the safety endpoint by [CONTACT_2931] a 10% margin to the PTA event rates from the 
LEVANT  [ADDRESS_554132] that these subjects may be at somewhat greater risk 
of previous need for stent placement.

15.5.4  SAFETY ENDPOINT : HYPOTHESIS TEST AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The primary safety endpoint is a c omposite of freedom from all -cause perioperative  (≤30 day) 
death and freedom at 1 year from the following: index limb amputation  (above and below the 
ankle)  index limb re -intervention, and index -limb-related death.    
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of  Lutonix DCB  subjects free from any safe ty 
event* is greater than the OPG target of 69%  through [ADDRESS_554133]-index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of Lutonix DCB subjects free from safety events post -index 
procedure is less than or equal to the OPG of 0.69 (69%) at 12 months (H 0: φDCB ≤ 
0.69) .  
H1: The proportion of  Lutonix DCB  subjects free from safety events post-index 
procedure is greater than then OPG of 0.69 (69%) at 12 months (H 1: φDCB > 0.69) . 
* All-cause perioperative (≤30 day) death, index limb amputation  (above or below the ankle) , 
target limb  reintervention, and target limb related death are safety events.   
The statistical analysis will be a one-sided exact binomial test  assessed using a one -sided α=0.[ADDRESS_554134] one safety event  from the time  following the index procedure  through 12 
months .  A significant rejection of the null hypothesis with one -sided p -value less than 0.05 
indicates success for this endpoint.   
Sample Size Estimat e:  The sample size estimation assumed the following:  
 The true [ADDRESS_554135] group is 84.9%  
 The Type 1 error,  = 0.05 (one -sided).  
 The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
 
The evaluable sample size required for 90% power is [ADDRESS_554136] no 
missing data is expected for this endpoint, a llowing for censoring of 10% of subjects,  at least [ADDRESS_554137] 95% confidence intervals for the rates will be provided 
for the 12 month endpoint.  In addition, descriptive statistics will also be estimated for the 
subsets of subjects with and without bailout stenting . 
Efficacy measurements of Device, Technical and Procedural Success will be assessed following 
the procedure.

APPENDIX  A:  DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device 
under investigation.   
 Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect is any untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use for preparation or deployment of the device.  It also includes any 
event that is a r esult of a user error.  
 Anticipated Adverse Event  
Any undesirable health related experience occurring to a subject whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product(s) or drug regimen prescribed as part of 
the protocol, predefined in the pr otocol and/or Instruction s For Use (IFU) that is 
identified or worsens during a clinical study.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is an adverse event that:  
 led to death or led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject  
 resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
 resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
 required in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38470]  
 resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A SADE is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a ser ious adverse event or that might have led to any of these 
consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or 
if circumstances had been less opportune.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
A UADE is “any serious a dverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or a pplication (including a supplementary plan or application), or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
SFA ISR Investigational Plan    
Document:  CL0018 -[ADDRESS_554138] igator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:  
 
Mild  
 Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
subject’s usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment 
and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  
 Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  
 Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of 
the subject’s usual activity and requires treatment.  
  
 Relationship to study device  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the 
adverse event to the use of study device:  
 
Not Related  
 The event is definitely not associated with device application.  
The adverse event is due to an underlying or concurre nt illness or 
effect of another device or drug.  
Unlikely  
 An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
study device and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between device application and the ev ent 
is such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition 
or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon device 
application completion/removal or the Event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s condition.  
Highly 
Probable  The temporal sequence is relevant  and the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal, or reap pearance of the 
event on repeat device application (re -challenge).

procedure  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between the procedure  and the event  is 
such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition or 
concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon 
procedure completion  or the Event cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s condition.

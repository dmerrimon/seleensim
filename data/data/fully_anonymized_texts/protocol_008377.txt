2. Rationale  
 
While RA is recommended for all women no later than age 30,  this has not yet been translated to clinical practice 
and thus women are not receiving RA prior to the age of [ADDRESS_1257270], should start screening as young as age 25 (e.g ., for those identified 
to have a BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation). As most women ages [ADDRESS_1257271] cancer RA. We will achieve these aims through a conducting a stepped -
wedge trial employing a mixed methods study design. The primary outcome is the proportion of women age 25 -
49 having RA. Secondary outcomes include the numbers of women: 1) identified as high -risk; 2) pursuing risk -
adherent screening; and 3) diagnosed with breast cancer. Implementation outcomes include reach , feasibility, 
acceptability, and appropriateness. Data collected will inform a future multi -site cluster randomized clinical trial 
to test the implementation strategies on a larger scale over a longer durat ion, enriched for underserved 
populations such as minority and rural dwellers.

will facilitate making direct connections with clinics and potential study participants .   
 
5. Research Design and Methods  
5.[ADDRESS_1257272] cancer RA. 
5.1.2 Feasibility Assessment  
 
Presentation of Potential Strategies:  
The Vanderbilt study team will give a short presentation  demonstrating the proposed strategies to increase 
breast cancer RA. Strategies include engaging a site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], offering provider education, and offering 
methods to increase patient awareness of breast cancer RA. The presentation will be either in person or virtual 
as necessary per COVID restrictions. The presentation is expected to  take approximately 15 minutes and will 
demonstrate strategies such as how a site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896901], how provider education can be offered to the sites, and how patient awareness materials could b e 
presented . 
Following the presentation, the Vanderbilt team will distribute a web-based  voluntary, anonymous REDCap  
survey to clinic providers and staff.   This survey is an  adapted version  of the validated Feasibility of Intervention 
Measure (FIM), a 4-item scale that measures provider perception that a given practice can be easily or 
conveniently performed . Questions are asked on a Likert -like scale (1 , Completely Disagree – 5, Completely 
Agree ) with both FIM sum and mean scores calculated. Higher scores indicate higher feasibility. [see REDCap 
Survey - Feasibility]  
Following completion of the survey, clinic providers and staff will be invited to participate in a brief listening 
session to share their thoughts on the strategies presented . [see Listening Session Guide  - Feasibility ] 
Recruitment and Eligibility:  The Vanderbilt study team will perform the Feasibility Assessment in up to 10 clinics 
in Tennessee. The Vanderbilt team will recruit  clinics to participate  in the Feasibility Assessment  leveraging 
existing relationships through the TBCSP  to identify potential participants  [see Recruitment Email – 
Feasibility ]. The Vanderbilt team will respond via email or phone to answer additional questions potential clinics 
may have.  The Vanderbilt team will recruit individuals at each participating clinic at the time of the feasibility 
presentation to participate in the Feasibility Assessment [see Information Sheet – Feasibility] . The Vanderbilt 
team will answer any questions potential  participants  may have. The survey sample will consist of approximately 
60 individuals . Sample size at individual clinics may vary due to diff erences in the number of providers and staff 
at each clinic. Eligible individuals will be age 18 and older and will be a provider, staff, or administrator employed 
in a clinic enrolled in the study.  
Data Collection Methods:  Data from the anonymous, voluntary survey will be collected and stored via REDCap, 
a secure online data collection tool.  The listening sessions will be digitally recorded via audio recorders with 
participant permission, transcribed verbatim, and coded by [CONTACT_896908] a codebook. If 
participants choose not to be recorded, the interviewer will take notes on their responses. Any id entifying 
information that are part of the participants ’ response s will be removed from the transcriptions.  Original listenin g 
session  recordings will be destroyed once transcribed. The responses to all the listening sessions  will be 
summarized.  When the specific responses from individual organizations are quoted, the organization or person’s 
name [CONTACT_874543].  
Consent:  We will request a Waiver of Consent for the Feasibility Assessment .  Consent will be implied by 
[CONTACT_896909] a listening group .

 5 5.1.3 Data Analysis  
Continuous measurements will be summarized using mean + standard deviation or median /interquartile range. 
tables and graphs will be created to describe and visualize data. Qualitative data will be analyzed using inductive 
coding to identify emerging themes.  
5.[ADDRESS_1257273] cancer RA implementation strategies on the proportion of eligible 
women receiving RA (reach) . The intervention in this trial is the use of implementation strategies including 
identifying a site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], offering provider education, and providing tools to increase patient awareness of RA. 
The working hypothesis is that implementing this bundle of select ed strategies to increase utilization of breast 
cancer RA will increase the proportion of eligible women (age 25-49) having RA performed  when compared to 
usual care . 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1257274] cancer RA (Fig. 1). No clinics are exposed to the intervention at 
the beginning of trial. Subsequently , each clinic will receive the intervention . Data will be collected before and 
after intervention, so that each clinic contributes observations under both control and intervention conditions. 
Ultimately, all clinics will receive the same intervention. The primary outcome is the proportion of eligible women 
(women age 25-49) who receive breast cancer RA.  
5.2.3 Implementation Periods (Control, Implementation, Maintenance)  
Control: Baseline data on reach will be collected  through electronic health record or data collection forms (see 
section 5.2.6 - Data collection methods).  
Implementation: During  the implementation period , the research team will identify and engage the site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896902] . The research team will deliver tailored in-person provider education  and provide clinics 
with tools to increase patient awareness of breast cancer risk assessment. T he research team will also 
participate in clinic staff meetings to answer questions about breast cancer RA, discuss barriers to performing 
RA, and provide feedback on the clinic’s use of RA. Final  versions of education and awareness materials have 
been submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
Maintenance: Implementation strategies will no longer be offered. The maintenance period will consist of data 
collection only.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1257275]. We will recruit two back -up clinics meeting 
these selection criteria in case a site drops out during the early phase of the study. The Vanderbilt team will  
reach out to potential clinics with the guidance of our established relationship with the TBCSP via email or in 
person and provide a study information sheet for potential clinics [see Recruitment Email – Clinic, Information 
Sheet – Clinic ]. The Vanderbilt team  will respond via email or phone to answer additional questions potential 
clinics may have regarding enrollment.  
At the clinics enrolled in the study, we will collect data retrospectively from individual health records on patients 
who are seen by [CONTACT_3652]. We anticipate that we will collect clinical data on approximately 3,[ADDRESS_1257276] cancer.  
Version 06.13.23 
 
 6 5.2.5 Remuneration  
Clinics will be offered compensation for the administrative time and effort and IT effort s necessary to participate 
in the study. Organizations enrolling one clinic will be offered $4,000, organizations enroll ing two clinics will be 
offered $6,000, and organizations enrolling three clinics will be offered $7,000.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1257277] appropriate data access credentials and IRB app roval. VUMC personnel will not directly 
access any medical records. Data extracted by [CONTACT_896910] -identified and entered into the Clinic Data 
Collection Form – REDCap . 
If an enrolled clinic does not have a reliable electronic health record, paper data collection forms or via REDCap 
will be used  [Clinic Data  Collection Form  – Paper , Clinic Data Collection Form - REDCap ]. These clinic  data 
collection forms will be distributed to clinic sites by [CONTACT_896911] -wedge 
trial. Research team personnel will provide instruction to clinic site personnel on how to use the forms. Clinic 
sites will store the data collection forms in a secure pre -determined location within the clinic. Forms will be 
electronically scanned and sent to the research team or collected by [CONTACT_896912] -weekly.  
Data collected will include  the date of the patient  encounter, provider name, demographic information ( age, 
race/ethnicity); was breast cancer RA offered/ performed with the Tyrer -Cuzick tool? (yes/no), result of breast 
cancer RA, was further testing was recommended? (y/n), and what further testing was recommended  on the 
clinical data collection forms . For clinics with reliable electronic health records, this information will be obtained 
from the electronic health record  by [CONTACT_482222], deidentified, and provided to the Vanderbilt team . We 
will obt ain data use agreements with the enrolled clinics for the data transfer . 
The numerator for the primary outcome (number of women receiving breast cancer RA by [CONTACT_896913] -Cuzick model) 
will be extracted by [CONTACT_896914]. Study team 
members will establish the d enominator for the primary outcome (number of patients eligible for breast cancer 
RA) by [CONTACT_896915]’s 
electronic medical record or scheduling database .  
Data collection for s econdary outcomes will include the number of women offered RA, but declining; number of 
high-risk women identified; number of high -risk women pursuing risk -stratified screening; number of abnormal 
screening studies; number of cancers identified ; and types of cancers identified . Data on these secondary 
outcomes will be obtained from the electronic health record.  This data will be collected for [ADDRESS_1257278] 
or data collection forms (described in section 5. 2.6) by [CONTACT_896916]. Adoption outcomes 
will include the total number of clinics offering RA and the total number of providers offering RA  during the 
implementation phase . Maintenance outcomes will include the total number of clinics offering RA and the total 
number of providers offering RA six months after the completion of the implementation period.   
Data will be collected during the control, implementation, and maintenance time periods  of the stepped -wedge 
trial. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1257279] and the clinic data collection forms  from the enrolled clinics .   
5.2.8 Data  Analysis  
Data will be summarized using mean + /- standard deviation. Generalized linear mixed models for binary outcome 
will be used to assess difference in the proportion of participants receiving breast cancer RA between control 
and intervention groups, stratifying by [CONTACT_896917], rural vs. urban loca tion, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, 
and time, with a nested random -effect for subjects within clinic clusters. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% 
Version 06.13.23 
 
 7 confidence interval (CI) will be reported. Interaction between intervention and time will be assessed. All tests of 
statistical significance will be two -sided. Findings will be considered significant if p<0.05.  
5.3 Acceptability and Appropriateness  
5.3.1 Purpose  
Assess  acceptability and appropriateness  with an integrated mixed -methods analysis including surveys and 
interviews  of patients  and healthcare team members recruited from the 10 clinic sites enrolled in the stepped -
wedge trial .   
5.3.2 Healthcare Team Survey  
Healthcare Team Survey : During the maintenance phase of the stepped -wedge trial,  we will distribute a web -
based REDCap survey via email to providers , staff, and administrators in the enrolled clinics to obtain data on 
acceptability, appropriateness, and intent to continue using the breast cancer RA tool. We will use adapted 
versions of the Acceptability of Intervention Measurement (AIM) and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure 
(IAM)  scales . Up to 4 weekly email reminders will be sent weekly to non -responders to increase response rate.   
[see REDCap survey  – Approp, Accept ] 
Recruitment  and Eligibilit y: The Vanderbilt team will perform recruitment for the Healthcare Team Survey  via 
email  with the guidance of the clinic site champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] [see Recruitment Email – Survey] . The Vanderbilt team 
will respond via email or phone to answer additional questions potential survey respondents may have. The 
survey sample will consist of approximately 10 individuals per clinic (N = 100). Sample size at individual clinics 
may vary  due to differences in the number of providers and staff  at each clinic . Eligible individuals will be age 18 
and older and will be a provider, staff, or administrator employed in a clinic enrolled in the study.  
Data Collection Methods : Data will be collected and stored via REDCap, a secure online data collection tool.  
Consent : We will request a Waiver of Documented Consent for the Healthcare Team Survey.  Consent will be 
implied by [CONTACT_896918].  Participants will be provided with study information at the beginning of the 
survey.  
5.3.3 Healthcare Team  Interviews  
Healthcare Team Interview : We will conduct semi -structured interviews during the maintenance phase  with key 
informants . Interview guides will explore in more detail the results of the provider survey.  We will elicit information  
about the acceptability and appropriateness of implementing our select ed breast cancer RA strategies  [see 
Interview Guide – Healthcare Team] . These interviews may be performed via telephone . Interviews  are 
anticipated to last approximately  45-60 minutes . 
Recruitment  and Eligibility : The Vanderbilt team  will recruit Healthcare Team members from the enrolled clinics 
with the guidance of the site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896903], phone, or in person [see Recruitment Email - 
Interview , Recruitment Script –Interview, Interview  – Information Sheet ]. The Vanderbilt team will recruit 
approximately 5 key informants per clinic (N=50) including individuals such as administrators, site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896904] (i.e. nurses and physicians). Site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896905]. Recruitment will stop when the team feels that we have reached data thematic 
saturation.  Participants in these interviews may have complicated the Healthcare Team Survey, but that will not 
be a requirement.  Eligible individuals will  be age 18 and older and will be a provider, staff, or administrator 
employed in a clinic enrolled in the study.  
Remuneration : Healthcare team members participating in interviews will be offered  a $50 incentive in 
appreciation of their time .  
Data Collection Methods:  Interviews will be digitally recorded via audio recorders with participant permission, 
transcribed verbatim, and coded by [CONTACT_896908] a codebook. If participants choose not to 
be recorded, the interviewer will take notes on their responses. Any id entifying information that are part of the 
participants response will be removed from the transcriptions.  Original interview recordings will be destroyed 
once transcribed. The responses to all the interviews will be summariz ed.  When the specific responses from 
individual organizations are quoted, the organization or person’s name [CONTACT_874543].

implied by [CONTACT_896919]. Written consent will not be obtained. Interview participants will be 
provided with a study information sheet. [Interview  – Information Sheet ] 
5.3.4 Patient Interviews  
Patient Interview : We will conduct semi -structured interviews with patients who recently had  breast cancer RA . 
Site champi[INVESTIGATOR_896906] . These interviews will help us to understand 
the patient perspective on breast cancer RA. [see Interview Guide – Patient] . These interviews may be 
performed via telephone , in person, or via computer . Interviews  are anticipated to last one hour or less . 
Recruitment  and Eligibility : Clinic sites will identify potential participants for interviews via telephone, email, or in 
person [see Patient Interview - Recruitment Email (for clinic) , Patient Interview - Recruitment Script  (for 
clinic) ]. Clinic staff will identify these potential participants through their own electronic health record or word of 
mouth. Clinical staff will ask potential patient participants if they 1) prefer to provide their contact [CONTACT_896920] 2) if they prefer to contact [CONTACT_896921]. At 
the participant’s preference, the clinic sites will either 1) obtain patient’s preferred method of contact (phone call 
[with an introductory text message ] or email) and contact [CONTACT_896922] 2) provide contact [CONTACT_896923].  
 
The Vanderbilt research team will store this participant contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, email address, phone 
number) in a password protected file on an institutional secure server such as OneDrive. This information will 
not be connected in any way to participa nt interview data.  This information will be destroyed at the earliest 
time possible [see Patient Interview - Contact [CONTACT_130052]]. Once the participant and the Vanderbilt 
team are connected, the team will share more information about the study and enroll those who are interested.  
   
For patients preferring a phone call, a text message will be sent prior to the phone call to familiarize the 
participant with the phone number of the caller [see Patient  Interview - initial text message before 
recruitment phone call] . If the  Vanderbilt research team member calls the patient’s phone and does not reach 
the patient, the research team member will leave a voice mail [see Patient Interview - voicemail before 
recruitment script ]. When the research team member reaches the patient on the phone, they  will describe the 
study [see Patient Interview - Recruitment Script  (for research team) ]. For patients preferring an email, an 
email will be sent [see Patient Interview – Recruitment E mail (research team) ].  
  
The Vanderbilt research team member  will discuss the study with the patient by [CONTACT_369594]. If the patient 
agrees to participate in the interview, the Vanderbilt research team member will schedule the interview and then 
send the patient the Patient Information Sheet via email or tex t message [see Interview - Information Shee t, 
see Patient Interview - Provision of patient study information sheet via email or text message ]. The day 
before and the day of the interview, the Vanderbilt research team member will send the patient a reminder  text 
message  or email  about the interview [ see Patient Interview - reminder text message  or email ].  
 
We will recruit approximately [ADDRESS_1257280] study during the study time period.

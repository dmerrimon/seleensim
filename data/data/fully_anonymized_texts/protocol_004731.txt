Methodology:  
Study RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613769] 3 days between subjects being dosed within each cohort (following 72- hour safety assessment review by [CONTACT_478385]). 
The study stages for Part 1 are:  
• Screening (within 84 days prior to Day 1).  Patients have [ADDRESS_613770] be completed within 28 days prior to Day 1. 
• Treatment period:  Check-in Day 1, administration of study drug, 3-night in- clinic stay, 
and discharge on Day 4 following the completion of all scheduled procedures.  
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential • Follow -up: Subjects will have follow -up visits for up to [ADDRESS_613771] -dose as follows: 
subjects will receive a phone call on Study Days 5, 6 , and 7 to inquire about their general 
health and will return to the clinic for visits on Study Day 8 (± 1 day), Study Day 15 (± 3 
days), and Study Day 29 or Early Termination (± 4 days).  For each cohort in Part 1, the 
same general procedures will be applied, as follows.   
Screening  
All subjects must sign/e -sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to undergoing any screening 
procedures.  Screening procedures will take place up to [ADDRESS_613772] structure and intrathecal space ( Appendix 12) ; MRIs will be run locally and 
evaluated  by a sponsor-arranged expert .  Additional radiological assessments may be performed at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator, including CT or MRI of the head and X-ray of the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_478321].  The 
subject’s demographics, medical and surgical history, and prior and concomitant medications will be recorded.  Screening/baseline assessments will be performed, and subjects will undergo blood draws 
where blood, serum collection, viral serology will be obtained, and urine samples will be collected. The screening laboratory tests must be completed within [ADDRESS_613773] agrees, samples 
of his/her CSF, blood, MRI scans and data collected in the study, will be stored for future research.  A 
subject does not have to agree or sign the biobank ICF in order to be eligible to  participate in this 
main study.   
Prosp ective subjects must follow dosing restrictions as specified in the protocol for each medication  
listed in Exclusion Criteria . 
Urine testing for drugs of abuse  will include the standard 9 -drug panel (amphetamines, cocaine, 
marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], methadone, and propoxyphene). 
Subjects using marijuana /THC -CBD preparations, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], sedative hypnotics, or tranquilizers may 
be permitted to participate in the trial provided the dosage and frequency of use are not considered 
likely to interfere with evaluation of safety and efficacy endpoints in the trial.  Determination of 
exclusion due to use of a specific  medication from these classes of medications will be made by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_478322], frequency of use, and medical condition being 
treated.    
In the event that a subject is rescreened, the original screening MRI and expert review of the images 
may be used for the rescreening provided the MRI was completed within 6 months of rescreening.  
Similarly, neurological examinations and questionnaires do not need to be repeated provided the 
rescreening occurs with in 84 days of the time of data collectio n. 
In-Clinic Treatment Period:  
Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the evening prior to or on the day of dosing (Study 
Day 1) dependent on clinical site requirements .  Following final pre- treatment assessments, subjects 
will undergo a lumbar puncture (LP) and receive their single dose of study drug administered via 
intrathecal lumbar slow bolus infusion by [CONTACT_94108][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained and licensed 
designee.  Dosing will be according to Table 2.   
Subjects will remain in -clinic until discharge on  Study Day 4 and will undergo daily safety 
assessments and observation.  
Blood and CSF samples will be obtained.  The timing for serum and CSF sample collection may be 
adjusted for subsequent cohorts based on PK data from the preceding cohorts. In addition to 
undergoing PK analysis, s erum  samples obtained from blood collected at pre- dose and on Study Days 
8 and 29 will be analyzed for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) .

Follow- up:  
Sites will contact [CONTACT_478386] 5, 6, and 7 to inquire a s to their general 
health status .   
Subjects will return to the Clinic on Study Day s 8 (±1d), 15 (±3d), and 29 (± 4d).  On Study Days 8 
(±1d) and 29 (± 4d), CSF and serum PK samples will be collected.  Blood will be collected for clinical 
laboratory testing and serum for PK on Day 15 ( ±3d).  Vital signs, AEs, and general health status will 
be assessed at each follow -up visit and end of study assessments will  be performed on Study Day 29 
(±4d). 
Dose Escalation in Part [ADDRESS_613774] ( DSMB)  
In order to ensure the utmost safety of subjects, the sponsor will also use an i ndependent Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ).  Each time the DSMB  is engaged,  a recommendation to proceed 
from the DSMB  will be required in order for the study to continue  (i.e. to resume if stopped or 
ongoing study will be stopped if DSMB does not recommend proceeding).  During Part 1, the DSMB  
will b e consulted prior to resuming the study if any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23893].  The DSMB  will 
also be asked to review the safety and tolerability data from Part [ADDRESS_613775] has completed 3 months of dosing and approximately 
every 3 months thereafter while dosing continues in the study (allowing for potential scheduling 
logistics). In addition to the pre-determined DSMB  data review meeting, the DSMB  may be engaged 
at any time at the request of an investigator, the sponsor , or medical monitor. A charter will be written 
to describe the DSMB ’s objectives, schedule for data reviews, and general responsibilities in respect 
to the study.  All DSMB  decisions will be documented in writing, and where required, submitted to 
the institutional review board (IRB) for their review or information.    
Dose Escalation Rules  for Part 1 
Dose escalation (for each sequential cohort) will not occur until [ADDRESS_613776]-dose follow-up visit.  Determination of whether to escalate dose in the subsequent cohort will be made by [CONTACT_478387] .  Review will include  adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs 
(SAEs) , and specifically the following potential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_478323] .  If the dose is well tolerated in the completed dose group, the sponsor, in conjunction with 
the investigator s and medical monitor, will recommend escalation to the next dose level.   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]/Study Interruption/Discontinuation Notic e 
The investigators and medical monitor  in conjunction with the sponsor may elect to stop dosing or 
stop the study based on any treatment emergent concerns .  Dosing will be stopped due to the 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613777] earlier analysis of a partially 
completed cohort if completion of the cohort is delayed or partial cohort data is desired to aid in 
interpretation of any emergent clinical data .   
Part 2  
Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat  dose study in CSCI  
subjects.  Approximately 32 subjects will be randomized (ratio 1:1) to receive AXER -204 or placebo  
(an isotonic phosphate buffered s aline formulation).  Subject to review of the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetic data from Part [ADDRESS_613778] to DSMB approval, the dose and dose frequency may also be adjusted during Part 2 based on emergent safety and tolerability 
data.  
The study stages for Part 2 are:  
• Screening (within 84 days prior to Day 1).  Patients have [ADDRESS_613779] be completed  within 28 days prior to Day 1. 
• Treatment Period ( 15 weeks).  Investigational product given approximately every [ADDRESS_613780].  A telephone call  to assess status regarding any adverse 
events will be conducted on Study Day 8 ( ±3 days). 
• Follow- up (21 weeks).  Following the last Treatment Period dose of investigational 
product or Early Termination  of dosing , a telephone call  to assess status regarding any 
adverse events will be conducted on Study Day 137 (± 7 days)  and two follow-up visits 
will occur  at Study Days 169  (± 7 days)  and 253 (± 7 days). 
Screening  
All subjects must sign/e -sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to undergoing any screening 
procedures.  Screening procedures will take place up to [ADDRESS_613781] structure and intrathecal space; MRIs wil l be run locally and evaluated  by a 
sponsor-arranged expert. Additional radiological assessments may be performed at the discretion of 
the Principal Investigator, including CT or MRI of the head and X- ray of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_478324]. The subject’s 
demographics, medical and surgical history, and prior and concomitant medications will be recorded.  Screening assessments will be performed, and subjects will undergo blood draws where blood, serum 
collection, viral serology will be obtained, and urine samples will be collected. The screening laboratory tests must be completed within [ADDRESS_613782] agree s samples  of 
his/her CSF, blood, MRI scans and data collected in the study, will be stored for future research.  A 
subject does not have to agree or sign the biobank ICF in order to be eligible to participate in the main 
study.   
Prospective s ubjects  must follow dosing restrictions as specified in the protocol for each medication  
listed in Exclusion Criteria . 
Urine testing for drugs of abuse  will include the standard 9 -drug panel (amphetamines, cocaine, 
marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], methadone, and propoxyphene).  Subjects using m arijuana /THC -CBD preparations, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], sedative hypnotics, or tranquilizers may 
be permitted to participate in the trial provided the dosage and frequency of use are not considered 
likely to interfere with evaluation of safety and efficacy endpoints in the trial.  Determination of 
exclusion due to use of a specific medication from these classes of medications will be made by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_478325], frequency of use, and medical condition being 
treated.   
In the event that a subject is rescreened, the original screening MRI and expert review of the images 
may be used for the rescreening provided the MRI was completed within 6 months of rescreening.  
Similarly, neurological examinations and questionnaires do not need to be repeated provided the 
rescreening occurs with 84 days of the time of data collection.  
Treatment Period  
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either AXER -204 or to placebo.  The randomization will be 
stratified based on pre -treatment American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_478326] (AI S) grade 
(AIS A,B vs. AIS C,D) and prior receipt of study drug in Part 1 (Received AXER-204 in Part 1 vs. 
Did not receive AXER-204 in Part 1).  
Subjects will receive their  baseline assessments and  assigned (double -blind) treatment on Study Day 
1.  A telephone call  to assess status regarding any adverse even ts will be conducted on Study Day 8 (± 
3 days).  Subjects will then return to the Clinic on Day 21 (± 5 days) for safety, efficacy, and PK 
assessments and their second dose of investigational product.  Thereafter, subjects will return 
approximately every 21 days, at Study Days 42 (± 5 days) (third dose), 63 (± 5 days) (fourth dose), 84 
(± 5 days) (fifth dose), 104 (± 5 days) ( sixth  dose), for safety, efficacy,  and PK assessments (pre-
dose) and investigational product administration .     
Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_478327] -dose at each treatment (dosing) visit, including 
Study Day 1, during a single LP procedure for collecting and dosing.  Serum for PK and 
immunogenicity (ADA) testing will be collected pre -dose at the timepoints specified in the schedule 
of events within [ADDRESS_613783]- dose at specified visits.  
For dosing visits that include  neurological exams and questionnaires (e.g. IS NCSCI, GRASSP, SCIM 
III self -care and mobility), these assessments should be performed prior to dosing. Depending on 
scheduling considerations, subjects may be asked to return the following day for dose administration.  
Under this circumstance, nearby [CONTACT_478388]. 
Following dosing, patients will remain under the observation of study personnel in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (eg, may include infusion center, PAC U, recovery suite, observation unit, short stay center) for [ADDRESS_613784] may 
be directed to remain at  a nearby  [CONTACT_478389] (if within a reasonable distance) 
and report the next morning for examination or to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11297].  Note that, under 
these circumstances, there is no require ment for an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]; if a decision is made to

Follow- Up 
Study personnel will conduct telephone call  with subjects on Study Day 137 (± 7 days) to assess 
status regarding any adverse events.  Depending on the results, the subject may be asked to come to 
the clinic for evaluation .  Subjects will retu rn at Study Days 169 (± 7 days) and 253 (± 7 days) for 
safety and efficacy assessments.    
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]/Study Interruption/Discontinuation Notice  
The investigators and medical monitor  in conjunction with the sponsor may elect to stop dosing or 
stop the st udy based on any treatment emergent concerns.  Dosing will  be stopped due to the 
occurrence of any individual adverse events which, in the judgment of the investigators and medical 
monitor in conjunction with the sponsor, need further characterization with respect to progression and 
reversibility before further dosing is conducted.  Such adverse events may include non- serious 
unusual events.  If dosing is stopped, review of the data by [CONTACT_478390] h the 
investigators and medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (see below regarding DSMB composition and charter) must occur before dosing 
can be resumed.   Dosing will only be resumed with DSMB approval. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB )   
In order to ensure the utmost safety of subjects, the Sponsor will also use a Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ).  Each time the DSMB  is engaged, a recommendation to proceed from the 
DSMB  will be required in order for the study to continue (i.e. to resume if stopped or ongoing study 
will be stopped if DSMB does not recommend proceeding).  The DSMB  will review the safety and 
tolerability data from Part [ADDRESS_613785] of an investigator, 
the sponsor , or medical monitor. A charter will be written to describe the DSMB ’s objectives, its 
membership, schedule for data reviews, and general responsibilities with respect to the study.  All 
DSMB  decisions will be documented in writing, and where required, submitted to the institutional 
review board (IRB) for their review or information.   
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Part 1 will enroll up to 24 subjects in cohorts of 6 subjects each. Part 2 will enroll approximately 32 
subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio (and thus approximately 16 subjects per arm) to repeated doses of 
AXER -204 or of matc hing placebo.

19. Evidence or self -report of alcohol or drug abuse within the previous [ADDRESS_613792], dosage and mode of administration:  
AXER -204 is  a human fusion protein to promote axon growth and recovery of neurological  function.  
AXER -204 is administered by [CONTACT_478392].   
Part 1:  
Dosage will be by [CONTACT_9084], with 4 sequentially- treated cohorts planned.   Intrathecal  doses of AXER -
204 below 90 mg will be diluted and delivered as a solution in 10 mL of isotonic phosphate buffered 
saline.  Both the 90 mg dose and 200 mg dose will be dosed with the current study drug 
concentration.  All administration will be given following a removal of an equivalent volume of CSF.  
Intrathecal injections will be given at a rate of 100 mL/hr using a medically approved syringe pump 
(eg, 12 minutes to administer 20 mL) to avoid significant disruption of natural CSF flow and pressure and monitored by [CONTACT_80348].   
The starting dose of 3 mg is estimated to be below the pharmacologically active dose.  Dose 
escalation will proceed to 30 mg, 90 mg, 200 mg contingent on safety, tolerability , and available PK .

Efficacy  
Part 1   
Part 1 is focused on safety , tolerability,  and pharmacokinetics.  However, a subset of efficacy 
assessments are to be performed including:  
• ISNCSC I.  ISNCSCI is a comprehensive clinician -administered neurological exam for 
SCI. It is widely used for research and clinical (neurologic) description to fully assess 
sensory and motor functioning and level of injury in traumatic SCI.  The UEMS will be calculated from the I SNCSCI.  
• GRASSP.  GRASSP is a clinician administered test that assesses strength in 10 key 
muscles in the upper extremity as well as dexterity and fine motor skills.  
• SCIM III self -care and mobility scores.  SCIM III measures functional outcomes in three 
sections:  self -care, respi[INVESTIGATOR_478333], and mobility.  The current 
study will employ the self- care and mobility subscores.  
Part [ADDRESS_613800] changes from pre -treatment  
baseline and slope for: 
• GRASSP  prehension performance  scores .  GRASSP is a clinician -administered test  with 
three subset scores  that assesses strength in 10 key muscles in the upper extremity as well 
as dexterity and fine motor skills.  
• SCIM III self -care scores.  Although the SCIM III measures functional outcomes in three 
sections:  self -care, respi[INVESTIGATOR_478333], and mobility, the current study 
will employ the self -care and mobility subscores.  The evaluation will be administered by  
[CONTACT_478394] a clinician.  
Exploratory endpoints will include within- subject changes over time from pre -treatment  in: 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential • ISNCSCI low er extremity motor and sensory scores.  ISNCSCI is a comprehensive 
clinician -administered neurological exam for SCI. It is widely used for research and 
clinical (neurologic al) description to fully assess sensory and motor functioning and level 
of injury in t raumatic SCI.   
• GRASSP strength, sensation and prehension ability scores   
• SCIM III mobility scores 
• ISAFSCI.  The ISAFSCI will be used to document autonomic control of the heart, blood 
pressure, sweating , and temperature regulation.  Lower urinary tract function, bowel 
function, and sexual function will be scored. 
• Patient Reported Outcomes  
− CUE -Questionnaire (CUE -Q).  Assesses subject -reported upper limb function. 
− SF-36 v2.  Provides a patient- reported Quality of Life (QoL) assessment.  SF -36 will 
provide data on the subjects' perceived health and well-being over the course of the study.   
− Neuro -QOL Item Bank v1.0 – Upper Extremity Function (Fine Motor, ADL) 
− PGIC – Chronic SCI 
Exploratory biomarkers of target engagement and axonal growth may be assessed.  
Safety: 
Safety will be evaluated similarly for both Parts, through the collection of data from: 
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms  
• Laboratory parameters (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis).  Analysis of CSF 
for protein, cell count, and glucose. 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).   
− TEAEs will be defined as any AE occurring during or after the injection of study drug or placebo.   
− TEAEs will be limited to those events occurring within [ADDRESS_613801] visit.  
Condition- specific safety outcomes will include adverse changes in : 
• ISNCSCI, GRASSP and all of the  neurological measures evaluated for efficacy  
• Spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale) .  A clinician administered examination for 
spasticity which measures muscle tone.  A score of 0 -4 is assigned to each muscle group 
evaluated.   Note: Testing will exclude fingers and thumb. 
• Pain (BPI) . A self -administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of a subject's 
pain and the impact of this pain on the subject's daily functioning.  
Statistical Methods  
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020  
 17  
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential A general description is inclu ded here for the investigator.  A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be 
submitted to the IND prior to unblinding the database for Part 2. 
Sample Size  
The Part 1 sample size was derived empi[INVESTIGATOR_478334]. 
The Part 2 sample size was selected to ensure adequate power for detecting treatment -related change 
in bilateral UEMS (Score from 0 to 50). A 5-point difference, between the treated and placebo groups, in the change from baseline to 6 
months in bilateral UEMS is considered clinically meaningful. Analysis of historical data for cervical 
SCI patients for the period between ~6- [ADDRESS_613802] deviation 
of bilateral UEMS change over 6 months to be around 3 to 4 points. 
With a sample size of 12 subjects per active and placebo group, Part 2 of the study has 80% power 
with Type I error of α=0.05 ( two sided), assuming a 5-point difference as indicated above, and with a 
common standard deviation within each treatment group  of approximately 4  in the change from 
baseline to 6 months in bilateral UEMS.  
Accounting for uncertainties in the assumptions based upon historical data used to extrapolate for 
estimating the sample size in this study and the need for estimation of missing data a sample size of approximately 16 subjects per treatment arm ( 32 total) will be randomized .    
Stages of Analysis 
The analysis for this study will be performed in three stages, with the first analysis performed upon 
completion of the clinical portion of Part 1, the second analysis (including the core efficacy 
assessment) performed upon completion Day 169 of Part 2  (ie, after all subjects have comple ted 
through Study Day 169), and the final analysis performed upon completion of the post- treatment 
follow-up phase of Part 2 (Day 253) .  The methods applied to each analysis will be consistent with 
the objectives of the study.   
The blind will be maintaine d for all blinded study personnel  (including investigators and subjects) 
through the completion of Day 169 of Part 2 .  After completion of Day 169, designated sponsor staff 
and external consultants/contractors required to perform the analysis will be unblinded to the treatment allocations in order to complete data analysis though Day 169.  The blind will be 
maintained for site investigators and subjects through completion of Day [ADDRESS_613803] be 
broken sooner for safety  or regulatory reason s.   
General Methods  
Data will be tabulated using both descriptive and inferential statistics where specified.   
• For Part 1, data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_478395] (all subjects 
combined), and no inferential statistics are planned.  
• For Par t 2, data will be tabulated for each treatment group separately (placebo and 
AXER -204) to allow for visual inspection of outcomes between the arms.  Inferential 
statistical comparison of the treatment groups is planned. 
For both Parts, all data collected w ill be included in by -domain data listings, sorted by [CONTACT_478396], or as appropriate. 
No hypothesis testing will be performed for demographics, background, or safety data.  Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_478397] (n), means, mean changes 
from baseline, mean % changes from baseline (where appropriate), standard deviations, minimum, First quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3) , and maximum values. The number of subjects with 
missing data will be indicate d. 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020  
 18  
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_478397] (n), the number of subjects 
with missing data as well as counts and percentages in each of the categories. Percentages will be 
based upon the number of subjects with available data. 
When inferential testing is applied to all efficacy assessments, d ichotomous/binary categorical 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed via a 2 -sided Fisher’s Exact test or Chi -square test as appropriate.  
Continuous efficacy endpoints will also present leas t-squares means and p -values from hypothesis 
testing of efficacy endpoints using mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM).  
Additional details will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior 
to unblinding Part [ADDRESS_613804]. Missing AE or CM dates and missing severity or 
relationship to study drug will always use a conservative approach. Details will be included in the 
SAP.  
For subjects who discontinue treatment (for any reason), subjects will continue to be followed and key efficacy endpoints and safety data collected where possible.  
Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  Safety outcomes will be assessed for all subjects who are given at least one dose 
of investigational product.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population:  Efficacy outcomes will be evaluated using the FAS, defined as 
all subjects randomized, t reated with at least [ADDRESS_613805]- baseline assessment of efficacy.  
Per Protocol  Population: The per protocol population will be a subset of  FAS  and include subjects 
who received at least 80% of study drug  and have no major protocol deviations that would impact 
efficacy assessment .  
Alpha Level Considerations 
All inferential testing will be performed using two -sided 5% Type I error (α), and therefore 2- sided p -
values ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_613806] will be the key secondary  efficacy endpoint of change in bilateral UEMS 
from baseline to Study Day 169 using the MMRM model as detailed below. Additional secondary 
efficacy endpoints tested will be the ch ange in GRASSP  prehension performance from baseline  and 
slope to Study Day 169 and of change in SCIM s elf-care from baseline to Study Day 16 9.  
Efficacy Endpoints 
Changes from pre -treatment to each on -treatment time point will be calculated, with the prima ry time 
point at Day 169.  Shifts over time in ordinal endpoints will be presented, with comparisons between 
treatment groups assessed using a CMH row mean scores statistic at each time point .  Slope of change 
will also be evaluated . 
Safety Endpoints 
Changes from pre -treatment will be calculated in a similar fashion as for the efficacy endpoints, but 
no inferential statistics will be provided for safety endpoints.  Shifts from baseline in 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ) will be tabulated  for heart rate and QTcF.  Other endpoints will be assessed 
according to the scale of the variable.  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020  
 19  
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential Concentration data in both blood serum and in CSF will be assessed descriptively over time.  
Correlation with efficacy and safety outcomes may be perform ed, as the data warrant.  
Potential Open -Label Extension Study  
The sponsor may, pending data outcomes from this current study, initiate an open- label extension 
study at a later date.  This study would provide subjects who participated in Study RNX- AX204 -101, 
during either Part  1 only  and those receiving placebo in Part 2, t he potential  opportunity to participate 
in a repeat -dose study with AXER-204.   
Initiation of the open- label extension study will be contingent on satisfactory results from the current 
clinical study (Part 1 and Part 2) supportive of continued development, f unding, and the requisite 
regulatory and IRB approvals.

This study will be conducted by [CONTACT_478398], 
Inc. (the sponsor ) at approximately [ADDRESS_613838] Research Organization, (CRO), and other vendors are listed in the Investigator Site File provided to each site.  

Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613839] with axonal receptors, including NgR1, NgR2, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_478341], and EphA4 [ Liu 2006, Schwab 
2014].  Extracellular proteoglycans, containing chondroitin sulfates, also inhibit axonal sprouting in the adult CNS, particularly near sites of astrogliosis and scar formation [ Ohtake 2015, Sharma 
2012].  There is substantial molecular cross talk between ligands and receptors.  The key inhibitory ligands Nogo, MAG, and OMgp all bind and activate NgR1 on axons to inhibit axonal extension.  Likewise, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_478341] (LILRB2) has been found to bind Nogo, MAG, and OMgp and to 
mediate axonal growth inhibition.  Consistent with partially overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_478342], simultaneous genetic deletion of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp has greater impact on axonal growth and functional recovery following CNS injury than deletion of a single inhibitor 
[Cafferty 2010].  A representation of the role of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp and other key 
regulators of axonal growth in t he adult CNS is presented in  Figure 1.  
Figure 1: Key Components Regulating Axonal Growth in the Adult Mammalian 
Central Nervous System  
 
Targeting one ligand or one receptor in the inhibitory adult CNS pathways has been shown to 
yield some benefit in certain specific pre -clinical spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] ( SCI) models.  Based on 
these observations, anti- Nogo antibodies are entering clinical trials  for new (subacute) SCI. In 
distinction, NoGo Trap (AXER-204, Nogo Receptor decoy, hNgR1(310)ecto- Fc Ala Ala) 

Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential represents a mechanistically superior approach to promoting axonal growth following injury as it 
binds three key inhibitors, Nogo, MAG, and OMgp, and blocks their interaction with 
endogenous NgR1 and other receptors ( Figure 2).  Consistent with this mechanism, NoGo Trap 
has been shown in multiple laboratories to promote axonal growth and recovery of function in a 
variety of pre-clinical models of CNS injury including stroke [ Lee 2004 ], dorsal root crush injury 
[Harvey 2009], acute transection SCI [ Li 2004], and acute/sub-acute contusion SCI [ Ji 2006, 
Wang 2006, Wang 2014].  Most critically, No Go Trap supports axonal growth and functional 
recovery in chronic contusion SCI [ Wang 2011 ], while no other blocker of extrinsic signals has 
reported efficacy in this setting.  Recent pre- clinical studies have  shown that intrathecal lumbar 
administration results in broad CNS distribution in rat and non-human primate and that intermittent intrathecal bolus injection of the protein provides equivalent restoration of function 
in rat contusion SCI in comparison to previously obtained results employing continuous infusion [Wang 2014].   AXER -204 promotes corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_478343]-human primates with cervical hemisection SCI [ Wang 2020].  
Figure 2: Putative Mechanism of AXER-204 
 
 
The present clinical evaluation of AXER -204 is being conducted in subjects with chronic SCI.  
This plan is based on the enhanced feasibility for detecting treatment-related functional 
improvements in subjects with otherwise stable deficits [ Fawcett 2007, NSCISC 2018].  The 

Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020  
36 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential substantially larger chronic SCI patient population compared to acute SCI cases should facilitate 
enrollment of th is study and has the potential to translate into benefit for many more individuals. 
5.2. Nonclinical Summary 
Nonclinical data are summarized for AXER -204.  In addition, data from nonclinical studies with 
various surrogate proteins, primarily a rat form of the NoGo Trap  protein, are included.  AXER-
204 binds to the myelin associated ligands Nogo (measured using Nogo-66 fragment), MAG, and OMgp in ELISA format in vitro.  Likewise, binding to MAG and OMgp has been measured using a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay.  Consistent with the binding 
profile, AXER-[ADDRESS_613840] injury in rat with either continuous infusion into the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) via intracerebroventricular cannula or intermitted 
bolus intrathecal administration.  Moreover, the intermittent intrathecal treatment increased the 
growth of raphespi[INVESTIGATOR_478344].  
A number of additional evaluations in spi[INVESTIGATOR_478345].  Overall, the pharmacological effects include functional recovery and 
enhanced axon growth.  Of particular importance, NoGo Trap was found to enhance functional recovery in chronic contusion injury in rat – supporting evaluation in chronic SCI.  In 
pharmacokinetics studies, AXER-[ADDRESS_613841] article ( No 
observed adverse effect level [ NOAEL ] was maximum feasible dose volume for each study). 
CSF and serum exposure were confirmed in each study.  Similarly, no test article- related toxicity 
was observed in GLP toxicology studies with administration of AXER-[ADDRESS_613842] level ( NOEL ) for rat and monkey was equivalent to the maximum feasible 
dose.  Toxicology studies employed frequent bolus infusions in order to maximize the cumulative dose evaluated.  
Off-target effects such as toxicity due to systemic exposure are not anticipated with AXER-204 
because the requisite ligands Nogo, MAG, and OMgp are mostly localized in the CNS and 
AXER -204 exposure is predominantly localized to the CNS following intrathecal administration 
in animal studies.  Nonetheless, a one-month GLP rat toxicology study employing intravenous dosing was completed and the maximum dose tested was found to be equivalent to the NOAEL. 
Please refer to the AXER -204 Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed description of 
toxicology investigations. 
5.3. Clinical Experience with AXER- [ADDRESS_613843] evaluation of AXER-204 in humans.   There is extensive published clinical experience with lumbar puncture (LP) procedures 
representative of those required for administration of AXER-204.  The most common adverse 
events (AEs) associated with LP consist of post-LP back pain and post- LP headache. Th is 
protocol includes procedures designed to minimize the incidence and severity of AEs  associated 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613844]. 
5.4. Rationale for Dose Selection  
In Part 1, the initial dose escalation sequence for the study is 3, 30, 90, and 200 mg. The starting dose 3 mg was selected to be 30- fold below the estimated human pharmacologically active dose 
of 90 mg.  Adjusting for cross-species scaling by [CONTACT_478399], toxicology studies did not 
identify AXER-204 related toxicity when given at equivalent (monkey) or at three-fold highe r 
(rat) doses  vs. the maximum planned human dose when given every other day by [CONTACT_478400] [ADDRESS_613845] 21-fold and 8-fold respectively.  The maximum doses 
in toxicology were the maximum feasible doses based on the tolerable volumes for intrathecal 
administration .  The 3  and 30 mg doses will be diluted from the formulation to provide a 
constant injection volume of 10 mL.  The 90 mg and 200 mg doses will be given without dilution 
resulting in dosing volumes of 9 mL and 20 mL respectively .  The dose volumes were selected 
based on published studies and drug label information for other therapeutics describing safety and drug distribution following intra thecal administration.  
A conservative approach was applied in deriving the starting dose in Part 1 in order to enhance 
safety.   For drugs delivered intrathecally, published FDA guidance suggests scaling based on 
compartment volumes and concentrations of the therapeutic [ Guidance for Industry, FDA] .  
Using compartment volumes, the pharmacologic human equivalent dose (HED) is calculated by [CONTACT_478401]. This yields an estimated pharmacologic HED of 90 mg.
  The starting dose of 3 mg is 
anticipated to be free of detectable pharmacological effects using the method outlined in the 
Draft Guidance for Industry and Reviewers of November 2005 entitled “Estimating the 
Maximum Safe Starting  Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult healthy 
Volunteers”  and incorporates a safety factor of 30 compared to the estimated human 
Pharmacologically Active Dose of 90 mg.  The maximum dose volume of 20 mL represents approximately 10-15% of total average CSF volume for adults and roughly 30% of spi[INVESTIGATOR_478346] [ Kroin 1992, Thorne 2001, Sakka 2011] .  The dose will be introduced immediately 
following collection of an equivalent volume of CSF and at a controlled constant rate of 100 mL/h (12 min for 20 mL).  The bolus injection rate selected is five times the average time required to regenerate the CSF collected (20 mL/h) [ Hladky 2014].  The time required to 
regenerate CSF collected by [CONTACT_478402] [ Brinker 2014, Masserman 1934] .  Thus, the sequence of CSF 
collection followed by [CONTACT_478403].  The controlled bolus injection rate selected is slower than the rate of injection specified for several marketed products administered intrathecally including:  Omnipaque 10-17 mL injected over 1- 2 min, a small 
amount of CSF may be removed prior to inje ction [ OMNIPLAQUE Package Insert ]; 
Methotrexate, usually 2-6 mL (up to 10 mL) injected over 1-3 min following removal of an equivalent volume of CSF; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101969] 5 mL injected in children over 1-3 min after removal of 5 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020  
38 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential mL CSF [ SPI[INVESTIGATOR_478347] ].  Published results indicate that volumes ranging from 10-
[ADDRESS_613846] removed [ Papi[INVESTIGATOR_478348] 2013, Rieselbach 
1962a, Rieselbach  1962b, Rieselbach 1963].  The conservative controlled injection rate of 
AXER -[ADDRESS_613847] distribution 
to the cisterna magna is reported following bolus intrathecal lumbar administration provided a volume over 10% of total CSF is given [ Papi[INVESTIGATOR_478348] 2013, Rieselbach 1962a ].  Estimates of total 
subarachnoid CSF volume in adults generally range between 90-170 mL and 150 mL is commonly taken as the volume for dose modeling [ Brinker 2014, Kuttler 2010] .  Thus, the range 
of AXER -[ADDRESS_613848] safety, d ose selection for Part 2 of the study will be based on safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics data generated in Part 1  and the DSMB will review and 
approve dosing frequency and level before recommending starting Part 2.  The maximum safe 
dose identified in Part 1 will be selected for repeated administration in Part 2.  The frequenc y of 
dosing in Part 2 will be determined based on analysis of pharmacokinetic data.  In addition, biomarkers of target engagement and mechanism engagement are under development with the objective of implementing these assays to aid in guiding dose frequency in Part 2.  The dosing will be no more frequent than once every two weeks or as long as once every 4 weeks for Part 2. 
As described for Part 1, repeat -dose toxicology studies with much more frequent administration 
in rat and cynomolgus monkey did not ide ntify AXER -204 toxicity.

expected to receive the same dose of study drug.  Thus, up to 24 subjects will be enrolled in Part 1, and all will receive AXER -204.  
If the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached prior to the fourth cohort, the sponsor may enroll the remaining subjects (up to a total enrollment of 24 for the study) to obtain furthe r data 
at the tolerated dose levels .  The sponsor in conjunction with the investigators and medical 
monitor will determine dose escalation according to the methods described in Section 7.3.3. 
Study drug will be administered sequentially, with at least 3 days between subjects being dosed 
within each cohort (following 72-hour safety assessment review by [CONTACT_478404]). 
The study stages for Part 1 are:  
• Screening ( within  84 days prior to Day 1).  Patients have [ADDRESS_613851] be completed within 28 days prior to Day 1. 
• Treatment p eriod:  Check-in Day 1, administration of study drug, 3-night in- clinic 
stay, and discharge on Day 4 following the completion of all scheduled procedures.  
• Follow-up: Subjects will have follow-up visits for up to [ADDRESS_613852]-dose as follows: 
subjects will receive a phone call on Study Days 5, 6, and 7 to inquire about their 
general health and will return to the clinic for visits on Study Day 8 (± 1 day), Study Day 15 (±3 day s) and Study Day 29 or Early Termination (± 4 days).  See Table 5  for 
the Schedule of Events for Part 1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening  
All subjects must sign/e -sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to undergoing any screening 
procedures.  Screening procedures will take place up to [ADDRESS_613853] structure and intrathecal space ( Appendix 12) ; MRIs will be run locally 
and evaluated  by a sponsor- arranged expert .  Additional radiological assessments may be 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613854]’s demographics, medical and surgical history, and prior and concomitant medications will be recorded.  Screening/baseline assessments will be performed, 
and subjects will undergo blood draws where blood, serum collection, viral serology will be 
obtained, and urine samples will be collected.  
Subjects will also be presented with a separate biobank ICF for review. If a subject agrees, 
samples of his/her CSF, blood, MRI scans and data collected in the study, will be stored for 
future research.  A subject does not have to agree or sign the biobank ICF in order to be eligible to participate in this main study.   
Urine testing for drugs of abuse will include the standard 9-drug panel (amphetamines, cocaine, 
marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], methadone, and propoxyphene).  Subjects using m arijuana /THC -CBD preparations, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], sedative hypnotics, 
or tranquilizers may be permitted to participate in the tria l provided the dosage and frequency of 
use are not considered likely to interfere with evaluation of safety and efficacy endpoints in the trial.  Determination of exclusion due to use of a specific medication from these classes of 
medications will be made by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_478349], frequency of use, and medical condition being treated.   
In the event that a subject is rescreened, the original screening MRI and expert review of the 
images may be used for the rescreening provided the MRI was completed within 6 months of rescreening.   
Similarly, neurological examinations and questionnaires do not need to be repeated 
provided the rescreening occurs with in 84 days of the time of data collection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. In-Clinic  Treatment Period  
Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the evening prior to or on the day of dosing 
(Study Day 1) dependent on clinical site requirements.  Following final pre -treatment 
assessments, subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture (LP) and receive their single dose of study 
drug administered via intrathecal lumbar slow bolus infusion by [CONTACT_94108][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained and licensed designee.  Dosing will be according to Table 8.  
Subjects will remain in -clinic until discharge on Study Day 4 and will undergo daily safety 
assessments and observation.  Blood and CSF samples will be obtained.  The timing for serum and CSF sample collection may 
be adjusted for subsequent cohorts based on PK data from the preceding cohorts. In addition to 
undergoing PK analysis, serum samples obtained from blood collected at pre -dose and on Study 
Days 8 and 29 will be analyzed for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).

Day 15 (±3d) for blood collection  (serum PK analysis) , and again on Study Day 29 (±4d) ( for 
end of study assessments).  V ital signs, concomitant medication s, AEs, and general health status  
will be assessed at each visit . 
7.1.2. Part 2  
Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat  dose study in CSCI 
subjects.  Approximately 32 subjects will be randomized (ratio 1:1) to receive AXER-204 or 
placebo (an isotonic phosphate buffered saline formulation).  Subject to review of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from Part [ADDRESS_613856] 
to DSMB approval, the dose and dose frequency may also be adjusted during Part 2 based on 
emergent safety and tolerability data . 
The study stages for Part 2 are: 
• Screening ( within  84 days prior to Day 1).  Patients have [ADDRESS_613857] be completed within 28 days prior to Day 1. 
• Treatment Period ( 15 weeks). Study treatment given every 2-[ADDRESS_613858].   
• Follow-up (21 weeks).  Following the last Treatment Period dose of investigational product or Early Termination  of dosing, a telephone call  to assess status regarding 
any adverse events will be conducted on Study Day 137 (± 7 days) and follow-up visits will occur at Study Days 169 (± 7 days) and 253 (± 7 days). 
See Table 6 for the Schedule of Events for Part 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening  
All subjects must sign/e -sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to undergoing any screening 
procedures.  Screening procedures will take place up to [ADDRESS_613859] structure and intrathecal space; MRIs will be run locally and evaluated by a sponsor- arranged expert.  Additional radiological assessments may be performed at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator, including CT or MRI of the head and X- ray of the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_478350]- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613860]’s demographics, medical and surgical history, and prior and concomitant 
medications will be recorded.  Screening assessments will be performed, and subjects will 
undergo blood draws where blood, serum collection, viral serology will be obtained, and urine samples will be collected.  
Subjects will also be presented with a separate biobank ICF for review. If a subject agrees, 
samples of his/her CSF, blood, MRI scans and data collected in the study, will be stored for future research.  A subject does not have to agree or sign the biobank ICF in order to be eligible to participate in this main study.   
Urine testing for drugs of abuse will include the standard 9-drug panel (amphetamines, cocaine, 
marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], methadone, and 
propoxyphene).  Subjects using m arijuana /THC -CBD preparations, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], sedative hypnotics, 
or tranquilizers may be permitted to participate in the trial provided the dosage and frequency of 
use are not considered likely to interfere with evaluation of safety and efficacy endpoints in the 
trial.  Determination of exclusion due to use of a specific medication from these classes of 
medications will be made by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_478325], frequency of use, and medical condition being treated.   
In the event that a subject is rescreened, the original screening MRI and expert review of the 
images may be used for the rescreening provided the MRI was completed within 6 months of rescreen ing.  Similarly, the ISNCSCI and GRASSP  do not need to be repeated provided the 
rescreening occurs with 84 days of the time of data collection.
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Phase 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either AXER -204 or to placebo.  The randomization will 
be stratified based on pre -treatment AI S grade (AIS A,B vs. AIS C,D) and prior receipt of study 
drug in Part 1 (Received AXER-204 in Part 1 vs. Did not receive AXER-204 in Part 1). 
Subjects will undergo baseline assessments and  receive their assigned (double- blind) treatment 
on Study Day 1.  Study personnel will conduct telephone call  with subjects on Study Day 8 (± 3 
days) to assess status regarding any adverse events .  Subjects  will then return to the Clinic on  
Day 2 1 (± 5 days) for safety, efficacy, and PK assessments and their second dose of study 
investigational product.  Thereafter, s ubjects will return approximately every 21 days, at Study 
Days 42 (± 5 days) (third dose), 63 (± 5 days) (fourth dose), 84 ( ± 5 days) (fifth dose ), 104 (± 5 
days) ( sixth  dose), for safety, efficacy, and PK assessments  (pre-dose) and investigational 
product administration .   
Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_478327] -dose at each treatment (dosing) visit, including 
Study Day 1, during a single LP procedure for collecting and dosing.  Serum for PK and 
immunogenicity (ADA) testing will be collected pre -dose at specified visits ( See Table 11 ), 
within [ADDRESS_613861]- dose at specified visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow- Up 
Study personnel will conduct telephone call  with subjects on Study Day 137 (± 7 days) to assess 
status re garding any adverse events.  Depending on the results, the subject may be asked to come

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential to the clinic for evaluation.  Subjects will return at Study Days 169 (± 7 days), and 253 (± 7 days) 
for safety and efficacy assessments.    
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Part 1 will enroll up to 24 subjects in cohorts of 6 subjects each.  
Part 2 will enroll approximately 32 subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio (and thus approximately 
16 subjects per arm) to repeated doses of AXER -[ADDRESS_613862] administration . 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
7.3.1. Part 1  
Dosage will be by [CONTACT_9084], with 4 sequentially-treated cohorts planned.  Intrathecal doses of 
AXER -204 below 90 mg will be diluted and delivered as a solution in 10 mL of isotonic 
phosphate buffered saline.  Both the 90 mg dose and 200 mg dose will be dosed with the current 
study drug concentration.  All administration will be given following a removal of an equivalent 
volume of CSF. Intrathecal injections will be given at a rate of 100 mL/hr using a medically 
approved syringe pump (eg, 12 minutes to administer 20 mL) to avoid significant disruption of 
natural CSF flow and pressure.   
The starting dose of 3 mg is estimated to be below the pharmacologically active dose.  Dose 
escalation will proceed to 30 mg, 90 mg, 200 mg contingent on safety, tolerability , and available 
PK.  Thus, dosing volumes will be given as follows: 
• Cohort 1:  3 mg, 10 mL 
• Cohort 2:  30 mg, 10 mL 
• Cohort 3:  90 mg, 9 mL 
• Cohort 4:  [ADDRESS_613863] ( DSMB ) Dose 
Escalation in Part 1  
Dose escalation decisions will be made jointly by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, and medical monitor.  
The investigator, sponsor, and medical monitor may also make adjustments to the dosing plan, as 
appropriate for reasons of safety and tolerability.  Dose escalation (for each sequential cohort) 
will not occur until [ADDRESS_613864]-dose follow-up visit.  
Determination of whether to escalate dose in the subsequent cohort will be made jointly by [CONTACT_4520], sponsor, and medical monitor after review of all clinical and available PK data.  Review will include AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), and specifically the following potential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_478351]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]/Study Interruption/Discontinuation Notice  (Part 1)  
The investigators and medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor may elect to stop dosing 
or stop the study based on any treatment emergent concerns.  Dosing will be stopped due to the 
occurrence of any individual adverse events which, in the judgment of the investigators and 
medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor, need further characterization with respect to progression and reversibility before further dosing is conducted.  Such adverse events may 
include non-serious unusual events.  If dosing is stopped, review of the data by [CONTACT_478405].   Dosing will only be resumed with DSMB approval.
 
Pharmacokinetic and anti -drug antibody test results will not be required for dose escalation 
unless it is determined advisable by [CONTACT_478406].  CSF and serum samples will be 
analyzed for each cohort immediately after all subjects have been dosed.  The sponsor may direct earlier analysis of a partially completed cohort if completion of the cohort is delayed or partial cohort data is desired to aid in interpretation of any emergent clinical data.   
If the investigators and medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor determine that the dose 
is well tolerated in the completed dose group, dosing will proceed to the next dose level.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]/Study Interruption/Discontinuation Notice (Part 2)  
The investigators and medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor may elect to stop dosing 
or stop the study based on any treatment emergent concerns.  Dosing wi ll be stopped due to the 
occurrence of any individual adverse events which, in the judgment of the investigators and 
medical monitor in conjunction with the sponsor, need further characterization with respect to 
progression and reversibility before further dosing is conducted.  Such adverse events may 
include non-serious unusual events.  If dosing is stopped, review of the data by [CONTACT_478407] (see below regarding DSMB composition and charter) must 
occur before dosing can be resumed.  Dosing will only be resumed with DSMB approval. 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613865] (DSMB).  Each time the DSMB is engaged, a recommendation to proceed 
from the DSMB will be required in order for the study to continue (i.e. to resume if stopped or ongoing study will be stopped if DSMB does not recommend proceeding) .  The DSMB will 
review the safety and tolerability data from Part [ADDRESS_613866] has completed 3 months of dosing and approximately every 3 months thereafter while dosing continues in the study (allowing for potential scheduling 
logistics). In addition to the pre- determined DSMB data review meetings, the DSMB may be 
engaged at any time at the request of an investigator, the sponsor, or medical monitor, or if 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_47940]. A charter will be written to describe the DSMB’s objectives, its 
membership, schedule for data reviews, and general responsibilities in respect to the study.  All 
DSMB decisions will be documented in writing, and where required, submitted to the institutional review board (IRB) for their review or information.   
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
If the dosing is stopped during the study due to safety and tolerability concerns, a recommendation from the DSMB  that it is safe to resume dosing will be required in order to 
continue dosing. 
All decisions will be documented in writing, and where required, submitted to the institutional 
review bo ard/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) for their review or information.

the source documents and electronic case report form  (eCRF) .  A discontinuation occurs when an 
enrolled subject ceases participation in the study, regardless of the circumstances, prior to 
completion of the protocol.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should 
be made to contact [CONTACT_423].  A subject will be considered lost- to-follow- up after [ADDRESS_613874]’s record.  In 
any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The 
Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_478353].  Withdrawal

Daily low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 mg) therapy is permitted. 
Antipsychotic drugs used as  mood stabilizers for the adjunctive treatment of depression as well 
as antidepressants (SSRI, SNRI, TCA, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331]) are permitted provided the subject is on a 
stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening and the dose is not anticipated to change 
during participation in the trial.  
Marijuana /THC -CBD preparations, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], sedative hypnotics, or tranquilizers are permitted 
only if the dosage and frequency of use are not considered likely to interfere with evaluation of

patients.  This wait- period will allow for a review of safety data collected during the in -clinic 
treatment phase prior to each new subjects ’ dosing.   
10.4.2. Part 2  
Central randomization will be implemented in the study.  At the pre-dose visit (Visit 2) Study Day 1 , eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_613880] identification number 
that was assigned at Screening Visit on the enrollment page in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) 
system . The EDC  will assign a unique treatment code, which will be linked to the appropriate 
treatment group as assigned by [CONTACT_478409].    
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either AXER -204 or to placebo.  The randomization will 
be stratified based on pre -treatment AIS grade (AIS A,B vs. AIS C,D) and prior receipt of study 
drug in Part 1 (Received AXER-204 in Part 1 vs. Did not receive AXER-204 in Part 1). The blind will be maintained for all blinded study personnel (including investigators and 
subjects) through the completion of Day [ADDRESS_613881] and performing all other study 
procedures.  After completion of Day 169, designated sponsor staff and external consultants/contractors required to perform the analysis will be unblinded to the treatment 
allocations in order to complete data analysis though Day 169.  The blind will be maintained for 
site investigators and  subjects through completion of Day [ADDRESS_613882].  
Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment ( eg, PK samples) will be handled 
such that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias minimized.  This may include making special provisions such as segregating the data in question from view by [CONTACT_478410], sponsor clinical team, and others as appropriate. 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613883] completed their treatment 
period and follow- up assessments  through Day 169.  This efficacy  analysis will be performed as 
the primary assessment of efficacy in the study; the study will continue through the follow-up period to Study Day 253.  A second efficacy analysis will be conducted at Study Day 253.

puncture and preparation and availability of study drug or placebo necessary for the intrathecal administration of investigational product.   
Serum will be collected for PK and ADA analysis as detailed in Section 13.2.  
If a lumbar puncture fails to return CSF after two  attempts, it is recommended that fluo roscopy 
be scheduled to assist in achieving successful LP.  Likewise, it is recommended that the lumbar 
puncture procedure be suspended if the CSF sample is bloody or turbid.  Decisions regarding the 
lumbar puncture procedure are at the discretion of the s ite principal investigator.   Additionally, 
investigators may make an assessment based on a given patient that all LPs will be conducted 
under fluoroscopy.  
During the lumbar puncture, an amount of CSF approximately equivalent to the amount of 
investigation al product to be injected into the intrathecal space (~9 -20 mL) will be obtained pre-

Part 1 is focused on safety, tolerability,  and pharmacokinetics.  However, a subset of efficacy 
assessments are included, as follows:  
• ISNCSCI.  ISNCSCI is a comprehensive clinician -administered neurological exam 
for SCI. It is widely used for research and clinical (neurologic) description to fully assess sensory and motor functioning and level of injury in traumatic SCI.  The 
UEMS will be calculated from the full ISNCSCI and evaluated separately.  
• GRASSP [ Kalsi -Ryan 2012a, Kalsi-Ryan 2012b].  GRASSP is a clinician 
administered test with three subset scores that assesses strength in 10 key muscles in the upper extremity as well as dexterity and fine motor skills.  
• SCIM III self -care and mobility scores [ Catz 2007, Itzkovich 2007].  SCIM III 
measures functional outcomes in three section s:  self -care, respi[INVESTIGATOR_478367], and mobility.  The current study will employ the self- care and mobility 
subscores. 
13.1.2. Part [ADDRESS_613913] change from 
pre-treatment baseline and slope for UEMS  as compared to placebo .  The UEMS is collected as 
part of the ISNCSCI  (Appendix 3).  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints will include changes from pre- treatment baseline and 
slope for: 
• Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensation and Prehension (GRASSP) 
prehension performance scores .  GRASSP is a clinician administered test with three 
subset scores that assesses strength in 10 key muscles in the upper extremity as well as dexterity and fine motor skills ( Appendix 4).  
• Version III of the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_174467] (SCIM III) self- care.  SCIM III 
measures functional outcomes in three sections:  self -care, respi[INVESTIGATOR_478367], and mobility.  The current study will employ the self- care and mobility 
subscores.  The evaluation will be administered by a clinician ( Appendix 8).  
Exploratory functional endpoints will include within- subject changes from pre -treatment 
baseline and slope for: 
• ISNCSCI low er extremity motor and sensory scores

• SCIM III mobility scores  
• Patient Reported Outc omes  
− CUE -Questionnaire (CUE -Q) [Marino 2012, Marino 2015] .  Assesses subject -
reported upper limb function ( Appendix 2). 
− SF-36 v2 - Provides an investigator- evaluated Quality of Life (QoL) assessment 
for subjects.  SF-36 will provide data on the subjects' perceived health and well-
being over the course of the study ( Appendix 6).  
− Neuro -QOL Item Bank v1.0 – Upper Extremity Function (Fine Motor, ADL) - 
(Appendix 7).  
− PGIC – Chronic SCI  (Appendix 10 ) – Provides a patient-reported global 
impression of change in the symptoms, activity limitations, emotions and overall quality of life with chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_478368]. 
• ISAFSCI  [Krassioukov 2012].  The ISAFSCI will be used to document autonomic 
control of the heart, blood pressure, sweating and temperature regulation.  Lower urinary tract function, bowel function, and sexual function will be scored (Appendix 1). 
Exploratory biomarkers of target engagement and axonal growth may  be assessed.   
Since the mechanism of action entails enhanced axonal growth and plasticity, changes attained  
through Study Day [ADDRESS_613914] relevant to assessing on- target effects of 
therapy.   
13.2. Pharmacokinetics  
Both serum and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_478369], as shown in Table 10 
and Table 11.   
In Part 1, a window relative to the nominal timepoint is allowed for sample collection as follows: 
• Blood serum pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at 0 hour (immediately pre-
dose), and 1 h ( ±10 min), 6 h ( ±10 min), 12 h ( ±10 min), and 24 h ( ±10 min) post-
dose, as well as at Study Day 4 (72h ±  10 min), 8 ( ±1d), 15 (±3d), and 29 ( ±4d).   
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_478332] (CSF) will be collected via lumbar puncture at 0 hour (immediately pre -dose), 24 h ( ±2h) Study Day 4 (72 h ± 4h), and Study Days 8 ( ±1d), 
and 29 (±4d).  
The timing for serum and CSF sample collection may be adjusted for subsequent cohorts based 
on pharmacokinetic data from the preceding cohorts.  Serum PK samples collected at pre-dose 
and on Study Days 8 and 29 will be analyzed for the presence of anti- drug antibodies (ADA). 
In Part 2 , Visits 3 -7 (Study Days 21, 42, 63, 84, 104) will have a window of ± 5 days and Visits 
8 and 9 (Study Days 169 and 253) will have a window of ± [ADDRESS_613915]-dose on Study Days 1, 21, 42, 63, 84, and 104.  Serum will 
also be collected for PK analy sis on Study Days 169 and 253.  Pre- dose serum will be collected 
for ADA analysis on Study Days 1, 21, 42, 63, 84, and 104.  Serum will also be collected for 
ADA analysis on Study Days 169 and 253.  A subset of the CSF samples may also be analyzed 
for ADAs  depending on development and presence of ADAs in the serum.  Part 2 serum and 
CSF from subjects receiving placebo will be collected but will not be analyzed for PK and 
ADAs.  
In Part 2 on Study Days 1, 21, 42, 63, 84, and 104 a window relative to the nominal timepoint is 
allowed for sample collection as follows: 
• Serum pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at 0 hour ( within 4 h pre -dose), and 
4 h (±10 min) post-dose 
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_478332] (CSF) will be collected via lumbar puncture at 0 hour 
(immediately pre -dose)

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential 14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The Schedule of Events for Part 1  given in Table 5 , and for Part 2 in  Table 6 provide the timing 
for assessments starting with the Screen ing Visits.  
14.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be evaluated similarly for both Parts, through the collection of data from: 
• Physical examinations 
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms  
• Laboratory parameters (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).   
− TEAEs will be defined as any AE occurring during or after the injection of 
investigational product.   
− TEAEs will be limited to those events occurring within [ADDRESS_613920] visit.  
Condition- specific safety outcomes will include: 
• ISNCSCI, GRASSP and all of the  neurological measures evaluated for efficacy  
• Spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale) [ Pandyan 1999].  A clinician administered 
examination for spasticity which measures muscle tone changes.  A score of 0 -4 is 
assigned to each muscle group evaluated ( Appendix 5).   Note s: Testing will exclude 
fingers and thumb.  Scores are to be recorded for left and right sides for each muscle group tested. 
• Pain (BPI)  [Cleeland 1994].  A self -administered questionnaire used to assess the 
severity of a subject's pain and the impact of this pain on the subject's daily functioning.  
14.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic information and medical history will be collected at Screening for determination of eligibility.  
14.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_458994] , and oral body 
temperature, will be measured after the patient has been in a sitting /recumbent  position for 5 
minutes.   
Height and weight will be captured as per the Schedule of Events.  BMI will be derived. 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020 
75 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential 14.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examination s will be conducted and abnormalities will be described.  At certain visits , 
as indicated in the Schedule of Events, only symptom-driven examinations (abbreviated physical 
examinations) will be performed .   
Clinically significant changes, in the judgment of the investigator, in physical examination findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as adverse events.  
14.1.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained on all subjects.  The electrocardiogram will preced e other 
evaluations in the sequence of operations at each timepoint as scheduled .   
The screening ECG will be evaluated by a physician for the presence of abnormalities.  Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities may not enter the study.  The timing of these evaluations may be adjusted and additional evaluation times may be added, if indicated.   
The 12- lead ECGs will be taken in triplicate.  To minimize variability, patients should be in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (resting) position for at least 5 minutes prior to each ECG recording, 5 minutes between 
each ECG . If findings from the ECG performed a t the Screening Visit (Visit 1) are clinically 
significant and would potentially prevent the subject from safely participating in the study (taking into account the patient’s overall status, as well as the medication profile), the patient should not be enr olled (or randomized ) and should be withdrawn from the study.  
Triplicate ECGs will be performed twice during the Treatment/In -Clinic  Visit (Visit 2) just prior 
to the lumbar puncture and within [ADDRESS_613921] (and, for Part 2, at each subsequent dosing time point) . Clinically significant abnormalities noted 
after investigational product administration are to be recorded as AEs.   All ECGs will be read 
locally  by [CONTACT_65384]. 
14.1.5. Laboratory Assessme nts 
The results of all laboratory tests required by [CONTACT_324124]'s eCRF .  
All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be repeated at appropriate intervals until they return either to ba seline or to a level deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_478422] [INVESTIGATOR_11305], or until a diagnosis that explains them is made.  
Abnormal laboratory test results that result in a change in study drug dosage or in 
discontinuation of the drug, or require intervention or diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the patient/subject, should be recorded as adverse events in the case report form.  Investigators 
should review the CTC AE toxicity criteria  that can be found at the following URL:

eference_8.5x11.pdf  
All laboratory assessments will be collected as per the schedule of events  (Table 5 , Table 6 ). 
The clinical laboratory tests analyzed in this study are provided in Table 12 .  The INRPTT , urine 
pregnancy testing and in -clinic safety laboratory tests requiring stat analysis will be processed 
locally .  In addition, laboratory samples taken during Study Days 1- 4 will be processed locally .  
All other laboratory tests will be analyzed by a central laboratory, .  All 
CSF, blood, and urine samples will be collected and sent to the central laboratory on the day of

study including prior to discharge from the in -patient clinic in Part 1 of the study.  During the 
course of the study, abnormal laboratory values should be repeated and subjects interviewed for 
evidence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the laboratory abnormality. Subjects 
with ab normal laboratories at screening can be rescreened (ie, lab repeated) for inclusion into the 
study within the 28- day screening window specified for labs .  A Laboratory Manual will be 
provided separately for processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585].

14.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:   
• clinically significant symptoms and signs  
• abnormal test findings 
• changes in physical examination findings 
• hypersensitivity 
• progression/worsening of underlying disease 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020 
78 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential Additionally, AEs may include the signs or symptoms resulting from: 
• drug overdose 
• drug misuse 
• drug interactions 
• exposure in utero 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures should not be reported as AEs. 
For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
14.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
• test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or 
• test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical interve ntion, 
and/or 
• test result leads to a discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or 
• test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687]. 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
14.2.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI) for this  study include possible allergic/immune 
reactions to administration of a protein therapeutic, AEs generally associated with lumbar 
puncture, and theoretical AEs arising from axon growth.  No AESI have been identified from 
non-clinical toxicology studies wi th AXER -204.  The following are considered AEs of Special 
Interest for this study: 
• Immune/Allergic  reactions:  fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, hematuria, proteinuria, 
serositis, central nervous system complications, and hemolytic anemia.  Injection site 
reactions may occur  
• Events relating to the lumbar puncture procedure: infection , postdural puncture 
headache,  bleeding, brainstem herniation, meningitis, back pain, excessive CSF 
leakage requiring blood patch  
• Complicating infections: discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis  
• Neurological symptoms or injuries: low back pain, radicular injury, abducens palsy 
• Other: late onset of epi[INVESTIGATOR_478370], increased pain, increased spasticity

79 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential 14.2.4. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (immediate risk of death)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], except 
overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478371] S ection 11.2.2 Treatment Phase, Visits 2 
through 7 (Study Days 1 through 104) whereby a decision is made to keep the patient overnight for convenience (e.g. travel issues, local alternate accommodations not readily available).  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening 
and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event may 
jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478372]. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets these 
criteria. Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit ( eg, 
from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological 
floor to a tuberc ulosis unit).   Exception: overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478371] S ection 11.2.2 
Treatment Phase, Visits 2 through 7 (Study Days 1 through 104) whereby a decision is made to keep the patient overnight for convenience (e.g. travel issues, local alternate accommodations not readily available).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• rehabilitation facilities  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief)  
• skilled nursing facilities  
• nursing homes 
• routine emergency room admissions 
• same day surgeries (as out -subject/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is not in itse lf an SAE. Examples include:  
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020 
80 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential • admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality)  
• social admission ( eg, subject has no place to sleep) 
• administrative admission ( eg, for yearly physical exam) 
• protocol-specified admission during a study ( eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_17143]) 
• optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (eg , for 
elective cosmetic surgery)  
• preplanned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
14.2.5. Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator is to record all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_478424]. 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment arm or suspected causal relationship to 
the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.  
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its designated representative. For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325542]. The investigator is required to assess causality.  For AEs with a causal relationship to the 
investigational product, follow-up by [CONTACT_455453] a level acceptable to the investigator, and the sponsor concurs with that assessment.    
In order to ascertain if headaches are secondary to the lumbar puncture per se, the clinical characteristics of the headache, including positional exacerbations will be assessed and reported.  
For Part 1, adverse events should be recorded and monitored from the time of first dose through 
subject completion of the study up to [ADDRESS_613930]-dose, or until the investigator deems the AE as resolved or stable (unchanging).  Serious AEs should be recorded and monitored from the 
time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through subject completion of the study up to 
28 days after completion of the study, or until investigator deems the SAE as resolved or stable (unchanging). 
For Part 2, adverse events should be recorded and monitored from the time of first dose up to 28 
days after completion of the study (28 days after Month 9 visit or ET ), or until the investigator 
deems the AE as resolved or stable (unchanging).  Serious AEs should be recorded and 
monitored from the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through subject 
completion of the study (28 days after Month 9 visit or ET), or until investigator deems the SAE as resolved or stable (unchanging). 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020 
81 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential [IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessment  
The investigator will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to 
determine the toxicity grade of AEs, found at the following URL:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality Assessment  
For all collected AEs, the investigator will determine each AE’s  causality based on temporal 
relationship and his/her clinical judgement.  For each AE, relatedness will be assessed with 
respect to 1) investigation al product and 2) the LP procedure.  The  degree of  certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories below and the investigator must record the causal 
relationship on the eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if applicable. 
Table 14: Relatedness Definitions (Study RNX -AX204 -101) 
Definitely related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  The clinical event, 
including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study product intake and cannot be explained 
by [CONTACT_9153].  The response 
to withdrawal of the study product (dechallenge) should be 
clinically plausible.  
Probably related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely.  The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after intake of the study product, is unlikely to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals and 
follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge).  
Possibly related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship  (eg, the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after intake of the study product).  However, other factors may have contributed to the 
event (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
events).   Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” 
soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.  
Unlikely to be related  A clinical event, includi ng an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study product makes a causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time after intake of the study product) and in which 
other drugs, or chemicals, or u nderlying diseases provide 
Protocol RNX- AX204 -101  FINAL V 4.0 October 1, 2020 
82 
ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential plausible explanations (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments).  
Not Related  The A E is completely independent of study product intake, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to an other 
etiology.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure in Utero  
An exposure in-utero occurs if: 
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the 
female becomes, or  is found to be, pregnant after being directly exposed to the 
investigational product (maternal exposure). 
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s 
pregnancy (paternal  exposure). 
If any subject becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject’s treatment with the 
investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the sponsor on an 
Exposure in Utero Form.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to the sponsor’s product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that 
she is pregnant and has been exposed to the investigational product by [CONTACT_478425][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using 
the Exposure in Utero Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitted should 
include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to induced termination 
of pregnancy). 
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero 
reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion 
or until pregnancy termination (ie, induced abortion) and then notify the sponsor of the outcome. The investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial Exposure in Utero 
Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An Exposure in Utero report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable.  Rather, a SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (ie, 
no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an Exposure in 
Utero Form can be completed).   The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be asses sed by [CONTACT_61321], unless pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
Additional information regarding the exposure in utero may be requested by [CONTACT_093]. 
Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by- case basis (eg,  follow-up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the

or collect any information. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Requirements  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Serious Adverse Reporting Requirements  
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE. If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.  
If an SAE occu rs, the sponsor is to be notified within [ADDRESS_613932] 
be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE infor mation.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Exposure in Utero cases (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigato r is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the e CRF for the study. When the 
form is completed,  will be notified electronically and will retrieve the 
form.  If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible for you to access the internet, fax a 
paper copy to .  As soon as internet service has been restored, send an email to 
 at .   Safety personnel are available for 
SAE reporting on a 24-hour bas is. Incoming reports are reviewed during normal business hours.”  
For all SAEs, the in vesti gator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator may 
be requested by [CONTACT_478426] -up information in an expedited 
fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the AE page of the e CRF.   
In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a c omplete 
medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information 
on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be 
provided. In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor or its designated representative.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the Adverse Event page(s) of the eCRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the Adverse Event eCRF.  Where the 
same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.   For example, the 
same AE term should be used on both forms.  Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information. 
A non-serious AESI will be promptly entered in the eCRF and reported on expedited basis 
(within 24 hours) to the sponsor (or designee) to facil itate real -time review of patterns of 
toxicity. Investigators are to report AESIs in accordance with the SAE reporting process noted in

15.1. Sample Size  
The Part 1 sample size was derived empi[INVESTIGATOR_478373]. 
The Part 2 sample size was selected to ensure adequate power for detecting treatment -related 
change in bilateral UEMS (Score from 0 to 50). 
A 5-point difference, between the treated and placebo groups, in the change from baseline to 6 
months in bilateral UEMS is considered clinically meaningful. Analysis of historical data for 
cervical SCI patients for the period between ~[ADDRESS_613934] deviation of bilateral UEMS change over 6 months to be around 3 to 4 points. 
With a sample size of 12 subjects per active and placebo group, Part 2 of the study has 80% 
power with Type I error of α=0.05 (two sided), assuming a 5-point difference as indicated above, and with a common standard deviation within each treatment group of approximately 4 in the change from baseline to 6 months in bilateral UEMS.  
Accounting for uncertainties in the assumptions based upon historical data used to extrapola te 
for estimating the sample size in this study and the need for estimation of missing data a sample 
size of approximately 16 subjects per treatment arm (32 total) will be randomized.    
15.2. Stages of Analysis  
The analysis for this study will be performed in t hree stages, with the first analysis performed 
upon completion of the clinical portion of Part 1, the second analysis (including the core efficacy assessment) performed upon completion Day 169 of Part 2 (ie, after all subjects have completed through Study Day 169), and the final analysis performed upon completion of the post- treatment 
follow-up phase of Part 2 (Day 253).  The methods applied to each analysis will be consistent with the objectives of the study.   
The blind will be maintained for all blinded study personnel (including investigators and 
subjects) through the completion of Day 169 of Part 2. After completion of Day 169, designated sponsor staff and external consultants/contractors required to perform the analysis will be 
unblinded to the treatment allocations in order to complete data analysis though Day 169. The 
blind will be maintained for site investigators and subjects through completion of Day [ADDRESS_613935] be broken sooner for safety or regulatory reasons. 
15.3. General Methods  
Data will be tabulated using both descriptive and inferential statistics where specified.   
• For Part 1, data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_478427] (all subjects combined), and no inferential statistics are planned. 
• For Part 2, data will be tabulated for each treatment group separately (placebo and 
AXER -204) to allow for visual inspection of outcomes between the arms.  Inferential 
comparison of the treatment groups is planned. 
For both Parts, all data collected will be included in by-domain data listings, sorted by [CONTACT_478428], or as appropriate.

ReNetX Bio, Inc.    Confidential No hypothesis testing will be performed for demographics, background, or safety data.  
Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_478397] (n), means, mean 
changes from baseline, mean % changes from baseline (where appropriate), standard deviations, minimum, First quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3) , and maximum values. The number of 
subjects with missing data will be in dicated.  
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_478397] (n), the number of subjects with missing data as well as counts and percentages in each of the categories. Percentages will be based upon the number of subjects with availabl e data.  
When inferential testing is applied to all efficacy assessments , dichotomous/binary categorical 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed via a 2 -sided Fisher’s Exact test or Chi -square test as 
appropriate.  Continuous efficacy endpoints will also present least -squares means and p -values 
from hypothesis testing of efficacy endpoints using mixed- effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM).  
Additional details will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to unblinding Part [ADDRESS_613936] will always use a conservative approach. Details will be included in the SAP.  
For subjects who discontinue treatment (for any reason), subjects will continue to be followed 
and key efficacy endpoints and safety data collected where possible. 
The primary analyses for change in bilateral UEMS will use a mixed model repeated measures 
which automatically accounts for the missing data based upon the covariate structure assumed. To evaluate robustness of results, sensitivity analyses will be performed with imputation methods for missing data
. 
15.5. Subgroups  
The sample size precludes analysis by -subgroup.  However, exploratory assessment of any trends 
among subgroups ( eg, by [CONTACT_094]- treatment AIS grade) may be performed, after initial review i f the 
data warrant.

review  source documents to confirm that the data recorded on eCRFs are accurate. The 
investigator and institution will allow the sponsor monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
The study site may be subject to review by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits 
performed by [CONTACT_456], or companies working with or on behalf of the sponsor, and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. 
It is important that the in vestigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613944] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, ICFs, and other relevant documents, eg , subject  instructions, recruitment 
advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator Site File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to the sponsor. 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary t o eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject s. In that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and the sponsor in writing immediately after the implementation.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subject s, adopted by [CONTACT_104584] (2008).

ICH GCP 
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie, clinical hold) by a n applicable 
Competent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aw are of any new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, the sponsor should be informed immediately.   
In addition, the investigator will inform the sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by [CONTACT_478431] s against any immediate hazard, and of any 
serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.  
Protocol RNX- AX204 -[ADDRESS_613945] be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's subject chart. In these 
cases, data collected on the eCRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the eCRF, or part of the eCRF, may also serve as source documents. In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at the sponsor and 
clearly identify those data that will be recorded on the eCRF, and for which the eCRF will stand as the source document. 
18.2. Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the sponsor, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg , eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], 
SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). 
The records should be retained by [CONTACT_95348], local regulations, or as specifi ed in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. 
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), the sponsor should be prospectively notified. The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the sponsor, such as another investigator, another institution, or to the sponsor.  The investigator must obtain the sponsor's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requir ements have been 
met.

carrying out this study and for no other purpose unless prior written permission from the sponsor 
or its delegate is obtained.   The sponsor has f ull ownership of the eCRFs completed as part of the 
study. 
All publications and presentations of the results of the Study are governed by [CONTACT_478432] (or its delegate) and the 
institution.   By [CONTACT_33351], the investigator agrees that the results of the study 
may be used for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and 
information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals by [CONTACT_478433].   If 
necessary, the authorities will be notified of the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The Investigator may not publish or present any information on this study without the express written approval of the sponsor or its delegate.   Additionally, the

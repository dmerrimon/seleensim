4 Protocol Amendment 2 – Summary of Major Changes 
Please note that Protocol Amendment 2 was not submitted to regulatory authorities or 
investigative sites.  
The study has been amended to reduce the number of cohorts in the study from 3 to 2, to amend the ratio of patients receiving EDP1815 or matching placebo from 3:1 to 2:1, to 
remove the secondary objectives to evaluate efficacy dose response and optimal dose of 
EDP1815, to include the option for study visits to be conducted remotely in exceptional circumstances (and where operationally possible), to clarify the addition of BMI calculation, to add IND number and change the study title. Sections 7.9 through [IP_ADDRESS] were deleted as 
information was already present in Sections 6.3 through [IP_ADDRESS].  
Administrative and minor grammatical, editorial, and formatting changes were made for 
clarification purposes only. 
The major chang es listed above have been made in addition to the edits in the following 
sections (and the corresponding text in the Protocol Synopsis).  
Changes have been marked as follows: new text as bold  and del
 eted text as strikethrough.

IND number [ADDRESS_397928] of EDP1815 in the Treatment of Mild to 
Moderate Plaque Psoriasis.  
Section 1: This Phase 2 study has been designed to investigate the clinical response to treatment with 
EDP1815 and t
o identify an optimal dose. 
Section 2.2: 
The secondary objectives of this study are the following:  
• To evaluate the efficacy dose response of EDP1815 at Week 16 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
5 • To evaluate the maximal clinical benefit of EDP1815 at Week 16  
• To evaluate the optimal dose of EDP1815 based on efficacy and safety up to Week 16 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of EDP1815 (all dose levels)  throughout the 
study 
Section 3.1: 
After eligibility is confirmed during the screening period (Section 4.1), participants will be 
randomly a
ssigned in a 1:1:1  ratio to one 1 of the following 3 2 parallel cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: 1.6 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 
2 mini tablets in capsules ( MICs ), once daily (Section  5.2).  
• Cohort 2: 4.8 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 6 MICs, 
once daily (Section  5.2).  
• Cohort 3: 8.0 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 10 MICs, 
once daily (S ection  5.2). 
In each cohort, approximately 60 69 participants will be randomly assigned in a 32:1 ratio to 
receive either EDP1815 or matching placebo once daily for 16 weeks. 
The study design figure (Figure 3.1) was updated accordingly to remove Cohort 3. Section 3.1.1:
 
The doses tested in the program are based on predictions from the preclinical data and the 
clinic
al and biomarker data obtained in EDP1815-101, the Phase 1 study. All doses tested up 
to 8.0 × [ADDRESS_397929] been equally well tolerated. No clear difference in efficacy was 
observed between the 1.6 × 1011 cells and the 8.0 × 1011 cells in EDP1815-101 over the 
28-day dosing period, but at the 14-day follow up (Day 42) the participants receiving the higher dose had a continued improvement in their psoriasis compared to participants who had received the lower dose. This suggests a more sustained and potentially deeper response in 
the high dose group. Evelo is therefore proposing to include the highest feasible dose (based 
on capsule load) in this study to establish the maximum clinical benefit and to assess 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
6 participant acceptability of the doses tested. The dose response relationships found in this 
study are expected to enable the selection of appropriate dosing for future studies. This 
suggests additional efficacy could be obtained at doses above the dose of 1.6 × 1011 cells. 
Therefore, 4.8 × 1011 cells will be tested as well as 1.6 × 1011 cells in this study.  
Section 4.1: 
Approximately 180 138 participan ts wil l be enrolled (randomly assigned to treatment) in 
multiple countries, including (but not limited to) sites in the [LOCATION_002], the United 
Kingdom, and Poland. 
Section 4.2.4: 
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study within [ADDRESS_397930] 4 weeks 
of postbaseline data.  
Section 5.1: 
Participants will be randomly assigned at the baseline visit (Visit 2) to 1 of 3 2 cohort s (in a 
1:1:1  allocati on ratio) that are distinguishable to participants and study staff by [CONTACT_322416]- daily dose. Within each the cohort, participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 3 2:1 allocation ratio to receive either EDP1815 or matching placebo 
treatment (Section  3.1). Interactive response technology (IRT) will be used to administer the 
randomiz
ation schedule. 
Section 6: The SoA is presented in Table 6 1. Detailed instructions for study site activities will be 
provided in the study manual. High level descriptions of the study assessments are presented in the subsections of Section 6. In exceptional circumstances, study assessments may  be 
conducted remotely (ie, at a participant’s home), except for baseline, Visit  9, and 
Visit  10. Remote visits can only occur if operationally possible.  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
7 Section 6.2.3: 
A complete physical examination will be conducted, including assessments of the skin and 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI, and neurological systems. Height (at screening only) and weight will also be measured and recorded (without shoes, street clothing). Body mass index will be calculated from the height and weight.  Investigators should pay special attention to 
clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
The SoA (Table 6 -1) was also updated to include a footnote clarifying the BMI calculation.  
Section 6.4.2: 
Systemic exposure following oral EDP1815 dosing is estimated to be very low based on lack 
of detection in blood (<0.01% of administered dose). However, plasma samples will be taken 
from all participants for the estimate of systemic EDP1815 levels by [CONTACT_322417] -specific 
primers that can detect EDP1815 specifically, even when other strains of Prevotella histicola  
are present. Any effects of EDP1815 on the gut microbiome will be investigated using 16S 
ribosomal RNA sequencing, which measures both the pres ence and quantity of microbes at 
the genus level. Sampling will be performed as specified in the SoA (Table 6 -1, blood 
sample for systemic levels of microbes) .  
Section 7.2: 
As a further supplementary analysis, a dose response model will be fitted using Ba yesian 
techniques as fully described in Section 7.8.1. This model will be fitted for the primary 
endpoint of percentage change from baseline at Week 16. Data collected after discontinuation 
of treatment will be considered missing and imputed using an LOCF approach in order to 
include all participants who had at least one evaluable on treatment percentage change from 
baseline in PASI score available. A sensitivity analysis, including only participants who have 
evaluable percentage change from baseline in PASI score at Week [ADDRESS_397931] efficacy or including all data collected during 
the study regardless of treatment discontinuation.

8 Section 7.5: 
The sample size of 180 138 participants in total, has been chosen to explore the tolerability 
and safety of EDP1815. “…” 
Participants in the placebo arm of each cohort will be pooled for the statistical analysis in 
order to c
ompare active and control arms resulting in 45 46 participants will be randomized 
to each treatment group (pooled placebo, EDP1815 1.6 × 1011 cells, and  EDP1815 4.8 × 1011 
cells, and EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells ). Assuming that no more than 15% of participants will 
discontinue treatment before the Week [ADDRESS_397932] more than 90% powe
r to detect a difference between the treatment groups at the 5% significance 
level under the assumption that pooling the placebo groups is a valid strategy . If the 
[ADDRESS_397933] a difference in each pairwise comparison between active and placebo doses within a cohort falls to approximately 70 80%.  
Section 7.7: 
If the placebo groups from the 3 2 cohorts are found to be too heterogeneous to be pooled 
(Section  7.8.1), the primary and secondary analyses will be performed using within-cohort 
comparisons of active and placebo treatments, and summary tables may also be produced by [CONTACT_9084]. 
Section 7.8.1: 
The assumption that the 3 2 cohorts of placebo participants can be pooled into a single 
placebo group to be used as a control for all active doses will be examined using mean ( ±SD) 
plots of percent change in PASI score against time. A decision will be made by [CONTACT_322418]. 
The primary analysis will be performed using an MMRM. The model will include parameters 
for tr
eatment*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. Body mass index, gender, and 
other baseline covariates wil l also be considered and included as parameters if found to be 
significant (p<0.05). The model will not include an intercept. Visit will consist of 6 levels 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
9 (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16) and treatment will consist of 4 3 levels (pooled placebo, 
EDP1815 1.6 x 1011 cells,  and EDP1815 4.8 x 1011 cells  and EDP1815 8.0 x) if the placebo 
pooling strategy is considered appropriate or 6 4 levels (Placebo matching  1.6 x 1011 cells , 
Placebo matching  4.8 x 1011 cells , EDP1815 1.6 x 1011 cells , and EDP1815 4.8 x 1011 cells 
and EDP1815 8.0x) if the placebo pooling strategy is not considered appropriate. “…” 
If the assumption of similarity between the 3 2 placebo cohorts is considered appropriate, the 
placebo cohorts will be pooled, and a single placebo control group will be used for the 
pairwise differences for each active dose to placebo. “…”  
If the assumption of similarity between the placebo cohorts is supported, a supplementary 
analysis will be performed on the percent change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_397934] fitting model (lowest 
DIC) selected for use in the outputs.  
The dose response model will be fitted to the data using Bayesian techniques with 
non informative priors for E0 and Emax and an FUP for ED50 (3  and 4 parameter models 
only) and the slope parameter m (4 parameter model only). The rationale for this choice of 
inference is that the FUP shrinks the dose response towards a flat line throughout the dose 
range, therefore providing more conservative estimates of the dose response relationship 
compared to maximum likelihood (Bornkamp 2014). The models will be fully described in 
the SAP.  
Based on the selected mod el, the posterior mean with associated 95% HDP CrI, for the 
difference from placebo for each active dose will be produced for the pairwise differences 
between each active dose and placebo, together with the posterior mean and 95% HDP CrI of 
the treatment d ifference from placebo for each active dose and posterior probabilities that 
difference from placebo is less than 0, 20%, 30% and 50%. 
Section 7.8.2: 
All secondary analyses will be performed either using the pooled placebo group if the 
assumpt
ion of similarity for the placebo cohorts is considered appropriate or using the 3 
2 cohort-level placebo groups if it is not considered appropriate.

11 • Blood or plasma analytes: urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, ALT, AST, total and 
direct bilirubin, CRP, creatine kinase, fasting glucose, fasting lipid panel (total 
cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides) 
• Hematologic analyses: full blood count, including hemoglobin, MCV , MCH, MCHC, 
hematocrit, percent reticulocytes, platelet count; differential white blood cell count 
including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils 
• Urinalysis by [CONTACT_81795]: protein, blood, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, pH, nitrites, and 
specific gravity  
Other screening tests include the following:  
• Serology (HIV antibody, HBsAg, and HCV antibody) 
• Serum pregnancy test (HCG) at screening, urine test thereafter  
Blood samples for assessment of fasting blood glucose and lipid panel will be obtai ned after 
the participant has fasted for at least 8 hours.  
A central laboratory (or specialized central laboratories) will be used for all laboratory 
analyses. Details of sample collection and handling procedures will be provided in the study 
manual.  
The investigator must review the laboratory reports, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study. If the laboratory reports are not 
transferred electronically, the values must be filed with the source information (including 
reference ranges). In most cases, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those 
that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_163582]'s con dition. 
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_397935] dose of study drug should be 
repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_10982]. If such values do not return to 
normal/baseline within a time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be 
identified, and the sponsor notified. 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_397936] be conducted in 
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table  6 1). If laboratory va lues fro m 
nonprotocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory 
require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
Section 7.10.1: 
The planned maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of 
the study is less than 130 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety 
reasons or for technical issues with the samples. The planned maximum amount of blood 
collected from each participant at a single visit is less than 46mL, and the planned maximum 
amount of blood collected from each participant over 30 days is less than 58 mL.  
Section 7.10.2: 
Systemic exposure following oral EDP1815 dosing is estimated to be very low based on lack 
of detection in blood (<0.01% of administered dose). However, plasma samples will be taken 
from all participants for the estimate of systemic EDP1815 levels by [CONTACT_322419]18 15 specific primers. Sampling will be performed as specified in the SoA ( Table  6 1, 
blood sample for systemic levels of microbes).  
Systemic exposure of EDP1815 will be measured using specific PCR with strain specific 
primers which can detect EDP1815 specifically even when other strains of Prevotella 
histicola  are present. Any effects of EDP1815 on the gut microbiome will be investigat ed 
using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, which measures both the presence and quantity of 
microbes at the genus level.  
Section 7.10.3: Procedures for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be detailed in the 
study manual. Biomarkers are exploratory endpoints and analytical results for biomarkers 
will not be included in the CSR. They will be reported separately from the CSR.  
Digital photographs should be taken of up to [ADDRESS_397937] a lesion area 
≥2 cm × 2 cm at baseline. The sam e locations photographed at baseline should be followed

provided in the study manual.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]: 
Standard histology will be performed on skin plaque biopsies (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_207891], 
basal mitotic counts and immune cell infiltrates, immunohistochemistry) from approximately 
15 participants in each cohort. Details will be provided in the study manual. The histologic 
evaluations are exploratory and are outside the scope of the CSR.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]: An mRNA transcription analysis will be performed on the skin plaque biopsies.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]: Blood samples will be stimulated ex vivo and analyzed for levels of cytokines and 
chemokines, including IL 1 beta, IL 2, IL 4, IL 6, IL 8, IL 10, IL 12p40, IL 17A, TNF α, and 
IFNγ. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]: The microbiome composition of stool samples will be assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA 
sequencing, which looks at the diversity and abundance of microbes in the colonic 
microbiome (Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012). EDP1815 is not expected to 
alter the composition of the microbiome, but it is being evaluated as a safety biomarker.

Dose -Ranging Study Investigating the Effect of EDP1815 in the Treatment of Mild to 
Moderate Plaque Psoriasis.  
Section 1: 
Evelo  Biosciences Inc. (Evelo) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_322377] m onoclonal single strains 
of bacteria as a new class of therapeutic agents known as monoclonal microbials. 
Monoclonal microbials. These therapeutic agents  are human commensal organisms that 
offer the potential of systemic immune system modulation following oral administration, 
without systemic exposure. “…” 
Several studies (de Groot et al 2017; Hindson et al 2017; Yan et al 2017; Felix et al 2018) 
suggest
 that host- microbe interactions in the gut, and particularly in the small intestine, can 
influence systemic inflammation. Evelo is seeking to develop oral anti- inflammatory 
medicines based on this emerging science. Preclinical data confirms that individual s trains of 
microbes exhibit unique pharmacological profiles. This is thought to be based on multiple distinct microbial structural pattern motifs interacting with varying combinations of host pattern recognition receptors in small intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] .  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
15 Studies of EDP1815 in vitro in a range of human and mouse assays and studies in vivo in 
model symptoms support the use of EDP1815 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
including psoriasis (Evelo Biosciences 2019). EDP1815 increases secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL -1RA, and IL-27 from human immune cells, 
while inducing minimal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 6, TNF α, and 
IFNγ. 
Oral administration of EDP1815 to mice results in striking pharmacodynamic effects on anima
l models of delayed-type hypersensitivity, fluorescein isothiocyanate cutaneous 
hypersensitivity, collagen- induced arthritis (Marietta et al 2016) and experimental acute 
encephalomyelitis (Mangalam et al 2017). The high degree of consistency of both effect and dose suggests the potential for clinical benefit across multiple type 1, type 2, and type [ADDRESS_397939] the immune response in peripheral tissues. 
Psoriasis is a chronic immune -mediat
 ed type 1/3 inflammatory skin disease in which 
hyperactive T  cells trigger excessive k eratinocyte proliferation. “…” 
This Phase 2 study has been designed to investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of  
resp

After eligibility is confirmed during the screening period (Section 4.1), participants will be 
randoml
y assigned in a 1:1:1  ratio to 1 of the following 3 2 parallel cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: 0.81.6 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 1 PIC  
2 MICs , once daily (Section 5.2).  
• Cohort 2: 3.24.8 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 
4 PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378] 6 MICs , once daily (Section 5.2).  
• Cohort 3: 8.0 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 
10 PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378], once daily (Section 5.2). 
In each cohort, approximately 7569 participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive either EDP1815 or matching placebo once daily for 16 weeks. 
The study design figure (Figure 3.1) was updated accordingly to add Cohort 3. 
Secti
on 3.1.1: 
The doses tested in the program are based on predictions from the preclinical data and the 
cli
nical and biomarker data obtained in EDP1815-101, the Phase 1 study. All doses tested up 
to 8.0 × [ADDRESS_397940] been equally well tolerated. No clear difference in  efficacy was 
observed between the 1.6 × 1011 cells and the 8.0 × 1011 cells in EDP1815-101 over the 
28-day dosing period, but at the 14-day follow up (Day 42) the participants receiving the 
higher dose had a continued improvement in their psoriasis compared to participants who had 
received the lower dose. This suggests a more sustained and potentially deeper response in the high dose group. Evelo is therefore proposing to include the lowest and highest feasible doses (based on capsule load) in this study to establish the dose response, the 
maximum clinical benefit, and to assess participant tolerability and  acceptability of the 
doses tested. additional efficacy could be obtained at doses above the dose of 1.6 × 10

cells. Therefore, 4.8 × 1011 cells will b e tested as well as 1.6 × 1011 cells in this study.

Section  7.1: 
The pri
mary estimand will be the effect of EDP1815 on the percent change in PASI score 
from baselin e to Week 16 in the mITT set of all treated participants, regardless of deviations 
from the protocol. Only data collected while on treatment will be used to account for the 
intercurrent event of treatment discontinuation (hypothetical strategy based on adherence to 
treatment only). The posterior mean difference between each active dose and the pooled 
placebo group will be estimated. 
For the primary analysis, 2 supportive estimands will also be considered: 
• To assess the impact of intercurrent events related to protocol deviations believed to 
impact efficacy, a supportive analysis will be performed where all data collected after 
any such identified protocol deviations will be excluded. Participants who had a 
protocol deviation believed to impact efficacy prior to the first dose of treatment 
(hypothetical strategy based on adherence to treatment and the aspects of the protocol 
which impact efficacy) will be completely excluded from this analysis.  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation, a supportive analysis will be 
performed in which all data collected during the study, including any data collected 
after treatment discontinuation will be included (treatment policy strategy).

Section 7.5 (previously Section 7.7): If the placebo groups from the 32 cohorts are found to be too heterogeneous to be pooled

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_397950] time. A decision will be made by [CONTACT_322418]. 
The primary analysis will be performed using an Bayesi an MMRM. The model will include 
parameters for treatment*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. Body mass index, 
gender, and other baseline covar iates will also be considered and included as parameters if 
found to be significant (p<0.05). The model will not include an intercept. Visit will consist of 6 levels (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16) and treatment will consist of 43 levels (pooled placebo, 
EDP1815 0.81.6 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells,  and EDP1815 8.04.8 × 1011 cells) if 
the placebo pooling strategy is considered appropriate or 64 levels (Placebo matching

appropriate. “…”  
If the assumption of similarity between the 32 placebo cohorts is considered appropriate, the 
placebo cohorts will be pooled, and a single placebo control group will be used for the pairwise differences for each active dose to placebo. If the assumption of similarity is 
considered inappropriate, each placebo dose will be included in the model as a separate dose 
level and pairwise comparisons between each active dose and placebo will be performed using only the matching placebo dose data for the relevant active dose.

the analysis, alternative statistical methods will be considered, appropriate to the type 
of violation observed. “…” 
A further sensitivity analysis will be performed on the model with the primary 
estimand, in which participants who withdrew from study drug due to treatment failure 
(demonstrated by [CONTACT_322421], biological, or intermediate 
or high-potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_322389]) will have their percentage change from PASI imp uted at all visits after study drug was discontinued as the maximum 
on-treatment value reached (ie, worst score carried forward) . 
If the assumption of similarity between the placebo cohorts is supported, a supplementary analysis will be performed on the pe rcent change from baseline to 
Week  [ADDRESS_397952] fitting model (lowest DIC) selected for use in the outputs.  
The dose -response model will be fitted to the data using Bayesian techniques with 
noninformative priors for E 0 and E max and an FUP for ED50 (3- and 4 -parameter 
models only) and the slope parameter m (4 -parameter model only). The rationale for 
this c hoice of inference is that the FUP shrinks the dose response towards a flat line 
throughout the dose range, therefore providing more conservative estimates of the dose-response relationship compared to maximum likelihood (Bornkamp 2014). The 
models will be  fully described in the SAP.  
Based on the selected model, the posterior mean with associated 95% HDP CrI, for the 
difference from placebo for each active dose will be produced for the pairwise differences between each active dose and placebo, together with  the posterior mean and 
95% HDP CrI of the treatment difference from placebo for each active dose and posterior probabilities that difference from placebo is less than 0, - 20%, - 30%, 
and - 50%. A further sensitivity analysis will be performed on the dose re sponse model, 
in which participants who withdrew from study drug due to treatment will have their 
Week 16 percentage change from PASI imputed as 100% after study drug was 
discontinued.

For the PASI-50, a Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects model with a logit link function 
will be fitted using data from all visits. Treatment*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions will be included in the model as fixed effects. Body mass index, gender, and other baseline covariates will also be considered and fitted as fixed effects if found to be

A sensitivity analysis for the PASI-50 will also be performed, in the same manner as 
described above, in which participants who withdraw from study drug before Week 16 
due to treatment failure will be included in the model with the PASI -50 endpoint 
imputed as ‘not achieved’ at all visits after study drug withdrawal.

study is expected to report out before the end of 2020, this interim analysis may not be 
performed.  “...” 
The interim analysis will look at the primary endpoint of percentage change from baseline in PASI score, secondary, and safety endpoints. The posterior predictive probability (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_279839] 2004) of the percent change from baseline in PASI score being at least 20% lower in each active dose compared to the pooled placebo group will also be calculated, 
using the estimates of treatment difference found at Week 12 using the Bayesian MMRM model described for the primar y analysis. If the posterior predictive probabilities for all 
active doses are found to be <30%, then the study may be stopped for futility.

Section [IP_ADDRESS]   Histologic Assessment  
A 4 mm punch biopsy will be taken by [CONTACT_322427] (see Section 
6.1.10).  Standard histology will be performed on skin plaque biopsies (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_322395], basal mitotic counts and immune cell infiltrate s, immunohistochemistry) from 
approximately [ADDRESS_397983] paragraph: The primary analysis for the study will occur after all participants have completed [ADDRESS_397984] dose of study medication (end of Part A). The final 
analysis for the study will oc cur when all participants have completed the required 
relapse and rebound follow -up period of up to [ADDRESS_397985] -treatment (end of Part B).  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_397986] paragraph: For the primary analysis, 3 2 supportive estimands will also be considered: 
• To assess the impact of intercurrent events related to protocol deviations believed to 
impact efficacy, a supportive analysis will be performed where all data collected after any such identified protocol deviations will be excluded. Participants who had a 
protocol deviation believed to impact efficacy prior to the first dose of treatment (hypothetical strategy based on adherence to treatment and the aspects of the protocol 
which impact efficacy) will be completely excluded from this analysis.  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation for any reason , a suppor
 tive 
analysis will be performed in which all data collected during up to  the studyend of 
Week 16 , including any data collected after treatment discontinuation wil l be 
included (treatment policy strategy).  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation due to a requirement for alt
ernative therapy, a supportive analysis will be performed where the highest 
PASI score recorded prior to treatment discontinuation wil l be applied to all 
expected visits after treatment discontinuation up to Week 16.  
The primary analysis will be performed using a Bayesian MMRM as fully described in 
Section  7.6.1. Data from visits prior to Week [ADDRESS_397987] on efficacy.

Section 7.5    Description of Subgroups to be Analyzed No subgroup analyses are planned, but R esults
  may be summarized by [CONTACT_322429].  
Subgroup analysis of the primary estimand will be performed based on the following 
subgroups:  
• Baseline PASI score (<10, ≥10)  
• Baseline PGA score (2, 3)  
• Baseline BMI (<30kg/m2, ≥30kg/m2) 
 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_397992] paragraphs: 
The assumption that the 3 cohorts of placebo participants can be pooled into a single placebo 
group to be used as a control for all active doses will be examined using mean (±SD) plots and box plots  of per cent change in PASI score against time. In addition, a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to compare the 3 cohorts of placebo participants. The model will include parameters for cohort, visit and baseline PASI score together with cohort* visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. LS mean 
(95% CI) estimates for each placebo cohort will be plotted by [CONTACT_765].  
A decision will be made by [CONTACT_322430] , based on examination of the above 
figures and model, on whether the pooling strategy is appropriate.  
The primary analysis will be performed using a Bayesian MMRM. The model will include 
parame
ters for treatment*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. Body mass index, 
gender, country,  and time since diagnosis other baseline covariates  will also be considered 
and included as parameters if found to be significant (p<0.05) . The model will not include an 
intercept. Visit will consist of 6 levels (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16) and treatment will 
consist of 4 levels (pooled placebo, EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, and 
EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells) if the placebo pooling strategy is considered appropriate or 
6 levels (Placebo matching EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, Placebo matching EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 
cells, Placebo matching EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 
3.2 × 1011 cells, and EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells) if the placebo pooling strategy is not 
considered appropriate.  
Five paragraphs without changes 
This primary analysis will be repeated using the 2 3 supporti ve estimands defined in 
Section  7.1.1. 
Deleted the following paragraph: A further sensitivity analysis will be performed on the model with the primary estimand, in 
which participants who withdrew from study drug due to treatment failure  (demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_322421], biological, or intermediate or high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_322396].  EDP1815

visits after study drug was discontinued as the maximum on treatment value reached (ie, 
worst score carried forward) . 
Added as last paragraph: 
All summaries and analyses defined above for the primary estimand will be repeated 
using the subgroups defined in Section 7.5. 
 Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_397993] sentence: 
All p-values, posterior probabilities , CI, and CrI calculated will be considered as descriptive 
with no further adjustments for multiplicity performed.  
Added third paragraph: 
The covariates selected for the Bayesian MMRM analysis for the primary estimand will 
also be used in all other analytical models including covariates. 
Two paragraphs without changes From fifth paragraph to end of this section: 
For the PASI-50, a Bayesian generalized linear mi xed effe
 cts model with a logit link function 
will be fitted using data from all visits.  Treatment, visit, and baseline PASI score terms 
will be included in the model as fixed effects, together with treatment*visit and baseline 
PASI  score*visit interactions , will be included in the model as fixed effects. Body mass 
index, gender, and other any baseline covariates selected in the primary analysis model for 
the primary estimand. will also be considered and fitted as fixed effects if found to be 
significant (p<0.05) . Odds ratios and 95% HDP CrI CIs for each active dose compared to 
placebo at each visit will be presented.  
A sensitivity supportive  analysi s for the PASI-50 will also be performed, in the same manner 
as described above, in which participants who withdraw from study drug before Week 16 due 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
60 to treatment failure requirement for alternative therapy  will be included in the model with 
the PASI -50 endpoint imputed as ‘not achieved’ at all expected  visits after study drug 
withdrawal.  
A sensitivity analysis wil l als o be performed on the PASI -50. Bayesian logistic regression 
models will be individually fitted at each of Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. The model will 
include parameters for treatment and baseline PASI score together with any baseline 
covariates selected in  the primary analysis model for the primary estimand. The 
posterior odds-ratios for each pairwise comparison of an active EDP1815 dose and placebo with associated 95% HDP CrI will be presented together with the posterior 
probability that the true odds rati o >1. 
Percentage of participants achieving PGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement and 
percentage of participants achieving a PGA of [ADDRESS_397994] ratios and 95% HDP CrI for 
each active dose compared to placebo will be presented . The expectation -maximization 
iterative complex minorant (EMICM) method for iterative computation of the 
nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for the survival function (Wellner and 
Zahn 1997) will be used. The number and proportion of participants who meet the 
PASI -[ADDRESS_397995] will 
be used to compare each active dose with placebo and the p- value for treatment 
difference will also be presented. The estimated survival curves for each treatment 
group will also be p resented.  
Cumulative incidence of partial relapse and complete relapse at Weeks 20, 24, 28, and 
40 will b
e summarized  by [CONTACT_322431] 12 responders set.  
Cumulative incidence of rebound after cessation of study treatment at Weeks 20, 24, 28, 
and 40 will be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570].

Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Parallel-Cohort, Dose-Ranging Study 
Investigating the Effect of EDP1815 in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Plaque Psoriasis  
Sponsor:  Evelo Biosciences Inc.  
[ADDRESS_398006] Cambridge, MA [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003] 
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
Study Sites:  Multiple countries, including (but not limited to) sites in the United 
States, the [LOCATION_008], Poland, and Hungary.  
Indication:  Treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis  
Rationale: Evelo  Biosciences Inc. (Evelo) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_322399] a new class of therapeutic agents. These therapeutic agents are human commensal organisms that offer the potential of systemic immune system modulation following oral administration, without systemic exposure. EDP1815 is a pharmaceutical preparation of a strain of Prevotella histicola  isolated 
from a human duodenal biopsy: it has not been genetically modified.  
Studies of EDP1815 in vitro in a range of human and mouse a ssays 
and studies in vivo in model symptoms support the use of EDP1815 
in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including psoriasis.  
Oral administration of EDP1815 to mice results in striking pharmacodynamic effects on animal models of delayed-type hypersensitivity, fluorescein isothiocyanate cutaneous hypersensitivity, collagen- induced arthritis and experimental acute 
encephalomyelitis. The high degree of consistency of both effect and dose suggests the potential for clinical benefit across multiple type  1, 
type 2, and type [ADDRESS_398007] 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_398008] the 
immune response in peripheral tissues. 
Psoriasis is a chronic immune -mediated type 1/[ADDRESS_398009] validated the role of anti -TNF α, anti-IL-17, and anti- IL-23 therapy 
in moderate to severe psoriasis. For patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, therapy usually involves topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450] (topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], vitamin D3 analogs), with topi[INVESTIGATOR_322400] a wide range of formulations. More recently, physicians are prescribing apremilast, a first-in-class oral PDE4 inhibitor, ahead of biological therapy, which 
includes etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab. 
In Evelo study EDP1815-101, a total of [ADDRESS_398010] 
participated in Cohorts 1-4, with 36 of these participants receiving EDP1815 once daily; 16 of these were treated for 14 days (healthy volunteers) and [ADDRESS_398011] and tofacitinib at the same time point, ha ve been observed on the (psoriatic) LSS and 
PASI at Day  28. Furthermore, at the Day 42 follow-up visit, when 
participants were “off treatment” for [ADDRESS_398012]. The safety profile of EDP1815 was similar to placebo, with no SAEs or AEs of severe intensity.  
The evidence available so far su ggests EDP1815 is very well 
tolerated and it continues to undergo clinical development in mild to 
moderate psoriasis. A well-tolerated oral therapy could offer significant benefit in the treatment of psoriasis and it is presently anticipated that EDP1815 would be used in established but early disease, before the use of biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
This Phase 2 study has been designed to investigate the clinical 
safety and efficacy of EDP1815 and to identify an optimal dose.

 Page 70 Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of 3 different doses of EDP1815 for the treatment of psoriasis following daily dosing for 16 weeks.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are the following: 
• To evaluate the efficacy dose response of EDP1815 at Week  16 
• To evaluate the maximal clinical benefit of EDP1815 at 
Week 16  
• To evaluate the optimal dose of EDP1815 based on efficacy 
and safety up to Week 16 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of EDP1815 (all dose levels) throughout the study 
• To evaluate relapse and rebound of plaque psoriasis after cessation of EDP1815  
Exploratory Objectives:  
The exploratory objectives of this study are the following: 
• To evaluate the time to onset of clinical res ponse to 
EDP1815  
• To evaluate the effect of EDP1815 treatment on patient -reported outcomes including quality of life and pain 
• To evaluate the duration of remission, treatment success, and therapeutic effect of EDP1815  
• To evaluate the effect of EDP1815 treatment on biomarkers in blood 
• To evaluate the effect of EDP1815 treatment on biomarkers in skin plaques 
• To evaluate the effect of EDP1815 treatment on fecal microbiome composition  
Estimands:  Primary Estimands  
The primary estimand  will be the effect of EDP1815 on the percent 
change in PASI score from baseline to Week 16 in the mITT set of all treated participants, regardless of deviations from the protocol. Only data collected while on treatment will be used to account for the inte rcurrent event of treatment discontinuation (hypothetical 
strategy based on adherence to treatment only). The posterior mean difference between each active dose and the pooled placebo will be estimated.  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 71 For the primary analysis, 3 supportive estimands will  also be 
considered: 
• To assess the impact of intercurrent events related to protocol 
deviations believed to impact efficacy, a supportive analysis will be performed where all data collected after any such identified protocol deviations will be excluded. Pa rticipants 
who had a protocol deviation believed to impact efficacy prior to the first dose of treatment (hypothetical strategy based on adherence to treatment and the aspects of the protocol which impact efficacy) will be completely excluded from this ana lysis.  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation for any reason, a supportive analysis will be performed in which all data collected up to the end of Week 16, including any data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included (treatment policy strategy). 
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation due to a requirement for alternative therapy, a supportive analysis will be performed where the highest PASI score recorded prior to treatment discontinuation will be applied to all expected visits after treatment discontinuation up to Week 16. 
 
The primary analysis will be performed using a Bayesian MMRM.

for inclusion or could interfere with the participant participating in or completing the study. 
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -cohort, dose-ranging study of participants with mild to 
moderate plaque psoriasis.  
Part A of the study comprises a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a baseline visit, a treatment period o f 16 weeks (8 planned study site 
visits), and a follow- up visit at Week 20 (4 weeks after cessation of 
dosing). Part A of the study therefore comprises a total of [ADDRESS_398026] previously experie nced treatment failure 
and/or had rebound of disease. A final visit at Week [ADDRESS_398027] not yet met the definition of disease relapse. Part  B of the s tudy therefore comprises a 
maximum of 3 additional scheduled study visits with a follow-up of up to 40 weeks (24 weeks after cessation of dosing), and on completion of Part B, the final analysis will be performed.  
The study design is presented in Figure 3-1, and the SoA is presented in  Table 6 -1 for Part A, and in  Table 6 -2 for Part B.  
After eligibility is confirmed during the screening period, participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 3 parallel cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: 0.8 × 10
11 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo 
administered as 1  PIC, once daily.  
• Cohort 2: 3.2 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo 
administered as 4  PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378], once daily.  
• Cohort 3: 8.0 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo 
administered as 10 PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378], once daily. 
In each cohort, approximately 75 participants will be randomly assign ed in a 2:[ADDRESS_398028] 50% of 
participants have completed at least 12 weeks of treatment.

initial follow -up visit at Week  20 (ie, [ADDRESS_398030] dose of study 
treatment), completing Part A of the study; and enter Part B with 
continued follow-up for a maximum of 20 additional weeks (up to Week  40). The duration of follow up will depend on the initial 
response to study therapy and any relapse or rebound experienced after cessation of study treatment.  
Estimated Study Duration: The maximum planned duration of study participation will be [ADDRESS_398031] completed the study after the 
completion of all required visits.  
Efficacy 
Assessments:  The efficacy assessments will include the PASI score, the LSS, the National Psoriasis Foundation Psoriasis Score version of a static PGA, the percent of BSA involvement, the mNAPSI, the DLQI, the PSI, the SF-36 Bodily Pain Scale, the V AS Pain assessment, the vitality subscale of the SF -36 (to assess fatigue), and a fatigue V AS. 
Pharmacokinetic or 
Pharmacodynamic Assessments:  Pharmacokinetic assessments will be limited to a predose blood sample at baseline and another sample at the Week 16 visi t (end of 
treatment).  
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments are exploratory endpoints and analytical results for biomarkers will not be included in the CSR. They will be reported separately from the CSR. 
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments inclu de digital 
photography of up to [ADDRESS_398032] histologic assessments 
of skin plaque biopsies, mRNA transcription analysis of skin plaque biopsies, blood cytokine and chemokine analyses, and microbiome composition of the fecal microbiome. 
Safety  and 
Tolerability Assessments:  Safety and tolerability assessments include monitoring AEs 
(including SAEs), monitoring concomitant medications, BSFS categorization (recorded in a stool diary), physical examinations, vital sign measurements, and ECGs. 
Deta ils of Applicable 
Monitoring 
Committee:  There will be no safety review committee or data monitoring committee.  
Study drug, Dosage, and Route of Administration: The study drug will be capsules containing EDP1815 or matching capsules containing placebo.  
There will be 3 dosing cohorts, with dosages of 1 capsule, 
4 capsules, or 10  capsules; capsules of EDP1815 each contain

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 79 8.0 × 1010 cells of EDP1815, while placebo capsules contain no 
bacteria.  
Participants will self -administer their doses of study drug orally in 
the morning with water.  
Sample Size:  The sample size of 225 participants in total, has been chosen to 
explore the tolerability and safety of EDP1815. Although the study 
will use a model-based probability inference approach in a Bayesian framework, the following power calculation was also performed (using a basic frequentist approach) in order to give confidence that enough participants are available to find a clinically meaningful difference between active dose and placebo if the below assumptions are met.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the PASI score at Week 16. Percent change from baseline relative to placebo will be estimated within the model as (percent change in active) - (percent change in placebo), with a negative value 
indicating a greater improvement for active than placebo. A percent change from baseline relative to placebo of at least 20% will be considered cl inically meaningful. The pooled standard deviation 
across all doses is assumed to be 25%. 
Participants in the placebo arm of each cohort will be pooled for the 
statistical analysis in order to compare active and control arms resulting in 75 participants randomized to the pooled placebo group and 50 participants randomized to each active treatment group (EDP1815 0.8 × 10
11 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, and EDP1815 
8.0 × 1011 cells). Assuming that no more than 15% of participants 
will discontinue treatment before the Week [ADDRESS_398033] more than 95% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups at the 5% significance level under the assumption that pooling the placebo groups is a valid strategy. If the [ADDRESS_398034] a difference in each within -cohort pairwise comparison 
between active and placebo doses would be greater than 80%. 
As the statistical inference for this study will focus on estimation 
rather than testing a formal hypothes is, no multiplicity adjustments 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 80 of the different comparisons between groups in order to control the 
study- wise type I error rate will be performed.  
Similarly, as there is no intention to use any interim analyses to stop 
the study early for efficacy, no adjustments for multiplicity will be 
made to account for any analyses performed as part of the interim analyses.  
Statistical Methods:  Analysis methods for key endpoints are briefly described below. Further details on all analyses will be described in the SAP. 
No formal hypothesis will be tested. A model-based probability 
inference approach in a Bayesian framework will be used to guide decision -making around dose selection. Posterior estimates and 95% 
credible intervals (CrI) for the difference  between each active dose 
and placebo will be produced for relevant primary and secondary endpoints. 
Unless otherwise specified, missing data will be considered as 
missing at random and will be accounted for using mixed models for repeated measures, with all time points collected for the relevant endpoint included in the model. This includes data which is excluded due to collection after treatment discontinuation or after a protocol deviation as applicable to the definition of the estimands used in the analysis. 
The primary analysis for the study will occur after all participants have completed [ADDRESS_398035] dose of study medication (end of Part A). The final analysis for the study will occur when all participants have completed the required relapse and rebound follow-up period of up to [ADDRESS_398036]- treatment (end of 
Part B).  
Analysis Sets:  
The mITT set will consist of all participants who were randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study treatment.  
The PPS will consist of all mITT participants who were not replaced 
(following study withdrawal before the end of Week 4) and who do not have a protocol deviation that may impact efficacy with a start date for the deviation before initiation of study t reatment.  
The safety set will consist of all participants who received any study drug. 
The mITT set will be the primary population of interest for the 
efficacy section, with some supportive analyses performed using the PPS. The safety set will be used for all safety summaries.

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 81 Statistical Analysis Methodology:  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS software 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_398037] deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value. C ategorical variables will be summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages. Time- to-event variables will be 
summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of participants with the event at each visit. Data will be listed in data listings.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
The primary analysis will be performed using a Bayesian MMRM. 
The model will include parameters for treatment*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. Body mass index, gender, country, and time since diagnosis will also be considered and included as parameters if found to be significant (p<0.05) . The model will not 
include an intercept. The priors for all parameters in the model will be non-informative and follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 1000. The prior for the variance- covariance matrix will 
follow an inverted Wishart distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of visits and an identity scale matrix. 
The adjusted posterior mean percentage change from baseline and 
the associated 95%  HDP CrI for each treatment at Week 16 will be 
reported, together with the adjusted mean difference from placebo and the associated 95% HDP CrI for each active dose at each visit and the probability that each treatment difference is less than 0%, -20%, -30%, and - 50%.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:   
All secondary analyses will be performed on the mITT set, excluding data collected after treatment discontinuation, without consideration of any protocol deviations. Dose will be treated as a categori cal variable and no dose response modelling will be done. 
Comparisons of interest will be between individual EDP1815 doses and placebo. All p -values, posterior probabilities, CI, and CrI 
calculated will be considered as descriptive with no further adjustments for multiplicity performed.  
Analyses of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints will be summarized using the mITT 
population, with data collected after discontinuation of treatment excluded but without consideration of any protocol deviations.  
Analyses of biomarkers will be addressed in a data analysis plan 
outside the study SAP.

 Page 82 Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
The number and percentage of participants who have a quantifiable 
concentration of EDP1815 in their blood sample will be summarized using the safety set by [CONTACT_765]. Placebo participants will be pooled into a single treatment group. If at least 20% of participants within a treatment group are found to have a quantifiable level at one of the visits, then the concentration will be summarized as a continuous variable for the relevant treatment group at that visit.  
Safety Analyses:   
All safety endpoints will be tabulated or plotted by [CONTACT_322433]. All safety analyses will use the pooled placebo. Further details will be des cribed in the SAP.

 Page 86 1 Introduction  
Evelo Biosciences Inc. (Evelo ) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_322401] 
a new class of therapeutic agents. These therapeutic agents are human commensal organisms 
that offer the potential of systemic immune system modulation following oral administration, without systemic exposure. EDP1815 is a pharmaceutical preparation of a strain of 
Prevotella histicola  isolated from a human duodenal biopsy: it has not been genetically 
modified. Strains of the Prevotella  genus of microbes have been found in all human 
populations tested to date, at abundances ranging from less than 1% to nearly 50% of total 
fecal microbial load (Vandeputte 2017). Prevotella  are gram -negative, obligate anaerobes that 
are natural human commensals in the oral cavity and GI tract. EDP1815 is a gram- negative 
bacterium sensitive to the major classes of antibiotics, eg, penicillins and cephalosporins. In non-clinical and clinical studies, its therapeutic effects have been dose- dependent. The IB 
describes the development of EDP1815, initially in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Initial clinical data from the first- in-human study in psoriasis patients are 
presented in the IB (Evelo Biosciences 2019). 
Several studies (de Groot et al 2017; Hindson et al 2017; Yan et al 2017; Felix et al 2018) 
suggest that host- microbe interactions in the gut, and particularly in the small intestine, can 
influence systemic inflammation. Evelo is seeking to develop oral anti- inflammatory 
medicines based on this emerging science. Preclinical data confirms that individual strains of 
microbes exhibit unique pharmacological profiles. This is thought to be based on multiple 
distinct microbial structural pattern motifs interacting with varying combinations of host 
pattern recognition receptors in small intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  
Studies of EDP1815 in vitro in a range of human and mouse assays and studies in vivo in model symptoms support the use of EDP1815 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
including psoriasis (Evelo Biosciences 2019). EDP1815 increases secretion of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL -1RA, and IL-27 from human immune cells, 
while inducing minimal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 6, TNF α, and 
IFNγ. 
Oral administration of EDP1815 to mice results in striking pharmacodynamic e ffects on 
animal models of delayed-type hypersensitivity, fluorescein isothiocyanate cutaneous hypersensitivity, collagen- induced arthritis (Marietta et al 2016) and experimental acute 
encephalomyelitis (Mangalam et al 2017). The high degree of consistency of both effect and

Psoriasis is a chronic immune -mediated type 1/[ADDRESS_398041] validated the role of anti- TNF α, 
anti-IL-17, and anti- IL-23 therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis. For patients with mild to 
moderate psoriasis, therapy usually involves topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450] (topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], 
vitamin  D3 analogs), with topi[INVESTIGATOR_322400] 
a wide range of formulations. More recently, physicians are prescribing apremilast, a first-in-class oral PDE4 inhibitor, ahead of biological therapy, which includes etanercept, 
infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab. 
In Evelo study EDP1815-101, a total of [ADDRESS_398042] participated in Cohorts 1-4, with 
36 of these participants receiving EDP1815 once daily; 16 of these were treated for 14 days 
(healthy volunteers) and [ADDRESS_398043] been observed on the (psoriatic) LSS and PASI at Day  28. Furthermore, at the Day 42 follow-up visit, when 
participants were “off treatment” for [ADDRESS_398044]. The safety profile of EDP1815 was similar to placebo, with no SAEs or AEs of severe 
intensity.

 Page 88 The evidence available so far suggests EDP1815 is very well tolerated and it continues to 
undergo clinical development in mild to moderate psoriasis. A well-tolerated oral therapy 
could offer signifi cant benefit in the treatment of psoriasis and it is presently anticipated that 
EDP1815 would be used in established but early disease, before the use of biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
This Phase 2 study has been designed to investigate the clinical safety and effic acy of 
EDP1815 and to identify an optimal dose.

3.1 Study Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-cohort, 
dose-ranging study of participants with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis (Section 4.1).  
Part A of the study comprises a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a baseline visit, a 
treatment period of 16 weeks (8 planned study site visits), and a follow-up visit at Week 20 
(4 weeks after cessation of dosing) . Part A of the study therefore comprises a total of 
[ADDRESS_398045] previously experienced treatment failure 
and/or had rebound of disease. A final visit at Week [ADDRESS_398046] not yet met the definition of disease relapse. Part B of the study therefore comprises a maximum of 3 additional scheduled study visits with a follow-up of up to 40 weeks (24 weeks after 
cessation of dosing), and on completion of Part B, the final analysis will be performed.  
The study design is presented in Figure 3-1, and the SoA is presented in Table  6-1 for Part A, 
and in Table  6-2 for Part B.  
After eligibility is confirmed during the scree ning period (Section 4.1), participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 3 parallel cohorts: 
• Cohort 1: 0.8 × 10
11 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 1 PIC, 
once daily (Section  5.2).  
• Cohort 2: 3.2 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo adminis tered as 4  PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378], 
once daily (Section  5.2).  
• Cohort 3: 8.0 × 1011 cells of EDP1815 or matching placebo administered as 10 PI[INVESTIGATOR_322378], 
once daily (Section  5.2).

 Page 94 3.1.1 Rationale for Study Design  
The EDP1815 Phase 1 program evaluated doses of 1.6 × 1010 cells to 8.0 × 1011 cells given 
daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers and doses of 1.6 × 1011 cells and 8.0 × 1011 cells given 
daily for 4 weeks to participants with mild to moderate psoriasis. All doses were found to be 
well tolerated and doses of both 1.6 × 1011 and 8.0 × 1011 cells induced clinically relevant 
reductions in signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis and psoriasis lesion severit y.  
The doses tested in the program are based on predictions from the preclinical data and the clinical and biomarker data obtained in EDP1815-101, the Phase 1 study. All doses tested up to 8.0 × [ADDRESS_398051] been equally well tolerated. No clear difference in efficacy was 
observed between the 1.6 × 1011 cells and the 8.0 × 1011 cells in EDP1815-101 over the 
28-day dosing period, but at the 14-day follow up (Day 42) the participants receiving the higher dose had a continued improvement in their psoriasis compared to participants who had 
received the lower dose. This suggests a more sustained and potentially deeper response in 
the high dose group. Evelo is therefore proposing to include the lowest and highest feasible doses (based on capsule load) in this study to establish the dose response, the maximum clinical benefit, and to assess participant tolerability and acceptability of the doses tested.  
The clinical response to EDP1815 treatment will be evaluated using multiple assessments, 
facilitating appropr iate selection of efficacy measures for future studies.  
The use of a placebo comparator is appropriate for this participant population of individuals with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis for the following reasons:  
• The limited proven efficacy of other tr eatments (topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], vitamin D3 
analogs, and apremilast) in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis that could potentially serve as an active comparator  
• The limited duration of the study (maximum of 16 weeks of treatment) for each 
participant  
• A randomization ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_398052], including time to relapse and incidence of

 Page 96 4 Participant Selection and Withdrawal Criteria  
4.1 Selection of Study Population  
Approximately 225 participants will be randomized in multiple countries, including (but not 
limited to) sites in the [LOCATION_002], the [LOCATION_008], Poland, and Hungary. Participants will be assigned to study treatment only if they meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion 
criteria during screening. 
Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed: adherence to the 
eligibility criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.  
Screen failures are defined as parti cipants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomly assigned to study drug (EDP1815 or placebo). A minimal set of screen failure information is required to be entered in the eCRF to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs. 
Individuals who fail to satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria at screening may be rescreened 
1 additional time with the agreement of the medical monitor before rescreening. Participants 
may also be rescreened if they initially pass the screening ass essments but go beyond the 
screening period time limit. In exceptional circumstances, the screening window can be extended on a case -by-case basis after consultation with the sponsor: such an exceptional 
extension will not be considered a protocol deviation.

participating in or completing the study.  
4.2 Discontinuation From Study Treatment and/or Withdrawal From the 
Study  
Participants may discontinue from study treatment or withdraw from the study at any time 
and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_322434]. Every effort should be made to keep participants in the study. The reasons for participants discontinuing treatment and/or withdrawing from the study will be r ecorded in 
the eCRF.  
There are 3 scenarios that result in interruption of the treatment regimen: interruption of 
study drug, early discontinuation of study drug, and early withdrawal from the study: 
• Interruption of treatment is defined as a temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322402], due to an AE or any other reason. The maximum permitted interruption is 1 week. 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 101 • Early discontinuation of treatment is defined as permanent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322403]  16. Investigators will strive to ensure 
that a participant who has interrupted treatment for a particular reason will not 
discontinue treatment unless discontinuation is medically imperative in the investigator’s judgment. However, a dose interruption of more than 1 week will result in mandatory discontinuation of treatment.  
• Early withdrawal from the study is defined as failing to complete the required follow-
up period.  
A participant will be discontinued from the study drug or withdrawn from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
1. The participant experiences treatment failure, demonstrated by [CONTACT_322421], biological, or intermediate or high-potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588]. 
2. The participant has a serious o r intolerable AE that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_322391]. 
3. The participant has symptoms or an intercurrent illness not consistent with the protocol requirements or that justifies withdraw al. 
4. The participant is lost to follow -up. 
5. Other reasons (eg, pregnancy, development of contraindications to use of study drug). 
6. The participant withdraws consent, or the investigator or sponsor decides to discontinue the participant’s participation in the study. 
A participant may be discontinued from the study drug or withdrawn from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
1. The participant is noncompliant with the protocol. 
2. The participant has laboratory safety results that reveal clinically significant 
hematological or biochemical changes from the baseline values.  
3. If the participant is required to start therapy for a concurrent condition that may affect the study endpoints, eg, a disease- modifying agent for psoriatic arthritis.  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 102 In all of these instances, if the participant is to remain in the study, then the investigator 
should confirm that the participant is suitable to continue in the study with the medical 
monitor.  
4.2.1 Discontinuation From Study Treatment  
It may be necessary for a participant to permanently  discontinue study treatment. If study 
drug is definitively discontinued, the participant will be encouraged by [CONTACT_322435], so that study data will be collected for the par ticipant per protocol. Every effort should be made to keep 
participants in the study.  
Dosing may be interrupted at the investigator’s discretion due to AE or intercurrent illness for 
a period of up to [ADDRESS_398065] or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons. The investigator will also withdraw a participant if Evelo 
terminates the study.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the eCRF.  
Participants who withdraw from the study during Part A should complete the final 
assessments listed under the Follow-up Visit (Week 20) at an unscheduled follow-up visit, as 
detailed in the SoA ( Table  6-1). Participants who withdraw from the study during Part B 
should complete the final assessments at the Early Withdrawal Visit, as detailed in Table  6-2.

required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_322436]/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 2 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_322437].  
If the participant continues to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.

5.1 Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups  
Participants will be r andomly assigned at the baseline visit (Visit 2) to 1 of 3 cohorts (in a 
1:1:1 allocation ratio) that are distinguishable to participants and study staff by [CONTACT_322416]- daily dose. Within the cohort, participants will be ra ndomly 
assigned in a 2:1 allocation ratio to receive either EDP1815 or matching placebo treatment (Section  3.1). Interactive response technology will be used to administer the randomization 
schedule.  
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Participants in each cohort (described in Section  3.1) will self -administe r study drug doses 
orally in the morning with water, refraining from consuming acidic drinks 1 hour either side of dosing and from eating 2 hours before dosing and 1 hour after dosing ( Table  6-1). The 
composition of capsules is described in Section 5.3. Strategy to improve compliance is presented in Se ction  5.7.

regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all study drug will be reconciled and retained or destroyed according to applicable regulations. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study drug are provided in the IMP handling manual. 
Accountability, reconciliation, and then shipment for destruction or for destruction on site 
will be documented through the IRT. 
5.4.3 Other Supplies  
Evelo will supply Bristol stool diaries (Section  6.2.2) and paper dosing diaries to all 
participants (Section  5.7.1). Electronic devices for administering questionnaires will be 
provided to all study sites.  
5.5 Overdose Management  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a participant or taken by a participant that exceeds the maximum dose described in the protocol (10 capsules per day).

The primary purpose of the diary is to enhance participant compliance with the protocol. Participants will be asked to capture the following information in the diaries: 
• Dates of dosing with study drug 
• Times of dosing with study drug 
• Numbers of capsules in dose 
• Changes in concomitant medications 
• Changes in symptoms  
• Other comments  
Diaries will be dispensed and collected as detailed in the SoA ( Table  6-1). Study staff will 
review the diaries with participants at each visit when diaries are collected. Diaries will be 
reviewed for completeness and accuracy, and participants will be coached as needed on compliance with the protocol.

requirement is that drug tradename, total daily dose, and the dates of administration are to be recorded. In addition, it is expected that the reason for use and dosage information (including dose and frequency) will also be recorded. This will include all prescription drugs, herbal 
products, vitamins, minerals, and OTC medications. Any changes in concomitant 
medications also will be recorded in the participant’s eCRF. The participant’s dosing diary may contain information relevant to the documentation of changes in concomitant medication.  
Any concomitant medication or therapy deemed necessary for the welfare of the participant 
during the study may be given at the discretion of the investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded 
in full in the eCRF.

Participants will be asked to withhold the application of any emollients or moisturizers on the day of any site visit until after all study assessments have been performed. As part of the screening, PASI, BSA involvement, and 
PGA scores will be measured (inclusion criterion  #4, Section 4.1.1).  
Participants meeting eligibility criteria at screening will return to the study site on Day 1.

 Page 116 6.1 Efficacy Assessments  
6.1.1 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score  
The PASI score will be assessed as described by [CONTACT_322423] (2004). The PASI is a 
physician assessment that combines the assessment of the severity of and area affected by [CONTACT_322424] a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The absolute 
PASI score in this study is used as part of inclusion criterion #4. The PASI percentage 
response rates are efficacy endpoints (ie, PASI-50, PASI-75, PASI-90, and PASI-100). For example, the percentage of participants who achieve a 75% or greater reduction in PASI 
score from baseline is represented by [CONTACT_248165] -75 value. Details of the PASI assessment will 
be provided in the relevant training material.  
Response Definitions based on PASI score at Week 16: 
• Responders:  Participants on treatment achieving PASI -50 or greater at Week 16 visit 
• Relapse:  Increase i n PASI score to baseline value or greater, or participant begins a 
new treatment for psoriasis  
• Partial Relapse: Loss of PASI-50 response after cessation of study treatment 
• Rebound:  Increase in PASI score to 125% of baseline value or above, or onset of 
new pustular/erythrodermic psoriasis within 3 months of cessation of study treatment 
• Duration of remission:  Time from first achievement of PASI -100 to loss of 
PASI -100 
• Duration of trea tment success:  Time from first achievement of PASI -50 to loss of 
PASI -50 
• Duration of therapeutic effect:  Time from cessation of study treatment until 
increase of PASI to 50% of maximum improvement from baseline

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 117 6.1.2 Lesion Severity Score  
The LSS is used to score the severity of psoriasis plaques (Patel and Tsui 2011). The 
dimensions of scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation are each scored on a scale from 0 to 4, and the total LSS is the numerical sum of the 3 -dimensional scores observed at a single study 
visit.  
6.1.3 Physician’s Global Assessment  
The National Psoriasis Foundation Psoriasis Score version of a static PGA is calculated by [CONTACT_322442], induration, and desquamation scores (Feldman and 
Krueger 2005). Erythema, induration, and desquamation will be scored on a 6-point scale, 
ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (severe): the total PGA score is defined as the average of the erythema, induration, and desquamation scores. Details of the PGA assessment will be provided in the relevant training mat erial.  
6.1.4 Percent of Body Surface Area Involvement  
The percent of BSA involvement will be estimated for each participant, where 1% is approximately the area of the participant’s handprint (Walsh et al 2013). Details of the BSA assessment will be provided in t he relevant training material.  
Walsh and colleagues proposed the product of the PGA and the BSA involvement as a simple and effective alternative for measuring severity of psoriasis in clinical trials (Walsh et al 2013).  
6.1.5 Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index  
The mNAPSI is a numeric, r eproducible, objective, and simple tool for physicians to evaluate 
the severity of nail bed psoriasis and nail matrix psoriasis by [CONTACT_23006] (Cassell et al 2007). Details of conducting the mNAPSI will be provided in the relevant 
training material.

 Page 118 6.1.7 Psoriasis Symptom Inventory  
The PSI is a patient reported outcomes instrument that is used to assess the severity of plaque 
psoriasis symptoms (Bushnell et al 2013). All symptoms (itch, redness, scaling, burning, cracking, stinging, flaking, and pain) are rated on a 5-point severity scale. The PSI demonstrated good construct validity and was sensitive to within-subject change (p<0.0001). 
Details of administering the PSI will be provided in the specific user manual.  
6.1.8 Pain  
Pain will be assessed by [CONTACT_20763] -36 BPS and the V AS Pain (Hawker et al 2011).  
6.1.9 Fatigue  
Consistent with a recent study of fatigue in psoriasis (Skoie et al 2017), fatigue will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_322443]-36 (van der Heijden et al 2003) and a fatigue V AS (Wolfe 2004). 
6.1.10  Biopsy of Skin Plaque  
Skin plaque biopsies (ie, a 4 mm punch biopsy, performed pre-dose by [CONTACT_322444]) are to be performed after all other 
assessments have been completed at the end of Visits 2 and 10.

 Page 119 A TEAE is defined as any event not present before exposure to the study drug or any event 
already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any event that 
• results in death  
• is immediately life threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 120 [IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported from the date of signed informed consent and through for 
[ADDRESS_398079]- treatment 
would only be reported if the investigator considers it to be related to the study treatment. 
If the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the 
study drug or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor (or designee).  
Serious AEs that occur m ore than [ADDRESS_398080] been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (prescription or OTC medications), noticed any changes in bowel habits, or had unplanned vis its to their general practitioner since the last visit.  
In addition to participant observations, AEs identified from any study data (eg, laboratory 
values, physical examination findings, ECG changes) or identified from review of other 
documents (eg, participant diaries) that are relevant to participant safety will be documented on the AE page in the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Assessment of Severity  
The severity, or intensity, of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the participant’s daily activities or their health . The intensity of the AE will be rated in 
accordance with the CTCAE version 5.0. 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized 
as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 121 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process. Regardless of the investigator's assessment of an AE's relationship to study drug, the AE must be reported.  
The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the following classification and criteria:  
Unrelated:  
There is no association between the study drug and the reported event. 
 
Possible: Treatment with the study drug caused or contributed to the AE, ie, the event 
follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration or follows a known response pattern to the study drug but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_322445] s. 
 
Probable: 
A reasonable temporal sequence of the event with drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event with the study drug seems likely. The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of study drug. 
 
Definite: 
A definite causal relationship exists between drug administration and the AE, 
and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event. The event reappears or worsens if the study drug is re- administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes the following: 
• Dose (number of capsules per day) 
• Description of the event / event term  
• Date and time of  onset 
• Investigator- specified assessment of severity

Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 122 • Investigator-specified assessment of causal relationship to study drug 
• Date and time of resolution of the event 
• Seriousness 
• Lot/batch number 
• Any required treatment or evaluations 
• Action taken with the study drug due to the event 
• Outcome 
• Investigator- specific assessment if the AE is related to a recent/current COVID 
infection  
• If a COVID positive PCR test received within last [ADDRESS_398081] also be reported. 
All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The then-current version of MedDRA will be used to code all AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE, but it should be captured in the medical history 
page(s) of the eCRF. However, it should be recorded as an AE at any time during the study that it dete riorates to a greater extent than would be expected.  
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be reported to  
immediately (ie, within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the 
event.

 Page 124 event onset, comparing the severity of each S[LOCATION_003]R and the cumulative event frequency 
reporte d for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the EDP1815 IB. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and 
seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_183005]. If an AE, after caus ality 
and expectedness assessment, is regarded as a potential S[LOCATION_003]R by [CONTACT_322446], unblinding for regulatory reporting purposes must be 
performed before notification of the S[LOCATION_003]R to the regulatory authorities and IRBs/ECs, as applicable. The procedure must ensure that the identity of the IMP  is only revealed to those 
that need to obtain this information. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Participants Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to satisfactory resolution, until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, the event is considered stable, the participant dies, or the participant is lost to 
follow-up. 
6.2.2 Bristol Stool Form Scale  
The BSFS is a classification system for the form (appearance) of human feces (O’Donnell et 
al 1990) that has been determined to be a reliable and validated assessment that correlates well with stool water content (Blake et al 2016). In addition, the Prevotella  enterotype has 
been found to be more abundant in subjects with looser stools (Vandeputte et al 2016).  
The BSFS classifies human feces into [ADDRESS_398082] stools (low stool water content) and slow colon transit.  
During the screening period, participants will complete a 7-day stool diary over the week 
before the baseline visit. Participants will record in the diary the date  and time of each 
defecation, as well as its BSFS category. Participants will bring their completed diaries to the baseline visit, when study staff will collect it for entry in the eCRF.  
6.2.3 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will be conducted, including assessments of the skin and cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI, and neurological systems. Height (at screening only) and

 Page 125 weight will also be measured and recorded (without shoes, street clothing). Body mass index 
will be calculated from the hei ght and weight. Investigators should pay special attention to 
clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_398083] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, mobile phones). 
Vital signs (to be checked prior to any procedures) will consist of 1 pulse rate and 3 blood 
pressure measurements ([ADDRESS_398084] 1 minute). The lowest of the 3 blood pressure readings will be recorded on the eCRF.  
6.2.5 Electrocardiograms  
Single 12-lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the SoA ( Table  6-1) using an ECG 
machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, RR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals.  
At each visit, a single individual ECG tracing should be obtained: if, in the judgment of the investigator, the ECG tracing appears to be clinically significant, it should be repeated. If the repeated tracing also appears clinically significant, the investigator should report the abnormality as an AE and consult with the medical monitor to decide whether the participant 
should continue trea tment in the study.

spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and 
status of mother and child, even if the participant was discontinued from the study. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital 
anomaly, ectopic pregnancy), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an 
SAE. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous miscarriages must be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s attention 
after the participant has completed the study, and considered by [CONTACT_160524], must be promptly reported to . 
6.[ADDRESS_398086] results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECGs, vital si gn measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline or are clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator, are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, any clinically significant safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_165781]’s condition, are not  to be reported as AEs 
or SAEs.  
Standard laboratory analyses to understand safety and tolerability include the following:  
• Blood or plasma analytes: urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, ALT, AST, total and 
direct bilirubin, CRP, creatine kinase, fasting glucose, fasting lipid panel (total 
cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides) 
• Hematologic analyses: full blood count, including hemoglobin, MCV , MCH, MCHC, 
hematocrit, percent reticulocytes, platelet count; differential white blood cell count including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils 
• Urinalysis by [CONTACT_81795]: protein, blood, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, pH, nitrites, and specific gravity

• Serum pregnancy test (HCG) at screening, urine test thereafter  
Blood samples for assessment of fasting blood glucose and lipid pa nel will be obtained after 
the participant has fasted for at least 8 hours.  
A central laboratory (or specialized central laboratories) will be used for all laboratory 
analyses. Details of sample collection and handling procedures will be provided in the 
specific laboratory manual.  
The investigator must review the laboratory reports, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study. If the laboratory reports are not 
transferred electronically, the values must be f iled with the source information (including 
reference ranges). In most cases, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those 
that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_322448]'s condition. 
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_398087] dose of study drug should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982]. If such values do not return to 
normal/baseline within a time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be 
identified, and the sponsor noti fied. 
All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in this section, must be conducted in 
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table  6-1). Screening laboratory results 
will be used to confirm eligibility at Visit 2 ( Baseline) . If laboratory values from 
non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory 
require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the 
eCRF.

 Page 128 6.4.1 Blood Volume  
The planned maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of 
the study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 130 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. The planned maximum amount of blood collected from each partici pant at a 
single visit will not exceed 46 mL, and the planned maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over 30 days will not exceed 58 mL.  
6.4.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Systemic exposure following oral EDP1815 dosing is estimated to be very low based on lack of detection in blood (<0.01% of administered dose). However, plasma samples will be taken from all participants for the estimate of systemic EDP1815 levels by [CONTACT_322417] -specific 
primers that can detect EDP1815 specifically, even when other strains of Prevotella histicola  
are present. Any effects of EDP1815 on the gut microbiome will be investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, which measures both the presence and quantity of microbes at the genus level. Sampling will be performed as specified in the SoA ( Table  6-1, blood sample 
for systemic levels of microbes).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Fecal Microbiome  
The microbiome composition of stool samples will be assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, which looks at the diversity and abundance of microbes in the colonic microbiome (Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012). EDP1815 is not expected to 
alter the composition of the microbiome, but it is being evaluated as a safety biomarker.

 Page 130 7 Statistical Considerations  
Analysis methods for key endpoints are described below. Further details on all analyses will 
be described in the SAP.  
No formal hypothesis will be tested. A model-based probability inference approach in a Bayesian framework wi ll be used to guide decision-making around dose selection. Posterior 
estimates and 95% CrI for the difference between each active dose and placebo will be produced for relevant primary and secondary endpoints. 
Unless otherwise specified, missing data will be considered as missing at random and will be 
accounted for using mixed models for repeated measures, with all time points collected for 
the relevant endpoint included in the model. This includes data which is excluded due to 
collection after treatment di scontinuation or after a protocol deviation as applicable to the 
definition of the estimands used in the analysis. 
The primary analysis for the study will occur after all participants have completed [ADDRESS_398089] dose of study medication (end of Part A). The final analysis for the study will occur when all participants have completed the required relapse and rebound follow-up period of up to [ADDRESS_398090]- treatment (end of Part B).

from the protocol. Only data collected while on treatment will be used to account for the 
intercurrent event of treatment discontinuation (hypothetical strategy based on adherence to treatment only). The posterior mean difference between each active dose and the pooled 
placebo will be estimated.  
Percent change from baseline in PASI score at each visit will be calculated as:  
100*(PASI score at Visit – baseline PASI score) / baseline PASI score.  
A negative percentage change from baseline will indicate an improvement.  
For the primary analysis, 3 supportive estimands will also be considered:

 Page 131 • To assess the impact of intercurrent events related to protocol deviations believed to 
impact efficacy, a supportive analysis will be performed where all data collected after any such identified protocol deviations will be excluded. Participants who had a 
protocol deviation believed to impact efficacy prior to the first dose of treatment (hypothetical strategy based on adherence to treatment and the aspects of the protocol which impact efficacy) will be completely excluded from this analysis.  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation for any reason, a supportive 
analysis will be performed in which all data collected up to the end of Week 16, 
including any data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included (treatment policy strategy).  
• To assess the impact of treatment discontinuation due to a requirement for alternative 
therapy, a supportive analysis will be performed where the highest PASI score 
recorded prior to treatment discontinuation will be applied to all expected visits after treatment discontinuation up to Week 16.

mitotic counts and immune cell infiltrates) at Week 16 versus baseline 
• mRNA transcription analysis on skin plaque biopsies at Week 16 versus baseline

• Microbiome composition (in feces) at Week 16 and Week 20 versus baseline

discontinuation of treatment excluded but without consideration of any protocol deviations. 
7.3 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size of 225 participants in total, has been chosen to explore the tolerability and safety of EDP1815. Although the study will use a model- based probability inference 
approach in a Bayesian framework, the following power calculation was also performed 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 135 (using a basic frequentist approach) in order to give confidence that enough participants are 
available to find a clinically meaningful difference between active dose and placebo if the 
below assumptions are met. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the PASI score at 
Week  16. Percent change from baseline relative to placebo will be estimated within the 
model (Section  7.6.1) as (percent change in active) - (percent change in placebo), with a 
negative value indicating a greater improvement for active than placebo. A percent change from baseline relative to placebo of at least 20% will be considered clinically meaningful. The pooled standard deviation across all doses is assumed to be 25%. 
Participants in the placebo arm of each cohort will be pooled for the statistical analysis in 
order to compare active and control arms resulting in 75 participants randomized to the pooled placebo group and 50 participants randomized to each active treatment group (EDP1815 0.8 × 10
11 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, and EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells). 
Assuming that no more than 15% of participants will discontinue treatment before the Week  [ADDRESS_398096] more than 95% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups at the 5% significance level under the assumption that pooling the placebo groups is a valid strategy. If the [ADDRESS_398097] a difference in each within -cohort pairwise comparison 
between active and placebo doses would be greater than 80%. 
As the statistical inference for this study will focus on estimation rather than testing a formal 
hypothesis, no multiplicity adjustments of the different comparisons between groups in order 
to control the study- wise type I error rate will be performed.  
Similarly, as there is no intention to use any interim analyses to stop the study early for 
efficacy (Section  7.6.7), no adjustments for multiplicity will be made to account for any 
analyses performed as part of the interim analyses.  
7.4 Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses.

and who received at least one dose of study treatment. Participants who withdraw from the 
study before the end of Week 4 and are replaced will be included in this analysis set. All analyses using the mITT will group participants according to randomized treatment.  
PPS: The PPS will consist of all mITT participants who were not replaced (following study 
withdrawal before the end of Week 4) and who do not have a protocol deviation that may 
impact efficacy with a start date for the deviation before initiation of study treatment. Note 
that in the case of participants who have a protocol deviation with a potentia l impact on 
efficacy after initiation of treatment, the participant will remain in the PPS but all data collected after the protocol deviation occurred will be excluded from any analyses performed using the PPS. All analyses using the PPS will group partic ipants according to treatment 
received at the start of the study. Deviations that may affect efficacy are shown in Table  7-2.

7.5 Description of Subgroups to Be Analyzed  
Results may be summarized by [CONTACT_322429].  
Subgroup analysis of the primary estimand will be performed based on the following 
subgroups:

• Baseline BMI (<30  kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2) 
If the placebo groups from the 3 cohorts are found to be too heterogeneous to be pooled 
(Section  7.6.1), the primary and secondary analyses will be performed using within-cohort 
comparisons of active and placebo treatments, and summary tables may also be produced by [CONTACT_9084]. 
7.[ADDRESS_398101] deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Time- to-event variables will be summarized using 
Kaplan -Meier estimates of the proportion of participants wit h the event at each visit. Data 
will be listed in data listings.  
Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the SAP.  
7.6.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The assumption that the 3 cohorts of placebo participants can be pooled into a single placebo group to be used as a control for all active doses will be examined using mean (±SD) plots and box plots of percent change in PASI score against time. In addition, an MMRM will be 
used to compare the 3 cohorts of placebo participants. The model will include parameters for 
cohort, visit and baseline PASI score together with cohort*visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. L east squares mean (95% CI) estimates for each placebo cohort will be plotted 
by [CONTACT_765]. 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  17 November 2020  
 Page 139 A decision will be made by [CONTACT_322430], based on examination of the above figures 
and model, on whether the pooling strategy is appropriate.  
The primary analysis will be performed using a Bayesian MMRM. The model will include 
parameters for treatment *visit and baseline PASI score*visit interactions. Body mass index, 
gender, country, and time since diagnosis will also be considered and included as parameters 
if found to be significant (p<0.05) . The model will not include an intercept. Visit will consist 
of 6 levels (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16) and treatment will consist of 4 levels (pooled 
placebo, EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, and EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells) 
if the placebo pooling strategy is considered appropriate or 6 levels (Placebo matching 
EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, Placebo matching EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, Placebo matching 
EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 0.8 × 1011 cells, EDP1815 3.2 × 1011 cells, and 
EDP1815 8.0 × 1011 cells) if the placebo pooling strategy is not considered appropriate. 
The priors for all parameters in the model will be non-informative and follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 1000. The prior for the variance- covariance matrix will 
follow an inverted Wishart distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of visits 
and an identity scale matrix. The choice of Wishart distribution is based on it being the 
conjugate prior of the inverse- covariance matrix of a multivariate-normal random vector.  
If the assumption of similarity between the 3 placebo cohorts is considered appropriate, the 
placebo cohorts will be pooled, and a single placebo control group will be used for the pairwise differences for each active dose to placebo. If the assumpt ion of similarity is 
considered inappropriate, each placebo dose will be included in the model as a separate dose level and pairwise comparisons between each active dose and placebo will be performed using only the matching placebo dose data for the relevant active dose. 
The adjusted posterior mean percentage change from baseline and the associated 95% HDP 
CrI for each treatment at Week 16 will be reported, together with the adjusted mean 
difference from placebo and the associated 95% HDP CrI for each active dose at each visit and the probability that each treatment difference is less than 0%, -20%, -30%, and -50%. 
Model checking and diagnostic plots, including posterior density plots of the posterior 
samples for all parameters in the model and residual plots to evaluate the distributional 
assumptions underlying the model, will be produced. The assumption that data are missing at random will be evaluated by [CONTACT_322449], 
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_398102] fitting model (lowest 
DIC) selected for use in the outputs. 
The dose-response model will be fitted to the data using Bayesian techniques with 
noninformative priors for E 0 and E max and an FUP for ED50 (3- and 4- parameter models 
only) and the slope parameter m (4-parameter model only). The rationale for this choice of 
inference is that the FUP shrinks the dose response towards a flat line throughout the dose 
range, therefore providing more conservative estimates of the dose-response relationship 
compared to maximum likelihood (Bornkamp 2014). The models will be fully described in the SAP.  
Based on the selected model, the posterior mean with associated 95% HDP CrI, for t he 
difference from placebo for each active dose will be produced for the pairwise differences between each active dose and placebo, together with the posterior mean and 95% HDP CrI of the treatment difference from placebo for each active dose and posterior  probabilities that 
difference from placebo is less than 0, -20%, -30%, and -50%. A further sensitivity analysis 
will be performed on the dose response model, in which participants who withdrew from 
study drug due to treatment will have their Week 16 percentage change from PASI imputed as 100% after study drug was discontinued. 
Percent change from baseline in PASI score will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].  
Evelo Biosciences Inc.  EDP1815  
Protocol: EDP1815 -201 Version 5.0 (Amendment 4)  [ADDRESS_398103] will be between individual EDP1815 doses 
and placeb o. All p -values, posterior probabilities, CI, and CrI calculated will be considered as 
descriptive with no further adjustments for multiplicity performed.  
Data will be analyzed as collected and no imputation of missing data will be performed. 
The covariates selected for the Bayesian MMRM analysis for the primary estimand will also 
be used in all other analytical models including covariates. 
Mean percentage change from baseline in PASI score at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 will be analyzed 
as part of the MMRM for the primary estimand. The same statistics produced for the Week 
16 time point will also be produced at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. 
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same manner as described for the 
primary analysis: 
• Mean absolute change from baseline in PASI score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16  
• Mean percentage change from baseline in LSS at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16

For the PASI-50, a generalized linear mixed effects model with a logit link function will be 
fitted using data fr om all visits. Treatment, visit, and baseline PASI score terms will be 
included in the model as fixed effects, together with treatment*visit and 
baseline PASI  score*visit interactions, and any baseline covariates selected in the primary 
analysis model for the primary estimand. Odds ratios and 95% CIs for each active dose 
compared to placebo at each visit will be presented.  
A supportive analysis for the PASI-50 will also be performed, in the same manner as 
described above, in which participants who withdraw from study drug before Week 16 due to requirement for alternative therapy will be included in the model with the PASI -50 endpoint 
imputed as ‘not achieved’ at all expected visits after study drug withdrawal. 
A sensitivity analysis will also be performed o n the PASI -50. Bayesian logistic regression 
models will be individually fitted at each of Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. The model will include 
parameters for treatment and baseline PASI score together with any baseline covariates selected in the primary analysis  model for the primary estimand. The posterior odds- ratios for 
each pairwise comparison of an active EDP1815 dose and placebo with associated 95% HDP CrI will be presented together with the posterior probability that the true odds ratio >1.

All safety endpoints will be tabulated or plotted by [CONTACT_322433]. All 
safety analyses will use the pooled placebo group. Further details will be described in the SAP.  
7.6.6 Other Analyses 
Tabulations will be provided for completion/withdrawal status, protocol deviations, study populations, demographic and other baseline characteristics, use of concomitant medications, and exposure of and compliance with study drug. 
7.6.[ADDRESS_398107] 50% of participants have completed at least 12 weeks of treatment or withdrawn from treatment. The purpose of this analyses will be to aid in the planning of future studies and for a better 
understanding of the benefit/risk profile of EDP1815.  
For the interim analysis, unblinded aggregate results will be produced by [CONTACT_322450]. These will not be shared with any study site staff, participants, or clinical monitors who will be involved in 
the collection and review of individual study data. 
The interim analysis will look at the primary endpoint of percentage change from baseline in 
PASI score, secondary, and safety endpoints. The posterior predictive probability (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_279839] 2004) of the percent change from baseline in PASI score being at least 
20% lower in each active dose compared to the pooled placebo will also be calculated, using 
the estimates of treatment difference found at Week 12 using the Bayesian MMRM described for the primary analysis. If the posterior predictive probabilities for all active doses are found 
to be <30%, then the study may be stopped for futility. 
No decisions regarding study conduct, other than the potential to stop the study early for 
futility, will be made based on these assessments and the study will not be stopped if superior efficacy is found. Outputs featuring unblinded treatment assignments will be created by [CONTACT_322451] (to be 
included in the data dissemination plan).

submitted in writing to the investigator’s IRB/IEC, along with any applicable changes to the 
ICF, for approval before participants can be enrolled into an amended protocol. 
11.2.2  Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_1275]. A significant deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol or to local regulat ions or ICH GCP guidelines that may or may not result in a significant, 
additional risk to the participant or impacts the integrity of study data. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the participant’s source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard/safety risk to 
study participants without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an 
occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, where required. 
In order to keep deviations from the protocol to a minimum, the investigator and relevant site 
personnel will be trained in all aspects of study conduct by [CONTACT_456]/sponsor representative. This training will occur either as part of the investigator meeting or site initiation. Ongoing training may also be performed throughout the study during routine site 
monitoring activities.

Male participants   
Male participants must participate according to one of the following criteria: 
• Be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent. 
• Use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_322410] [ADDRESS_398121] 90 days following their final visit.  
• Have had a vasectomy, and the absence of sperm has been confirmed in the 
ejaculate.

 Page 162 Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
Table Notes:  
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. 
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods 
for participants participating in clinical studies.  
b) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which 
may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, a highly effective 
metho d of contraception plus condoms should be used during their participation in the 
study up to and including at least 1 complete menstrual cycle (≥28 days) for women and 
[ADDRESS_398122] dose.   
 
Pregnancy Testing:  
• A WOCBP should only be included after a negative serum HCG  pregnancy test.  
• Pregnancy testing is required at screening, randomization, and [ADDRESS_398123] 
dose at the follow-up visit.  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
For male participants with partners who become pregnant:  
• The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who be comes pregnant while the male participant is in this 
study. This applies to all male participants who receive EDP1815. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the

 Page 163 pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 8 weeks following the 
estimated deliver y date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
For female participants who become pregnant:  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy. The participant will be followed to de termine the outcome of 
the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to  8 weeks beyond the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complicat ion or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such. Any post -study pregnancy- related SAE considered reasonably related to the 
study drug by [CONTACT_55901]  [IP_ADDRESS].1. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
inform ation in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.

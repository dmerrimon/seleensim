Full Title:  Positive Affect  as a Source  of Resilience for Adults  in Chronic  Pain 
Short  Title:  LARKSPUR Study  
Principal Investigator: M. Carrington Reid, MD,  PhD (WCM) 
Anthony  D. Ong,  PhD (Cornell) 
Study  Description:  Our goal  for this study  is to evaluate  the feasibility, acceptability,  and 
effect size of a previously developed online positive affect (PA) skills 
intervention —LARKSPUR  (Lessons  in Affect  Regulation  to Keep Stress and 
Pain UndeR  control)— in a sample  of older adult  patients  with  
fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).  
Sample  Size:  N= 150 
Enrollment:  This study  will enroll  150 subjects  and screen up to 1,200 subjects  
Study  Population:  Older  adults  50 years  of age or older with a physician confirmed  diagnosis  
of FMS, or a self-report physician diagnosis corroborated by a screening  
measure, that will be stratified by [CONTACT_121854], non- Hispanic Black, or non- 
Hispanic  other  (e.g.,  White, Asian).  
Enrollment  Period: 2 years  
Study  Design: This is a longitudinal,  randomized behavioral  intervention feasibility 
study with internet trainings, daily reporting, and surveys using REDCap  
and BrightOutcome for  data  collection.  
Description of Sites/ 
Facilities Enrolling  
Participants:  We will be enrolling participants  only  through  WCM/NYP  and will be 
recruiting  participants  through EPIC,  physician referral, flyers, letters,  
social  media,  and direct recruitment.  
Study  Duration:  September  30, 2024 
Participant  Duration:  4 months  
Primary Objective:  To maximize  relevance and acceptability  of content  and delivery of 
LARKSPUR inte r vention among patients  with  FMS,  a chronic  pain  
population with  known deficits  in PA. This aim will establish the feasibility 
(recruitment and retention) and acceptability (helpfulness, satisfaction,  
and impact) of the multicomponent LARKSPUR intervention in patients  
with  FMS. 
Secondary  Objectives:  To conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_316599]  (primary  outcome),  as well PA, 
depressive symptoms,  physical  functioning,  and stress appraisals 
(secondary  outcomes),  and explore  racial/ethnic disparities. We 
hypothesize that intervention participants will report more frequent PA,  
decreased depressive symptoms,  enhanced physical  functioning,  
improved  stress appraisals, and reduced FMS  pain (intensity  and 
interference) immediately following the intervention (approximately 8  
weeks), and at 1-month  post -intervention.

Keep Stress and Pain UndeR  control)— in a sample  of patients  with fibromyalgia  syndrome (FMS).  
 
1.1.1 Objectives  
1) To maximize relevance and acceptability of content and delivery of LARKSPUR intervention  
among patients with FMS, a chronic pain population with known deficits in PA. This aim will  
establish the feasibility (recruitment  and retention) and acceptability  (helpfulness,  
satisfaction,  and impact)  of the multicomponent  LARKSPUR intervention  in patients  with  FMS.  
 
2) To conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_316600] (primary outcome), as well PA,  depressive symptoms, physical functioning, and  
stress appraisals (secondary  outcomes)  and explore racial/ethnic disparities. We hypothesize  
that intervention participants  will report  more  frequent  PA, decreased depressive  symptoms,  
enhanced physical functioning, improved stress appraisals, and reduced FMS pain (intensity  
and interference) immediately following the intervention (approximately 8 weeks), and at 1- 
month  post -intervention. 
 
1.1.2 Hypotheses  / Research Questions  
We hypothesize that the intervent ion will lead to more frequent daily PA, which, in addition to  
directly affecting depressive symptoms,  will also have  indirect effects  through enhanced  physical  
functioning and improved  stress appraisals ( resilience mechanisms ). Decreased  depressive  
symptoms,  enhanced  physical  functioning,  and improved  stress appraisals, in turn,  are 
hypothesized  to lead to reduced  FMS pain ( resilience outcomes ). 
 
2. Background and Significance 
Chronic non -cancer pain affects as many as [ADDRESS_389555] (PA) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients, a chronic pain  population with known deficits in PA  
and an inability to regulate PA in the face of pain. Our goal is to conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_316601] (Lessons in Affect Regulation to Keep Stress and Pain UndeR control), an online -delivered PA  
skills inter vention. Our central hypothesis is that our LARKSPUR program will (a) show acceptability and  
feasibility in engaging and retaining FMS patients and (b) demonstrate greater improvements in PA and  
FMS -related pain and functional  impairment.  
 
This proposal  for pi[INVESTIGATOR_316602] a high-quality  randomized  trial for people  
with FMS.  The proposed  work  holds  promise  as an effective, low cost,  scalable, and readily implementable  
novel non -pharmacologic intervention to help people cope with FMS. By [CONTACT_316606],  
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the LARKSPUR intervention, we hope to improve quality of life,  
as well as the options  available  for care  for millions of people who  suffer from  FMS.

one, but they can return to old lessons or exercises if they choose. As part of the daily home practice,  
intervention participants  will be asked  to complete  the daily emotion check-in that comprises  the 
attention control condition (which takes about 5 minutes to complete). Based on past studies, we  
estimate the time to read through a skill to be about 15 minutes per skill. We also encourage daily  
interaction with  the website (home practice,  reporting emotions)  and estimate  the time  involved to be an 
additional about 10 minutes. Both the LARKSPUR intervention and emotion-reporting attention control  
conditions,  including all home practice  and assessments,  will be done over  the internet from  the 
participant's  home,  or any other  location  of their choice.  The intervention content,  emotion  check-in,  and 
are all mobile -enabled so can be completed  on desktop,  laptop,  tablet,  or smartphone with web browser  
access.  
 
Attention  Control  Condition  (n = 75). We sought  an attention  control  condition  that provided  something  
to engage participants, but was not expensive or burdensome. In past research we have established that  
emotion reporting is acceptable as an attention control condition (retention rates of ~80%, similar to or  
higher than for the intervention), and that participants perceive it as being beneficial, providing some of  
the features of a placebo  control.  In this daily emotion -reporting  attention  control  condition,  participants  
will be asked to report how they are feeling daily for [ADDRESS_389557] that this reporting will require approximately 5 minutes per day. Note  
that participants in the LARKSPUR intervention condition will also be completing the daily reporting of  
emotions as part of their home practice. The control group will be completing the same number of  
assessments as the intervention condition at the same time points (baseline, post -intervention, 1-month  
follow-up).  
 
Data collection, transfer, security, and management. Data for the study will come from self-report  
through online. Self -report data will be collected via online assessment (REDCap) at baseline, during the  
6-8-week intervention/control (BrightOutcome), immediate post intervention/control, and at 1 -month  
follow-up. In addition, one week of daily stress and emotion surveys coinciding with each of the three  
assessments, for a total of 21 days outside the intervention/control period, will be collected via REDCap.  
The baseline, post -intervention/control, and [ADDRESS_389558] 60 and no more than 75  
minutes, and may also be done by [CONTACT_316607], or due to retention  
follow-up. With participant permission, phone and/or videoconference calls may be recorded for the  
purpose of accurate data collection. The recordings will be deleted a fter the study is completed and  
participation is not contingent on the participant’s agreement to be recorded. Participants will choose  
whether or not to authorize recordings when  completing their  informed  consent process.  
Data from  the  online intervention platform  will be securely stored  on Weill Cornell Medicine  and 
BrightOutcome servers, accessible only to IRB -approved co -investigators and BrightOutcome staff. These 
data  include number  of log-ins,  completed  home exercises, number  of skills completed,  and data  from  the 
daily emotion reporting surveys. All data used for analysis will be de -identified, and no identifiable data  
will ever be stored  locally on staff  computers  and no data  are stored  locally on participants’  devices.

intervention,  and 1-month  follow-up on-line via REDCap  or by [CONTACT_648].  Participants  will complete one week 
of daily 5 -10-minute surveys upon completion of each the three assessments, for a total of 21 days. They  
will also complete  5-minute daily check-in surveys  during the intervention/control period of 6-[ADDRESS_389560] effects through enhanced physical  
functioning and improved stress appraisals (resilience mechanisms ). Decreased depressive symptoms,  
enhanced physical functioning, and improved stress appraisals, in tu rn, are hypothesized to lead to  
reduced FMS pain ( resilience outcomes ). The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_316603] a future high - 
quality,  adequately powered trial that will explore theoretical moderators, thereby  [CONTACT_316608] ( resilience resources ). Finally, it is anticipated that  
the proposed  project  will foster  cross -campus  collaborations  (i.e.,  Weill Medical  College, Cornell 
University) that will advance research on rheumatic and autoi mmune diseases (including FMS), and  
culminate in the development of a novel non -pharmacologic therapeutic approach that is effective, low  
cost,  and easily  disseminated.

4.4 Strategies  for Recruitment  and Retention 
We will recruit fibromyalgia patients from offices at Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork -Presby[CONTACT_194840]  
(e.g., the Center on Aging (COA), the Cornell Internal Medicine Associates (CIMA), and the Iris Cantor  
Health Center).  Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cary  Reid,  PI [INVESTIGATOR_316604], has established a successful track  
record  recruiting  chronic  pain  patients for Roybal -supported  research studies at Weill Cornell 
Medicine/NewYork-Presby[CONTACT_194840]. 
 
A total of [ADDRESS_389562] been identified  
by [CONTACT_316609]. Based  on prior  recruitment  
at WCM/NYP we anti cipate recruiting double the number of females than males, and will target  
enrollment to an equal number of non -Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non -Hispanic other (e.g., White,  
Asian) equally between males and females. Participants will open-endedly self-repo rt their race and  
ethnicity;  the research team  will ensure  that the randomization  process  is stratified  by [CONTACT_121854], non- 
Hispanic Black,  and non -Hispanic  other (e.g.,  White, Asian).  
 
Norma l
 patient participants will be recruited via physician -referred agree to contact [CONTACT_3791] (paper or  
REDCap  survey), flyers, and/or  in-person  recruitment.  Physicians  will utilize  an Agree  to Contact  [CONTACT_316610] (phone, email, and/or mailing  
address)  and sign  agreeing to be contact[CONTACT_316611].  
 
Flyers will be distributed  throughout  WCM/NYP  locations  (including  the Center on Aging),  and 
distributed at senior centers,  community  centers,  and community  events. Additionally, co- 
investigators may  approach  potential  participants  in WCM/NYP  offices (e.g.  the Center on Aging),  and 
ask if they would be interested in the study, when it is safe to do so under COVID -19 considerations.  
Trained co -investigators may either screen the partic ipants at recruitment sites and/or ask for their  
contact [CONTACT_316612] a time convenient for the  
potential  participant.  
 
Research staff will ask physicians at WCM/NYP, to review their patient lists and iden tify potential  
participants  based  on eligibility criteria  both  directly (e.g.  email) and at department  meetings. 
Research  staff  may  also request  EPIC  provider  reports  based  on eligibility requirements to reach  out 
Protocol  #20-06022291  
Version  Date:  November 1 , 2022  
Page  # 7  
  
to WCM/NYP physicians for permission to contact [CONTACT_316613]. Research staff will 
set EPIC search criteria to draw names from all networked EPIC databases accessible to Weill Cornell 
Medicine staff . Identified potential  participants  will be contact[CONTACT_316614],  email,  or 
Weill/EPIC Connect. Recruitment letters may also be sent to potential participants via EPIC pool of 
WCM/NYP Consent to be Contact[CONTACT_316615] (CCR) patients and chart review to determine 
potential eligibility. Potential subjects will be  sent a letter  informing them  of the study  and that they  
will be contact[CONTACT_257216] a co-investigator who  will assess interest in participating in the study. The letter 
will also provide a contact [CONTACT_316616]/disinterest for participation in the  study.  
 
Additional  efforts  will rely on making  study  information available  on online platforms. Online  
platforms  may  include, but are not limited to: FMS  interest pages  on Facebook,  participant  registries, 
online  bulletin boards,  mobile apps  and websites,  etc. Methods  include,  but are not limited to: posting  
flyers, posting messages describing the project and inviting interested participants to contact [CONTACT_316617] (see “Social Media Posting” document), including study information in e- newsletters, etc.  
Permission from group administrators will be received prior to posting on any social media group  
platform. In addition,  online research  match  databases including  but not limited to 
ResearchMatch.org  and the Institute for Translational  Health Sciences will be added  as a recruitment  
method.  
 
Eligible  participants  will be compensated  up to $142 for completing the study.  Participants  will receive 
$25 for each  of the three study  assessments (baseline, post -intervention, and 1-month follow up), up 
to $42 ($2 per survey)  for the daily 5-10- minute surveys  following the study  assessments,  and $[ADDRESS_389563], follow up emails, calls,  
or texts (depending on partici pant preference) to participants will be utilized to remind patients of  
upcoming study  activity  (online  assessments,  etc.). Text  message  reminders  will be administered using  
the Twilio service, embedded via the CTSC in REDCap. Second, throughout the study period, accrual  
and retention  rates  will be monitored  at weekly study  meetings  through reporting reasons for missed  
approaches, study refusal, and loss to follow up. This will allow the PI [INVESTIGATOR_316605]/or  retention and the potential  reasons for it so that proper  action  
can be taken  to resolve the issue. Finally, all attempts  have  been made to keep assessments brief and 
flexible in order  to reduce  burden on the patients.  
 
5. Registration Procedures  
 
5.[ADDRESS_389564]  Registration (WCM only)  
Subjects will be registered within the WRG -CT as per the standard operating procedure for  
Subject  Registration.

Not applicable. 
Protocol  #20-06022291  
Version  Date:  November [ADDRESS_389566]  be obtained  before  the study  center  can be initiated or the IP is released to the Investigator.  
Any necessary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the  
study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The written  
approval  of the IEC/IRB together  with  the approved ICF  must be filed in the study  files. 
 
The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new informatio n that may adversely  
affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. The Investigator will submit written  
summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as required. On completion of the study, the 
IEC/IRB  will be notified that the study has  ended.  
 
All agreed protocol  amendments  will be clearly recorded on a protocol  amendment  form  and will 
be signed  and dated  by [CONTACT_316618].  All protocol  amendments  will 
be submitted to the relevant institutional  IEC/IRB  for approval  before  implementation,  as 
required by [CONTACT_427]. The only exception will be when the amendment is necessary to  
eliminate an immediate hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the necessary action will be  
taken  first, with  the releva nt protocol  amendment following shortly  thereafter. 
 
Once protocol amendments or consent form modifications are implemented at the lead site,  
Weill Cornell Medicine, updated  documents  will be provided to participating  sites.  Weill Cornell 
Medicine  must  approve  all consent  form  changes prior  to local  IRB submission.  
 
Relevant study documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the  
participating countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and approval  
before  the beginning of the study. On completion of the study,  the regulatory  authorities will be 
notified that the study has  ended.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_389567]’s  legally 
authorized representative prior to participating in the research study. Subjects who agree to  
participate  will receive an oral  consent  document  prior  to speaking to a co-inve stigator.

Protocol  #20-06022291  
Version  Date:  November [ADDRESS_389568] prior to their baseline  
interview, by [CONTACT_316619]. For oral consent,  a member  of the study  team  will review the ICF and HIPAA  
Authorization  document  in-full  (see Oral Consent  Script  attachment) by [CONTACT_316620], allowing for questions and reminding the potential subject that participation is  
voluntary. The subject and researcher will each recite their statements. Upon completion, oral 
confirmation  of consent  to participate  will be documented  by [CONTACT_316621].  
 
Once  virtual  consent  processes are established with  the JCTO,  we will submit an amendment  with 
the IRB to conform  to these  new  policies. We feel that with  our older  adult  population,  at a higher  
risk to COVID -19, that this is best practices in human subjects for participants not to leave their  
home in order  to participate  in this  study.  
 
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised written ICF and any written information provided to the  
subject must  approved  by [CONTACT_316622]. The ICF will adhere  to IRB/IEC  requirements,  applicable  
laws and regulations. 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_389569] (FDAMA) and the Food  
and Drug  Administration Amendments  Act (FDAAA),  the Sponsor -Investigator  of the trial is solely 
responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for  
submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Information posted will allow subjects to identify  
potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by [CONTACT_3379] a  
central  contact [CONTACT_316623].  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_389570] medical  records  and other  source  documentation will be kept  for the 
maximum  time  permitted  by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307],  institution,  or medical  practice.  
 
8. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Aim 1. Feasibility and acceptability will be examined by [CONTACT_296659]  
(i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, range) for enrollment rates, number of sessions completed,  
number  of weeks required to complete  the intervention,  and Likert-scale  items assessing  satisfaction  with  
the intervention and perceived helpfulness. Aim 2. Aim [ADDRESS_389571] - 
versus-pre- difference will be sought to estimate the change in patients’  outcomes (e.g., pain self - 
management).  This is a small  feasibility trial to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention 
among racially and ethnically diverse older adults with fibromyalgia. The trial is not powered to estimate  
statistically  reliable differences in outcomes.  Missing data.  All missing data  will be assessed  for 
missingness  (e.g.,  random  or non-random)  and appropriate  imputation  methods will  be used.

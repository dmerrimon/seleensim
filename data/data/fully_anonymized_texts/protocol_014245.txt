Background, Rationale and Context  
Pain can have a significant impact on psychiatric patients, as it can exacerbate symptoms and 
interfere with treatment. Pain can cause or worsen anxiety and depression,  is associated with 
increased disability and poorer quality of life in people with severe and persistent mental 
illness . (Birgenheir et. al., 2013, Onwumere et al. , 2022, Stubbs et al. , 2015).  Additionally, both 
severe and persistent mental illness and pain are associated with increased suicide risk ( Fu XL et 
al., 2021, Racine, 2015) . 
 
Evidence suggests that individuals with mental illness may be one population with particularly 
high rates of chronic non cancer pain ( CNCP) and  may also be more likely to receive 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_472152] ( 6). Individuals with serious mental illness, who are most at 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_472153] -related problems, continue to be prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_472154] ( Owen -Smith et al., 2020).   
 
As of January 1, 2018, The Joint Commission requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472155] -pharmacologic 
modalities available for pain management in an effort to decrease the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Acupuncture and acupressure have been used for centuries in the management of a variety of 
disorders including pain.  A recent meta -analysis (Zhong et al., 2019) of 26 RCTs (all included 
studies were in China) favored the use of acupressure for pain management over usual care 
based on total effective rate (RR =1.25, [CI= 1.13, 1.37] , p <.0001) and total analgesia use 
(RR=0.41, [CI= 0.24, 0.68] p = .0006).  There were no serious adverse events reported in the 26 
trials (N=1063 in treatment groups) and no withdrawals from the studies were reported due to 
adverse events.  More recently, in an effort to increase access to non -pharmacological 
modalities for pain management, the VA has developed a battlefield auricular acupressure 
(BAApress) protocol .   Unlike acupuncture, acupressure can be easily applied with training and 
is within the sco pe of practice for nurses, according to the North Carolina Board of Nursing 
(NCBON, 2013).  Although acupressure has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese 
medicine, there are few studies assessing the use of nurse -initiated  acupressure as  an adjuvant 
for co -occurring pain. Thus, we propose assessing the effectiveness of BAApress for chronic and 
acute pain management for psychiatric patients in a psychiatric emergency room setting.  In 
addition, by [CONTACT_472160] y patients that may benefit 
most from BAA press acupressure.

 This feasibility study is being performed in collaboration with the BAApress training and 
Intervention Fidelity study IRB00084011 . This study is similar to Fidelity study IRB 00068022, 
Auricular Acupressure for Pain Management as a Non -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_472156] (PI [INVESTIGATOR_472157]).  The purpose of this study is  to test the feasibility of 
Emergency Department nurse -initiated  battlefield auricular acupressure as an adjunct to  
medication for pain management for psychiatric Emergency Department Observation patients.   
The Battlefield Auricula Acupressure interventionists  (nurse) will  complete Auricular training 
modules and complete competency assessments and intervention assessments throughout the 
study. Study interventionist will include the possibility that a study participant may be part of a 
competency assessment and that their se ssion may be recorded and securely uploaded to a 
server per IRB and institutional policies.  
 
 
Objectives  
1. To determine  psychiatric patients’  accept ance  of BAApress as  an adjunct treatment 
to address co -occurring pain.    
2. To determine if the addition of BAApress protocol will lower pain scores and   
decrease pain medication usage . 
3. To determine ability of ED nurses to incorporate  BAApress into  their  workflow .

• Sample Size  
A total of between 10 -20 patients will be recruited from Atrium Health BH Charlotte 
ED Observation unit   
 
 
Interventions and Interactions  
 Terms:   AA = Auricular acupressure  
Acupressure pad= hypoallergenic adhesive pad containing a 2 mm Vaccaria 
seeds (Earseeds®)  
   Acupoint = specific area of body where acupressure is applied.  
 BAApress= Battlefield Auricular Acupressure        
 
• Participants will be informed of the study once they are identified by [CONTACT_472161] , which includes patient’s  psychiatric provider  and medical 
consultation provider as  an appropriate candidate.  
• Informed consent will be obtained by  [CONTACT_472162] , the 
BAApress interventionist will confirm consent for participation.    
• A study team member will perform  visual analogue Scale and Brief  Pain Inventory 
with  the participant to establish baseline pain score  and impact pain has on general 
activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationship with other people, sleep 
and enjoyment.  
• The participant will be asked to also complete baseline questionnaires prior to the 
initiating placement of the AA including  data collection form and General  Anxiety 
Disorder Scale (GAD -7)- A self -administered 7 item scale that draws from DSM -V 
criteria for general anxiety disorder ( GAD) to identify GAD and measure symptom 
severity. It is routinely used to measure changes and track treatment progress . 
• BAApress interventionists will record the time  from the moment they meet with 
the patient in an available room for the purposes of placing acupressure pads and 
activating each pad until they exit the room .  BAApress interventionists will make 
notation if recorded time includes activity unrelated to placement of acupressure 
pads.  After placement of acupressure pads, BAApress interventionist will enter 
procedure note in  a shared specific file for interventionist and  complete the 
REDCap nurse questionnaire.  
 
Protocol Date: [ADDRESS_605266].   
 
o If the participant consented to the recording portion of the study, they will be 
reminded of the process and the BAApress acupressure nurse will confirm that 
the participant still agrees to participate in  the recording portion of the study . 
 
o Acupressure pads will be placed prior to any pain medication . 
 
o A total of 10 adhesive acupressure pads will be placed, 5 acupressure pads per 
ear. Patients will be given a handout showing location of each point where 
acupressure pad will be placed. The pads will be placed bilaterally on the 
following 5 auricular sites: 1) Cyngulate gyrus, 2) Thalamus, 3) Omega 2 4) Point 
Zero, and 5) Shen Men. These sites were selected based on the  Veterans 
Administration Battlefield Auricular Acupressure Protocol for acute and chronic 
pain. This is the protocol the Veterans Administrati on uses for acupressure 
therapy for acute and chronic pain management and is taught to both nurses and 
physicians.   
 
o Each ear will be cleansed with alcohol, beginning at the base of the ear (lobule) 
to the apex.  The acupoints will be visually located and marked with a sterile 
surgical marker.   
 
o The pads will be placed by [CONTACT_472163]. The pads will be placed on the on the identified site by 
[CONTACT_472164], with the seed portion of the pad aligning 
with the ide ntified acupoint.  
 
o To secure the pad, gentle but firm pressure will be applied to the pad, making 
sure that pressure is applied to the entire pad.  
 
o After placement, the interventionist will apply moderate pressure to each 
acupressure pad for 30 seconds (total time 2.5 minutes per ear). Both right and 
left ear site will be stimulated at the same time with pressure in the following 
order: 1) Cyngulate g yrus, 2) Thalamus, 3) Omega 2, 4) Point Zero, and 5) Shen 
Men .   
 
o Participants will tell the BAApress interventionist nurse when they feel a tingling 
sensation in the ear or feel moderate tenderness or pressure as confirmation 
Protocol Date: [ADDRESS_605267] the missing pad/pads.  
 
o After completion of day 3 study activities, the study team will remove the 
acupressure pads by [CONTACT_472165] . 
 
o If participants are discharged prior to 3 days, they will be contact[CONTACT_472166]/or via text messaging depending on 
participant preference  to remind them to complete the questionnaire and to 
activate their pads [ADDRESS_605268] and take pi[INVESTIGATOR_472158]. These recordings will be used to ascertain fidelity to the 
intervention protocol as it relates to a) proper placement of acupressure seeds 
and b) provision of instructi ons to the participant.  
 
o Each study participant will be asked to sign a separate consent giving 
permission for the intervention to be recorded and  used for education and 
research purposes. The recordings will be done to limit  exposure of the study 
participant’s face.

 o The study team will perform Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) and Brief Pain 
Inventory with  participants one to two times a day for [ADDRESS_605269] the participant   complete GAD -7 every morning for 3 
days . 
 
o The study team will complete B AApress Questionnaire daily with  participant 
every morning for 3 days . 
 
 
End of Study Assessment  
Verify completion of day 5 study questionnaires:  VAS, Brief Pain Inventory, GAD -7, 
BAApress  Questionnaire  and Pain Management Satisfaction  
 
Primary Outcomes  
Patient reported pain  and general activity scores ( Visual Analogue Scale ) and (Brief Pain 
Inventory)  
 
Secondary Outcomes to be measured : 
• Pain medication usage. Trajectory of am and pm pain scores  
• General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7). Patients are asked to rate the frequency of 
anxiety symptoms daily on a Likert scale (0 -3). In general, patients with GAD or 
other common anxiety disorders exhibit GAD -7 scores of 10 or greater . 
• Pain Management Satisfaction  to determine patient satisfaction  
• Acupressure Acceptability questions - We will ask acceptability questions. "How 
satisfied were you with how your pain has been treated?" using the Likert scale to 
measure "Very satisfied =5, Satisfied=4, Somewhat satisfied = 3, Somewhat 
dissatisfied= 2, Di ssatisfied 1, Very Dissatisfied 0. ”  Would you consider using 
auricular acupressure in the future for pain or if recommended by [CONTACT_472167]? a. No, would not use again (Score of 0) b. Maybe (Score of 1), c. Yes, I 
would consider using in the future (Score of 2) 3. Is there anyth ing else you would 
like to tell us that may be helpful for us to know regarding ear acupressure? (Each 
answer will be collected and assessed for future studies).  
• BAA Press placement survey (interventionists only) : The Interventionist (Acupressure 
nurse) will be asked to capture time related to completion of study tasks and other 
qualitative questions to assess overall feasibility.  
• Additional Data collection: contact [CONTACT_3031], relevant demographic data that will 
be recorded are : DOB, age, gender , ethnicity /race .  Relevant medical history will be 
duration of pain medications including narcotic use (in years) and comorbid chronic 
or acute pain  diagnoses.

 Analytical Plan  
Sample Size:  This is a feasibility study with no control group. Target enrollment is [ADDRESS_605270] (HIPAA) . Confidentiality of medical information will be maintained 
throughout the study. All p aper case report forms (CRFs) and informed consent forms (ICFs) will 
be stored in a locked drawer.  Study p articipants will be assigned a unique identifier  that will be 
used on CRFs . Dat a collected for this COVID -19 ALS Registry will also be stored and analyzed 
electronically in Atrium Health’s REDCap  Database . REDCap is a secure web platform for 
building and managing online database projects  and surveys and is used extensively by 
[CONTACT_472168]. This REDCap study will further restrict  access to study  staff.  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
To assist with recruitment. Pa tients when admitted to  Atrium Behavioral  Health Emergency 
Room may  be identified by  [CONTACT_472169] .  
 
Study personnel will review eligibility and approach patient regarding participation.  Only 
eligible patients willing to complete all survey’s pre and post procedures and provide written 
consent will participate.  The study team will ensure that the participant understands the 
voluntary nature of participating in the research study and that study participation study will 
not affect the care that they will receive.  
The study personnel will maintain a record of eligible study participants.  This list will include 
name, MRN, psychiatric and pain diagnosis, and will be kept in a secure file on a secure 
computer  and only accessible to study staff . The file of eligible participants will be destroyed at 
the end of recruitment.  
 
Compensation  
Participants completing the study will receive $25.[ADDRESS_605271].  The study personnel will obtain 
informed consent at the time  participant is admitted to Observation unit and it is determined 
patient meets criteria.  No study procedures will begin until the IRB approved method of 
obtaining consent is completed.  
Protocol Date: [ADDRESS_605272] been reported in the literature related to auricular 
acupressure, participants will be asked to report any events to study personnel.  Participants 
and the acupressure nurses will be instructed to monitor and report any concerns to the 
principal investigators.   
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_129116] a ppropriate.
